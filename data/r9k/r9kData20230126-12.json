Figured this out when I went to a bar in my rural area that has club-like events on the long weekend regularly two years ago (so I would have only been 23); it ended up being nothing but the normiest of zoomers (nobody that I could even relate to despite growing up here) and got accused by some fat bitch for trying to put something in her drink (almost got in a fight because of it too). Shame because I always wanted to go to a rave from liking that type of music but was too much of a social pussy to make friends for a road trip and now I&#039;ll definitely feel like &quot;the old guy&quot; as you put it if I were to go to one now.<br>Here&#039;s hoping you went to college or something before you turned your brain into mush so you can get some bullshit tech job or a trade

It&#039;s the ultimate taboo. If we look at it from a normie perspective, it&#039;s the one thing that CANNOT happen to a mother and son relationship. Not only physically speaking, but mentally too. It&#039;s not just that a normie would think the desire to impregnate your mom is disgusting, they probably assume that it&#039;s impossible to exist at all, totally unthinkable.<br><br>Out of all the things people want from momcest, impregnating your own mom is probably the rarest that could realistically happen. I think even in these threads I&#039;ve seen some saying that inbreeding is too far for them, and this is literally the thread for motherfuckers. With anal it&#039;s more like they&#039;re either into it or not, but with pregnancy it&#039;s like it&#039;s the one thing that mustn&#039;t happen.<br><br>And now imagine the scenario itself. She is the woman that gave birth to you. When she held you in her arms as a newborn, she probably thought of the future that is ahead of you. At some point she probably thought about how your future wife is gonna look like and she is eager to eventually see your kids, her grandkids and play with them.<br>But instead what happened is that somehow you ended up wanting her instead, and somehow she let it happen. And even then, there is still a possible out, you can stop your relationship and try to go back to normal. But that possibility gets obliterated when you actually impregnate her. Even the act itself changes things. Imagine making love to your mom, she&#039;s fertile and not on the pill and you both know this, and either you&#039;re just too into it or maybe both of you even want it. Either way you shoot everything you have deep inside her and then you look into her eyes and give her a passionate kiss. You both know that this is not just sex, but the desire to mate and procreate, despite being mother and son. And all of this is just the start. You and your mom will be a couple and raise a child. Every day that you continue only makes this relationship more taboo.", "time": 1674523494, "resto": 71932623}, {"no": 71942664, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)20:26:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Incest is putrid, imagine if your friend told you he touched his mom.

I have nothing against them, but when is see the Siscest - Relatives with benefits tagline, I am immediately disappointed. Incest is extremely taboo, incest with your mom feels even more taboo, but nothing is more taboo than romantic incest with your own mom. The entire scenario is so bizarre and alien to everything we know and see growing up, in books, on TV and so on. Even a mainstream show like Game of Thrones doesn&#039;t have any real momcest as far as I know.<br><br>Yet this is exactly what makes it so fascinating. Your mother is not an equal. She&#039;s not a woman you meet and have a good time with, exchanges numbers and just date. Everything about your relationship seems to be at odds with even considering the idea of a romantic relationship, let alone trying to pursue it. Be it nature or socializing, fact is that wanting to take your mom as a woman or wife for example is extremely abnormal.<br><br>But for me at least, this why I love it. What happens if you succeed? How does it feel? How would she feel? Our desire to breed is impossibly strong, but if you want to do it with her, you would literally impregnate her with her own would-be grandchildren. Everything about this relationship would be upside down. Would you become her equal? Would you give each give each other valentine&#039;s presents and then kiss. Would you occasionally kiss even without the intention of it leading to sex, like a normal couple?<br><br>Most posts here seem overly fetish oriented, but I&#039;m always curious about how such a relationship would actually function. Like imagine having a child with your mom and the child calls you dad and her mom. From his perspective this is completely normal and sweet, but looking behind the curtain, it is kind of fucked up. No relationship seems to be able to capture the same kind of love, passion, weirdness, degeneracy and chaos like a mother and son relationship that turns romantic.

I went through various different &quot;interpretations&quot; of Shadow in my head, or assumptions about his personality that were far off. <br>I originally discovered Shadow sometime around on 4kids TV at ~6 years old, without playing any video games that featured him, so a notoriously shit dub was all I knew. I don&#039;t remember thinking anything at first, but I don&#039;t remember enough. <br>It grew into a steady dislike as I saw a few of his appearances in that dub. See, without any knowledge of him he initially comes across as some complete nigh-villainous asshole who&#039;s stronger than everyone else in the cast. I also was a HUGE diehard Knuckles x Rouge shipper, and came to view him as competition since Shadow and Rouge are allies and thus a decently popular ship among fans. <br>This changed when I started taking interest in what the games did and watched the cutscenes. And I can still vaguely remember the feeling of &quot;oh, shoot&quot; when the guy I had hated for a surface level assumption had actually been a good person who had killed himself for his own mistake. <br>What followed was him very quickly becoming my favorite character as I tried to learn more about him with the new knowledge that he wasn&#039;t a bad person and his past had been terrible. <br><br>...Leading me straight into a second misconception lol. Fan interpretations, noncanon media, soon enough I had this vision in my head that he was some angel good boy who dindu nuffin and any morally dark actions he took weren&#039;t his fault. I could explain more but this is already long. Basically though, that 2nd misconception that he was always a good boy was slapped out of me when I was shown proof he tries to kill people.<br>With every step I take towards knowing the truth of his heart, my love for him grows brighter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL DR </span><br>Shadow is an awful jerk --&gt; Shadow is a perfect angel --&gt; Shadow is an angelic jerk", "filename": "ISDX00 - 1256651607531327489 - 2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2152, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674643974196693, "time": 1674643974, "md5": "Z/sTqnrmWpgfiJeMO89WlA==", "fsize": 130756, "resto": 71953833}, {"no": 71960110, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)07:17:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/r9k/thread/71891247#p71931303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71931303</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If waifu had to pursue a creative hobby (i.e drawing, writing, sculpting, etc) which would suit her best? </span><br>drawing, probably. he&#039;s skilled with his hands, and it&#039;s a good way to express his feelings without words, something that he has trouble with <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s something she needs help with?</span><br>how to be less wrathful/hot-tempered, impulsive, overconfident, single-minded, rude, insensitive, self-centered, and unsociable, and how to communicate with others through words instead of fists. thankfully, he improves in all of these aspects throughout his anime. <s>my answer has probably made him seem like a bad person, but i swear, he&#039;s a good boy at heart</s><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is waifu street smart?

Every story about god(s) is mostly some creative people spinning tales on what they thought were good and bad things to do in certain situations, and then those stories get shaped by the people that hear them next.
