Not even just incels necessarily, but introverted weirdos in general just have a bad reputation by every society on earth. I&#039;d go as far as to say that humans being social creatures is the greatest tragedy on earth, and it&#039;s why I&#039;m so deeply repulsed by humans.<br><br>I fucking hate it so much. When you&#039;re a &quot;loner&quot; type, everyone hates you. Every republican thinks that you&#039;re some sort of crack addict that burglarizes houses and sells fentanyl-laced pills. Every democrat thinks you&#039;re an incel nazi terrorist school shooter that&#039;s building a bomb in his basement. Everyone in between thinks you&#039;re a sore loser that&#039;ll get nowhere in life. Ironically enough, the reason why introverts like us exist is because anyone who&#039;s slightly introverted is completely hated by society, which forces them to be more introverted, and complete the cycle. And incels are just a byproduct of general hatred of introverts coupled with a more sexually open and active society.<br><br>I swear. When I was a kid, I would mention a slightly dark topic at school once and some random faggot would accuse me of being a school shooter, to which I&#039;d be searched by the police and have whatever drugs were keeping me sane at the time confiscated from me. I&#039;d mention how shitty the situation is to someone, and get hit with the bomb squad rifling through my fucking house. I&#039;m fucking tired of zogbots, pigs and faggots harassing me solely because everyone hates me. Literally the only reason I&#039;m not in jail for being hated by the system is because I get paid by my job and pay my rent completely under the table to keep a low profile. I don&#039;t fucking know why everyone hates me. I&#039;ve tried looking more like the general population. Speaking more like them. Acting more like them. But nothing fucking works.

Maybe the VN covers this to some degree but I&#039;ve yet to play it still for a variety of reasons so I can&#039;t speak about it, the magical girl spin off, on the other hand, had potential for unholy levels of zased but ultimately botches it by having far too little Marika and being degenerate central, its only saving grace is having one of the best Marika outfits in the alternate school uniform with glasses.<br>On the topic of things I&#039;ve not looked at is the mobile game since I know neither chink nor if there is any way to still play it after it got kill. The outfits are garbo as well.<br>All in all unfortunate does not being to describe the way the way this series went, it&#039;s not hard to give SOME trivia.

There&#039;s just a scale you have to follow when gifting to one. If you&#039;re an outer orbit friend and you give them an inner orbit close-friend kind of gift, could warm their heart all the same but make them feel a little uncomfortable. It can feel like anything from awkward to plain painful to feel things like &quot;we&#039;re not this close&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m not good enough to reciprocate this gesture&quot;. Or &quot;we *are* close, but I didn&#039;t earn this and I&#039;m feeling guilty now&quot;. An insecurity that sleeps between inferiority complex and imposter syndrome. A gift can awaken that inside him.<br>Be aware of that, and you can&#039;t go wrong.<br><br>And of course, meaningless gifts are meaningless.

A neovagina done with a modern method by a competent doctor is often indistinguishable from the average vagina. It&#039;s erogenous, made of the same kinds of tissues, often able to self lubricate.
