If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

So at least for me it&#039;s an ease of mind too so yeah the money is well spent in my opinion.
