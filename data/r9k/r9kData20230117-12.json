People back then knew the fact that incest or inbreeding is a way to create perfect specimens. Inbreeding increases the chance of the genes of the parents reappearing massively, obviously. If the parents are gods or royalty, in the mind of the people: &quot;perfect humans&quot;, they want to have the best chance of having &quot;perfect&quot; offspring with those same genes. Inbreeding is a way to guarantee that.<br>Inbreeding also obviously makes the chance of the bad genes reappearing, like hereditary disorders, but in theory two people with flawless genes would only have flawless offspring. Incest doesn&#039;t actually lead to random mutations like &quot;common knowledge&quot; seems to think. It leads to less mutation and change. <br>It makes perfect sense that the most powerful god or the most powerful ruler would only want to breed with someone carrying their genes.<br><br>Ancient royalty inbreeding makes perfect sense to me. Back then they were basically gods compared to regular people, healthy, beautiful, educated, and most likely like a foot taller and stronger than normal people due to having actually good nutrition growing up and a more stress free lifestyle. No wonder they thought they should keep their &quot;bloodline pure&quot;. People didn&#039;t know about genetics, but they&#039;ve always known about certain attributes getting passed down from parents to kids.<br><br>Looking at it that way, it also makes perfect sense why incest was seen as bad for the common people. They had less than perfect &quot;bloodlines&quot; so them inbreeding was bad.

Jung writes of extraverted feelers as those where feeling &quot;loses its personal character -- it becomes feeling per se; it almost seems as though the personality were wholly dissolved in the feeling of the moment. Now, since actual life situations constantly and successively alternate, in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting, the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings.&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung<wbr>ian_cognitive_functions#Extraverted<wbr>_feeling)</span><br><br>The gist of it is to look for social harmony.

By the nature of an object that is intangible and unobservable, it is very likely that we wouldn&#039;t even suspect its existence. For example, gravity, there could be some intangible object that causes the force we know as gravity. We cannot observe the object itself, but we can represent its force &quot;gravity&quot; with math. As a result of that, we cannot define any of the attributes of the object that creates the force known as gravity, if it does in fact exist. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If nobody knows that an object exists, and if it&#039;s a complete unknown unknown rather than a known unknown, is it an object?</span><br>Yes. But, due to the nature of the object being intangible, it can only be represented in an abstract way, for example, through math, or with some metaphor. So if somehow or another, someone was able to suspect the object existed, there would be no way for them to quantify the object in an objective manner. It would only be able to be represented as a concept or an idea. This is the premise of how theoretical physics works.

Naturally, most of them were abroad (not just Goddamn SE Asia and Africa, but all around the world). I try to identify them and block them, so they disappear from the like count. Seriously, fuck the passport tab and those cunt location changers. It&#039;s depressing to think after 15 failed years on OkC that I really could have been a pussy magnet, had I been rich enough to travel (TFW never left my country and don&#039;t care about traveling).<br>One can also keep opening the discover tab over and over to shuffle the deck. If the same ones come up (in a city), there&#039;s a fair chance they sent a like. One good thing about OkC is that pass swipes can be reset, so if the same people keep showing up, one can safely pass knowing that they can go back. Sometimes the site will mention a missed match. I&#039;ve also lost matches by their leaving the site. Sometimes they come back.<br>Using the app to reset swipes and preferences can be faster than using the desktop site, though shuffling the stack isn&#039;t possible on there. Though it is easier on the app to see the blurred likes that one may have received.<br>It seems a lot of matches say nothing, then either block or unmatch - Then they may match again. I finally started to just straight out ask for a fling and they just block (lol). I suppose it&#039;s a good way to clear out the negresses, or get some easy pussy (if there is such a thing for non-Chads these days). Though I am so used to being a loser hermit, I&#039;d be screwed if I somehow got lucky. Going by the well known Chad-fishing experiments, it does seem best to message immediately after matching and push for a fuck or a meet. Most, if not all, will be filtered there already. I also hate how they all love traveling and fancy restaurants. I just want a regular fuck, FFS.<br>On the fuck apps, Tinder and Bumble. It&#039;s also a waste. Matches never speak or let it expire.

The fact that there are subjects who experience pain is objectively true, but the phenomenal quality of pain which we immediately apprehend exists because there are subjects that exist to experience it. It&#039;s in this latter sense that I think subjectivity is undeniable - every time you feel pain it is true that you are undergoing a subjective experience.

Cute little white girl gfe all the way no bare penetration though. Expensive as fuck and kind of boring but her looks and service and youth sort of evened it out. Wont repeat.<br>Heard from older guys that her crew used to post on humaniplex but I guess they got tired of fucking older dudes for cheap and moved on to pd. Goes by alyvia violet.<br>Posts ad on tryst as well.<br>Also be wary of pd reviews and golden pussy syndrome girls asking for high price and offer shit services. Most reviews are retards just trying to get verified to see more girls and they post bullshit reviews.<br><br>Havent mongered in a while, not since then. She asked me<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why not tinder</span><br>and havent stopped thinking about that question since lol. Like what the fuck am I doing paying for puss when I can probably get it for free.
