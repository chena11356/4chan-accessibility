Even if I wanted to I don&#039;t think I could bring myself to do it. If others post characters defined as their &quot;type&quot; or some fictionalised character to construct elaborate fantasies, that&#039;s great, but it&#039;s not what I&#039;m after.<br><br>Rather, the posts are more a reflection on &quot;how I&#039;d be&quot;. The physical appearance, at least, (not that picrews are any good at representing that) are more or less directly based on myself. When, in the past, the threads tended to feature posters describing the character they made, I tended to write out a few attributes inherited from myself. These aspects, of course, were cherry-picked for what might have been interesting or funny; nevertheless, they are derived from how I perceive myself and how others perceive me. Never mind if the clothing in which the character&#039;s depicted is an unlikely taste: it more so reflects how I myself dress (or would dress, if I had more money).<br><br>There are some variations, of course. In reality I have uncorrected vision, but myopia runs in the family, so the picrews always reflect that. This fictionalised self-inversion, being fictional, of course makes fewer mistakes, is more amicable, less abrasive, etc. than the real deal. Yet it&#039;s (I won&#039;t deign to use personal pronouns for such a fragment of the imagination) is not fundamentally much altered from the maker. That&#039;s also why I played around with pictures of the same character in differently-gendered incarnations. Fundamentally I want to test and see how I (and others, I guess) respond to gender variations of the same internal concept.

Charity might allow a large population of useless people to survive and reproduce, but that population will eventually perish when our civilization either collapses or changes to be less altruistic.

We spoke for a long time via email, never showed our faces; I had fallen in love with an autistic eastern euro (EE) girl though. She ghosted me because her friend committed suicide, because the friend was desperately calling the EE girl for help and she ignored her to play visual novels. She returned months later and we exchanged pics and both of us found each other really attractive, and started crushing on each other. I guess it continued like that for years, until 2 years ago she said she didn&#039;t like me because she was a lesbian.<br>I knew she was lying though, and had very low self esteem as she would often try to reject me by saying I was too good for her. 2 years ago I came up with an elaborate plan: I&#039;d get semi-rich (to finance everything), get plastic surgery (to fix my own insecurities), and move to EE so that she would go out on a date with me. Then, I knew she would realize that she was good enough for me and we could be together.<br><br>So I did it, all of those things, and 3 months ago I quit my job and moved. Whenever I told anyone why I was moving to Europe, I&#039;d say it was because I was interested in the history, or the public transportation. Those things did interest me, but the true reason was this girl I considered my waifu. I sent her an email before I left and she returned me one back with tons of tips about living in EE.

Oxytocin is not s*x-specific (aside from its plasma levels being higher in women on average, as estrogen promotes synthesis of oxytocin and expression of oxytocin receptors in the brain), but there&#039;s some bit of a difference on what it influences between either of s*xes.<br>Also, I have never seen any twink-like monks. How monks are related? Another part of my rant is bringing up that meditation (not exclusively, of course) stimulates oxytocin production (and iirc there&#039;s enough neurobiological overlap between meditation and prayer to even go as far to assume prayer stimulates oxytocin production, too, but don&#039;t quote me on that, as I couldn&#039;t find anyone else even trying to look into it).", "filename": "aad1c63e4265ba179c0ad2826a93005d8f7cbc07", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2480, "h": 3508, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672430642247431, "time": 1672430642, "md5": "i+3dRcNALvHY7C90sIfQbg==", "fsize": 1987702, "resto": 71611997}, {"no": 71618963, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)15:06:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71618604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71618604</a><br>One of his minions?

You refer to the internal way too much. Hyper self awareness, aka self conscious. I should clarify, hyper self-awareness does not result in awareness of all things within the self. It&#039;s a hyper fixation on a specific aspect of the self, internal tunnel vision is another way to think about it. It often creates visceral emotions like fear, anxiety and disgust, amongst others. The point of these emotions, aka urges, is to cause change typically, they urge you to do something about the external world through fight or flight, can also be a positive emotion though.<br><br>Your specific internal tunnel vision seems to be focused on the specific emotional state, or urge, and thus you miss the thing that sparks the urge. Since you miss the &quot;spark&quot; you have no foundation on which to base the rest of your interaction. It&#039;s like trying to get on a train, except the train left the station 15 minutes ago.<br>I would call your awareness of the external &quot;enough to not die&quot; or &quot;barely enough just enough&quot;. I say &quot;enough to not die&quot; with intent, as well, because your reaction is that of someone facing death. It&#039;s very primal and visceral. Archaic, to use a Jungian word. In those moments you&#039;re acting purely on your inferior emotional based instinct, which is fueled by your &quot;barely just enough&quot; awareness of the external. <br><br>The solution to your problem is to adjust the &quot;tool which you use to observe the internal machinations of your consciousness&quot; and alter that tool so that the lens has a variable variable zoom to alter the resolution at which you view &quot;yourself&quot;. Currently you&#039;re mega, mega zoomed in. You&#039;re looking at this one little aspect at a super high resolution, and that is the cause of your problem. You need to lower the resolution and zoom out to see the whole thing.

Like, we&#039;ll be playing around until she&#039;s soaked and literally demanding that I get on with it. Then, I&#039;m literally putting part of myself into her, seeing and feeling the joy she gets from that, and giving her part of myself at the end of it. It makes me feel wanted and accepted. So, as much as I&#039;d like to reassure you that it would be fine, I personally cannot do that. It isn&#039;t the most important thing, but it is important and I think that it is something that I need to feel that connected to someone. We&#039;ve discussed it before and she has similar feelings of acceptance and validation from that sort of intimacy, especially due to being someone who struggled with body image and self esteem in the past, so I don&#039;t think that men and women are very different when it comes to the importance of sex in a relationship.<br><br><a href=\"#p71644555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71644555</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;once as a learning experience</span><br>For me, the first few times were not great.

I don&#039;t mean in any way to dismiss your views, but I hope that you&#039;ll eventually get to enjoy good sex with someone. For me, the first time I really enjoyed it was when the emotional connection was already established. That relationship ended and then I met my girlfriend back in 2012.

Do you really want to share your life with someone at all or do you want to have sex? These are different things and neither answer is wrong. If you want a girlfriend, make room for someone else in your life and share yourself with others. This will involve doing things that many here will not be comfortable with and may require professional help. If you want to have sex, you&#039;re going to have to learn how to find people who want the same thing. Again, this may require professional help because most of you have untreated issues and atrophied or undeveloped social skills.<br><br>Finally, to prevent the inevitable responses. Yes, men are not treated fairly in society. No, this doesn&#039;t mean that your life is hopeless or that you should not try to be happy. Also, sex and romance are optional parts of life. You ay find with some introspection that they are not actually things that you want or find fulfilling.<br><br>TL; DR<br><br>Seek professional help.

Assuming that the 28 year old virgin is you, try to understand that you are still quite young. I don&#039;t think that I was mature enough for a serious relationship until my early thirties. Virginity isn&#039;t really something that you need to share with a partner. If she asks at some point, answer honestly, but it likely will never come up. People don&#039;t usually know what they want in a partner, and most I know ended up with someone who isn&#039;t anything like what they said they wanted. I&#039;m no exception. Online dating has made it worse for your age group, because now dating seems to resemble shopping.
