If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

It seems the main problem that people are having here is they meet people and there&#039;s a lack of interest from one or both parties. I can give some advice at least in this aspect. People that are having this issue it&#039;s probably that they&#039;re looking for anybody that&#039;s looking for a relationship, and spraying a praying, or meeting others like it&#039;s Tinder dating. I&#039;ve never done that before, but looking in from the outside of this style of I guess you could call it modern dating. You&#039;re just bound to meet people that you have no similarities with. You treat relationships like a numbers game and that&#039;s what you&#039;ll get. It should be no surprise that with most people that you meet there will be a lack of interest. How I found authentic relationship was just by meeting someone that was similar to me and it all happened by accident. We were a lot like each other and had a lot of the same interests. I can&#039;t give any advice on having a successful relationship but I did have one that was authentic. Maybe I don&#039;t have good advice advice to even give on anything though that&#039;s been my experience.

Chuck I can respect, but at the same time is too much like a boy for me. INTJ Megumin is a tsundere and I hate them with every bone in my body, mainly because I am autistic and would take anything hurtful as being a genuine statement. Cook/Gardener ENFJ is much like Sophie, perhaps even worse, I met a tranny like this person once and it was incredibly lonely. <br><br>Rxy is alright, but I think I am going to trash them, student council presidents and responsibility just is pressuring. Turbie is nice... but honestly their mannerisms sound like they would be misery to live with, that type tends to speak more shallow and less deep than I desire. <br><br>6, 8, 9, and 0 are all great choices. I love the clingy nature of ENFJ-senpai, but I don&#039;t read books and thus a bookworm might not be for me. Breeder wants to be a livestreamer, which sounds kinda isolating when I would want someone who would want to engage me in their hobbies. Centaur is sleepy and eats a bunch, which means I would be financially drained and they would be asleep so I couldn&#039;t talk to them. Firmament sounds great... but the permanent online thing means it would be heavily isolating, they wouldn&#039;t be a good gf. <br><br>I vote for ENFJ-senpai. I don&#039;t like books, but perhaps they could get me involved in their hobby, and their clingy obsessive nature is absolutely perfect for me. They hold respect and kindness, plus they are not boisterous in the way say Turbie would be. <br><br>ENFJ-senpai is best girl.", "time": 1669035433, "resto": 71040527}, {"no": 71071173, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)08:35:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71070897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71070897</a><br>ENFJ-Senpai broke up with me :\\", "filename": "die", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 774, "h": 541, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1669037702260444, "time": 1669037702, "md5": "rAeBxG/5EtbqVYlpwqcYJw==", "fsize": 150187, "resto": 71040527}, {"no": 71071190, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)08:36:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71071173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71071173</a><br>Is this anons delusional headcannon", "time": 1669037812, "resto": 71040527}, {"no": 71071360, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)08:57:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71070820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71070820</a><br>There&#039;s enough mirrors at in your mom&#039;s bedroom", "time": 1669039041, "resto": 71040527}], "last_modified": 1669039041}, {"no": 71068588, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)02:35:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Disneyland for anime.", "filename": "pepe-the-frog-thinking", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 498, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669016119037818, "time": 1669016119, "md5": "DQaWm3XllRPDkA6Evk55Bg==", "fsize": 96745, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "disneyland-for-anime", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 13, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 71070303, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)06:44:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It needs a huge fucking area for senshado", "filename": "1669030971720", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 297, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 74, "tim": 1669031096288460, "time": 1669031096, "md5": "/qcjgILwAi+LPH7bZ6P0EQ==", "fsize": 1568370, "resto": 71068588}, {"no": 71070415, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)06:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;your favorite waifus surprise you and praise you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;random parades of live action anime girls playing songs</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tons of good food stalls</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most kawaii place on Earth</span><br>God I wish.", "filename": "HD-wallpaper-htt-anime-azunyan-black-hair-cute-k-on-mio-mugi-music-ritsu-yui", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1133, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669031998805879, "time": 1669031998, "md5": "a+tKcJb0fL7gKZwT5pOC8A==", "fsize": 135712, "resto": 71068588}, {"no": 71070876, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:55:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71068605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71068605</a><br>you think what you do is any better? grow the fuck up", "time": 1669035346, "resto": 71068588}, {"no": 71070889, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:56:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "anime is fucking gay", "time": 1669035416, "resto": 71068588}, {"no": 71070896, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:57:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71068605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71068605</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having fun </span><br>Fucking child <br><a href=\"#p71068588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71068588</a><br>Imagin the smell", "time": 1669035433, "resto": 71068588}], "last_modified": 1669035433}, {"no": 71070863, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:54:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I woke up and my right hand smells", "filename": "1665513914349119", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 976, "h": 836, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 214, "tim": 1669035253630484, "time": 1669035253, "md5": "IBrRS57+zHDChJ39SvgLTw==", "fsize": 100608, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-woke-up-and-my-right-hand-smells", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 71070872, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:55:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Smells like what", "time": 1669035329, "resto": 71070863}, {"no": 71070892, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:57:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71070872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71070872</a><br>Kinda funky and pungent", "time": 1669035421, "resto": 71070863}, {"no": 71070895, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:57:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71070863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71070863</a><br>he who sleeps with an itchy butt, will awaken with a smelly hand.", "time": 1669035432, "resto": 71070863}], "last_modified": 1669035432}, {"no": 71070877, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:55:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hey jovial!", "filename": "Scan-145-e1514206222227", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 492, "h": 800, "tn_w": 153, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669035352428040, "time": 1669035352, "md5": "1tzFsSna7t7ZUhKOfTICOg==", "fsize": 40224, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hey-jovial", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1669035352}, {"no": 71070770, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)07:44:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Whenever I drink coffee my kidney hurts.
