0,23675577,1.0,1.0,10/24/15(Sat)16:57:43,Anonymous,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

Alcohol is responsible in the world for 1.8 million deaths and results in disability in approximately 58.3 million people. Approximately 40 percent of the 58.3 million people disabled through alcohol abuse are disabled due to alcohol-related neuropsychiatric disorders.[78] Alcohol abuse is highly associated with adolescent suicide. Adolescents who abuse alcohol are 17 times more likely to commit suicide than adolescents who don&#039;t drink.[79] Additionally, alcohol abuse increases the risk of individuals either experiencing or perpetrating sexual violence.[58] Alcohol availability and consumption rates and alcohol rates are positively associated with violent crimes, through specifics differ between particular countries and cultures</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Domestic violence typically cooccurs with alcohol abuse. Alcohol use has been reported as a factor by two thirds of domestic abuse victims. Moderate drinkers are more frequently engaged in intimate violence than are light drinkers and abstainers, however generally it is heavy and/or binge drinkers who are involved in the most chronic and serious forms of aggression. The odds, frequency, and severity of physical attacks are all positively correlated with alcohol use. In turn, violence decreases after behavioral marital alcoholism treatment.

If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br><br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything alobg thise lines, thats where you proceed to go! <br>Do not ask yourself useless shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.",welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1),.gif,640,360,250,140,1670660330897115,1670660330,2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==,1566411,0,,ze-keikaku,0,12,7,"[{'no': 71337364, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)05:43:18', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71337204"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71337204</a><br>Sooner or later some of them will want to chabge, and all I have to do be here when that moment for each of them has come.<br><br>Also, many are demoralized becaus they are being spammed in an achoechamber of toxic shit.<br>If that brought them down, then the opposite should work aswell.

Blood is a highly valuable liquid, like how gold is valuable. Blood is valuable because it MAINTAINS life, and can be transfused to save one; one could call it &quot;liquid gold&quot;.<br><br>Secondly we have gold, which represents two things: literal gold, and urine. Liquid gold is valuable because gold itself is a precious metal, being used for jewelry, coinage, and other high-value purposes--Gold&#039;s high ductility, resistance to corrosion, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion-resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in infrared shielding, production of colored glass, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine. Why urine? In 1669 the German alchemist Hennig Brand boiled urine on his furnace until it broke down into phosphorous, which he thought could be used to create gold. Phosphorous led to the creation of matches, which are useful.<br><br>Thirdly we have white, which represents semen. Semen is valuable in the fact that it is stored in sperm banks, and is in high demand. Without it, none of us would be here, and the world as we know it would be far different.<br><br>Blood relates to the presidency in the fact that many presidents have been shot and bled, and many have made decisions which led to bloodshed or prevented bloodshed. Every presidential vehicle comes stocked with liters of the current president&#039;s blood type. Every president has blood, and has bled.<br><br>Urine relates to the presidency because former president Trump was accused of hiring prostitutes to urinate on him, giving him a &quot;golden shower&quot;. Every president produces urine, and has urinated.<br><br>Semen relates to the presidency because former president Bill Clinton was exposed for his inappropriate relationship with his secretary by her semen-stained dress. Every president so far produces semen, and has ejaculated.",DALL·E 2022-12-10 05.27.37 - Liquid gold,.png,1024,1024,250,250,1670672179055870,1670672179,N7wokxFWLZ8C03+alX5jSQ==,1365363,0,,red-gold-and-white-liquid-gold-three-golden,0,1,0,"[{'no': 71337750, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:42:38', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p71337700"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;71337700</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;tfw so many robots use ai programs they have given it severe mental retardation</span>', 'time': 1670672558, 'resto': 71337700}]",1670672558,0.0,0.0,,
