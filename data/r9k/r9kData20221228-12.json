A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat.<br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672217006202106, "time": 1672217006, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "71543505", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 10, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 71582578, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)03:44:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>YOYOYO", "time": 1672217093, "resto": 71582570}, {"no": 71582949, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:35:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71582570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71582570</a><br>I have not been here for a year.

Spent like a week with a lot of our relatives there, a largeish farm type place. For like four days we didn&#039;t have any chances to do much, and seeing her so close but not being able to do anything made me incredibly horny. Her too apparently. Any little time we had we basically teased each other, like I rubbed her tits and she rubbed my crotch.<br>Yesterday I went to get wood and mom came along. When we got to the shed, we realized that we were alone for the first time in a long while. It was cold out, but the shed was sort of warm. She opened her jacket and hugged me. I opened my jacket too. I just felt her tits press into me through our shirts, her huge nipples were rock hard from the cold. Haven&#039;t gotten that horny in a long time. I sucked on her neck a little and pulled up her shirts, and sucked on her tit. After a few moments I put my hand down her pants and felt how wet her panties were. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore so I turned her around and pulled her sweatpants down and hugged and kissed her butt and hips. She made the same little whimpering sounds as our first time. I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her. She moved over to a pile of wood and bent over it leaning on her arms with her pants around her ankles. I just couldn&#039;t stop myself and went to town on her, I didn&#039;t care about the noise. I grabbed her hips hard and let her ass slap. Same as the first time, I felt like I wanted to just go as deep in her as possible. I heard a door open and people talking out, but didn&#039;t care, they were far enough to maybe only hear light clapping sounds. Came in her like a firehose while I squeezed her tits hard.", "filename": "6538635865", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1201, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672136631509275, "time": 1672136631, "md5": "ZOxxvjvrWkgWqLtp8Qkpog==", "fsize": 769339, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569939, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:28:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br>bruh if you are finanon you need to give us a lot of updates", "time": 1672136887, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569995, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her.

I pulled her in one last time and pulled out. I could now feel the cold on my wet cock, I didn&#039;t even notice how cold it was before. As my mom went to pull her pants back up, a HUGE load just slid from her with a splat. It made a puddle on the floor and the back and inside of her sweatpants got covered, some more ran down her thigh. She kind of gave me a worried look and rushed nearer to me. I could see half of the butt of her grey sweatpants was covered in very noticeable goo and it had already turned into a darker grey wet spot. I pulled up a wood basket to cover my boner and she pretended to put down some logs. My aunt and her friend opened the door and laughed that thought they had to be the ones to carry the wood in, but were happy that we were already on it. Mom just sort of kept her ass out of view, us being a little out of breath and sweaty with our jackets open looked probably pretty normal for what we were supposed to be doing. They left after a few words and we actually collected the wood with mom. The back of her pants was ruined. We rubbed some snow on her and said she fell in the snow and had to go change.

Soon after it wasn&#039;t too weird to have a massage in the living room before the sauna. We were undressing and after we got undressed I pretty much just asked her if she wanted a massage before the sauna while we sip on drinks. Being naked and hard with her was natural enough by now that it was easy. Oiling her up on a towel on the couch was pretty much the point where it stopped being normal in any way, as in you couldn&#039;t anymore explain it as just being natural while naked and non-sexual. Something about being naked and touching like that without being or going into the sauna/shower. It sort of helped me get over most of the hesitation to touch her. The first time on the couch I just slapped her ass cheeks and played with her butt like she wasn&#039;t my mom. Slipped my hand between her thighs and up enough that I lightly touched her hair. I don&#039;t remember if it was the same night, but I also massaged her tits from the front while putting lotion on her standing in the sauna. I very obviously played with her nipples and rubbed her shiny tits for a long while. She just giggled and smiled. I don&#039;t think my dick had been that hard before.

She just turned around with her tits flopping and asked me to put the rest on her neck and chest. She used the word for upper chest, not tits btw. I started putting the lotion on her neck and went down on her shoulders and upper chest. At this point I was already on her tits, felt them giving a little, being soft under my fingers. I slid my hands over the outside edge of her tits, like into her armpits. I already felt like I was fondling her tits, so I just went a little lower each stroke until my hands went down the side of tits to her nipple level. So my hands were now undeniably on just her tits. She was having fun clearly so I just kept going like that, a little more obvious every move. I slid my hands under her tits, between them, etc. Then I slid down the middle of her tits until I hit her nipples and rubbed around and on them a little. It was still ok with her so I also sort of grabbed her tits from the sides pushed them into each other. Lifted them up a little from the bottom. Put her nipples between my thumb and finger and squeezed lightly. I had no idea what to do next so I just gave her tits a little tap and said &quot;alright done&quot;. She just giggled and smiled, grabbed her drink and kind of tapped me on the shoulder. Again we went on the rest of the night like normal, like we usually after doing something new.

She wore some weird new pants, beigeish and I could see through them a little. I had not seen her in that type of clothes in years. When she took her boots off, I noticed how small she looked at my place, she is pretty short. It kind of felt like a female friend came over. We made some tea and talked. Our talking was very different from normal, very different topics and she looked at my eyes constantly. She didn&#039;t really seem to listen, more like waiting for something to happen.

I couldn&#039;t focus on my phone, and I noticed mom hadn&#039;t changed the page in a while. She said it was kind of warm in there and took down her cover, sat up, and zipped open her sweater and put in on the floor.

She giggles and I look at her, her eyes are open again and she smiling and happy. Nipples are poking in her shirt. She sees me looking at them. She grabs her shirt on her belly and pulls down a bit and moves a bit higher on the bed, her cleavage pops out a lot. She again sees me looking. She sort goes to sit on her side a little, towards me with her tits getting very close to my face. I put down my phone on my side and just look. Mom whispers something about a pillow and goes over me. She grabs a pillow behind my head, but her arms are short so she now buried my face in her bare cleavage while on me.

She was going to keep teasing me more and more, in more extreme ways, because that was her thing, but maybe if I hadn&#039;t shown her my reaction like that, we might not have moved ahead that fast.

It&#039;s been in the works for a long long while and goes to show what I was slowly creeping towards in the first place before going off on a couple tangents. Anyway, as stated previous, the road to change is a slow one, but it&#039;s possible, but it takes time. Now here is where you take some plays out of your opponents playbooks. Ever since RvE was enacted, the conservative party has been slowly, gradually, methodically chipping away at it, making it harder and harder to get them before they were outright illegal. You have to change small things at a time. For example in a lot of those women&#039;s clinics they passed building codes that said hallways and ceilings had to be XYZ feet wide and tall or the building would be forcibly shut down by the city/state government for violating the new health and safety statutes and effectively put them out of business forever in that fashion. A little change here, a drop of water there, and suddenly you have a tidal wave nobody saw sneaking up on them because they were too busy looking for enemies that didn&#039;t exist in the first place. The real one was in front of them all along and they didn&#039;t see it, they thought they were safe and could operate with impunity. Back to the original message. Fuck i&#039;ve been awake too long and i&#039;m getting rambly. Anyway. It&#039;s slow, small, gradual and methodical changes that have the greatest impacts down the road to the future you want to see.

Comparatively, facebook has almost 3 BILLION people. Now tell me anon, which of those two do you think would be a more effective platform for gathering support for a cause? Further broken down, twitter, rounding up, has about 220 million US based accounts, of which 23% are roughly in your age range(early to mid twenties.) while most boomers, you know, the people who actually go out and fucking VOTE and organize themselves, use facebook. You can shout hate all you want anywhere you want, getting people off their ass to change shit is how you get what you want. As I said over and over but you still won&#039;t listen apparently, you must start with your local city governments to get the ball rolling if you want to place these people into higher offices with more governmental powers and responsiblities to their represented citizens. Twitter is for deepthroating celebrities, if you want to get organized and work to unfuck the world my parents&#039; generation created, then you have to use EVERY PLATFORM available, not just one.

I used to play SW:TFU all the time on my wii when i was 8/9 and its honestly probably my favourite starvwars game story wise. Maybe im just bias cause of nostalgia but i wish respawn would reboot it.

Any weight I put on didn&#039;t go anywhere besides the &quot;good spots&quot;. Now I hated this at first because of bullying, but in high school Tumblr was popular and I got sucked into the body positivity stuff, which led me to bbw porn. I feel like I developed this kink overnight, not so much of viewing the other women sexually but of imagining myself as being 600+ lbs. Coping mechanism, need for acceptance, etc. This started a little before I turned 16 in early sophomore year and I first recorded my weight as 165 here at the start of this hellish journey. <br><br>During the summer after sophomore year I was eating 5000 calories most days and there was a week where I ate 10000+ calories a day. (The original plan was to eat 10000 more each day until I reached 100000 at day 10 but I only managed 30000 on day 3, so I just stuck to 10000.) I would have continued this nonstop but I was so full that I started vomiting up even small meals like a Big Mac and fries after the 9th day. I only managed to keep down water, soda, and ice cream. My stomach wasn&#039;t full on day 10 but just my digestive system was so full that my stomach had nowhere to expand, since my intestines were occupying so much space. I was constipated for 2 days afterward and couldn&#039;t eat anything until a week&#039;s worth of undigested food just fell out of my ass. I&#039;m amazed I didn&#039;t die from something bursting. I was 190 lbs at the start of the summer and ended up around 260 at the end. It was honestly the most fun I ever felt, but like a high from heroin it was ultimately harmful as shit.<br><br>1/?", "time": 1672192820, "resto": 71578545}, {"no": 71578972, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)21:00:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;biological sex</span><br>male<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;height</span><br>5&#039;4&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;current weight</span><br>117lbs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heaviest you&#039;ve ever been after age 15</span><br>160 - 175lbs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinnest you&#039;ve ever been after age 15</span><br>105lbs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe why</span><br>don&#039;t understand this<br>Also list your height at the time if it was different than what it is now.<br>I&#039;ve been 5&#039;4&quot; since 14", "filename": "jon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1477, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672192858257749, "time": 1672192858, "md5": "NmepSste6G207WZODiRixQ==", "fsize": 217744, "resto": 71578545}, {"no": 71578983, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)21:01:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71578967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71578967</a><br>So I went through junior year like this and everyone knew what I was doing, they all knew I was doing it for kink reasons even if I didn&#039;t state it. I wore croptops which barely covered my tits and shorts which went halfway up my ass cheeks. I binge ate in the middle of the lunchroom and people gathered to watch and make fun of me. Maybe some of the kids were turned on. My family is very big so they didn&#039;t think anything of me putting on so much weight, like it was just me starting to resemble everyone else and become an adult, even if I blew past them in a shocking matter of months.<br><br>That next summer is when I realized I was killing myself. My family took a trip to Greece and I had to buy two seats on the plane which were still super tight. (I liked this part at the time because of how huge it made me feel.) But then when we visited some historical sites a couple days into the trip, I realized what I&#039;d done. I had a minor heart attack from walking around more than going from class to class. I ruined the vacation.<br><br>In around a year and a half I had put on a little over 200 lbs and went up to 368lbs. The doctors back in America said that if I kept gaining like this that I would be dead in under a year, and that they had hardly any literature about someone gaining as rapidly as I did. I had basically pushed my body so hard that my organs were still those of a 250lb woman but inside a woman 100 lbs heavier. Like, if I had gone up to this weight over a course of 5+ years they said, I would actually be better off because my organs would have changed alongside my size increase. Even my skin was noted as being stretched extremely super thin around my pelvis region because of the gain there. They said it&#039;s amazing that my skin didn&#039;t just split open. My stretchmarks were basically blood red.<br><br>2/?", "time": 1672192913, "resto": 71578545}, {"no": 71578996, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)21:03:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71578545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71578545</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;biological sex</span><br>Male<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;height</span><br>5&#039;10<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;current weight</span><br>169<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heaviest you&#039;ve ever been after age 15</span><br>180<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinnest you&#039;ve ever been after age 15</span><br>132<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;describe why</span><br>when i was 15 (3 years ago) i was still 5&#039;5&quot;, I had also just started to lift weights, I only managed to get in around 180lbs due to bulking, etc. I was around 17 at that time, most of it was definitely fat so i just burned it off leaving me 169lbs", "time": 1672192990, "resto": 71578545}, {"no": 71578997, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)21:03:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71578983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71578983</a><br>Of course this shocked me (I liked and still love living, thank you) since I believed the really bad problems would start around 500 lbs, after which I would weigh (lol) the risks of continuing. I immediately went down to 1600 calories a day. I was always starving but I ignored the feeling and just went against my instincts. Eventually I found /fit/ and dropped down to 147 by age 21 over a course of around 4 years.<br><br>Since then... I&#039;ve been a bit more reasonable but I did gain weight again, again because of the fetish. I eat a lot still (usually 3000 calories a day) but I do cardio and lift.

I still have daily fantasies about reaching truly horrific sizes but I strictly count calories to stay around the weight I currently am. Just over the line for obesity but with a level of muscle and cardio health that makes up for it. I get compliments on /fit/ when I post my body (a lot are brosnans though) but most tell me to cut.

everyday using something like IXL (if it&#039;s math) or college lectures on YouTube, and study things that you actually want to learn about to start off to motivate you. There&#039;s tons of good apps I&#039;ve found for daily study habits like Brilliant or something. Once you get into the habit you can broaden the range of subjects you learn about and also study longer. Doing this stuff daily is basically brain hygiene, keep yourself stimulated and smart. Read something too while you&#039;re at it and keep your vocabulary strong, learn how to articulate yourself and work on your reading comprehension. What&#039;s better than studying though is learning with someone, which is more engaging. Find a teacher, someone who knows a lot about the topic and can explain it in a way for a noob to understand, you&#039;ll get introductory knowledge and then they can crank up the complexity as time goes on, until you eventually master the subject. or maybe try to learn by doing if it&#039;s a practical skill, basically apprenticeship, it&#039;s how doctors learn their craft.", "time": 1672204311, "resto": 71580553}, {"no": 71580880, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)00:16:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71580553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71580553</a><br>don&#039;t study in your room. go to the library, a cafe, even a different room in your home, somewhere quiet where the only thing to do there is study. if you can&#039;t do that then try to get your hands on some adderall. both helped me.", "time": 1672204568, "resto": 71580553}, {"no": 71580928, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)00:20:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71580880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71580880</a><br><a href=\"#p71580827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71580827</a><br>thanks guys, right now i dont think i have issues with that part of studying, it is more that i feel too emotional to concentrate , like i tried starting and i couldn&#039;t concentrate cause alll i could think is how pointless it is and how it will fail regardless", "filename": "2907891091_9ec2ee3fc7_b", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672204854609190, "time": 1672204854, "md5": "XWEgyIEDrFNOS7n6nwyVdA==", "fsize": 126541, "resto": 71580553}, {"no": 71581035, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)00:29:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71580928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71580928</a><br>in the short term i&#039;d say take a break from studying and find something that will help calm you down until you feel at least a little better. maybe watch a couple episodes of your favorite show or play some vidya, just something to take your mind off the stress. then try to get one small thing done. starting is usually the hardest part in situations like this.<br>in the long term, look into therapy/medication if you haven&#039;t already. your mental health is clearly not good right now and it can really make a difference as long as you go into it with an open mind.", "time": 1672205383, "resto": 71580553}, {"no": 71581065, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)00:33:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Running will calm your mind enough.

It takes away bad thoughts and when things get too bad it&#039;s better than slamming my head into a wall repeatedly while screaming like I used to. Or better than loading the gun and looking down the barrel.

I will miss every single one of you and I very much hope to see you all again in SSG 2023!<br><br><a href=\"#p71558635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71558635</a><br>I went into further detail in the previous thread, but in short, everyone made SSG great for me this year! Like you said, corny, but very true! Everyone made a contribution in making this year what it was no matter how minor. The memories made, the laughs, the frustrations, everything, I&#039;m very thankful for it.<br><a href=\"#p71558689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71558689</a><br>Courage the Cowardly Dog and Ed Edd n Eddy have always been my favorites!

Fusion reactors would almost certainly be too much though. Not only are they not possible atm without being energy negative in terms of profit, but they produce excessive amounts of heat.

Snails may be less viable as larger snails tend to be herbivorous and smaller snails are no good for eating.
