Basically tinder, for tinder do not swipe on every girl or the algorithm will kick your head in, you have a ranking on tinder, things you do influence your ranking, swipe once on every 10 girls and you should be okay, do not swipe all in one session, do it throughout the day.

In terms of a profile what pictures do you have floating around? birds like anything thats not selfies, one mirror pic in a gym or some shit will suffice but the rest need to be you doing shit, if you cant find someone maybe a camera stand for your phone then just stage the fuckin photos. Sounds gay as fuck but you need to fake it because girls nowadays have so many options you cant give them a reason to not swipe, yes its demoralising but welcome to 2023.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>XOXO", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672385291085275, "time": 1672385291, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "helloy-anon-need-some-help-a-shoulder-to-cry-on", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 10, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71612118, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:29:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

It&#039;s worth considering that evolution is a real thing, I assume you and I agree on this matter. Consider what makes us any different from the beasts of the earth. Is there really so much? We all modify our environment to better suit us, be us an ant or a man. We have our wits and intellect, not just other hominids but completely alien creatures to us like a cephalopod. What makes us different? One might say that it&#039;s our seemingly intrinsic knowledge of good and evil.

She doesn&#039;t really care for parties being held because the kids cause all kinds of messes and she know she&#039;s the one that&#039;s going to clean it up. That when Anon walks comes into the picture. See, Anon needs a job and he&#039;s tried everywhere, but no one seems to be hiring in this town. <br>Their first encounter didn&#039;t go so smoothly as a few rowdy kids knocked Anon over causing him to bump into her and knocking her into an overflow trash can. He tried to apologizes but it didn&#039;t stop her from becoming angry, not at him, but at her boss who should went over to and began yelling at for not having anyone to help her out out for such a busy day. Anon just stood there stunned and not knowing what to do before the Manager (and owner) asked him if he needs something. Anon asked about a job, and before the Manager could answer, she spoke up and yelled &quot;Yes!&quot; and gave a very scary stare at the Manager, so he reluctantly agreed to hire him and asked if he could start immediately.<br>With the party being over and the cleaning finally done, she asked Anon if he liked rhythm games. He mentioned playing Guitar Hero one time but that&#039;s about it. She said that&#039;s great, so you won&#039;t be completely lost. She brought him over to a new game they just recently got in called Taiko no Tatsujin. She said it was her favorite one recently but she never has anyone to go against. &quot;Let&#039;s see what you got, Mustard Boy&quot;. Confused, he looked around at himself and saw he had a yellow stain on the bottom of his shirt. Not sure where he got it from and too tired to care, he grabbed a couple of bachi and got ready for the face off.<br>This is how Anon met his future wife.", "filename": "1666902170843", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672363905292731, "time": 1672363905, "md5": "doKQt3AjwUE7mFBCxLN6rg==", "fsize": 361842, "resto": 71606506}, {"no": 71608341, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)20:34:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Enjoys going outside and admiring the scenery, moderately likes vidya and anime, enjoys reading too.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ambivert.

To his surprise, he recognized this song, it was Jeanette&#039;s &quot;Corazon de poeta&quot;. A sudden shock hit her, as she just realize she was being listened to as Anon said the title out loud instead of his head by mistake. She apologized for disturbing him since it was so late to which he retorted that she wasn&#039;t disturbing him. They started discussing the singer and she told him about how it was her grandmother that always played these vinyl records, so a lot of the songs were stuck in her head. <br><br>PT1", "filename": "LaRisoVita", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672393762296276, "time": 1672393762, "md5": "6qUri6oUdDpWfZbQwMP8Mg==", "fsize": 261376, "resto": 71606506}, {"no": 71613232, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)04:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71607000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71607000</a><br><a href=\"#p71610570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71610570</a><br>Cont.<br>As the days turned into weeks, and weeks into months; not once did they ever see each other despite being right next door.

Though as time went on, both of them had a seed in their mind that was beginning to grow &quot;I wonder what they look like&quot;. This thought scared them for some time as they found comfort in how they interacted and didn&#039;t want to mess it up. <br><br>The day finally came, as the urge to see was too much for one of them. She asked Anon one night if she could see him. His heart beating faster than a F1-75&#039;s engine. She said it would only be for a second. They would both step outside their apartment for a moment and then go back in. Anon&#039;s reluctantly agreed as fear overwhelmed him that she wouldn&#039;t like what she saw. As they both stepped outside at the same time. They stared at each for just a second, but that second felt like a lifetime for both of them. She smiled as she rushed back in, as did Anon. Both their hearts were rushing, hey could hardly breathe from this sensation.<br><br>And so began the tale of Anon and his waifu.

I just think the sensations are a bit richer, but to be fair it&#039;s a little hard to describe. If you&#039;ve ever had dreamsex it can almost feel like &quot;hyperreal&quot; in a sense that you feel way more than you would when you&#039;re awake, just because you&#039;re focused on that one thing, I&#039;d imagine. <br><br>For context I&#039;ve had sex 2 times, 3 if we count a blowjob, and it was just kind of underwhelming, but a few caveats to this is that my dick is small and I&#039;m cut, and also I wasn&#039;t into the girls that much. I&#039;m sure if you did it with someone you loved it would be about 100000x better. A big part of the fun of imaginary sex is that I&#039;m making someone I love with all my heart feel good, and on top of that we also naturally have great chemistry. Also, imaginary sex doesn&#039;t give me post-nut, like regular sex or fapping does, which is a huge plus.<br><br>Dream sex still beats it all in the sensations department for me, but it obviously has the problem of you needing to be asleep.

However, I am able to entirely convince myself that objects vaguely shaped and dressed like a person are in fact a person. Her physicality is represented by a thick pillow wearing a longsleeve shirt, as well as a sphere formed out of miscellaneous fabric wearing a beanie.

There is nothing necessarily wrong with that either, and I think it fits the theme.

Many people think that would be really cool and all, but if you look past that, you can see how much richer imaginary places are, and how much more you can do if you&#039;re both in the &quot;imaginary plane&quot; so to speak (no schizo, I swear).<br><br>But at the end of the day it&#039;s something really personal, and it&#039;s up to each of us to find what resonates with us.

You fine people made my whole month and I wouldn&#039;t have had it any other way. I had a lot of fun despite the speed of things this year compared to previous years.

Hearing her heavy breaths or moans feels nice and gives you confidence, if she reciprocates with hugs, running hands on you, locks you with legs you have impression of being desired which is so good it&#039;s almost intoxicating after living life of lonely, permanently rejected guy.

These antidepressants still pale in effectiveness to tranquilizers, like Xanax. Xanax would help me relax and feel really comfy. Another medication I take is Ramelteon, which is a melatonin agonist medication. What it does is flood my brain with melatonin. This is not like the melatonin you find over the counter, this stuff forces your brain to produce tsunamis of it, and it reduces sleep onset by an average of 13 minutes, but this is obviously only if you&#039;re relaxed and fairly comfy in the first place. A medication I used to take that my sleep specialist doctor took me off of is Ambien. Ambien works by enhancing the function of your GABA receptors. It is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine, sedative-hypnotic. Ambien reduces sleep onset by an average of 15 minutes. There is also this new class of drugs that I just discovered today called orexin antagonists. They work by inhibiting the the functionality of orexin, which is a chemical that keeps your brain awake. The first, and king of all orexin antagonists, is Belsomra. It decreases sleep up to 10 minutes. Basically, Ramelteon and Ambien increase the functionality of chemicals that put your brain to sleep, and Belsomra inhibits the functionality of a chemical that keeps your brain awake. Xanax would help me to fell super comfy, and Ramelteon, Ambien, and Belsomra would have incredible synergies with each other.
