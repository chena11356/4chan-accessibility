0,23675577,1.0,1.0,10/24/15(Sat)16:57:43,Anonymous,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

There are people who have died from jerking off. When we do it and get tired, our body is losing nutrients. So if you follow the line, we get tired from doing it once or whatever, the people who die are dead because their systems lose all nutrients. Can&#039;t function. You can&#039;t do anything like that. No way. Ancient people using terms like &#039;life force&#039; was because they didn&#039;t fully understand nutrients, but if you think about it, they weren&#039;t exactly wrong. Imagine the money that could be made if you took an average sample of however many ejaculations from different guys, saw the average nutrients lost, then invented a drink to replenish everything to the bone.

But giving one of those 3 things just for her attention, and you being okay with that, means you&#039;re a simp. A simp is someone who jizzes his pants just because a girl touched his finger and he would give the world for that experience, a normal guy is a guy who wants pussy and would give the world for pussy, getting pussy in any way shape or form, will make you not a simp, because a simp is someone content with a girl looking in his direction, he doesn&#039;t even conceptualise himself getting laid ever', 'time': 1670927266, 'resto': 71379702}]",1670927266,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0,
