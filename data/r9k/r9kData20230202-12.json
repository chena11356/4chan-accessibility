Her ability to delay gratification for example seems compromised if she&#039;s pushing 50+ sexual partners at any age. It seems like she&#039;s the sort of woman who, plainly and simply, cannot control her sexual urges, her desire for validation from men, or more commonly both. It&#039;s especially hard for me to understand as there have been times where I&#039;ve had available sex from a willing girl and I&#039;ve said no: because I was too tired, I didn&#039;t actually like her and didn&#039;t want to be around her etc. I find myself asking the question &quot;if I can say no to sex with someone attractive but toxic, then a girl who can&#039;t obviously has something seriously wrong with her.&quot;<br><br>Also for the sake of fairness: I&#039;ve encountered some women with a promiscuous past or present who, honestly and unironically I&#039;d argue are capable of being loyal to a man. I&#039;m not exactly sure how they manage it but they do, and that&#039;s fine for the men who marry them I suppose. These types of women are usually just very honest and up front about their sexual pasts. <br><br>The problem with women on /r9k/, or /soc/, or 4chan in general is that your sluttyness is almost always tied to some sort of intense Cluster B personality disorder - usually BPD - that is literally incurable. For me that&#039;s the clincher. The girls I&#039;ve met on here are just way, way too borderline. It&#039;s not just the sluttyness although that&#039;s a big part. It&#039;s the dishonesty, the deceit, the addiction to internet dopamine and discord, the mood swings from egocentric smugness to utter self loathing, the self harm. You and the other women in this thread know exactly what I mean. Your body count being high is directly tied to your sense of low self worth and your awful impulse control.

This manifests in many subtle details, but especially in relation to other men. A women will expect you to fend off other males approaching her, will expect you to have all eyes on her, will expect compliments. Basically she will expect you to be on a date with her. This in itself is just chivalry. But women will expect you to make a move on her now, the thing is it is your role as a man to conquer her. So if you do not do it, the girl will be flabbergasted. <br><br>The examples I brought up:<br>The first one is when a girl from a group we met at a bar approached me and in hindsight wanted me to make a move on her. But I didnt, from then on she was acting extremely strange. Same with women you randomly meet, they are always expecting you to court them.<br>So I guess the monkey dance I am referring to just the regular human dating/mating rituals that exist, which are all a monkey dance frankly speaking. <br>I did not differentiate it from a situation where men are literally acting like the lowest possible animals because this is something that just did not naturally occurred to me as I do not display this behavior and find it disposable. But yea perhaps I should have used a word that differentiates what I mean from it.<br><br>The second situation was when we were handing out with a different group of friends and we went to different bars all over town. And there was this girl who was apparently trying to get my attention, and when I did not give it to her she started saying that I act gay. Because I must be gay if I do not do the monkey dance", "time": 1675339974, "resto": 72063799}, {"no": 72064519, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:18:05", "name": "hecate", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qu<wbr>Yne6ATwY&amp;embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2F<wbr>4chan.org%2F&amp;feature=emb_rel_end", "time": 1675340285, "resto": 72063799}, {"no": 72064546, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:22:28", "name": "hecate", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaM<wbr>D2N-Jy8Y&amp;embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2F<wbr>4chan.org%2F&amp;feature=emb_rel_end", "time": 1675340548, "resto": 72063799}, {"no": 72064599, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:31:11", "name": "hecate", "com": "https://voca.ro/1daLDol3CZEV<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt3<wbr>3ElBL5nI<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TT<wbr>PGAy5H_E", "time": 1675341071, "resto": 72063799}, {"no": 72064636, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:38:02", "name": "hecate", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHn<wbr>Ye5Nj0F0", "time": 1675341482, "resto": 72063799}, {"no": 72064677, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:43:30", "name": "hecate", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wis<wbr>I4tBArSw", "time": 1675341810, "resto": 72063799}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 72054567, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "as a fembot who has dated 3 robots and talked to dozens i&#039;ve noticed a pattern<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most robots are legit ugly and are probably going to be forever alone because of it unless they fix it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of the good looking robots are extremely mentally ill and refuse to lower their standards</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;loads of robots are rich and rich incels are more common than you&#039;d might think</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most misogynistic robots tend to be the most submissive</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people here are kinda self aware more than the average normie</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most robots are not right wing contrary to popular rhetoric</span>", "filename": "baise-moi", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 337, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675273706993226, "time": 1675273706, "md5": "HSqOLNVCUGe5P0QUmwAMvg==", "fsize": 59759, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "as-a-fembot-who-has-dated-3-robots-and-talked-to", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 152, "images": 37, "unique_ips": 61, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 72054625, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:53:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72054567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72054567</a><br>ok how do i find hot mentally ill chads that are rich and submissive but not misogynistic?", "time": 1675274032, "resto": 72054567}, {"no": 72054681, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:58:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72054625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72054625</a><br>lol, r9k servers and here. that&#039;s what all my ex bfs that were robots were like. one was really anxious and the other two really hot aspies who couldn&#039;t really get normie girls to overlook their weirdness. alternatively, just look for the &quot;i&#039;m hot and have girls interested in me but i&#039;m too autistic&quot; posts here. as i said in the op, most robots are extremely self aware", "time": 1675274332, "resto": 72054567}, {"no": 72054799, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)13:09:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72054681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72054681</a><br>also, would not recommend anyway. autistic or mentally ill people are not worth dealing with no matter hot they are but ye, it&#039;s fun fucking a hot guy who feels grateful for your touch. novelty wears off though", "time": 1675274992, "resto": 72054567}, {"no": 72054819, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)13:12:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72054567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72054567</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most robots are legit ugly and are probably going to be forever alone because of it unless they fix it</span><br>What are they gonna do, work their fucking face out?", "time": 1675275142, "resto": 72054567}, {"no": 72054834, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)13:13:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "can all the &quot;fembots&quot; stop pretending they&#039;re sad or lonely now when they&#039;re literally passively racking up chadlite robot body counts. what the fuck.", "time": 1675275219, "resto": 72054567}, {"no": 72054845, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)13:14:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72054834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72054834</a><br>Just stop responding to their stupid posts.

Even guys who used to pick on me would try befriend me once they saw I was getting female attention. I&#039;ve always been the best at maths and guys in my class were generally all decent towards me. I&#039;d finish all the work 10-20 minutes into class and the teacher would let me read in the corner since I already knew everything. Sure some guys would ask for help and maybe one or two girls but they&#039;d move away once they got it. Randomly these 2 girls who were really hot would come across the classroom and ask for help with the work but they were unnecessarily touching me and asking unrelated questions. One of them had a Chad athlete bf and he randomly started talking to me asking if I want to go to the football tryouts for the school team. Within a week these two girls were following me home and they&#039;d start sitting next to me at lunch. They&#039;d ask random questions and shit.

Could be if you think back, you&#039;ll realise there were missed opportunities. Not something to dwell on, just something to consider. <br>Past high school, women are attracted to status and dominance in my experience. And looks. My very first girlfriend was a friend from middle school who I convinced to date me when we were 18 or so. We were very close, but in the end she wasn&#039;t attracted to me. I had little going for me and I was incredibly boring. Not too long after that, I started a relationship with a friend of my sister&#039;s who decided she liked me, started initiating hangouts with me, and then we got hammered and tried to have sex. I had terrible whisky dick, but we ended up sort of dating for eight months. In my estimation, she liked me because I was older than her and I look and act decent. Most people have attractive qualities that some women will be attracted to, but if you only have one or two things going for you, fewer women will notice.<br>Since then, I&#039;ve noticed that my attractiveness to women has very much coincided with becoming more successful in work. Success and working my way up the hierarchy at work has helped. I have to talk to them for work, I tell them what to do, they see me manage my guys, I&#039;m better with eye contact now. I have noticed interest from many of the girls at work, and slept with a couple of them when I got drunk enough. Since my first girlfriend, I don&#039;t chase women. I don&#039;t try to flirt with them apart from normal banter, teasing them/bullying them, and pushing them around playfully.<br>My advice is to be competent and dominant in a setting where women (who are similar age or younger looking/seeming than you are) are, and figure out how to read the signs they give you.

I&#039;d probably mostly see based upon how she acts around me, compared to others and such. But once I&#039;m decently sure she&#039;s at least interested, I&#039;d probably just tell her when I feel the moment is right. Would it be sweet to write some long love letter professing my undying love? Maybe, but it may be autistic, especially when we aren&#039;t even a couple. The lovey dovey sperging would truly begin if we actually became lovers. The few times I ever remember actually asking out a girl was just kinda casually. It&#039;s better to just let it out. It&#039;s a very nice feeling, being honest and taking the weight off your chest. I&#039;d tell then they mean alot to me, and I&#039;d love to be more than just friends. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;How do you act around someone you like?</span><br>More loving, that&#039;s for sure. They have my attention first and foremost. It&#039;s honestly not hard to know if I like you. I&#039;d be around you often, would always be happy to talk, especially if I get to bond or learn more about you. Witu the last girl I truly liked, I talked to her basically every day. I&#039;d also try to be more touchy feely. I respect people&#039;s personal space, but if I can get hugs, I&#039;m absolutely gonna try to get one every time we see each other again. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Your favorite snack</span><br>That&#039;s an extrenely tough question, as iy may depend on my mood.

This led to a moral reckoning from many streamers over it. and I think it&#039;s interesting to compare these reactions and note how they differ depending on their MBTI, and see what trends, if any, about typology we can glean from them.

PDB says if you like Minecraft you are INTP 5w4 which I believe is my enneagram too. So I&#039;ll go with the Minecraft soundtrack for my overall answer then I guess. I would say Terraria but it is a much more upbeat soundtrack.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What is a stereotype about your type that annoys you?</span><br>The we are basement-dwelling, unfit, unhealthy, autistic losers <s>because it is true often.</s><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What do you think people get wrong about your type the most?</span><br>I think that people read the &quot;INTPs are not robots and have emotions&quot; but fail to understand that our emotions don&#039;t seem to work the same.<br><a href=\"#p72061777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72061777</a><br>I&#039;ve never seen salt in water.", "filename": "1649465750121", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675334208460103, "time": 1675334208, "md5": "1xxgwFM+nEbDnSBWYYRvHg==", "fsize": 308341, "resto": 72054341, "trip": "!oexo7A6fyU"}, {"no": 72063775, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:38:23", "name": "Turbie, Anons&#039; Waifu", "com": "I-I tried the Nemusona AI waifu generator (waifus.nemusona.com) because I was curious about what Typology Academy would look like if it were created by AI!

Seems like it&#039;s gonna also make sleeping not easy.<br>Idk what to do to save my retardation. I have benzos (aprazolam, pyrazolam), phenibut, noopept, 5-htp, and many stims like NEP.<br>How do I even undo the dissociation of DCK and find the motivation to finish my stuff.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>SPSPS", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675334426642527, "time": 1675334426, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 8, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 72063806, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:41:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body.
