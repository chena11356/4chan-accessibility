However, if your son gets some dumb whore pregnant, it&#039;s entirely up to her if she chooses to get an abortion or keep the kid, and if she keeps the kid, then it&#039;s your son that&#039;s going to be coughing up 25% of his paycheck for the next 18 years", "time": 1670993563, "resto": 71391284}, {"no": 71392500, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:45:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71391590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71391590</a><br>birth control is toxic and dangerous.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pro abortion</span><br>you&#039;re a monster.", "time": 1671000339, "resto": 71391284}, {"no": 71392557, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:52:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71391284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71391284</a><br>not that i would care too much about my daughter having sex, but it&#039;s the same logic as children not being able to consent, someone doesn&#039;t always know what&#039;s best for them, tho i&#039;m sure the low iq tweet. got 200k likes", "time": 1671000730, "resto": 71391284}, {"no": 71392589, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)01:56:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is idiotic.

The guy got all pissed off at me and just kept asking me about it, eventually I got up and went over to the Asian chick and was like, can I just get my weed, and I got it and left and didn&#039;t go back. <br><br>Now in retrospect, dude was DEFINITELY just spewing complete horseshit.

I know this sounds crazy, but I&#039;m going to tell my experience and maybe others can corroborate this. <br>Most people see VR porn as the most degenerate thing there is, but anyone that has a VR set will tell you, VR gets old fast and most is gathering dust. <br>VR porn was exciting at first, incredible but after a month i fell back into normal porn addiction and lust and stopped using VR. <br>Thats because VR porn is basically the same as regular sex. Which means its just as dull. I think the main aspect of porn addiction is the variety searching, and all the pics and different videos. Watching a VR porn video is like regular sex, which means it gets boring at parts. it&#039;s just a lady on top of you going up and down. <br><br>Recently, about a month ago, I decided to buy a subscription to VR porn site. For about a month now, I watch at most just one video a day, because I want it to be like regular sex. <br>The thing is, it&#039;s not addicting. I even have to kind of force myself to use it. I barely have a sex drive like as if I have wife. <br>The effects of this after a month is I no longer have lust or desire for women really. I think it&#039;s because VR porn is almost indistinguishable from real sex. My porn addiction was predicated on a fantasy and sexual frustration, and VR porn is more like the real thing. Because of this, I&#039;ve realized how stupid it is to lust for women. Women basically mean nothing to me now. <br>Contrary to regular porn addiction, I don&#039;t even feel bad after. I feel sexually healthy and balanced and can just go about my life like a normal person. <br>No more lust or frustration or regrets about missed opportunities and anger. I just feel content. <br><br>BTW -- I&#039;m not an incel, I&#039;ve had sex before, and I can tell you sex is basically the same as VR porn. If anything, VR porn is better<br>VR porn instills in me something I already knew, but it makes me realize how pointless sex is without love.
