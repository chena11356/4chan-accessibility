So if you follow the line, we get tired from doing it once or whatever, the people who die are dead because their systems lose all nutrients. Can&#039;t function. You can&#039;t do anything like that. No way. Ancient people using terms like &#039;life force&#039; was because they didn&#039;t fully understand nutrients, but if you think about it, they weren&#039;t exactly wrong.
