A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>AYAY", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672992439881216, "time": 1672992439, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 9, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 71712899, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:07:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks.

At the same time, she might find herself growing more attached to my wife, who&#039;s happy to have someone around to help manage my libido. All that masturbation is unhealthy, after all. It might irritate her to be chatting with my wife about some shared interest and suddenly be bent over the table with my hands spreading her open and lubing her up. I&#039;d be polite about it, of course. No need to stop what you&#039;re doing for me.

She might find herself enjoying my daily interruptions, even anticipating them. Perhaps she herself wouldn&#039;t know whether it&#039;s preference or Pavlovian conditioning that makes her slick with arousal when I walk in the room and tell her it&#039;s time. She could feel cheated when I waste my daily use of her on finishing in her after a session of masturbation, and disappointed when I skip a day. At least she&#039;d be able to understand her own feelings in that. Who could understand the mix of jealously and envy and possessiveness on days when I make love to my wife instead of using her?", "filename": "cuckedAndLovingIt", "ext": ".png", "w": 288, "h": 263, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1672978351120049, "time": 1672978351, "md5": "SLqW/s4Ex/FeEStV7wnKkw==", "fsize": 113325, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711293, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)23:31:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71710553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71710553</a><br>I have XX chromosomes kys<br><a href=\"#p71711122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71711122</a><br>Cuck fetishists should be drug out into the street and shot publicly, you kys too", "filename": "illust_97908306_20221219_093626", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672979466314170, "time": 1672979466, "md5": "cuuU3lnEAagNBSmRZGnlPA==", "fsize": 897088, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711325, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)23:34:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71707252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71707252</a><br>Look into bride kidnapping in Central Asia anon, still happens today in many rural regions.", "time": 1672979685, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711349, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)23:38:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71711122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71711122</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cuck fetishists should be drug out into the street and shot publicly, you kys too</span><br><br>No thanks, I&#039;ve got plans to rub dicks with a femboy who digs my hairy dad bod", "filename": "hatersGonnaHate", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 540, "h": 541, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672979882754989, "time": 1672979882, "md5": "BNpoJGazOKfUiU2Z8Ve/Jw==", "fsize": 43324, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711785, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:28:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71711325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71711325</a><br>I was unironically groom kidnapped when I spent time there, kept in captivity for a time.", "time": 1672982917, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711883, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:38:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71711785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71711785</a><br>Did it... yurt?", "time": 1672983496, "resto": 71707252}, {"no": 71711914, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)00:42:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71707252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71707252</a><br>Yes, but without the rape.

Finally, in January 2018, a group of researchers led by Francesca Lionetti published their article in Translational Psychiatry and introduced a third group: &quot;tulip children&quot;, which has both resilient and sensitive characteristics (by the way, Elaine Aron is one of the authors of this paper~): https://rdcu.be/c2MtB ! \\(^_^)/<br>So tl;dr:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dandelion: high resilience, low sensitivity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tulip: medium resilience, medium sensitivity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;orchid: low resilience, high sensitivity</span><br>*^w^*<br>You can take the flower test here: https://sensitivityresearch.com/sel<wbr>f-tests/adult-self-test/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whats you favourite one</span><br>Maybe spearmint! :3<br><br><br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71611997#p71640940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71640940</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saying kek</span><br>N-no... :Oc<br><br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71611997#p71641107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71641107</a><br>What&#039;s an INTJ-J?

The &quot;little adults&quot; idea largely hinges on exactly what age we&#039;re talking about. 11 year olds? Yeah, maybe. 3 year olds? No, toddlers are the furthest thing in the world from &quot;miniature adults&quot; on just about every possible level. <br><br>The impression I get is that the maturation process went at an accelerated rate compared to today, but that there was still a transition from child to adult that spanned years. Children in ancient fiction are still portrayed as mischievous, bratty, and dumb. 6 year olds worked hard on the farm rather than taking it easy, but they didn&#039;t hold significant ranks in society and were often considered not to be culpable for crimes. 11 year olds worked on the mines, but that didn&#039;t mean they were viewed 1:1 identical to adults psychologically - just that they were capable of doing manual labor. From what I can gather, many societies viewed people as full adults in the 14-18 range, not well into the 20s like today, but people below that range weren&#039;t viewed as adults. It&#039;s true that &#039;child culture&#039; wasn&#039;t much of a thing back then - kids wore smaller versions of adult clothes, they didn&#039;t have media specifically catered to them - but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s humanly possible not to realize that a 5 year old is very difficult from someone in their 20s or 30s, no matter what the culture or era.", "filename": "Yor 2", "ext": ".png", "w": 783, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672907498120223, "time": 1672907498, "md5": "K18Rs6PdvZNoZCCRl1+30Q==", "fsize": 862050, "resto": 71688227}, {"no": 71698870, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:32:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71698864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71698864</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would people be ok with any other demographic being forced into education camps?

Even if you excuse this as a necessary evil for society to function, I still think many parents don&#039;t give their kids enough freedom, scheduling out their every single hour and waking moment, trying to sign them up for every extracurricular possible to turn them into a Renaissance kid of a thousand skills regardless of their own personality or interests or desires. Kids aren&#039;t adult but they&#039;re still human beings. They should have choices, they should have a significant amount of freedom, they should have their preferences and feelings respected and listened to.

My only friend was my mom. No friends in school at all. I didn&#039;t understand how social interaction works, I still really don&#039;t. Whenever I talked with anyone, it would range from awkward silence because I didn&#039;t know what to say (ever) to just being bullied. I had a couple friends when I was doing Ju Jitsu but not really. My mom lied to the school district to get me into a higher income school since we were dirt poor and she wanted me to be better off than she was, and I was a year younger than my classmates. Was also disgusting half-white half-asian crossbreed (if you ever have kids, never create racial abominations. I look like an effeminate faggot because of my asian half but have relatively low intelligence due to my white half. I look and sound like a disgusting genetic defect upon the face of the earth, and I have all the worst aspects of my two least favorite races on earth). Middle school was worse, my dad was abusive as a kid and he started to have more control in my life around that time (me and my mom were evicted from our apartment, ended up living with my dad because no other option). Kids at school would bully me relentlessly, even though I didn&#039;t interact with any of them. They would bully me by stealing shit from me, and by making false accusations to teachers and snitching on me for minor things (including showing signs of suicide. I know for a fact those faggots never reported me because they were genuinely concerned, just because they wanted to see me suffer even more. No one who&#039;s genuinely concerned would go to the fucking people in charge). My teachers and the staff hated me, seemingly just because I was an easy reject to bully (and let me just tell you, every single teacher is a bad person. if you ever see a teacher, I encourage you to kill them with a baseball bat).

Of course, when I was with my dad, I wasn&#039;t allowed to do anything but homework. Not allowed to leave the house out of fear that I would run away. After middle school, I only had two friends, the only two friends I&#039;ve ever had in the history of my life and still have today. Multiple times, I would be accused of wanting to shoot up the school or bomb the school. For a time, I did want to, but only for a time. One time I got searched because some stupid dyke in my special ed class at the time heard I owned an airsoft gun with no orange tip (that I didn&#039;t have on me) and decided it was reason enough to snitch (I specifically hate fags and trannies because they&#039;re the most likely people on earth to snitch over fucking anything). I was talking about how shitty the situation was with an acquaintance at school, and someone listening behind us reported me because all they heard was &quot;school shooting&quot;. In high school, I got in trouble for something else and some other girl that didn&#039;t like me reported me to the cops for wanting to build a bomb. My stupid fucking dad&#039;s side of the family is all liberal and pro-cop, so of course I get my room searched and all the drugs that were allowing me to feel somewhat OK with being alive were taken. They didn&#039;t know that the fucking 4th amendment existed apparently and decided to let the cops in with open arms since I&#039;m pretty sure they like the cops more than they like me.

He would totally give me shit for being a rapist weirdo if I got in trouble at school for asking a girl out. Besides that though, I did have my sexual encounters. They were all with hood black girls. I think the reason why in hindsight was because there was no commitment and no snitching. Black girls are all fucked up and have shitty father figures, and so do I. We have that much in common and are both in horrible standing with institutions. Besides all that though, I got super into lockpicking and hacking. I would break into a ton of abandoned buildings for fun, and befriend homeless people. They were like me, thrown into society&#039;s garbage can. Impoverished and hated by mainstream society. I also broke into a lot of in-use buildings. They had nice rooftops and good shit, and evading security provided a challenge. I would also use my programming skills to write malware that would steal passwords from browser autofill and contribute my hacking skills to my little gang of 3. We were essentially a bunch of James Bond wannabes, we stole keys to large buildings and picked our way into houses that were for sale and made the keys to them, and essentially just treated all these places like we owned them.

These include feelings of inadequacy, especially of his scientific training (obviously he was bolstered by publishing together with Pauli; however, he was never comfortable with math and physics, his background was in the biological sciences). He cites three reasons for proceeding: (1) His increasing experience of and with the phenomena. (2) His research into the history of fish symbolism (presented in detail in his book Aion), which included a set of synchronicities - in addition to those in the published accounts, Jung found a snake that had choked in the act of swallowing a fish so that both had died. This occurred in 1933 at the shore by his Bollingen retreat. According to a family member, Jung saw this as a synchronicity since he was working on the relationship of Christianity/Fish and Alchemy/Snake at the time, and the external event paralleled his views on how these systems&#039; inability to integrate their perspectives was fatal to each, leaving them dead.

I can&#039;t say it will work for sure but it will probably work a lot better than just doing random psychs at random dosages with no trip sitter and no frame of reference for what&#039;s happening. I know from experience that depression impairs your cognition and makes you do irrational things so adding psychs to that mix without any sort of consultation from someone experienced with them is again probably a bad idea. I took LSD 2 years ago and it just made things worse, then I took LSA about 4 days ago and it actually helped so it&#039;s not a guarantee and one substance that might be helpful to one person is not nesacarily going to help someone with a completely different biology and lived experience.

I won&#039;t say that some of these things aren&#039;t true. Shit, anon, - a lot of them are. I&#039;ve lived in the states most of my life. But to what extent these things are true is something you need to grasp and understand beyond a simply cynical perspective. The abstractions you speak of are vague and wide-reaching. It is much easier to have a scathing critique on something when you believe it&#039;s a universal experience.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that generalizations are fucking dangerous. The human brain isn&#039;t designed for all that much nuance. Given time, and a lack of world-experience, everything can be summarized and simplified as a group or wide-reaching phenomenon. You need to be cautious when you come to think about these things. Especially with generalizing.<br>Do you really believe that every American consumes s/oy? That every American is a blind consumer - that fresh food is impossible to acquire and our transport systems are worse than those in 3rd world nations?<br>I&#039;ll hazard a guess you&#039;re thinking &quot;Yes!&quot; to at least one of these things. That&#039;s not your fault. What lays at hand is that, while these may all have some truth to them -more so in some states, cities, regions and what-not than others, they are NOT a reflection of the ENTIRE nation. The transport system in my city is amazing. It works great. There&#039;s a community here - book stands, kids selling hot chocolate in the cold, shoveling driveways, you name it. What is important here is that I do not live in some Narnia or ill-guided whimsy. I live in the average city in America, with &lt;200.000 total residents. <br>What really stings me about the America/Europe blackpilling is that NOBODY who posts this shit has ever lived in Europe - let alone having visited. Not as an adult. They suffer from the same problems we do; as many western countries do. Of course, they are exasperated in some places, and not so prevalent in others.
