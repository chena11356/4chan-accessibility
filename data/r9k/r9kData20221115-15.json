My mom was also an incurable narcissist. I was treated from birth as nothing more than an asset for the family to gain bragging rights by. I did well in school, got into college, stayed and got even more straight A&#039;s in a major full of classmates that hated me. I won every assinine best kid contest at every family reunion year after year for more than 2 decades straight. I had to take an involuntary gap year after college so I failed into a codemonkey job at a tech company. It was &quot;glamorous&quot; so despite shit not going to plan they still bragged. Then I got fucked over at work to the point where lawyers, guns, and money were involved and they couldn&#039;t be even pretend to believe me. They were more interested in keeping me there so I could get tortured to death for their glory; evidently they couldn&#039;t keep up their end of the bargain for their &quot;trophy kid&quot;. After a ton of brutal fighting, we finally &quot;compromised&quot; on graduate school, which they considered insufficiently classy and a step down. It also bought them more time to change my mind for me. Now they&#039;re pumping up my younger brother since they burned me out. At least they finally grew a pair and stood up to the family, but that was only after they insulted my mom&#039;s cooking. I&#039;m halfway through grad school and I&#039;m just as angry as the day I entered. They seem to notice sine they are finally paying lip service to the concept of happiness, but how the fuck am I supposed to believe them? They still repeat &quot;you will change your mind&quot;. There was also a period of time where they were changing their trusts and wills to make sure they would get sent to at least a decent nursing home and to make sure my future wife would be unable to access the money for XXX years when it was clear I was pissed the fuck off. I guess I should be flattered that they think I can still get a girl.", "time": 1668542057, "resto": 70988593}, {"no": 70998040, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:18:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70992639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70992639</a><br>What did you fap to fren? <br><a href=\"#p70995962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70995962</a><br>I&#039;m a real person or is this a reference to a show or game or something ?", "filename": "file (4)", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668543490424130, "time": 1668543490, "md5": "G1iXj+9TEF+W+QmSmS82LA==", "fsize": 878941, "resto": 70988593}, {"no": 70998103, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:23:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70997773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70997773</a><br>home schoolers lucked out.", "filename": "pride_parade_school", "ext": ".webm", "w": 480, "h": 848, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668543825831307, "time": 1668543825, "md5": "ATIEBpVAy0xOdUF94zER+A==", "fsize": 2448078, "resto": 70988593}, {"no": 70998120, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:25:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70988593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70988593</a><br>My mom&#039;s genuinely remorseful of all the pain she&#039;s caused me, but it&#039;s pretty late in the game for her to be that way. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;threatened to walk out on the family when I was about 8</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;would sometimes ban me from eating with the family because my sister didn&#039;t want me there (I know making your kids eat by themselves is a thing in anglo families, but we don&#039;t ever do that in Italian culture)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;had to be her therapist growing up</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;had to be her rock when my dad died, even though I was clearly struggling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;became emotionally abusive to me, probably because I helped her when my dad died instead of demanding complete servitude from her</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;encouraged my sister to be cruel to me as well</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tried to talk to her during the pandemic because I was in physical pain from loneliness, she yelled at me and said any other parent would have kicked me out for asking that</span>", "time": 1668543900, "resto": 70988593}], "last_modified": 1668543900}, {"no": 70998119, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:24:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why don&#039;t you pretend to be autistic / retarded? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free gibs from government </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone likes you, has no expectation for you </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your parents won&#039;t make you get a job anymore </span><br><br>what&#039;s the downside?", "filename": "1659805502058254", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 671, "h": 498, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 185, "tim": 1668543884214201, "time": 1668543884, "md5": "ZIQryJdtxk36RYcn2q9qCg==", "fsize": 226419, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-dont-you-pretend-to-be-autistic-retarded", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1668543884}, {"no": 70997995, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are so many fine sistas dating goofy white boys?", "filename": "Screenshot_20221105-191152~2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 1091, "tn_w": 247, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668543267811801, "time": 1668543267, "md5": "fwmf2Vw1/Y78dpN1OM8hlQ==", "fsize": 1026722, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-are-so-many-fine-sistas-dating-goofy-white", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 8, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 70998031, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:17:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70997995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70997995</a><br>theyre not. he just has a rich dad. no one wants white guys for their looks or personality. <br><br>most girls i know just laugh at white dudes", "time": 1668543463, "resto": 70997995}, {"no": 70998038, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:18:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70998021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70998021</a><br>the t-shirt is what outs him as gullible, not the car. fucking retard.", "time": 1668543489, "resto": 70997995}, {"no": 70998053, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70998038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70998038</a><br>You said by the car and t-shirt, how else was I supposed to interpret that statement?

It is highlighted that sperm penetrates into the mucosa of the uterine and possibly alters the genetic structure, affecting the embryo and enduring from one pregnancy to the next, which may be one of the potential mechanisms of telegony. Uterine fluid, uterine gland-derived histotroph, supplies key nutrients for successful embryo implantation and it is important during the first trimester, especially, because of its susceptibility to maternal states. The presence of EVs in uterine fluid (uterosomes) was reported in mice, sheep, and humans, including a wide range of biomolecules, such as proteins, and non-coding RNAs. In this review article, we presented a new idea to explain telegony. Based on our idea, after the previous male sperm entry into the female reproductive system, those sperm which do not participate in fertilization penetrate into the somatic cells of the uterus and store their genetic/epigenetic information there. The sperm of the next partner reaches a location in the female reproductive canal where it exchanges information with the uterosomes and obtains the proteins and non-coding RNAs required for fertilization, development, and implantation.", "filename": "1668516689220380m", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 576, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668533309583034, "time": 1668533309, "md5": "jrx2uu9fjB2sYAZEHlpC5A==", "fsize": 124763, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "reminder-that-telegony-is-real-and-if-your-gf-has", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 149, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 144, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 70997904, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)15:06:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p70997876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;70997876</a><br>what?
