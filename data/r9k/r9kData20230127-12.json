If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Being a virgin or having a low bodycount versus someone having a very high bodycount like 100 really says a lot about another person. Having sex is something way more than just a few seconds of pleasure. Its showing another person your most vulnerable self. A woman with a very high bodycount might not take relationships too seriously and are more likely to cheat if their partner is not pleasuring them enough because they have so much experience and can compare you to their previous partners. While I do agree that women with higher bodycount also should experience love and respect its just easier to trust a virgin girl or someone with a lower bodycount. Also a lot of robots dont want to date women with high bodycount because they think theyre loose while its pretty hard to get loose from just dick itself , if they were pregnant or had very extreme vaginal sex that could be the case then. But either way we should respect someone wanting a virgin woman.

Those of us 30+ remember the pre-internet era. Life was slower and that was okay. You knew relatively few people. It didn&#039;t matter if you had nothing going on for a bit. There wasn&#039;t virtual pressures to live up to standards imposed by virtual realities. This internet era changed the relative basis to make everybody feel like they need to be socialite. Take away the digital facade and nothing is different than it used to be. Peoples lives aren&#039;t that exciting. They never were. The digital world made it feel like everybody has more social connections than they do because database entries says your friends list is this long. In the real life meat space I don&#039;t really know anymore people on a regular basis than I used to. By todays standards that means I&#039;m a loser man, dropped out of society even? Except nothing has changed. I was just another nobody dude in this town before. Today I&#039;m still just another dude. I suspect this is true for most people. The world succumbed to the surreptitious facade of virtual standards of a digital era which are nothing more than business selling user engagements packaged as a social life.

Like yeah I guess I can have cool conversations about the ramifications of Charles the Bold having his head cleaved in half outside Nancy on geopolitical relations at the time but that doesn&#039;t really generate economic value, it&#039;s just neat. If anything my Geographic knowledge would have more applications but I don&#039;t know who needs to pay someone who can remember that Kigali is the capital of Rwanda or that Nova Gorica is in the part of Slovenia near Italy named after the city on the other side of the border which had historically been populated by Slavs when they could just google it.<br><a href=\"#p71985545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71985545</a><br>Well, Britain did manage to lose a battle against primitive Zulus in the battle of Isandlwana (lol). They then followed up that humiliating defeat with a most impressive victory at the Battle of Rorke&#039;s Drift where a small garrison of a few hundred men held of many thousands of Zulus who had perhaps gotten overconfident because of the previous engagement. 300 Greeks repelled something like 10k Ottoman troops from a fortified inn and only suffered 5 casualties in the process (Battle of Gravia inn), in huge part because the Turks had left their Arty support behind in order to faster advance against the Greek revolt. A Venetian garrison held a besieged city in Crete for a whole 21 years before it finally fell to the Ottomans (Siege of Candia). Idk those are just random facts I kinda remember though", "time": 1674819245, "resto": 71985254}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71985113, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)05:05:40", "name": "Inventor of NO PUSSY NO WORK NO PUSSY NO TAXES NO PUSSY NO VACCINE NO PUSSY NO PEACE Simple A-S", "sub": "Day nr.12244 of getting absolutely NO PUSSY on my motherfucking dick", "com": "brutal, absurd, unfair, i dont know how else to describe this phenomenon.

In my case it did grow back when I stopped. And a lot of people online say the same. But still it&#039;s pretty dumb to tempt fate like I am. There&#039;s no guarantee it will keep growing back, if I keep doing this there&#039;s a very real chance it won&#039;t grow back at all at some point. And there are some reports online from people who said it didn&#039;t grow back, so it&#039;s not completely unheard of.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do you recommend not trying kratom?</span><br>For the same reason I don&#039;t recommend any addictive substance to people. It&#039;s addictive. It is (probably) far better than most other drug addictions, but it still is a drug and it still can lead to horrible addiction. I am 100% reliant on kratom. I can&#039;t get through a single work day without it. I rarely manage to last more than 48 hours before I can&#039;t resist taking more. I wouldn&#039;t wish this on anyone. Also the market is unregulated, there&#039;s no quality control and you really can&#039;t be 100% you&#039;re not getting adulterated or unpure product. And also there&#039;s no science yet on the potential long term effects of it. I was actually involved in a study last year on kratom users. <br><br>that&#039;s why I only recommend it for someone already addicted to opiods or alcohol. If you&#039;re on harder opiods than kratom is 100% a better addiction.

You&#039;re the problem. Integrity can have a lot of different meanings, but in the context of relationships the way you maintain integrity is by focusing mostly on yourself. In fact, it&#039;s only if you do this that you&#039;ll even notice manipulative bullshit, like, if you expect someone to show their love with &quot;acts of service&quot; then what you actually are looking for is co-dependence and enmeshment. After a while you will become enmeshed anyway, but in the early days (first year or two) signs of a shit-cunt are:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trying to do excessive favours, being a doormat for you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Generally not taking care of themselves.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Expecting you to do their laundry, dishes, seeing it as a singular task.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Expecting you to help maintain a standard of cleanliness that they really ought to take ownership of</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thinking that, say, vacuuming once a week is some absurd standard of cleanliness that&#039;s really your own.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Focusing more on you than themselves.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not focusing on you at all</span><br><br>You should, more or less, understand each other as filling a need and act accordingly. The need is sex and intimacy, not being a dishwasher or dog walker or whatever. It&#039;s fine to share your life, but expecting other people to clean up your messes just makes you a shitty person. She says she loves you, what is she doing to show she doesn&#039;t love you? Maybe I&#039;m wrong, you know, but the way you expressed is &quot;she doesn&#039;t show she loves me.&quot; It makes it sound like you have some dumb expectation but I dunno.", "time": 1674805291, "resto": 71982861}, {"no": 71983940, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:45:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71983900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71983900</a><br>You&#039;ve misjudged me.
