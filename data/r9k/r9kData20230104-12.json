No, What is meant to be and natural is not a social construct. Calling them by their preferred gender is literally erasing the definitions of gender. People can&#039;t even explain what a woman is anymore, &quot;woman is what you want it to be&quot; lmao.

She had a friend over and by 9pm they had decided to get high, and my Mom gave her bed to the friend cause the friend sleeps easy. Mom went to watch movies with me in my room, with her little puppy, and she fell asleep around 12. Now I lost my phone last night, so whereas I&#039;d put on porn in the bathroom after she slept, I instead am kept up by an unending boner that just won&#039;t go away. She slept on her back for awhile but after what seems like forever she rolled to her left. Her back is facing me, and her ass is huge. She&#039;s 6&#039;1, 180lbs or so. Likes to call herself fat but honestly she&#039;s just a total milf. Body shape like Syren de Mer. <br>So I start rubbing my cock slowly in my right hand, and when she starts snoring I grab her ass over the blanket with my left. I haven&#039;t done that since I was 15, over half a decade ago. It felt so nice, I have big hands and not even a full grasp could cover a cheek. After a couple squeezes her breath and snoring die down, but gradually. I think she&#039;s still sleeping, so I start again. I start feeling around for her butt crack, and after I find it I scoot myself and my hand closer so I start rubbing her faint and pussy. Her breath gets quiet again, so I pull away. She goes back to louder so I go under the blanket this time and start rubbing her pussy through her pjs. She even starts to moan and I try to finger her through the clothes. She starts to turn to her back again so I quickly pull my hand away and act like I&#039;m sleeping for a minute. I hear moaning though, I open my eyes and see shes still sleeping, thank this is my shot. I go to finger her again, but her hand was there. She was finger herself in her sleep! And by touching her hand she suddenly woke up, still obviously high as she never smokes. Asks about the dog, good excuse for me, so I say yeah hes fine go back to bed.<br>I cant fall asleep, that was the hottest thing I&#039;ve done in a long time.

Snoring again, I go back at it. Same thing, her breath gets quieter when I grab her ass or rub her pussy. I back off, let her stay sleeping, go back to it. I really try finger her pussy through the clothing this time, and she moans a bit but also just shorter breaths. She&#039;s not touching herself in her sleep again, and she has a separate blanket so I can&#039;t reach through her front. I decide to back off for awhile, then start putting my hand through her pants in the back. I manage to touch her crack a bit and get one grab in before she wakes up again. Shes more seriously awake now, but still obviously the pot is in her system. She asks me again about the pup, and then asks me what I&#039;m doing awake. Not a sexy tone or anything, just tired. I reply insomnia, which I have and also it&#039;s been a stressful week for the both of us, so she brushes it off. She goes to the restroom and comes back, mentions again how tired she is and falls back asleep, but this time again on her back. I felt that if she was wanting it, she would have put her butt in my direction again, so I decided to turn around and went to bed. <br>When I woke up this morning I felt a bit of shame, but was still horny enough that I decided to shave down there. Heres the deal, around a year ago, February, I got off work and we were watching movies in the living room, in a drunken and high stupor around 1am I told her I was sexually attracted to her. Her mood turned 180 and she just sounded sad, dismissed it and told me that was because I wasnt seeing any girls. This strained us a bit so I slept with some older chick in March, told her it was a teenager off tinder and she was happier. I&#039;ve never had a hard time getting women, but truth is I&#039;ve been attracted to my Mom since I was 8, no other woman even compared to her.

So mostly dumb people.<br><br>Barbara Daly Baekeland<br>One mother who most certainly seduced her son was Barbara Daly Baekeland. Born in 1922, Baekeland was a model whose face graced the pages of Vogue and Harper&#039;s Bazaar. After failing to make it in Hollywood as an actress, she married Bakelite heir, Brooks Baekeland and they had one child, a son called Anthony.<br><br>The Baekeland&#039;s enjoyed a hedonistic lifestyle of wild parties and infidelity until they eventually took to traveling the world- Anthony in tow. The boy wanted for nothing materially but was largely ignored by his self-absorbed parents.<br><br>Barbara finally became very concerned about her son when she discovered he was gay. Anthony had apparently been experimenting with boys from around the age of fourteen. In 1967, when the family was living in Spain, 20-year-old Anthony became involved with a bisexual Australian man, Jake Cooper. Anthony bought his way into Cooper&#039;s circle of drugs, drink, and the occult - and quickly fell in love.<br><br>Barbara was horrified. She tried to get a young French girl Anthony was friendly with to marry him- only for the girl, Sylvie, to run off with Brook. Barbara then decided to ply Anthony with prostitutes, but when this failed too, she hatched a further plan to &quot;cure&quot; him. Just before they separated, she told her husband: &quot;You know, I could get Tony over his homosexuality if I just took him to bed.&quot;<br><br>In 1969, during a holiday in Majorca, she seduced her drunk and high son, later boasting about it to friends.", "filename": "Barbara_Daly_Baekeland", "ext": ".png", "w": 262, "h": 320, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672833499638674, "time": 1672833499, "md5": "8TsWHfQnZksujcqNXfV+5w==", "fsize": 120018, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687781, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71687757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71687757</a><br>He&#039;s the fellow ass masseur like me.<br>In my humble opinion thats a lot and not normal at all.", "time": 1672833729, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687786, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:03:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71687407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71687407</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would never go for a married woman with kids tho and neither should you imo.</span><br>99% of the time I agree, but idk there&#039;s just something about her that makes me want to be a little risky", "time": 1672833807, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687807, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:07:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "so what kind of unhinged derange person is a dad who fucks their daughter<br><br>i can picture son and mom, but...", "time": 1672834047, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687830, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;71687805</span><br>Wait, you arent the guy who massaged his moms ass in tiger stripes thongs?

I need to stop thinking about him so hard, because I realize my heart is pounding and I can&#039;t relax to sleep. <br>It&#039;s become second nature to me to pick apart things with autistic precision to get a little crumb of information about his life. Sometimes I feel like my brain is a living archive of information about him, there&#039;s nobody I know of who is aware of him like I am, or so I tell myself. Everything he&#039;s ever said, done, all dissected by me in every way possible. Everything committed to memory so I can pull it out like a file in a file cabinet at a moment&#039;s notice. <br>Maybe he&#039;d find that creepy. Maybe he&#039;d wonder what I find in him. It&#039;s hard to put into words at times but once I get going I can&#039;t stop, I can&#039;t stop rambling on and on about this rat that&#039;s affected my heart in the very deepest way he possibly could&#039;ve. <br>I imagine his smell, the thought of that musky lavender clouding my brain like brown noise. Even his imagined scent activates something primal in the very deepest parts of my brain I can&#039;t control. I can&#039;t control myself when I think of him. It&#039;s control I&#039;ve never minded losing.<br>I love you Shadow.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

As for &quot;your woman isn&#039;t attracted to you&quot; that&#039;s not true. Simply by virtue of pair-bonding with a virgin woman in marriage, she will naturally develop a chemical love for you which will then by rationalized as an emotional love. The reason women don&#039;t feel this love in the modern day is because they, as a consequence for their desire to produce the strongest offspring, want to be able to have lots and lots of sex with the top guy. In the old pre-social media society, let alone a pre-industrial one, a woman would see her own husband as &quot;the top guy&quot; because she spends most of her time at home or with her husband, alongside the social proof of her family approving of that husband (because it is the duty of her father to vet a good husband for her) all heightens her attraction to her husband with her perception as him being the &quot;top guy&quot;. But now with social media and the normalization of women entering and exiting relationships with greater frequency, women no longer have the ability to be grateful for who they have and perceive him as &quot;the top guy&quot; as they are constantly looking for someone better.<br><br>TLDR; kys roastie", "filename": "bro that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been saying", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 683, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1672788275859203, "time": 1672788275, "md5": "hHwC2m+eVQMDetxcCfV89A==", "fsize": 140372, "resto": 71679785}, {"no": 71680644, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)18:24:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71679785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71679785</a><br>How old are you youngling?", "time": 1672788299, "resto": 71679785}, {"no": 71680689, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)18:28:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71679785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71679785</a><br>Lets see how long this dumb shit will last when society collapses as more and more men are checking out of society.

or nice or anything my gf was, but she could make me cum so that was good enough. anyway, today, i sent my flatmate a bunch of pro-andrew tate stuff, (i didnt know much about him despite she didnt like him - i knew about the sex trafficing but not the rape or stuff with underage girls). and she got so mad she told my gf about us cheating. i dont know how to go back into uni (we are in the same course. a small course of mainly girls). im thinking of switching courses if it is not too late in the year. also, i like randytaylor69, who, if u dont know who she is, randy is an e girl who got popular in her early 20s. apparenttly cus of that, my flatmate suspects im a pedo cus although shes 20-35 in her (non sexual) videos, she looks young. ill randytaylor69 in pic related so u can make ur mind up. flatmate said she looked like a child even when she was mid 30s lol. im kinda worried flatmate will tell her im into young girls even tho the girl im into is 20s-30s lol. so although ive been caught as a cheater, you know what it doesnt bother me as much as i thought it would. the truth is out there now. i feel a sense of calm. i just feel terrible for my (now ex probably) girlfriend, she will feel hurt and i dont know how to make her feel better, so do u have any advice on what i should do next r9k? personally, i will try to move courses. if that is not possible, maybe i will drop out, and still live in accomodation, if that is possible. the degree is useless anyway, and i was hoping to change it next year. now im just biding time till my gf/ex gf messages me. if she wants to

distraught and thats the worse thing. then after that, the awkwardenss of going into course (i take a mini bus with her and about 5 other girls - im a dude btw) and in a small class with about 15 girls, 5 guys. the professors will know too. so im gonna try and stay in uni but switch courses or just drop out entirely. and to make matters worse, my flatmate says she doesnt wanna play minecraft on our server anymore. at least 2023 can only get better for me here onwards, right? reactions would be nice. tell me im based or a peace of shit, i want a reality check now please", "time":
