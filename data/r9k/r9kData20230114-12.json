They&#039;re a reflection of your skills and dedication as a student. In your other post you talked about how you recently realized differences between men and women. Performance in school and the workplace, and how that performance is interpreted, is a big one that most people don&#039;t get.<br><br>Academia and most workplaces tend to reward submission, rote memorization and following instructions/orders. Those are all things typically more suited for women than men. That&#039;s a big reason women tend to do better than men in school and some workplaces. But it&#039;s a mistake to assume those skills translate to intelligence. If you want something truly innovative, profound and deep it will almost always come from a man. Women are very good at memorizing and parroting what they have been told but their academic and professional knowledge is usually shallow and surface level. Men write the script women are memorizing. Men create institutions, women help to keep them running.<br><br>This difference between men and women stems from biology. Female IQ tends to cluster mostly around the 90-110 midwit range while men have more extreme outliers on both ends, meaning more male idiots but also more male geniuses. This doesn&#039;t mean every man is either an idiot or Einstein. There are plenty of male midwits too. But I&#039;d say 80-90% of people who are actually smart are men. Dumb people and midwits and smart people and men and women all have their purposes and need to coexist and work together, so don&#039;t interpret this as a &quot;women bad&quot; or &quot;everyone below X IQ should be purged&quot; rant.

Maybe if whatever you enjoyed about the friendship stops being worth whatever pains you about it.<br>I don&#039;t think you&#039;re shit, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s about finding out you&#039;re shit either.

You could say I consider myself friends with Everyone to a certain degree, but it&#039;s not because I want to keep up my anonymous 4chan persona and be a cool namefag, I don&#039;t like being a namefag.<br>Where is the line between an actual friendship and just a name? Is it when the other person does certain things for you or gives you certain things or you have a close enough channel of communication? The latter might be true, and my standards for a friendship may be very low. I want to consider you a friend because I like you and enjoy experiencing your personality, or what you show of it on the internet, at least. Whatever a friendship means or what forms of interaction and mutual support the two people share, I think that&#039;s different for each pair of people.<br>I don&#039;t consider anyone I know better than you, anon, and I don&#039;t think friends need to be very similar.

I feel like an idiot in public and everything I say feels embarassing. In school, I used to shout &quot;banana!&quot; in the middle of the class to sound cool, very frequently. People didn&#039;t like it to say the least. I just became a more confident guesser and clown. I figured, and read on the internet a lot, that simply appearing confident is almost everything you need to not appear awkward to others when you act in public, and it feels like that&#039;s kinda right.<br>It also helps that the General Public chan has such a cute face.<br>Heh, if our stories are really opposite, it&#039;s kinda funny. I mostly shared it to illustrate how similar different lifes can be, I largely share parts of my life only on the off chance that they could help anons out, otherwise I would have preferred to stay a nobody online.. If you feel comfortable with sharing something about your backstory, and want to, I&#039;ll definetly read it.<br>No, I don&#039;t think it does. I meant it more like &quot;they supported me despite how I treated them&quot;: Maybe I accidentally was nice to them somehow, or they liked having someone who&#039;s there to play videogames and make jokes with, not that that&#039;s wrong or anything.<br>A friendship in my life mostly ends either because they had such a bad influence on me that I needed to artificially cut contact, or because we just stopped talking because of creeping personal and physical distance. However, I don&#039;t consider the latter an ended friendship, and if we reunite after many years, even for a day only, I normally reach out my hand.<br>My friends are amazing not because their friendships never end, but because they&#039;re like you, they clearly see all the things that I hate about myself, but they still give me somewhat of a chance. I&#039;m a joke to myself, and every time someone takes me serious it&#039;s something I don&#039;t feel like I deserve.<br><a href=\"#p71802536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71802536</a><br>basalt, sorry for posting 3d...", "time": 1673598404, "resto": 71782179}, {"no": 71805284, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:38:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sorry for textwalls<br>I want to post the hot dog Earth<br><a href=\"#p71803254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71803254</a><br>Earth chan, to me, is just a human antropomorphisation of Earth.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>wiwiw", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1673685934140266, "time": 1673685934, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hello-anon-need-some-help-a-shoulder-to-cry-on", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 71818065, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:46:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>wiwiw", "time": 1673685994, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71818075, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)03:48:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Previous:<br><a href=\"/r9k/thread/71807267#p71807267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71807267</a> (13.1.23)", "time": 1673686098, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71818618, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)05:25:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71818053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71818053</a><br>I appreciate these threads OP, I hope you never leave but in a good way", "time": 1673691903, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71819053, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)06:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why are you giving terrible advice?", "time": 1673696006, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71819092, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)06:37:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71818053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71818053</a><br>Decent advice but one thing, unless youre an ultrapoorfag you should shower every day and change clothes every day", "time": 1673696270, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71819311, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:12:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71818618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71818618</a><br>Thx for the kind words, Anon.<br>I&#039;ll be here for the foreseeable future.<br>If you ever need someone to listen or to talk to, swing by whenever you feel like it.", "time": 1673698343, "resto": 71818053}, {"no": 71819324, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:13:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71819053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71819053</a><br>I guees I like being terrible at things.<br>Why are you asking stupid questions?", "time": 1673698425, "resto": 71818053}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 71818568, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)05:17:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;my friend jessica told me your a virgin, is that true anon?</span><br><br>How do you react?", "filename": "43EC3050-3088-46ED-82F2-EEFC2E2F5973", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1350, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1673691448638248, "time": 1673691448, "md5": "vUMOqRxvz7ego1950iHQUg==", "fsize": 283355, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "my-friend-jessica-told-me-your-a-virgin-is-that", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 11, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 71818585, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)05:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m pretty sure if a girl knew you were a virgin she wouldn&#039;t talk to you at all", "time": 1673691589, "resto": 71818568}, {"no": 71818621, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)05:25:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71818568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71818568</a><br>&quot;yep&quot;<br>it&#039;s not even that weird at my age and I don&#039;t really care.

Suffering is the whip that strikes the flesh of the weak; catch that blood which falls, gleaming in the sunlight, those drops like red rubies worth their weight in wisdom. If your version of growth is tolerance for the things that keep you weak, content, immobilized as if you were a sessile fungal growth on the side of an immovable tree then its not growth you feel at all: its degeneration and torpor. If you want to suffer mediocrity, do it honestly under the sun; in deep pits under snowcapped peaks, in iron hell, the sound of chains on tortured flesh was not the sound of death at all. Suffering: the deprivation of lifes joy - to keep moving forward, like a comet, towards your goal until you die, and if you are deprived of hate, where is the whip that drives you? Where is the hunger which propels men to walk through arctic tundra and desert lands? Its not suffering at all: its exhilaration. Its exultation. Slip a razor blade under your skin and when you move, remember you&#039;re alive. If your version of happiness is tolerance for things you hate, then I hate you.
