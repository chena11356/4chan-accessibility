Abstract knowledge/concepts, then, are also used by your brain to shape how you sense reality.<br>Interestingly, according to this view, perception and reasoning are both part of the same fundamental process, and rely on the same source (base assumptions, priors, etc.). And, as we talked before, that leads to an important question, namely, where does that source come from? Are they prefabricated in the unconscious (such as with archetypes and Oedipal figures), or implanted and programmed into you from without?<br><br>This also goes back to your original point about intuition, and whether it could be considered a kind of sensing, where the brain maybe has to make sense of unconscious data in a similar top-down manner. <br>I just think that intuition doesn&#039;t operate on &quot;priors&quot; in the same way that the other functions do, hence why it risks erupting into schizophrenia.

She never liked it when she had limbs, her muscle mass made it hard for her to keep afloat, and with her body now resembling a pebble she feared she&#039;d just sink like one too. But with other exercise opportunities cut off (literally), it seemed like the best way to keep herself in shape, so she had to at least try. Besides, she already bought a new swimsuit.<br>It only took one dip for a revelation to come through. Both muscle and bone are denser than water, buoyancy comes mostly from cavities and fat in the torso, and since she was entirely torso now she found herself effortlessly floating on the surface. A serene feeling she&#039;d never experienced before, absolute relaxation. <br>Lying on water is nice, she thought, but not much of an exercise, so after 10 minues of soaking she got onto it. On third try she found the right motion to flip herself over, and with torso undulations that came to her intuitively she started moving. By normal people&#039;s standards it was slow, but for her, it turned out water provided freedom of movement far beyond what her abbreviated body had on land. It was hard work, but that too was exactly what she was after. <br>Long story short, going to the pool became a part of little Avril&#039;s daily routine.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>WRWR", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675853526733921, "time": 1675853526, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 72144459, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)05:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>WRWR", "time": 1675853575, "resto": 72144449}, {"no": 72144631, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:14:06", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72144449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72144449</a><br>Hello anon, it seems to me that my short burst of happiness I had experienced over past 2 days finally came to the end. At first i thought this time it would be different, this time I was a new me, I had a meaning, a destination point in life, but as expected, I soon started feeling uneasy, because I was still myself. Why is it I am so uneasy when I`m happy? Is it because of its novelty? Is it because I fear something unexpected will occur out nowhere and ruin everything? Or am I just afraid it will not last long? I honestly think it`s the latter. <br>Of course I understand that nothing here is forever, but I`m greedy and I want this happy feeling last until i die. Should I just shut the fuck up and accept that our world isnt convenient like that? <br><br>But at least I now have more inspiration to write.", "filename": "sato laptop", "ext": ".gif", "w": 207, "h": 156, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1675854846856002, "time": 1675854846, "md5": "MW478wUeTnQuCdUilKVPZg==", "fsize": 412172, "resto": 72144449}, {"no": 72144651, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:18:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72144449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72144449</a><br>fucking schizo threads, stop doing them", "time": 1675855106, "resto": 72144449}, {"no": 72145119, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)07:24:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72144631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72144631</a><br>I feel that your anxiety over possibly loosing that feeling is only half of the story.

I can&#039;t think of anything other than playing sports and going to therapy, though i doubt either would have made much difference. Playing sports sounds like the next best thing to be properly socialized after being cared for in early childhood. I should have opened up about my first break up to a close friend or an adult i trusted. I feel like bottling that up for years did me no good. Should have gotten away from my mother and father. Gotten a job and moved in with a friend. Gone to music high school to take piano seriously. Should have stick to programming on my spare time and majored in computer science instead of physics. Should have learned to foster whatever few friendships i somehow managed to have.

I&#039;m old. But right after college when I was making like 11 or 12 bucks an hour is when I was getting the most sniz. I had tons of college loan debt and the bumper was falling off my car and I lived in my step dad&#039;s basement for 7 years with no windows. But in those 7 years I had 4 girlfriends. Eventually I worked my way out and got my own place. I&#039;m currently meeting 61k a year which isn&#039;t amazing but it&#039;s double what I made when I was getting laid. I haven&#039;t had a gf since I moved out into my own apartment. I have no debt, I worked through the whole so called pandemic. I don&#039;t drink or do drugs, but at the end of the day, I&#039;m just not meeting women. <br><br>So the point is you shouldn&#039;t wait. You should just strike while the iron is hot. If girls want to fuck you, duck as many as you can and figure out all that other stuff as you go.<br><br>Another example I could give is that I bought a project car. I found this car for 400 bucks on Craigslist back in 2019. My dad said I could just use his garage until I get my own place. If I had waited I still wouldn&#039;t have a project car. It would be 4 years of not having the thing I want. <br><br>I want my own house with a garage but I can&#039;t afford one. So I just said fuck it, bought it anyway and it&#039;s worked out fine. Actually in this car it&#039;s great that I have an excuse to hang out with my dad and have something to do. <br><br>If you waite to but a house before you meet a girl, you&#039;ll be single forever. Our generation can&#039;t afford houses. I&#039;m sorry but I have 84kk in the bank and no debt maybe 61 per year and my best friend is a realtor. He said the bank would only approve me for 200k. You can&#039;t but a fucking house where I live for 200k. It doesn&#039;t exist. <br><br>And again I don&#039;t have bad habits. I don&#039;t do drugs or go on expensive vacations or gamble. I&#039;m not voting my money on anything.

One member of the duo - the &quot;straight man&quot;, &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;dead wood&quot;, or stooge - is often portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other one - the funny man, &quot;banana man&quot;, or comic - is portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. When the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other is often referred to as a comic foil. The term &quot;feed&quot; comes from the way a straight man sets up jokes and then &quot;feeds&quot; them to his partner. Despite the names often given to the roles, the straight man is not always humorless, nor is it always the comic who provides the act&#039;s humor. Sometimes the straight man gets laughs through sarcastic reactions to the comic&#039;s antics, such as Stewart Lee&#039;s deadpan, reasoned reactions to Richard Herring&#039;s ridiculous antics in their pairing. When the straight man serves no specific comic purpose, but acts as a device to make the comic look good, he is known as a stooge.</span>", "time": 1675842342, "resto": 72143079}, {"no": 72143227, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)02:51:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72143181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72143181</a><br>Is this an AI post?
