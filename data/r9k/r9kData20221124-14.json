Women selecting for tall men with big dicks is dysgenic as the size of the baby increases and is more likely to die in childbirth. Tall men also die earlier and are more prone to various kinds of cancers as well as back problems and joint problems. Fisherian runway is the name of the phenomenon where women select for useless traits. <br><br>An example is the Irish Elk which is now extinct. Female elk would select for males with extremely and excessively large antlers, sometimes weighing more than 50lbs. <br><br>However these antlers were cumbersome, heavy, impractical and ultimately useless. Regardless, the females were attracted to these huge antlers and would only mate with these large antlered animals. So many of the large antlered animals got caught in trees, tangled in vines or died of exhaustion that they went extinct.<br><br>Excessively large dicks are another useless evolutionary trait. There is no proof large penises are any better at impregnating women than smaller ones. Large penises also are worse at filling fully with blood which makes them softer and floppier. Black men and white men have the largest dicks but also the highest rates of erectile dysfunction. <br><br>Societies with short men with small dicks are actually a good indicator that male sexual selection prevails and that the society is not cucked. <br><br>Thanks for reading.", "filename": "750ECD46-A13A-4CB3-9768-636CBE3B2D77", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1712, "h": 1736, "tn_w": 246, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1669318444444755, "time": 1669318444, "md5": "u0wKqkdjLEOBYJxx4Ul7Vw==", "fsize": 926621, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-fisherian-runway-and-why-female-sexual", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 8, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 71115596, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:47:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71115455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71115455</a><br>Thanks.

I wasn&#039;t expecting much besides another day when the sun rose and fell again. At least that&#039;s how it&#039;s felt for the past 11 years. Last time I was excited about my birthday it was 13 since I really liked that number and after I didn&#039;t really care since no other number held any significance to me. I&#039;ve always been alone on my birthday since I never really pestered people about it and my family would just buy a cheap cake from sainsbury and give me some presents like money to spend. This year was different. My family got evicted from their home and so I was living with my aunt who I hate more than sin. They all left for a trip to Turkey and so I was alone at home which I enjoyed until the deafening silence overcame me. My little brother and sister came over to visit which is something I never really cared about since I didn&#039;t grow up in a super intimate family like that but that day really got to me. I have no friends and only come home to an empty quiet house everyday after work or college classes. They visited and we went out for a walk and talked and I made me realise I loved my family. We had a great time chatting gossiping and just communing. It wasn&#039;t until they left and the silence hit me again and I realised how alone I am. The silence of the house, no lack of notifications on me phone, the sounds of people outside my house in the streets of London with their friends enjoying life drinking and laughing. I fucking broke me but not as much as the next day morning. I woke up and I had another realisation. A realisation of how much of my life I&#039;ve wasted, how I focused so much on being a character as opposed to making friends, how I was always lazy and never worked hard.

I have many strange quirks and mannerisms and things I call &quot;hard locks&quot;. Basically things I do that I don&#039;t deviate from. Like I don&#039;t eat sandwiches and no chips. I don&#039;t ever brush my teeth and then get dressed. I always get dressed and then brush my teeth. Just weird stuff like that. If I don&#039;t do certain things routinely I suffer from like a weird feeling of immense bad luck. Anyway, is it possible that I actually am autistic? If so... is it worth even getting diagnosed?

Others, it&#039;s simply in their financial interest to try and derail one of the wealthiest men in the world and his companies, especially if you are a competitor.<br><br>the hit campaign against him started in earnest during the rescue of the people stuck in the Thai cave. he had been vocal on Twitter and shit before this, and this was what gave the media more ammo to shoot at him. Around the same time is when Musk started tweeting about who runs the press, and talking about increasing censorship and media/tech industry bias (especially post-Trump). ~2018<br><br>Musk is also an attention-whore. Some of the criticism is deserved, but people like to berate some successful celebrity out of a strange sense of resentment or to distract from their own shitty lives. Controlled opposition or a rogue agent who doesn&#039;t go along with those in power. Ideology pushes people to extremes, especially when near-infinite money is involved.
