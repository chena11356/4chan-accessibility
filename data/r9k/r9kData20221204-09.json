The answer: to instill in a pavlovian fashion obedience to the dispensation of food where the subject is akin to automatic economic livestock. Physical shopping acts as a &#039;tic&#039; that reinforces obedience to the aisle structure, which imbeds deep in consciousness a spatial awareness oriented toward narrow column like heuristics, rather than vast memory palaces. People are conditioned by the oppressive nature of the aisles over multiple generations not to steal food because they are convinced by the salvific sensibility of the aisle and it&#039;s larp memory retrieval. Supermarkets have been prototype amazon data centers. Shoppers and their items are neurons. Time is measured with some kind of calculus between passing the door and calculating the items at the checkout.
