May you finally be free. And if you want to find out what awaits you on the other side then unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife. So paradise literally awaits you now. As one NDEr said, being in the light of heaven is like every molecule of your body is each individually having the best orgasm of your life times a billion. Literally and not an exaggeration. And it never ends.<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening as you realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness.

He&#039;s also lazy irl he&#039;s been dragging his studies out for years but I don&#039;t blame him because I&#039;d totally do the same thing and kinda did. I&#039;m a bit older than he is. He&#039;s so witty and funny he can be kinda a bitch to people because he plays little mind games and makes fools out of them. Sometimes people don&#039;t even realize he&#039;s mocking them. He&#039;s super self aware sometimes he does kinda silly or cringe things be he totally owns it and does it just because it&#039;s fun and it is fun I like being silly in the same way too but I&#039;m way too shy. When he&#039;s intimate though it makes my heart totally melt he&#039;s so vulnerable deep down I wish I could be his bedrock.

He&#039;s super stylish though he has such a great eye for colors he always stands out postively wherever he is. He likes to sing and I love hearing it sometimes we sing together and it makes me so happy I want to fly. He can&#039;t always hit the high notes but hearing him try is even better than if he could do it easily he&#039;s really singing from his heart and I love it so much. It&#039;s always awkward when I try and start talking to him but when we do talk we have such good long conversations and I get lost in his thoughts it&#039;s wonderful. I hope I keep his interest too I figure I must since he reaches out to me and he has plenty of other options but he&#039;s always so cool about it I can never really read him. He is a bit bipolar so he&#039;ll flip hot and cold and I&#039;m ok with that I just wish I knew where I stood.

Most people from Japan are very polite, so they&#039;ll probably help you out without a second thought, so don&#039;t be afraid to ask around. You can learn informal Japanese and get around, anime is pretty accurate to the language, even if it can sound juvenile, it&#039;s kind of like if some European guy came to America, and started talking like characters from cartoons, that would be excusable since English wasn&#039;t his first language. Japanese is not too much different in that context.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bring appropriate outlet ports, you&#039;ll need those.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make sure to have currency exchanges taken care of, you want to have some yen.

Thanks for picking up the phone when I was saying goodbye as I was sure I was about to die even though I didnt tell you. You betrayed me though. You didnt realize how amazing I am and how I did everything in the world for you. I pushed myself past the breaking point and I never gave up. I was always there for you and always believed in you. Even when you betrayed me and lied to me I still believed in you. Too bad you didnt realize how strong I am. I endured everything even losing you which is the hardest thing that will ever happen to me. I was even biochemically tortured and I still stood back up. I used to think that you made me strong, but it was really me. I&#039;m the great thing, not you. I always hoped you would be and I did it all to lift you up to my level but you gave up on yourself and our future. I forgive you and accept that youre gone and you won&#039;t ever be good enough for me and who I&#039;ve become. You didnt deserve me then and you definitely don&#039;t now. Letting who you could have been and who that was to me go was nearly impossible, but I did it. All that was left was the reality of who you really were and that empty shell of who you really are means nothing to me. Im disappointed in how abusive and unloving you were. I&#039;ll always love that ghost of you that I never got to meet. I feel bad for you because you might one day realize all this and it will destroy you because it destroyed me and im infinitely stronger than you are and unlike my story there&#039;s no happy ending in yours so you have my pity. Shes abusing you now and youre taking it because youre a sad broken person. You gave up me, your friends, your world for this psychopath. This was the worst mistake of your life.

I know you know I would make you happier than him, yet you stay addicted to his bullshit. I genuinely feel more hate to you than any sort of affection most of the time, but I still find myself crawling back for your attention. I don&#039;t know what part of me is the reasonable one, I think I&#039;m consumed by my selfish feelings but I think it&#039;s okay to indulge in them in these parts. The other girls don&#039;t seem to hit the same, and that frustrates me till no end. I&#039;m bitter, and I accept it. I&#039;m gonna grow though, and you&#039;re gonna stay stagnant with that loser. I&#039;m gonna figure my shit out, and I will try everything in my power to cleanse my mind of you. We don&#039;t choose who we love, and I guess that screwed both of us over. I can&#039;t stand how spineless and a pushover you are. I hate that you are scared to express what you really want and how you really feel about things. I hate how judgmental you are, and how you pretend how you aren&#039;t doing anything wrong by doing that. I find it so pathetic how you worship and glorify that little loser excuse for a man you call a bf. I hate how reserved and cowardly you are about everything, you expect so much to be done for you. I hate how you think you know how to introspect but all you dwell on is blind self hate and reveling in being a victim. I can&#039;t believe you made me confirm these fucked up beliefs of femininity being equal to weakness, when there are so many girls who truly are competent and interesting and morally upstanding. I hate how my broken heart ignores them and stays stuck on your stupid ass. You genuinely don&#039;t have an ounce of self respect, and I despise how that reflects on me being here for you all this time. You got better when I left though, so it really was my mistake wasting my time, not really your fault at the end of the day.

some retard emotional and philosophical revelations i had about my problems, and that i was going to manage them with stimulant use.<br><br>some wise anon who seemed to have had a terrible history with stimulant or other hard drug abuse dug into me and did all of the correct things in order to scare me whilst in my altered state and warn me about the danger of addiction i was diving into head-first into. he refused to engage with my silly delusions or my fake, stimulant-induced good faith responses (i guess since its fake good i should say bad), and scared me enough to dump out all of the benzedrex i had left even though i had planned on not using again after that (because i thought i would have a steady supply of adderall instead, which is less harmful than propylhexedrine).<br><br>anyway, for reasons that would take awhile to explain, that event not too many days ago led me to find out that i have OCD, specifically a subtype Existential OCD which includes obsessions over existential/philosophical topics along with the absolute inability to tolerate uncertainty that characterizes OCD. i thought that my dysfunctional pacing around and &#039;thinking&#039; about the meaning of life for, at worst up to 6 hours but usually 1-2hrs a day was just my neurotic personality, but it turns out that its a neurotic pathology. go figure.<br><br>as can probably be figured from my writing, i am still taking stimulants and i must disappoint the anon that tried to get me to hard stop. i am not yet dependent, but that day will probably come soon-- thank you for trying to warn me, and i echo the warning to all others even though i have not fallen apart yet. i know now that my behavior and desire to use is an addiction, and for what it&#039;s worth i no longer deny that. im sorry to that anon, who probably remembers me if you&#039;re here.", "time": 1676289740, "resto": 72200880}, {"no": 72209386, "now":

mental problems prevent me from being productive. the OCD compulsions prevent me from enjoying things even when i am not compulsively performing them, since i am still obsessing about them.<br><br>i can&#039;t say it is only the OCD, because i have other problems too. the fact is that i have tried over the past few years very strongly to get my life together, but it continues to stay broken because i simply am not strong enough to do the right thing. this is not a justification for my use, this is an admission of weakness. an admission i probably would not be able to make if, as the previously mentioned anon had pointed out to me last time i stimposted, i wasn&#039;t extremely high on a drug that directly fires up my reward system.<br><br>my stimulant use has thus far made me able to be productive for time periods, certainly, however i recognize now that the main draw is of course how it just makes me feel good. one of the chilling things this anon said to me was something along the lines of &quot;with a high enough dose, you could receive news that would kill you with despair if you were sober, but still smile because your brain is all lit up from the drug&quot;. that was a truth i felt then enough to scare me to flush all of my retard-drug last time, and it is something i feel now. the OCD is still there while I am on stimulants, but it no longer inspires terrible agony inside of me. the drug cuts off the pain before it gets too deep and disables me, and it replaces it with that electric dopaminergic warmth. that is what i am addicted to, i suppose.<br><br>so, to anybody wondering about trying strong stimulants, i recommend you don&#039;t if you have bad mental problems (everybody on /r9k/) that you would like to be able to be free of. i liked what louis ck

but from what i gather there is addiction and there is hopeless addiction.<br><br>the first category seems to be filled with people who stay strongly in denial about their addiction but eventually come to terms with their behavior and understand that they are addicted, and try to beat the addiction. it seems that in many cases this takes time, and perhaps many fail, but they want to be helped and do stuff like go to rehab and try to be sober and whatnot<br><br>the second category seems to be filled with the people who, whether they are in denial or not, simply don&#039;t want to stop. they have no desire to stop-- i think these people often tend to be the ones to have nothing left to go back to when sober. they are the ones that don&#039;t want to be helped<br><br>i think i fall into this latter category. no doubt heartache and tears awaits me down this dark road i am staring down, but i think the fact is that i have nothing that makes me want to quit. if i stop doing stimulants i go back to the same life where most days i can&#039;t even get out of bed, where any productivity comes with the immense toll of fighting off my compulsions and ruminations, with the same pains over my own past events. even on stimulants, i still perform compulsions, but i am able to get some things done. i wrote about 4,000 words today. i have been studying mathematics again. but, again, mostly, the stimulants reduce the mental suffering that paralyzes me on most days sober. i don&#039;t choose addiction, even if i made the choices that lead to it. i just don&#039;t want to quit and i

However, I do believe that it is, in fact, GROBDEUTSCHLAND (because it is spelled that way, with the german B, on my paradox games) I do wish to learn though(have not started yet due to low motivation levels), as I feel that relate very well with the german spirit. Additionally, although I don&#039;t have any concrete evidence, but I believe that at least a few of my forefathers have been german immigrants(I live in an area where that&#039;s a possibility, some germans have settled here in search of a better life), which would explain quite a lot. You see, I never quite fitted in with the my current nation of residence (people would often make fun of me for having many faux pas, which I attribute to my inner germanic spirit of being more direct and to the point), and after doing some soul searching I believe that the germanic ethos describes me the most of all.<br>I think in the future, when I am proficient at speaking, I would very much like to move to DEUTSCHLAND. I would love to see the beautiful beloved fatherland, and live somewhere in a small bavaria village, where I will marry a traditional aryan goddess who will birth many wonderful germanic children. <br>But until then, auf wiedersehen mein Bruder!

She would be commanded to obey her brothers&#039; and sisters&#039; every command. <br><br>Sexual favors, however, were *not* some of those commands. She knew it, and yet when the virgin Prince ordered her to service him she reluctantly obliged. The incestuous affair continued until, in his teenage naivety, the Prince knocked up his twin. <br><br>This enraged his father when he found out that his General&#039;s long-promised gift wife was spoiled and no longer a virgin. In his rage he ordered her to be executed and the Prince to be castrated and given to the General as a eunuch in compensation. <br><br>The Prince, who genuinely loved his sister, was so enraged at the sight of her beheading that he challenged his father to an honor duel, staying his punishment and, in the eyes of all who saw it, choosing instead a painful death in the ring. <br><br>We all know what happened next, when the teenage Prince bested the Emperor and drove a sword through his father&#039;s spine, so the legend need not be told here.", "filename": "blob_https___waifus.nemusona.com_0c2f18a4-9dbb-4945-ba8c-13ba000ff289", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676450669390323, "time": 1676450669, "md5": "drte54M0xM6Pe1EJxMf8Vg==", "fsize": 295327, "resto": 72233703}, {"no": 72236027, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:45:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72235976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72235976</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cowgirl</span><br>yours can wear whatever she wants and i wont complain. just noticed that half the time i get animal ears but the position is consistent", "filename": "blob https __waifus.nemusona.com_3e7111e4-4633-4df3-ab07-2e6ebd846dd7(1)", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676450749624860, "time": 1676450749, "md5": "eNb6euBQM7kYdE+8TNOUwQ==", "fsize": 320868, "resto": 72233703}, {"no": 72236033, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:46:23", "name": "Harem World", "com": "<a href=\"#p72235984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72235984</a><br>Im running out of inspiration and enthusiasm for my world, but I like your girl.
