Halfway while doing that, I suddenly thought about my recently deceased close friend, who had killed himself just a month ago. Since I live in a toxic household, my dad started to piss me off with his words, saying that my friend is never coming back and that I should stop thinking about him. While stating the obvious, his words didn&#039;t help and left me very enraged. I decided to leave the house instead of starting a very violent domestic dispute.<br><br>While I was out, I decided to call the hotline and vented angrily to the woman on the line. I had decided to walk a huge loop around my area and while I was on the phone, halfway through the call she hung up on me. Whatever. As soon as that happened, literally 10 minutes after she hung up, 3 cop cars pulled up on me, with 4 cops having their hands on their waist, like I was ready to pull out a weapon. It was a dramatic night. Eventually, after a worthwhile conversation, they decided to take me to a mental health facility where other people were staying at. I ended up spending the night there and left the next day, feeling dead hungover and rather annoyed.<br><br>So moral of the story?

If you are willing to grasp the hand given to you, then hope isn&#039;t yet lost. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br><br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1670745295361128, "time": 1670745295, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikaku", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 10, "images": 5, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 71350517, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)04:07:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71349940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71349940</a><br>Good morning, anon. Nice to see your again. WIll these threads be a daily thing?<br>Yesterday before going to sleep i brushed my teeth for the first time in a few months, then went to bed at 11 pm, thats much earlier than my usual 2-3 am. I woke up at 5 am and i actually feel rested now.I brushed my teeth, swept all rooms in the house and now i`m gonna prepare for uni exams. Then i might clean the guitar and rework that song from the previous thread.<br><br>In the previous thread you also mentioned &quot;negative intrusive thoughts&quot;. Of course i have them, about this whole thing that this is an act, a cope etc. But what were these negative thoughts in the beginning? I wasnt a total failure. But then i started calling myself one and I believed in the lie. I started neglecting health, studies, relationships etc. And the truth is that i`m still not a total failure. I just made myself believe that i`m. And I can make myself believe that it`s not over for me and that i will be happy. All other things around me can be fixed too. Of course it doesnt feel right telling myself this but it also didnt feel right when i started calling myself a total failure because i wasnt one. I just need to believe that its going to be alright and continue doing right things. I hope you get it what i meant by this schizo mumbling<br><a href=\"#p71350267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71350267</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a literal child who&#039;s still experiencing the world</span><br>uh, thats me. i`m still only 18 and i havent tried much.<br><a href=\"#p71350204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71350204</a><br>i wish i could record a vocaroo but i live with parents and a sick grandma.

And yes a regular sleep cycle is very important, as another Anon mentioned 2 days ago.<br> Having a morning ritual helps alot to get into gear, get some momentum going, which makes further daily activities that much easier. Humans are kind of like cars in that sense.<br><br>I&#039;ll use the path analogy again. Your mind is like a forest or a rocky plateu and your thoughts are peoole wqlking through the forest, or a river spilling atop the plateu.<br>Over time pathways will form/the rock will be carved and a riverbed forms.<br><br>Once these paths are establiahed it it very easy to find them, to navigatw them, which can be good, behaviour and knowledgevthat is so deeply engraindd that you can recall it whenever you want withou effort.<br>But it also has drawbacks. You will always use these paths, instead of forming new ones, and with each use they become even more prominent and harder to ignore.<br>In the case of a depressive mind this is especially damaging. You could say you are depressive because you revisit the same selfdepricating, demoralizing pathways over and over, and becaude you are depressive it becomes that much harder to leave them.<br>Its a negative feedback loop between mind and body.<br><br>Where did they originally come from? I can only guess for now, since finding out specific sources would require alot of talking, alot of remembering, lots of backtracking of your life.<br>My guess would be negative voices coming from the outside in your formative years, childhood and puberty. Spending lots of time on here during those years would be an example. Your identity is very malleable at that point and so you absorb the toxic waste on here like a sponge.
