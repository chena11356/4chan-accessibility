That&#039;s how I&#039;d imagine incest should be viewed. It&#039;s natural, but shouldn&#039;t be encouraged particularly, just accepted as part of normal sexuality. It definitely shouldn&#039;t be illegal, there is nothing actually wrong with consenting adults having sex, even when they&#039;re related. It will always happen, and it would be better if there wasn&#039;t a need to hide it.<br>Maybe like thirty years from now it will be normal, but just sort of weird, to get married with your single mom. I could see it happening again, if it was like that before too. People are clearly able to accept that happening.

There are no other options. Either you deal with it or die miserably hated by everyone. You wish to continue down that path?<br>After that you could start to work on that trauma. There is lucky chance that all those psychotic traits you got originate from trauma and once major part of that trauma is dealt with those psychotic symptoms also begin to cease but your mom also shows those symptoms it&#039;s not very good sign.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;place where incel killers gather</span><br>lmao.

I&#039;m not very well read on philosophy to be honest I am a total amateur I need to read a lot, a lot more.<br><br>Not to say that everyone is as enlightened as the Buddha but to some extent for a mentally well person, I think &quot;being&quot; comes naturally. I think a harder thing to figure out is &quot;doing&quot; - or rather HOW to do (not why - its been said previously ITT but the answer to what is the meaning of life is simply: to live). Being and Doing are my Yin and Yang.", "time": 1673509227, "resto": 71779808}, {"no": 71792942, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)02:41:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71792934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71792934</a><br>sorry I got kind of off track of spiritually ranking drugs. is anyone reading this? i don&#039;t really care that much, its fun even just to write.

I&#039;d consider someone old when they turn 40, but not 30. I often think people who project these ideas that any life stage beyond your early twenties being worthless, are either teens that don&#039;t have a lot of life experience and make massive judgements over what little notion they have about growing up, or adults in that age that romanticize their teens and twenties because it was a happier time in their lives (whether they miss the free time, the energy, or experiencing certain things for the first time). Society as a whole also romanticizes teens and young adults as the only good time you&#039;ll ever have in your life, so I understand why many people share the belief that anything beyond 25 is garbage.<br><br>Anyways, I skimmed through the conversation and I only saw people pretty much projecting their frustrations about being &quot;old fucks&quot; and not having their life together, so I believe that&#039;s the root of the problem here.

For those anons, I only want to say one thing: succumbing to peer pressure will make everyone everyone happy... except yourself. Yeah, people will always demand you do things in order to satisfy ages-old societal expectations (that may be even harder to fulfill as time goes by), but your own happiness should be what ultimately matters.

The order betrays the Upanisadic reasoning. Things are impermanent, i.e., ever-changing, and by that token they are not satisfactory, and by that token they cannot be the atman.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The third hallmark is very often mistranslated (sometimes by me too, in the past) as &quot;not having a self or essence&quot;. That is indeed how later Buddhists came to interpret it, but that was not its original meaning - in fact, it is doubly misleading. Both Pali grammar 14 and a comparison with the Vedanta show that the word means &quot;is not atman&quot; rather than &quot;does not have atman&quot;. Comparison with the Vedanta further shows that the translation &quot;self&quot; is appropriate, as the reference is to living beings. However, as time went by the term was taken as a possessive compound and also taken to refer to everything, so that it became the one-word expression of the Buddha&#039;s anti-essentialism.</span><br>https://archive.org/details/WhatThe<wbr>BuddhaThought/page/n85/mode", "filename": "1d5199fe52fd1255118e3c1342b5fdfea7f97070", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 869, "h": 1205, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673499949146327, "time": 1673499949, "md5": "udh76sCkPTTMrB3JlDR6Mg==", "fsize": 977300, "resto": 71789959}, {"no": 71791859, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:16:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71791073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71791073</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about men then?</span><br>Yeah, what about &#039;em?

Contributions can be made by making sure my kids are taken care of, the environment is clean, food is well made, finding a safe place for our children to go so we can spend an evening alone, increase my status by paying only me attention when there are other men around, taking time to listen and understand my thoughts/feelings, make my life easier. <br><br>If you&#039;ve access to a credit card with a $25k line and know that it automatically gets paid off whenever you spend anything then using that to make our life better in ways that I don&#039;t understand or have time for is infinitely better than making money to pay for dinner. <br><br>*working meaning a job by an employer that pays money, if you want to do amazon FBA, or blog or whatever and it makes money fine I&#039;m proud of you, but once a household has over a certain threshold of assets money becomes worthless.

I focus entirely on my career to try and numb myself from the pain, but my boss is a dick head. Honestly Doc I don&#039;t even know what I do anymore, I don&#039;t think my boss knows he just knows that he has power over me and I think that makes him happy. I&#039;ve been mulling over how I should kill myself for months, but I don&#039;t want to leave my poor dog all alone in this cruel hard world with no one to feed it. I don&#039;t even know where to turn to or what I should do anymore.<br>The doctor says, &gt;Wow moth that&#039;s really terrible, you sound troubled, but I&#039;m a podiatrist what you need a Psychologist to help sort out your life, how come you came here?<br>The moth finishes up, &gt;The light was on", "time": 1673584971, "resto": 71789959}, {"no": 71803331, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:45:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71803200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71803200</a><br>Yeah idk shit tea bee eightch.

She was a hypocrite to the core about everything. She&#039;s sit around trying to become an influencer, which she had the looks for but was &quot;too proud&quot; to do anything that would actually pander to people so her career never took off while she mooched off of my money, spent our together time on her phone trying to &quot;grow her influence&quot;, but got angry that I&#039;d spend time out with the lads. She was really possessive and hated me having female friends but in the ONE job she had she left with like 5 guy friends, all weird little manlets too. I never understood it. The second I make friends with a single 9/10 model she starts losing her shit, gets jealous, threatens to leave me so I decide that I&#039;m going to just ignore her. The pandemic happens and she starts pretty obviously emotionally cheating on me so I break up with her, get a new girlfriend and she loses her shit once again. We get back together because I was stupid, we move to Japan together and everything gets infinitely worse now she thinks I want to run off and marry every woman here (since they&#039;re Asian). At this point she&#039;s an extremely miserable thing to me and I send her the online divorce papers and now we&#039;re separated fully and I&#039;m dating her worst nightmare - a big titty Japanese girl. She did this to herself, I would have been happy if she was actually a good wife.

True suffering comes from being a loser without any redeeiming qualities. The sayings about misery and suffering being markers of a deep thinker is just intellectual masturbation. They want to corner the misery market and own it because the boring everyday suffering of some wretched wagie obviosuly can&#039;t compare to the lofty eloquent musings of their endowed brain. They have the intellectual firepower and the energy (from not being miserable) to run cicles around real losers.<br>A lsoer wouldn&#039;t have the skills to sylize and market their misery through music, drawings, writings, etc. The loser likely has indulged in an excess of passive entertainment at a young and vulnerable age because nobody cared enough about him to guide and help him. Passive entertainment like the internet and television had already hijacked the kid&#039;s shirt term dopamine feedback loops, forever fucking up the reward center (along with porn, goyslop and the rest). He&#039;ll be aimless with zero discipline so no skills will be retained and soon enough that kid will be an adult.

Given C&#039;s previous letters, I&#039;m inclined to believe you (J) are a biological male and that C is a female. I am also inclined to believe that things between you two are incredibly rocky and that they need to be sorted out.<br><br>A theme I&#039;m seeing is that C wants you but you either do or don&#039;t want her. What I&#039;m picking up from this is that J has severed all ties with C in an attempt to separate himself from her in any way possible, HOWEVER, we know for a fact that you two are working together at the same buisness and therefore are seeing eachother numerous times a week. It is my professional opinion that you two should get on a call together and just sort everything out. <br><br>J, you coming on this board and teasing her (aswell as posting stuff like this <a href=\"#p71799846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71799846</a> ) is no good for her mental health. Maybe you&#039;re mad at her, maybe you have some vendetta against her, I have no idea what the hell is going on aside from what I&#039;ve seen in the threads for the past two weeks, but you need to call her and straighten it out.<br><br>Of course, I could be completely wrong, and J is just here to make sure he has someone for when his relationship goes south. We know that he has a girlfriend from C&#039;s previous threads, and the way that you keep coming on here to seemingly mock her for wanting to be with you (either romantically or platonically), And by doing so are actively initiating contact with her and emotionally harassing her so that by the time your relationship dries up, she&#039;ll be waiting here for you arms open to help you move on.<br><br>Whatever the scenario is with you, it&#039;s clear you don&#039;t have her best interests in mind, and your continued posting on here after cutting contact is doing her no favours, it&#039;s almost as though you&#039;re getting a kick outta - 1/2", "filename": "download (15)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673581410835995, "time": 1673581410, "md5": "HK2Zc459r/W6yRVjO99w7A==", "fsize": 9738, "resto": 71765471}, {"no": 71802742, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:43:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71802729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71802729</a><br>magic 8 ball says yes absolutely", "time": 1673581436, "resto": 71765471}, {"no": 71802766, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:46:06", "name": "A", "com": "<a href=\"#p71802659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71802659</a><br>EWWW YOU?

As much as you want him back, he may never come back, but I do believe you two should make atleast some attempt at talking to one another, even if it&#039;s you telling your supervisor at work that you have drama going on and need time to make some form of ammends on company time to make sure it won&#039;t affect you so bad. From what you have also said, it seems like J may also be hurting a bit on the inside, so it doesn&#039;t seem like the worst thing in the world. In my humble opinion, you should be less giving with your letters to him from now on, as they tend to place him in a position above you when in reality you two are on even ground. The more you let on you want him, the more leverage he has against you. I sincerely hope that you two are able to reconsile and come back together, not even as lovers, being friends or just plain coworkers that text occasionally isn&#039;t the worst thing in the world.<br><br>Of course, I am nothing more than an outsider looking in. However, I can tell that if this goes on for much longer, the results won&#039;t be pretty on either end. J, if you do want to sever ties, atleast be polite and talk it over with her. Besides, you can&#039;t avoid eachother at work, so just suck it up for now and be nice to her, even if you hate it, work is just 8 hours out of the day, if you&#039;re mean to her now while you still somehow know her, you&#039;ll end up regretting it in the long run. This actually happened to me and a former coworker, but that&#039;s besides the point, all I&#039;m saying is that I speak from experience. C, you seem to have a lot to give, and I can tell that you miss this fella a lot.

During my time there I only remember a handful of black kids, maybe 4-5 east Indian and Pakistani kids. Unfortunately most of the black kids were the acting-out, future criminal types, but the ones who weren&#039;t seemed to get along well, and were treated just like anyone else. The area was/is pretty liberal and people were pretty chill and accepting in general.<br>Life was pretty good, honestly, though I myself was depressed and struggling in school. But in general, pretty good. Nobody worried about school shooters back then. No one had cellphones obviously. No social media. Internet was barely a thing. I&#039;d go over to friends&#039; houses after school and we&#039;d play basketball or computer/video games, or hang out and watch 90s cartoons like Animaniacs.<br>Most kids dressed pretty 90s normcore, but grunge/alternative music and fashion definitely had some influence too, as did skater fashion. There were definitely a few cute alternative girls who dressed in thriftstore clothes that I had crushes on.

Mainstream liberalism focuses on pragmatic, evidence based policy over rigid ideology.

Maybe if whatever you enjoyed about the friendship stops being worth whatever pains you about it.<br>I don&#039;t think you&#039;re shit, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s about finding out you&#039;re shit either.

You could say I consider myself friends with Everyone to a certain degree, but it&#039;s not because I want to keep up my anonymous 4chan persona and be a cool namefag, I don&#039;t like being a namefag.<br>Where is the line between an actual friendship and just a name? Is it when the other person does certain things for you or gives you certain things or you have a close enough channel of communication? The latter might be true, and my standards for a friendship may be very low. I want to consider you a friend because I like you and enjoy experiencing your personality, or what you show of it on the internet, at least. Whatever a friendship means or what forms of interaction and mutual support the two people share, I think that&#039;s different for each pair of people.<br>I don&#039;t consider anyone I know better than you, anon, and I don&#039;t think friends need to be very similar.

Affection is when she falls asleep with her head on your chest because she thinks of you as both provider and protector and knows she&#039;s safe. Affection goes two ways - affection is pacing back and forth because you haven&#039;t seen her for a week, and you keep thinking about how quickly you can move things alone, confronting your own fears, wondering if she really could be the one, and then the feeling of joy when you meet her for lunch the next day. Affection is wondering what your children would look like. Affection is the look in her eyes when you&#039;re holding each other, and you know that for now all is good and well and beautiful, and that even though the future is uncertain, for now you have each other and that&#039;s all that really matters.

And that&#039;s what this board needs - fucking momentum. Most of us lead small stagnant loves and that stagnation cemented itself onto this board, this place, this fucking website is just same shot different day. There was a time when various happenings were occurring whether big or small, bit these events sparked discussion and connection because if you were there for that happening you shared it with the others present.
