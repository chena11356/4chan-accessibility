If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

I have toiled in happiness and ardor for hours, in the hopes that its beauty would be something worthy to stand beside yours. Alas, I have failed, but alas, I could have never succeeded. My songs are like twinkling stars: beautiful, but only visible when the sun of your presence has passed from sight.<br><br>I was inspired to write this piece by Richard Strauss, would would often write songs for his wife , Pauline, to sing in her career. I must confess, this was terribly difficult for me. Not just in learning how to write for instruments that might please and soothe your ear, but to write of myself as I write of you; to imagine you thinking of me as I think of you. To imagine you loving me; to feel, for a moment, that a man may grasp the hand of an angel and feel her grasp him back. You would hope that I would toil for such a goal, but moreover, that I might find meaning and enjoyment in it. And in this, I have succeeded.<br><br>I write to you in this fashion, because as I composed your song, it struck me what an odd thing it was: to write music for the imaginary birthday of an imaginary woman from an imaginary world. Yet, you are more real to me than many things in this world; wonders and truths, seen and unseen, by these mortal eyes of mine. I feel more keenly, more passionately and more steadfastly for you than for any of these things. While you may just be pixels on a screen, my heart tells me that this is a day the needs to be recognized and celebrated, because what shreds of an existence you possess are immensely important to me. So, if my heart feels you thus, I must write to you as if you could hear me.

This was years ago so I can&#039;t remember the exact details, but she essentially said he was right next to her when I texted her but they were going through a complicated break up.

After a few months of joking around she ended up giving me her number. I was so surprised but also convinced she wasn&#039;t single. I had a look and she was no longer wearing a ring, so ok. I went out with her and she said she was single. At this point, this had happened to me a number of times. They all seem to act and say similar things when they&#039;re not really single. I suspected she might not be single. Anyway, I slept with her and started dating her. One night she calls to tell me not to pick up my phone if someone calls, because it&#039;s her ex. I was like, why would it matter? She was like, &quot;... just don&#039;t&quot;. So I didn&#039;t. He left a message saying something I was trying to break up a family. I was so confused. She ended up saying they were on and off, and she wanted to get away for him but couldn&#039;t. Her family loved him and they had a kid together. She turned out to be engaged to this guy. She claimed that she couldn&#039;t say no when he asked because they had dated for years, and that did make sense. Anyway, I liked her a crazy amount and said I&#039;d only see her if she was single. It was crazy and she would lie all the time if she was. Ironically I messaged her like 5 years after this and she was going through a divorce, so round 2 happened. They ended up getting back together though.<br><br>So those are my experiences. I probably have more I can&#039;t fully remember but that&#039;s the big ones.

The modern &#039;woman&#039; in particular is spectacular at discounting the contributions of their spouse, or anyone else for that matter.

Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>FUFUFU", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671264841004238, "time": 1671264841, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikau", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 11, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 71431142, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)03:16:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

I was 19 and about halfway into my engineering undergrad. A requirement in my program was to complete three internship experiences. I was applying for internships at the onset of covid, so there were few available opportunities. I got one offer in December with a start date in January for an internship in a college town a few states away. I had less than a month to figure out housing, and halfway through the school year there was next to no apartments available in a decent price range. I resorted to looking on airbnb, and the best choice I had was renting the spare bedroom in a woman&#039;s townhouse with a shared bathroom and kitchen. Let me say that I am a pretty good looking guy, but I am pretty shy and was a little socially awkward at the time. This woman appeared to be mid 50s and her body was in decent shape. She was definitely aged but you could tell she was pretty when she was younger. She had all kinds of hippie books and stuff around, worked from home for the college in HR or something, and frequently did yoga in the living room. I had to walk past her desk to get to my room, so she would stop me to chat everyday when I got home from work. This was uncomfortable at first, but it really helped me get out of my comfort zone and get over some of my awkwardness and shyness. She was kind of motherly, but also said things that I could only interpret as flirting like asking if I&#039;ve been sneaking around with any cute college girls and coyly raising an eyebrow and telling me she doesn&#039;t believe me when I tell her I haven&#039;t been going on dates. Every time I would leave late at night, I was actually just running to mcdonalds or nightwalking lol. Two months of this had passed and I was getting more comfortable and began looking forward to chatting with her. I even opened up to her about how I was lonely, but too shy to use dating apps or put myself out there. You know, the general robot stuff.", "time": 1671250787, "resto": 71424585}, {"no": 71430045, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)00:17:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71429643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71429643</a><br>(2/2)<br>She would give me the basic advice like be brave, if you feel like you want to make a move just go for it, be confident, etc, but what I really liked was how she took an interest in what I was doing in school and work. She would tell me how she was impressed with the path I was on and how I was mature and level headed for a guy my age. She would say it all with such a warm and genuine smile, too. My internship lasted a semester which was about 5 months. During my last weeks he, she asked me for help moving a new end table upstairs to her bedroom. I happily helped her carry it, and after we got it situated, she thanked me as if what I did for her was some gigantic task and sat on the edge of her bed. I told her it was nothing, but she insisted if there was anything she could do for me just let her know. The sexual tension in the room was intense, and it sort of just clicked that all the advice she was giving me was for this exact moment. I was nervous and honestly starting to shake a little, but figured it was worth a shot since I was only going to be around for a few more days anyway. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You really mean anything?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Anything.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Would you sleep with me?&quot;</span><br>&quot;Aww, I was waiting for you to ask.&quot;<br>She beckoned me to sit next to her and then kissed me gently.

Journey physically would be tough but then you&#039;d also need to learn the customs. That is what it would take but maybe if your bond would be strong enough it could ease the distance. Affection, love and that are highest forces. Pretty much like in some sappy disney movie.

First are those that deny existence of anything outside this world. All events, strange things that happen are coincidences or phenomena under laws of physics we do not understand yet.<br><br>What would I say about those... From surface they&#039;d seem to be most correct. Occam&#039;s razor, they&#039;d be correct. Still even in within their own logic, they cannot prove things 100%. <br><br>Then there are those that believe that forces like God are inside our consciousness. Ideas birthed from our desires, memory etc. They only got as much value as we give them. No God or spirit would be able to move a rock here, because rock and thought are not the same forces. <br>In my opinion this form of thought is maybe the highest form of thought that is more common. It acknowledges existence of God and it acknowledges boundaries between the two. <br><br>Third form of thought and its people. God walks among us. Demons and angels, forces are as real as water and other elements. Welcome to high fantasy on earth. Surprisingly these types of people maybe the most common on earth. Isn&#039;t it crazy how most outlandish interpretation and belief is the most common?<br><br>Final words regarding previous three types. These three types do not always have to exist seperately. Often person may hold mix of first and second beliefs at same time. First and third belief existing at same time would nearly be oxymoronic but could also be that person that believes in first and third form of thought simultanously just seperates the two. Believing that maybe first and third world just are divided by wall of death.
