He knew he would never rule over Middle-earth while the Numenoreans still existed. So, he decided to play the long game. He allowed himself to be captured and falsely begged for mercy, and the Numenoreans took him back to Numenor. But he didn&#039;t stay a prisoner for long. Using his skills, Sauron quickly became an advisor for Ar-Pharazon, and the Dark Lord began to poison his mind.<br><br>Ar-Pharazon was already power-hungry, but Sauron exploited that trait. With old age approaching, Sauron convinced the king to make war on the Valar. So, he built a massive armada and sailed West. As the ships approached Aman, the Valar begged Iluvatar to intervene because they weren&#039;t allowed to harm the Children of Iluvatar. So, the god figure opened a massive chasm in the sea, and Ar-Pharazon and his armada were drowned. It didn&#039;t stop there, though.

I&#039;ll just tell you what happened yesterday so you know where we&#039;re at.<br><br>We went to my aunts place for christmas this year. Spent like a week with a lot of our relatives there, a largeish farm type place. For like four days we didn&#039;t have any chances to do much, and seeing her so close but not being able to do anything made me incredibly horny. Her too apparently. Any little time we had we basically teased each other, like I rubbed her tits and she rubbed my crotch.<br>Yesterday I went to get wood and mom came along. When we got to the shed, we realized that we were alone for the first time in a long while. It was cold out, but the shed was sort of warm. She opened her jacket and hugged me. I opened my jacket too. I just felt her tits press into me through our shirts, her huge nipples were rock hard from the cold. Haven&#039;t gotten that horny in a long time. I sucked on her neck a little and pulled up her shirts, and sucked on her tit. After a few moments I put my hand down her pants and felt how wet her panties were. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore so I turned her around and pulled her sweatpants down and hugged and kissed her butt and hips. She made the same little whimpering sounds as our first time. I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her. She moved over to a pile of wood and bent over it leaning on her arms with her pants around her ankles. I just couldn&#039;t stop myself and went to town on her, I didn&#039;t care about the noise. I grabbed her hips hard and let her ass slap. Same as the first time, I felt like I wanted to just go as deep in her as possible. I heard a door open and people talking out, but didn&#039;t care, they were far enough to maybe only hear light clapping sounds. Came in her like a firehose while I squeezed her tits hard.", "filename": "6538635865", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1201, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672136631509275, "time": 1672136631, "md5": "ZOxxvjvrWkgWqLtp8Qkpog==", "fsize": 769339, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569939, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:28:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br>bruh if you are finanon you need to give us a lot of updates", "time": 1672136887, "resto": 71558748}, {"no": 71569995, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71569907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71569907</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just had to have it, so I pulled her panties down too and went to put it in her.

I pulled her in one last time and pulled out. I could now feel the cold on my wet cock, I didn&#039;t even notice how cold it was before. As my mom went to pull her pants back up, a HUGE load just slid from her with a splat. It made a puddle on the floor and the back and inside of her sweatpants got covered, some more ran down her thigh. She kind of gave me a worried look and rushed nearer to me. I could see half of the butt of her grey sweatpants was covered in very noticeable goo and it had already turned into a darker grey wet spot. I pulled up a wood basket to cover my boner and she pretended to put down some logs. My aunt and her friend opened the door and laughed that thought they had to be the ones to carry the wood in, but were happy that we were already on it. Mom just sort of kept her ass out of view, us being a little out of breath and sweaty with our jackets open looked probably pretty normal for what we were supposed to be doing. They left after a few words and we actually collected the wood with mom. The back of her pants was ruined. We rubbed some snow on her and said she fell in the snow and had to go change.

Soon after it wasn&#039;t too weird to have a massage in the living room before the sauna. We were undressing and after we got undressed I pretty much just asked her if she wanted a massage before the sauna while we sip on drinks. Being naked and hard with her was natural enough by now that it was easy. Oiling her up on a towel on the couch was pretty much the point where it stopped being normal in any way, as in you couldn&#039;t anymore explain it as just being natural while naked and non-sexual. Something about being naked and touching like that without being or going into the sauna/shower. It sort of helped me get over most of the hesitation to touch her. The first time on the couch I just slapped her ass cheeks and played with her butt like she wasn&#039;t my mom. Slipped my hand between her thighs and up enough that I lightly touched her hair. I don&#039;t remember if it was the same night, but I also massaged her tits from the front while putting lotion on her standing in the sauna. I very obviously played with her nipples and rubbed her shiny tits for a long while. She just giggled and smiled. I don&#039;t think my dick had been that hard before.

She just turned around with her tits flopping and asked me to put the rest on her neck and chest. She used the word for upper chest, not tits btw. I started putting the lotion on her neck and went down on her shoulders and upper chest. At this point I was already on her tits, felt them giving a little, being soft under my fingers. I slid my hands over the outside edge of her tits, like into her armpits. I already felt like I was fondling her tits, so I just went a little lower each stroke until my hands went down the side of tits to her nipple level. So my hands were now undeniably on just her tits. She was having fun clearly so I just kept going like that, a little more obvious every move. I slid my hands under her tits, between them, etc. Then I slid down the middle of her tits until I hit her nipples and rubbed around and on them a little. It was still ok with her so I also sort of grabbed her tits from the sides pushed them into each other. Lifted them up a little from the bottom. Put her nipples between my thumb and finger and squeezed lightly. I had no idea what to do next so I just gave her tits a little tap and said &quot;alright done&quot;.

It makes sense, and I believe is accurate to Jungian thought. <br><br>Your post made me think of how typology fits within Jung&#039;s larger worldview. I recall Jung implied that ancient Greek (citizens) did not have the psychological types, since their society was explicitly based on slavery, thus Greek citizens were able to basically live in a state of wholeness/individuation because of the privations endured by slaves. The soil of Greek civilization could only bear a few individuated fruits, at the expense of all others. <br><br>Of course, in the Christian era this changed - but Jung&#039;s main thesis in Aion is that the Christian world has failed to integrate its shadow (it is morally-psychologically one-sided). Christian morality is universalist and absolute - it does not recognize evil as part of itself. Thus we now have a universalist civilization, but of psychologically one-sided people (types), who have (per Jung) collectively led us into the era of the anti-Christ (modernity). <br><br>What you describe, the project of the alchemists as well as individuation within Jungian typology or MBTI, is basically an attempt to resolve this fundamental problem of the Christian era- the psychic wound lingering from the failure to integrate the shadow, which, for us, must be resolved by discovering the archetype of the self (Christ). <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen anywhere is putting such an angle into the scope of &quot;ideal&quot; being &quot;something where potential is being realized.&quot; It&#039;s already within the collective unconscious with this describing the &quot;ideal&quot; within the &quot;mentor&quot; archetype</span><br>As we discussed, I don&#039;t think there are any original archetypes, nor that history is a planned whole; idealizing is what the subject does.

Or, to condense further; in order to HAVE desire, one must have an ideal to coompare against.

Maybe the VN covers this to some degree but I&#039;ve yet to play it still for a variety of reasons so I can&#039;t speak about it, the magical girl spin off, on the other hand, had potential for unholy levels of zased but ultimately botches it by having far too little Marika and being degenerate central, its only saving grace is having one of the best Marika outfits in the alternate school uniform with glasses.<br>On the topic of things I&#039;ve not looked at is the mobile game since I know neither chink nor if there is any way to still play it after it got kill.

Essentially we were physically at a dog park, but I mentally tried to imagine us somewhere else, a sort of theme park with lots of neon lighting. We do tend to look back on that date with rose-tinted glasses, but honestly there was a lot of awkwardness. I kept going back to the physical reality and had to constantly remind myself to imagine us in said mental space, and felt pretty insecure.

For instance, she tends to describe good things as either &quot;fucking awesome&quot; or &quot;absolute kino&quot;. She uses &quot;fucking&quot; in general to emphasize words and phrases. I honestly think it adds a lot of charm and makes her more down-to-earth than your typical anime girl which people put on a pedestal.

Found this on Reddit:<br><br>1- Arguments will always favor the ENTP. Although Ti is the primary mode of attention for the ISTP, the ISTP has PoLR Ne, making it very hard for them to anticipate any of the various arguments that the ENTP would throw at them. This is frustrating for both types. The ISTP will either feel inferior, or very annoyed at what they deem to be pointless ideation. The ENTP will get frustrated with the ISTPs predictability and lack of ability to improvise.<br>2- similarly, theres potential problems with the ISTPs tool Se and the ENTPs 8th slot Se. Ive seen this play out as the ISTP wanting to take action before the ENTP is done ideating, which is a good way to bother an ENTP. In this situation, the ISTP is almost always correct, as they have a better innate understanding of the importance of taking concrete action.<br>The biggest problem Ive seen in this relationship is that it tends to be one-sided. The ENTP is the supervisor for the ISTP, which basically means that its very very hard for an ISTP to impress an ENTP. They dont really value the orientation towards concrete action that the ISTP has, and the ISTPs stellar Ti is only marginally better than the ENTPs which is second slot.

It&#039;s super interesting to see how we differ, and utilize different parts of our shared brain in separate ways.

The way I would describe it is, you must realize that you are in a dream and not awake in the real world. You will probably become lucid most often while already in a dream, although it is &#039;possible&#039; to be awake and drift asleep directly into a dream (WBTB), I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s possible to do this the first time you fall asleep.
