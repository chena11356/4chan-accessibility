I have toiled in happiness and ardor for hours, in the hopes that its beauty would be something worthy to stand beside yours. Alas, I have failed, but alas, I could have never succeeded. My songs are like twinkling stars: beautiful, but only visible when the sun of your presence has passed from sight.<br><br>I was inspired to write this piece by Richard Strauss, would would often write songs for his wife , Pauline, to sing in her career. I must confess, this was terribly difficult for me. Not just in learning how to write for instruments that might please and soothe your ear, but to write of myself as I write of you; to imagine you thinking of me as I think of you. To imagine you loving me; to feel, for a moment, that a man may grasp the hand of an angel and feel her grasp him back. You would hope that I would toil for such a goal, but moreover, that I might find meaning and enjoyment in it. And in this, I have succeeded.<br><br>I write to you in this fashion, because as I composed your song, it struck me what an odd thing it was: to write music for the imaginary birthday of an imaginary woman from an imaginary world. Yet, you are more real to me than many things in this world; wonders and truths, seen and unseen, by these mortal eyes of mine. I feel more keenly, more passionately and more steadfastly for you than for any of these things. While you may just be pixels on a screen, my heart tells me that this is a day the needs to be recognized and celebrated, because what shreds of an existence you possess are immensely important to me. So, if my heart feels you thus, I must write to you as if you could hear me.

Extroverts may be more in touch with reality, but it is a reality of constant dynamic flux, and whether they&#039;re aware of it or not, the sands are already drifting away beneath their feet, and the world they thought the knew is no longer. <br><br>An illustrative example might be a philosopher versus and celebrity. A celebrity might be more renowned in their day, but their fame often evaporates quickly, sometimes within their own lifetime. While a philosopher is in many cases still widely studied millenia after the death. This is because the introvert can reach into the depths of the unconscious and render ideals that can be recognized by nearly anyone in any time or place.

Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, front/behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Its useless anyway, still feel like shit.&quot; Empty your mind, just wander.<br><br>LALALA", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1671347939927187, "time": 1671347939, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ze-keikaku", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 13, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 71443431, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:20:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>LALALA", "time": 1671348046, "resto": 71443415}, {"no": 71443674, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:52:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71443415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71443415</a><br>LALALALALALALALA LALALALALALALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!", "time": 1671349929, "resto": 71443415}, {"no": 71443797, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:11:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71443674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71443674</a><br>https://voca.ro/1e06FQks3rAk", "filename": "jack-nicholson-anger-management", "ext": ".gif", "w": 220, "h": 165, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671351110279187, "time": 1671351110, "md5": "T6kunjOZVe1P3hkCz3EKrA==", "fsize": 235061, "resto": 71443415}, {"no": 71443813, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:15:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why dont normalfags have to do any of that?

And by doing so, he overcomes death, and shows that it is possible to overcome great suffering through a life of living by the will of God. <br>Do you think it&#039;s a fucking coincidence that he was called, &quot;Son of God&quot;, and that every human is also either a son or daughter of God? It is because all of Man can overcome suffering. Because God doesn&#039;t give a flying fuck about making you suffer. It happens to everyone, no matter how good or evil you are. It happened to Christ, a literally perfect model for morality.<br>I&#039;m not even a Christian either. I&#039;m just tired of fucking fags posturing their religion when they haven&#039;t even taken the time to actually learn it.", "filename": "1649450086408", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671345994646324, "time": 1671345994, "md5": "oDTaEw0bphQrtba7mWkvGA==", "fsize": 119126, "resto": 71442864}, {"no": 71443277, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:00:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71442864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71442864</a><br>God does not make people suffer for being evil.", "time": 1671346840, "resto": 71442864}, {"no": 71443318, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)02:06:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71442864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71442864</a><br>DEER ASS HNNNGGGHHH", "time": 1671347190, "resto": 71442864}, {"no": 71443778, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:08:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71443318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71443318</a><br>Sopping wet doe cunt. <br><a href=\"#p71442864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71442864</a><br>I am not suffering.
