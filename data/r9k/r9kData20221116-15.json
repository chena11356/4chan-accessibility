Most guys sit around in sweatpants all the time and the dick only comes out for horny times. This makes the dick your scary secret. <br><br>Instead just sit around naked - not all the time if you think that would be weird, but like, come out of the shower naked and just sit down on the couch by her. You can play it off as a goof, but the important thing is that she gets used to seeing your penis. <br><br>Be physically comfortable cuddling with her and getting boners. Lay off wanking for a few days so you pop stiffies just from cuddling. Then you can be like &quot;lol I&#039;m so hard it hurts, i just have to take my pants off&quot;. Don&#039;t start fapping or asking her to touch it, just keep doing w/e you were doing but with a fat stiffie. It&#039;s like a bar signal, she knows it wants touching.<br><br>This stuff lets her get used to seeing your penis - and something girls are very fascinated by is how a penis goes from flaccid to erect. They rarely get to see the full cycle and they&#039;re usually curious about it. <br><br>So she may start out by just gingerly touching your erection, or just goofing around and touching your flaccid pp until it gets hard, just to tease you. <br><br>Eventually, if you&#039;re always clean and smell nice when she sees your penis or touches it, she&#039;ll probably try kissing or licking it, and things go from there. DONT force her or &quot;facefuck&quot; if she starts sucking, you&#039;ll undo all your progress if she gets scared of it.

A home with running water and electricity. The same one who has never missed a meal. There&#039;s never been a rational reason for self harm. People who do it aren&#039;t even thinking in the present time when they do it. They&#039;re thinking about generating reactions from people when they&#039;ve scarred over and they can show them off. Just like in the emo music video you were so fascinated with. They replace their personalities with media and let that speak for them. They replace their personalities with scars and let that speak for them. Like a tattoo. If you can give me one legitimate reason why someone would cut themselves with a safety razor I&#039;ll believe you. As far as I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s a retarded way for insecure kids to express themselves. It&#039;s edgy like suicide, except you don&#039;t actually die, which is good.
