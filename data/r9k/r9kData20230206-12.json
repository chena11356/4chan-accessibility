And many times I would try to be affectionate/sexual with them it would end in rejection and frustration for myself. I would also become a little resentful and angry (although I try not to show it). I would feel like, we are a couple why doesn&#039;t she want me? why doesn&#039;t she want to be intimate with me? she musnt like me. Is she using me? Does she think I&#039;m ugly? <br><br>My thoughts would spiral like this and it would lead to fights and arguments. This is not good obviously and also for myself I feel guilty like I&#039;m pressuring these girls to have sex when they don&#039;t want to, like a fucking rapist or something. And then when we&#039;d genuinely have sex it would feel in my mind like well maybe she&#039;s just doing it to please me? Is she just doing it to keep me around? It really ruins things.<br><br>So I have learned basically to try and match my sex drive to her natural drive. Most girls have pathetic low-t sex drives and want sex like 3-5 times a week max. But for me it&#039;s like that much per day unironically. So what I do is I just have sex with her the amount she wants, and then masturbate the rest to make up the disparity. I like to use porn sometimes to do this. <br><br>I mean it&#039;s not a perfect solution obviously I just need a femcoomer sex addict but they are like 1 in 1 billion so I just make do with this solution. <br><br>And you may ask well why don&#039;t you just masturbate to thoughts of your gf or pictures? I would say I DO DO THAT but also it&#039;s not enough. You can only jack off to the same pics or memories or fantasies.

It is my understanding that methamphetamine is much more euphoric and addictive because, beyond involving the big dopamine release, it also has strong serotonergic properties as well.

I realized that I am a damaged person, and that at a young age I lost the ability to feel everyday joy that drives most normal people forward. I have felt empty and dead inside for years. Upon realizing this, I was able to feel something genuine for the first time in a long time.<br><br>Though, before in all my emptiness and languor, I did find one thing that could make me feel: great beauty. In all things, but it is mostly forms of serious art that does it for me.

He was like more awake and always on the grind doing something etc. BUt you are also more willing to take risks and become more hendonistic like drugs, smoking and sex.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>MBMBSDSD", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675680870365617, "time": 1675680870, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 72118061, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:55:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Dont question the use or meaning, do not rationalize, try to let the stimuli wash over you like a river.<br><br>MDMDS", "time": 1675680912, "resto": 72118056}, {"no": 72118247, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)06:21:33", "name": "Ukranon", "com": "<a href=\"#p72118056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72118056</a><br>Second in the nhk thread.
