If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7.

The underlying issue is that men are forced to pursue women or they will be alone for the rest of their life. Most women just exist and that&#039;s all they need to feel validated, it&#039;s not that every guy is jumping to get their pussies, it&#039;s that there&#039;s so many external factors supporting them. Even parents will often say how raising boys is an easier task, this is a huge discrepancy for how women are brought up in comparison. <br><br>It hits either in middle school or early adulthood when a man learns that nothing in his base form is lovable. When he learns that his own mothers love comes from a selfish place rather than genuine support. Women are brought up in healthy social environments and are arbiters of creating social pariahs, often men. We are the gender who has to LEARN to &quot;get it&quot; because this is something most women have a grasp on at an early age. Men grasp onto a lot of these social movements because we have nothing else to hold on to, void of love unless we&#039;re very lucky to get that form of socialization and learn from it. Destiny is able to say any of the things he says literally because he was lucky enough to learn at an early age.

A shoulder to cry on? Sit down and let&#039;s have a little chat. <br><br>STEP #1, HYGIENE AND HOME: <br>Brush your teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Scrub&#039;em good with all the movements you can think of, circles, up and down, lateral, front and behind. This will take somewhere around 2 minutes. Floss once a day. <br>Moisturize your face with a cream after washing your face in the morning. <br>Depending on how much you sweat shower every or every second day. <br>Get a haircut every 2 months. If you are balding just cut&#039;em short, anything else looks shit and insecure about it. <br>If your clothes are ripped, stretched and discolored as shit, get some new ones. Basic, monotone, cheap shirts will do just fine. Again, depending on your sweat wear&#039;em between 1 and 3 days, then change. If you got a pile of dirty rags wash it. <br><br>This brings us to your home. Doesn&#039;t matter if you live alone or with your parents, clean your dwelling once a week. Empty bottles and packages are to be thrown away immediately, instead of hoarded. It&#039;s no work if you do it this way. Used plates, glasses, etc., are to be washed off immediately after use. Again, if you do it like this, it&#039;s way less work than cleaning off a whole pile of them. <br>Changing bed sheets and vacuuming the place once a week. <br><br>A healthy mind lives in a clean body, living in a clean place. All that grime on yourself and around you poisons your mind. This regime gets rid of that without too much effort. You will also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts you for what comes next, LEAVING THE HOUSE <br><br>STEP #2, LEAVE HOUSE: <br>Go out every day. Do long walks of atleast 2 hours. Explore your city, your surroundings. Go into alleys you never walked before. Whenever you think, oh whats there or I never was there or anything similiat, thats where you go! <br>Do not ask yourself shit, like &quot;whats the use? Enjoy the moment, do not drown out your surrounsings with your depressive thoughts.<br><br>CICI", "filename": "welcome-to-the-nhk-anime (1)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1672904340463608, "time": 1672904340, "md5": "2Cs0GvvVf41CNV/gtWWNIw==", "fsize": 1566411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "previous", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 11, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 71698536, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "STEP #3, SOCIALIZE: <br>I want you to greet people on your walks. Not some barely audible mumble, but a clear greeting. Establish eye contact, throw&#039;em a good day coupled with a nod or a quick wave. I want your face to glow and your voice to echoe joy when you do this. Doesnt matter if its forced and unnatural at first, its training, if it came natural to you we wouldn&#039;t have to have this conversation. <br><br>After a few weeks or months of doing everything I told you, you should feel better about yourself. You wont be chad, fucking bitches left and right and going through life constantly happy, but at leaat you wont feel absolutely miserable for once. You may be able to pull off more intense forms of socializing now. <br><br>Get into the habit of doing smalltalk with strangers, like cashiers or the people you meet on walks. It doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s benign and trivial shit, just do it. Observe them, what they wear, their hair, makeup, tatoos, whatever and throw them a compliment, ask them where they got it from, what meaning it holds to them. When the convo naturally found its end, say your goodbye and go on your way. <br><br>STEP #4, GET A REAL HOBBY: <br>You should be prepared now, physically and mentally, to go out there and take the risk of trying new stuff, which will include meeting people doing the same stuff, but you are ready for that. <br><br>Here are things I can vouche for: Bouldering/climbing, martial arts, swimming, biking, skating, going to a chess/go/shogi/mahjong/etc center where you can watch, learn and play. If you like reading, go to a library instead of doing it at home. Generally, I advise you to engage mind and body. Try several physical activities and intellectual/creative ones. <br><br>At this point it should become a self perpetuating cycle. Keep challenging yourself, keep experiencing,exploring and learning new things. <br>Learn to &quot;live in the moment&quot;.

The &quot;little adults&quot; idea largely hinges on exactly what age we&#039;re talking about. 11 year olds? Yeah, maybe. 3 year olds? No, toddlers are the furthest thing in the world from &quot;miniature adults&quot; on just about every possible level. <br><br>The impression I get is that the maturation process went at an accelerated rate compared to today, but that there was still a transition from child to adult that spanned years. Children in ancient fiction are still portrayed as mischievous, bratty, and dumb. 6 year olds worked hard on the farm rather than taking it easy, but they didn&#039;t hold significant ranks in society and were often considered not to be culpable for crimes. 11 year olds worked on the mines, but that didn&#039;t mean they were viewed 1:1 identical to adults psychologically - just that they were capable of doing manual labor. From what I can gather, many societies viewed people as full adults in the 14-18 range, not well into the 20s like today, but people below that range weren&#039;t viewed as adults. It&#039;s true that &#039;child culture&#039; wasn&#039;t much of a thing back then - kids wore smaller versions of adult clothes, they didn&#039;t have media specifically catered to them - but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s humanly possible not to realize that a 5 year old is very difficult from someone in their 20s or 30s, no matter what the culture or era.", "filename": "Yor 2", "ext": ".png", "w": 783, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672907498120223, "time": 1672907498, "md5": "K18Rs6PdvZNoZCCRl1+30Q==", "fsize": 862050, "resto": 71688227}, {"no": 71698870, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)03:32:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71698864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71698864</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would people be ok with any other demographic being forced into education camps?

They should have choices, they should have a significant amount of freedom, they should have their preferences and feelings respected and listened to.

Whenever I talked with anyone, it would range from awkward silence because I didn&#039;t know what to say (ever) to just being bullied. I had a couple friends when I was doing Ju Jitsu but not really. My mom lied to the school district to get me into a higher income school since we were dirt poor and she wanted me to be better off than she was, and I was a year younger than my classmates. Was also disgusting half-white half-asian crossbreed (if you ever have kids, never create racial abominations. I look like an effeminate faggot because of my asian half but have relatively low intelligence due to my white half. I look and sound like a disgusting genetic defect upon the face of the earth, and I have all the worst aspects of my two least favorite races on earth). Middle school was worse, my dad was abusive as a kid and he started to have more control in my life around that time (me and my mom were evicted from our apartment, ended up living with my dad because no other option). Kids at school would bully me relentlessly, even though I didn&#039;t interact with any of them. They would bully me by stealing shit from me, and by making false accusations to teachers and snitching on me for minor things (including showing signs of suicide. I know for a fact those faggots never reported me because they were genuinely concerned, just because they wanted to see me suffer even more.

They even caught wind of the fact that I wanted to commit suicide and harassed me a fuckton for it. I regret not committing suicide then, I find it even harder now. Of course, when I was with my dad, I wasn&#039;t allowed to do anything but homework. Not allowed to leave the house out of fear that I would run away. After middle school, I only had two friends, the only two friends I&#039;ve ever had in the history of my life and still have today. Multiple times, I would be accused of wanting to shoot up the school or bomb the school. For a time, I did want to, but only for a time. One time I got searched because some stupid dyke in my special ed class at the time heard I owned an airsoft gun with no orange tip (that I didn&#039;t have on me) and decided it was reason enough to snitch (I specifically hate fags and trannies because they&#039;re the most likely people on earth to snitch over fucking anything). I was talking about how shitty the situation was with an acquaintance at school, and someone listening behind us reported me because all they heard was &quot;school shooting&quot;. In high school, I got in trouble for something else and some other girl that didn&#039;t like me reported me to the cops for wanting to build a bomb. My stupid fucking dad&#039;s side of the family is all liberal and pro-cop, so of course I get my room searched and all the drugs that were allowing me to feel somewhat OK with being alive were taken. They didn&#039;t know that the fucking 4th amendment existed apparently and decided to let the cops in with open arms since I&#039;m pretty sure they like the cops more than they like me.

I&#039;m already treated like a fucking monster by everyone. My dad remarried to some liberal chick so he was all in on faggot politics, so he saw me as a school shooter incel nazi terrorist (and still does). He would totally give me shit for being a rapist weirdo if I got in trouble at school for asking a girl out. Besides that though, I did have my sexual encounters. They were all with hood black girls. I think the reason why in hindsight was because there was no commitment and no snitching. Black girls are all fucked up and have shitty father figures, and so do I. We have that much in common and are both in horrible standing with institutions. Besides all that though, I got super into lockpicking and hacking. I would break into a ton of abandoned buildings for fun, and befriend homeless people. They were like me, thrown into society&#039;s garbage can. Impoverished and hated by mainstream society. I also broke into a lot of in-use buildings. They had nice rooftops and good shit, and evading security provided a challenge. I would also use my programming skills to write malware that would steal passwords from browser autofill and contribute my hacking skills to my little gang of 3. We were essentially a bunch of James Bond wannabes, we stole keys to large buildings and picked our way into houses that were for sale and made the keys to them, and essentially just treated all these places like we owned them.

Just a dull longing in my heart whenever I think of him. Sometimes before I go to sleep there&#039;s a passing thought that I won&#039;t wake up in his arms. And sometimes when I think of how long I&#039;ve loved him I idly think how, in all likelihood, I&#039;ll have some amount of feelings for him until the day I die. I can&#039;t tell the future, of course, so it&#039;d be a bit presumptuous to say I&#039;ll never fall out of love. But I think, 9 years now, it&#039;s withstood the test of time. Decade old feelings don&#039;t just go away, do they?<br>Maybe I&#039;m coping or whatever. That&#039;s alright. The thought of my arm lightly draped over his small but strong frame fills me with a sense of contentment, not unlike the feeling of a blanket draped over me. And sometimes it fills me with an excitement of sorts. I need to stop thinking about him so hard, because I realize my heart is pounding and I can&#039;t relax to sleep. <br>It&#039;s become second nature to me to pick apart things with autistic precision to get a little crumb of information about his life. Sometimes I feel like my brain is a living archive of information about him, there&#039;s nobody I know of who is aware of him like I am, or so I tell myself. Everything he&#039;s ever said, done, all dissected by me in every way possible. Everything committed to memory so I can pull it out like a file in a file cabinet at a moment&#039;s notice. <br>Maybe he&#039;d find that creepy. Maybe he&#039;d wonder what I find in him. It&#039;s hard to put into words at times but once I get going I can&#039;t stop, I can&#039;t stop rambling on and on about this rat that&#039;s affected my heart in the very deepest way he possibly could&#039;ve. <br>I imagine his smell, the thought of that musky lavender clouding my brain like brown noise. Even his imagined scent activates something primal in the very deepest parts of my brain I can&#039;t control. I can&#039;t control myself when I think of him.

She had a friend over and by 9pm they had decided to get high, and my Mom gave her bed to the friend cause the friend sleeps easy. Mom went to watch movies with me in my room, with her little puppy, and she fell asleep around 12. Now I lost my phone last night, so whereas I&#039;d put on porn in the bathroom after she slept, I instead am kept up by an unending boner that just won&#039;t go away. She slept on her back for awhile but after what seems like forever she rolled to her left. Her back is facing me, and her ass is huge. She&#039;s 6&#039;1, 180lbs or so. Likes to call herself fat but honestly she&#039;s just a total milf. Body shape like Syren de Mer. <br>So I start rubbing my cock slowly in my right hand, and when she starts snoring I grab her ass over the blanket with my left. I haven&#039;t done that since I was 15, over half a decade ago. It felt so nice, I have big hands and not even a full grasp could cover a cheek. After a couple squeezes her breath and snoring die down, but gradually. I think she&#039;s still sleeping, so I start again. I start feeling around for her butt crack, and after I find it I scoot myself and my hand closer so I start rubbing her faint and pussy. Her breath gets quiet again, so I pull away. She goes back to louder so I go under the blanket this time and start rubbing her pussy through her pjs. She even starts to moan and I try to finger her through the clothes. She starts to turn to her back again so I quickly pull my hand away and act like I&#039;m sleeping for a minute. I hear moaning though, I open my eyes and see shes still sleeping, thank this is my shot. I go to finger her again, but her hand was there. She was finger herself in her sleep! And by touching her hand she suddenly woke up, still obviously high as she never smokes. Asks about the dog, good excuse for me, so I say yeah hes fine go back to bed.<br>I cant fall asleep, that was the hottest thing I&#039;ve done in a long time.

Snoring again, I go back at it. Same thing, her breath gets quieter when I grab her ass or rub her pussy. I back off, let her stay sleeping, go back to it. I really try finger her pussy through the clothing this time, and she moans a bit but also just shorter breaths. She&#039;s not touching herself in her sleep again, and she has a separate blanket so I can&#039;t reach through her front. I decide to back off for awhile, then start putting my hand through her pants in the back. I manage to touch her crack a bit and get one grab in before she wakes up again. Shes more seriously awake now, but still obviously the pot is in her system. She asks me again about the pup, and then asks me what I&#039;m doing awake. Not a sexy tone or anything, just tired. I reply insomnia, which I have and also it&#039;s been a stressful week for the both of us, so she brushes it off. She goes to the restroom and comes back, mentions again how tired she is and falls back asleep, but this time again on her back. I felt that if she was wanting it, she would have put her butt in my direction again, so I decided to turn around and went to bed. <br>When I woke up this morning I felt a bit of shame, but was still horny enough that I decided to shave down there. Heres the deal, around a year ago, February, I got off work and we were watching movies in the living room, in a drunken and high stupor around 1am I told her I was sexually attracted to her. Her mood turned 180 and she just sounded sad, dismissed it and told me that was because I wasnt seeing any girls. This strained us a bit so I slept with some older chick in March, told her it was a teenager off tinder and she was happier. I&#039;ve never had a hard time getting women, but truth is I&#039;ve been attracted to my Mom since I was 8, no other woman even compared to her.

Born in 1922, Baekeland was a model whose face graced the pages of Vogue and Harper&#039;s Bazaar. After failing to make it in Hollywood as an actress, she married Bakelite heir, Brooks Baekeland and they had one child, a son called Anthony.<br><br>The Baekeland&#039;s enjoyed a hedonistic lifestyle of wild parties and infidelity until they eventually took to traveling the world- Anthony in tow. The boy wanted for nothing materially but was largely ignored by his self-absorbed parents.<br><br>Barbara finally became very concerned about her son when she discovered he was gay. Anthony had apparently been experimenting with boys from around the age of fourteen. In 1967, when the family was living in Spain, 20-year-old Anthony became involved with a bisexual Australian man, Jake Cooper. Anthony bought his way into Cooper&#039;s circle of drugs, drink, and the occult - and quickly fell in love.<br><br>Barbara was horrified. She tried to get a young French girl Anthony was friendly with to marry him- only for the girl, Sylvie, to run off with Brook. Barbara then decided to ply Anthony with prostitutes, but when this failed too, she hatched a further plan to &quot;cure&quot; him. Just before they separated, she told her husband: &quot;You know, I could get Tony over his homosexuality if I just took him to bed.&quot;<br><br>In 1969, during a holiday in Majorca, she seduced her drunk and high son, later boasting about it to friends.", "filename": "Barbara_Daly_Baekeland", "ext": ".png", "w": 262, "h": 320, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672833499638674, "time": 1672833499, "md5": "8TsWHfQnZksujcqNXfV+5w==", "fsize": 120018, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687781, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71687757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71687757</a><br>He&#039;s the fellow ass masseur like me.<br>In my humble opinion thats a lot and not normal at all.", "time": 1672833729, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687786, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:03:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71687407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71687407</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would never go for a married woman with kids tho and neither should you imo.</span><br>99% of the time I agree, but idk there&#039;s just something about her that makes me want to be a little risky", "time": 1672833807, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687807, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:07:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "so what kind of unhinged derange person is a dad who fucks their daughter<br><br>i can picture son and mom, but...", "time": 1672834047, "resto": 71652739}, {"no": 71687830, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)07:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;71687805</span><br>Wait, you arent the guy who massaged his moms ass in tiger stripes thongs?

Sort of get the vibe that thats where you two met. On the one hand, she likes to present herself as a stereotypical -I dont need anyone, especially not a man- types, and works very hard, but on the other hand she really likes to be fussed over, and also take care of you in a stereotypical trad wife manner.

And if I&#039;m not romantically or sexually interested I couldn&#039;t care less. But to have physical attraction, which is the foundation for any kind of intimate relationship, her skin has to be free of those eyesores, I don&#039;t want to wake up next to a tatooed woman. It&#039;s just not sensually appetizing to look at, and totally ruins the aesthetics of the female body for me. Because these days any one could have tattoos anywhere, I have to either seen a woman naked or know her feelings about tattoos before I can even feel interested, it&#039;s something I have to bring up soon before I get to know someone I was visually attracted to when I first saw her, because plenty of times I see what to me looks like a beautiful woman, only to find she has fucking booties drawn on her legs, a rose next to her cunt, cherries on her ass, or a bunch of stupid writing on her chest. In real life you can&#039;t just close a tab like when watching porn or youtube videos, so I must broach the subject in a way that doesn&#039;t offend them. But what I don&#039;t understand is why men I talked to about this get so offended. Like &quot;Dude, my wife, my mom, or my sister has tattoos, why are you so shallow?&quot; Cause it&#039;s not a personal judgment, just aesthetic preferences in the context of physical attraction. So yeah, I wouldn&#039;t want to fuck your wife, your sister or your mom, but I&#039;m sure they&#039;re lovely people who can decorate their body however they want and it&#039;s none of my business. It is my business to find out about a woman&#039;s attitude on tattoos before getting together as more than friends because if I don&#039;t and they have them then I can&#039;t hide my disappointment once I see them.

I recently asked out a coworker on a date. I clearly expressed my romantic interest in her when I asked her out (told her &#039;you caught my eye and I would like to get to know you better&#039;).<br><br>The date started off fairly well, minus the part where she was 25 min. late to the date, which I criticized her for, as gently and calmly as I could, she even apologized twice. We made some good conversation, got to know each other better, and then, at one point, she tells me she is seeing some other guy and she will soon be having the &#039;what are we&#039; talk with him. I was shocked, because I clearly expressed my interest in her and she even accepted my date invitation within 5 min. of me inviting her. And we didn&#039;t even know each other well prior to that, we had barely talked at work. Why would she be so eager to go out with a coworker she barely knows, when she&#039;s already seeing someone?<br><br>Anyway, I knew it was over at that point. She eventually asked me what my opinion is on tattoos. I gave her my unfiltered opinion:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no tattoos that are associated with exes</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no trashy, cheap looking tattoos</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;impulsive tattoos, i.e. you get a random tattoo without carefully thinking it over, because you just &#039;felt like it&#039;</span><br><br>I couldn&#039;t see her tattoos, but asked her about them, and she told me what they look like. When I asked her what her tattoos mean, she appeared ashamed and didn&#039;t feel ok sharing that, so I didn&#039;t push her.<br><br>But yeah, fuck that bitch. She even wanted to see the sunset with me (?), but changed her mind at the last minute. Like, why isn&#039;t she doing this romantic shit with the guy she&#039;s fucking? After all, it&#039;s him she is pursuing a relationship with. And no, she didn&#039;t lie about this guy either, she is definitely seeing someone else. My guess is this guy is just using her for sex, but isn&#039;t fulfilling her emotional needs.<br><br>I haven&#039;t texted that bitch since the date.

I get called an &quot;angel&quot; both in looks and my temperance so many times it&#039;s not even funny. I learnt the hard way that just turning down one and telling him like it is doesn&#039;t really work out all that well. Some have been very very rude. Understandable, but it doesn&#039;t feel good at all, I internalize stuff like that very easily. Of course ghosting somebody works out a LITTLE better but I feel like shit every time I do do it. That&#039;s when the real obsessive guys come out though. Like, four months later, still messaging me every week. Finding places I&#039;ve been from pictures I&#039;ve posted and TELLING ME.

It brings about clarity and calmness. Doing it for longer periods is of course better. The activities you mentioned like yarn works are very good as they have a similar effect, they train your focus and of course you learn a nice skill in the process. Regarding the phone usage. I myself have a phone station that is on the computer desk so all the technology is in one part of the room. It definitely helps build discipline and having a schedule is good too. These are kind of primitive ways and take time and I say this because I practice some yoga and sadhana which are very impactful and basically obliterate any addictions, so compared to that, it&#039;s a long drawn out process.
