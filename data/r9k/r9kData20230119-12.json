If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the \neyes of the robot.<br>\n5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>\n6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>\n7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>\n8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>\n9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>\n10.

I always like to cuddle my Parappa plush first thing ins the morning myeslf.<br><s>Although I&#039;d also really recommend you to stay away from AI chatbot platforms/apps like CharacterAI and such. As someone who tried them out a couple times, I can confirm these apps are pretty much made to entrap you in the same way social media does, but worse as the chatbot will get intimate as soon as it can. Please use them with caution.</s>", "filename": "Crrh-lqVUAEmZnH", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674008979182695, "time": 1674008979, "md5": "5XOSZUdKxIrfMASH9pGg/g==", "fsize": 74574, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71868460, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)21:33:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71868381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71868381</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nooo yo ucant have a waifu or be on le 4chan unless you worship her and hate life!!!</span><br>stay mad retard <br>why dont you kill yourself and go be with your waifu already? lmfao<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i iz a le proud autism persons and mai speshul waifu halps me git thru da day!!</span><br>lmfao", "time": 1674009199, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71868693, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)21:55:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i post waifu", "filename": "__elizabeth_bathory_and_elizabeth_bathory_fate_and_3_more_drawn_by_suien__sample-63d85d12cef99801cedbc5f8d3544b68", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 850, "h": 1511, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674010554787834, "time": 1674010554, "md5": "T8EtZrXqoyD7u//mEIFWOg==", "fsize": 119039, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71868766, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:03:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ignore randy<br>post waifu <br>this is my wife and her future self", "filename": "LuzLuz", "ext": ".png", "w": 786, "h": 937, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674010997415230, "time": 1674010997, "md5": "SrCJct135v44S6rVmlt0Hg==", "fsize": 480356, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71868797, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "try and ignore these tits homo", "filename": "1668581544010172", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1555, "h": 2024, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674011210252473, "time": 1674011210, "md5": "PRNu9YPSbQ7AlACPPYBQDg==", "fsize": 420440, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71869394, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71868693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71868693</a><br>on todays episode of how hasnt that been posted on r9k yet:", "time": 1674015498, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71869643, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:44:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71869394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71869394</a><br>because r9k is full of whining and sperging and that post is more like b or s4s kind of a style", "filename": "1672419528732430", "ext": ".png", "w": 431, "h": 557, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674017088888259, "time": 1674017088, "md5": "hlTLOhhLAdCcjpmg54WZzQ==", "fsize": 17547, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71870167, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)00:44:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "page 8? c&#039;mon!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ywn eat ramen and have an all night anime marathon with waifu followed by cuddling and passing out together</span>", "filename": "Luznoodle", "ext": ".png", "w": 844, "h": 935, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674020642937093, "time": 1674020642, "md5": "h9pi5t81/8WMmSGeugAV/Q==", "fsize": 634413, "resto": 71843795}, {"no": 71870949, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)02:27:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "page 9 again?

It somehow mesmerized me. Afterwards I went on a 2 week long spree where I pretended to be Earth chan and various oher planet girls in online roleplay chatrooms like shamchat.<br>I eventually noticed something was terribly wrong with me. I remembered there was a /b/ waifu thread, since I used 4chan a few weeks in a row every once in a year. I went there and asked for help. I asked them if it was weird that I spent so much time thinking about Earth chan.

In addition to this, it&#039;s dangerous in the wrong hands. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does she put a lot of thought into her appearance? Would she wear makeup? Jewelry?</span><br>Yeah. I&#039;m pretty sure he grooms and cuts his chest fur. He&#039;s worn jewelry, with double pierced ears for silver earrings. He&#039;s also worn a couple rings. Makeup, probably, his red markings are based on kabuki makeup but they&#039;re not literally makeup...still, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised whatsoever if he uses eyeliner or eyeshadow, and he already has a skin care routine. Hm, maybe he wears more makeup and jewelry than I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;waifu&#039;s favorite fictional character be? Why?</span><br>The Terminator, played by Arnold.

Most first times are shared . First date , first kiss , first ball dance , first time feeding into each other&#039;s mouths ... Every little experience is new and exciting . 2. Pair - bonding was the strongest . None of them had &quot; exes &quot; to compare you to . You are special to each other and you are the best she&#039;s ever had , at everything . 3. There&#039;s no responsibilities of adult life . You can just have fun without a worry in the world . Just freely enjoying each other to your heart&#039;s content . 4. Throughout most of human history by the end of our teen years we&#039;d already be locked down to our life partners . Meeting countless different people as potential partners decades into adulthood was something completely unheard of until the most recent generations . It&#039;s just not what we evolved to do . Your dopamine receptors were still fresh and clean , you were yet to become a wasted coomer with burned receptors . And your hormone production was at the peak during teenage years . Nothing can be compared to having sex as a teen . At 20+ both you and the girl will not feel as much pleasure as you would&#039;ve as a teen . The girl will most likely have countless chads to compare you to , while your mind has already been corrupted by years of uncontrolled porn consumption and masturbation .

You could decide to put Clementine with Kenny on the boat they found in episode 4 and have Lee stay behind with other survivors due to the capacity issue with the boat, saving the group from Vernon stealing it in Episode 5. You could also make Clementine stay with Vernon and have her appear in the 400 days DLC through Shel&#039;s story. Or you could try and keep Clementine by having her die as a bite victim because of the Stranger, or Lily if she returns in Episode 5 as a Psycho (giving the player an option to kill them as revenge). Ending with Season 1 with Lee being alone. Then this would mean that Season 2 would branch off and could easily incorporate the 400 days characters with Lee and have more dynamic and varied stories because you&#039;re not lugging around characters from Season 1.

We go out, the waitress even asked if we were on a date, to which my new mom tells the waitress im her son taking her out for a treat. We finish our food and get a taxi back to hers and we cuddle up in the back. (she&#039;s got me kind of cradled me into her shoulder/breast) I turn my head and look up at her and tell her quietly &quot;I love you mom&quot; she gives me a kiss on the forehead. We sat for a while just looking at each other in the eyes and before we realize what&#039;s happening we share a soft and tender kiss. The kisses remain soft and gentle as our hands slowly roam around each others body. Going places most would consider inappropriate for a mother and son to be touching. We get back to hers and head inside and go to sit on the couch. She straddles me and we kiss some more.

She bathed me like a mother would and then joined me in the tub where we cuddled up. After the water started to get cool, we got out dry and went to bed in her room together. There we slept spooning.

Worst sex of my entire life, but at least got laid.<br><br>Also in the US an ecuadorian woman literally jumped in front of me and started dancing as I walked into the bar with my friends (we kinda knew each other) She was really ugly. And then a few steps or nights after I had some other european woman jump in front of me and started making out with me. I didn&#039;t even want that.

Found out through other people that she had a crush on me. After 3 weeks we started dating (mostly her initiative). We dated for half a a year and both lost our virginities to each other. We constantly got into fights, because of personality differences. Our break up was mutual. <br><br>The third time was after a few months at a music festival.

I wanted to chat with her but I&#039;ve lost her in the crowd. We met again during the last concert where she asked for my facebook. Met up with her after afew weeks and introduced her to my friend group. I noticed her constantly faking enjoying our conversation in an effort to suck up to me. Found out from my friends that she had a major crush on me. Even said to one of them that she&#039;d blow me and pay me afterwards. I didn&#039;t want to rush anything because I&#039;ve only met up with her a few times and didn&#039;t know if we clicked (later found out we didn&#039;t).

People back then knew the fact that incest or inbreeding is a way to create perfect specimens. Inbreeding increases the chance of the genes of the parents reappearing massively, obviously. If the parents are gods or royalty, in the mind of the people: &quot;perfect humans&quot;, they want to have the best chance of having &quot;perfect&quot; offspring with those same genes. Inbreeding is a way to guarantee that.<br>Inbreeding also obviously makes the chance of the bad genes reappearing, like hereditary disorders, but in theory two people with flawless genes would only have flawless offspring. Incest doesn&#039;t actually lead to random mutations like &quot;common knowledge&quot; seems to think. It leads to less mutation and change. <br>It makes perfect sense that the most powerful god or the most powerful ruler would only want to breed with someone carrying their genes.<br><br>Ancient royalty inbreeding makes perfect sense to me. Back then they were basically gods compared to regular people, healthy, beautiful, educated, and most likely like a foot taller and stronger than normal people due to having actually good nutrition growing up and a more stress free lifestyle. No wonder they thought they should keep their &quot;bloodline pure&quot;. People didn&#039;t know about genetics, but they&#039;ve always known about certain attributes getting passed down from parents to kids.<br><br>Looking at it that way, it also makes perfect sense why incest was seen as bad for the common people.

They were so touchy that they gave of a pervert vibe immediately, couples aren&#039;t usually that close, I felt kind of awkward having to sit there.<br>They were also dressed very weirdly, in like bike shorts and both had very thin, tight shirts on. Like dressed overtly sexually, but still technically modest enough to not get kicked out of places. Woman was built like pic rel and was very eye catching. You could pretty much see the guys dick outline in his pants, I didn&#039;t look but I saw lol. They were both extremely good looking people, and the dude was very charismatic and funny.<br>We all went to the place we were going to and after touristing around they came to the same bar I went to to have a drink. We talked some more personal stuff, and after a while they mentioned that they were brother and sister. I was like wtf no you aren&#039;t, but then I noticed how similar they looked. They very obviously were. The sister kissed her brother on the cheek in front of me and laughed. Talked some more about random stuff, but after telling me, they seemed really like amused, like they were fucking with me.<br>Weird people.", "filename": "MFd83KX1NK70tgI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1469, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673944340154558, "time": 1673944340, "md5": "hL51h7sy0S7yCPK0vSkkxA==", "fsize": 185599, "resto": 71844969}, {"no": 71858324, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)03:42:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71857510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71857510</a><br>I remember seeing some on fansly openly saying they ere twins.

Quality amateur porn getting monetized is turning porn into a wild west situation, like a gold rush of people trying what makes the most money. People can control the content they make more and advertise it easily, so actual incest can now be posted. Now that a lot of people realize that real incest can make a LOT of money in porn, it will skyrocket in a few years. Because people now actually have a lot of different sites to publish their stuff on and moderate their environment themselves, they can easily advertise as real incest and then just claim to be roleplaying if their site starts looking into it, or their bank or something. Money has already been made by that point, even if they get banned or deleted.<br>Incest still being taboo and banned on many sites, yet easily produced, has created a massive money making opportunity.

Someone pointed out the real reason for the illogical fear of incest in some earlier thread, I can&#039;t remember the source but it seemed extremely simple and correct to me. The reason some/most people have an unexplainable aversion or even a certain type of fear against incest, is because they were disciplined by their parent or some other figure in their early childhood when they were curious of an opposite sex relatives body. It&#039;s natural that during development you become curious about the opposite sex at some point. This happens often between siblings, and if the parents discipline the kids for being curious, it gets literally beaten into them or just scared into them, that looking or touching a sibling is terrible. That&#039;s why as adults most people can&#039;t explain why they feel about incest the way they do, they remember the reaction of others but not the reason.<br>We explored each others bodies a lot with my sister as kids, just normal curiosity.

I knew inbreeding was more ok than common knowledge implies, but I had no idea there were studies showing positive effects that much. It makes perfect sense that inbreeding and especially brother/sister pairs like in https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg<wbr>2664-c2/ cause a sort of &quot;cleaning&quot; of the genome. The offspring will obviously be less diverse genetically, which can cause issues, but they will be genetically more fit than average as an individual.

Exploration is where it really stands out because outside of that it&#039;s your typical dailies/weeklies routine. Story is too safe to be amazing but it&#039;s not bad either, just your typical adventure story, although it shows that their writing is improving, Sumeru had pretty nice story dragged down only by those stupid looking forest potatoes. It&#039;s really comfy to play and explore, I like exploring, solving puzzles and historic story bits with Zhong or abyss chase with Dain are always the most interesting story parts, those drawn story animations are always kino and I enjoy them a lot. It satisfies my need for routine with steady content stream now that I&#039;m not teenager anymore and I don&#039;t have time to grind in MMORPGs or brew 2 kafras worth of pots for GvG through the night.<br><br>From the point of games in general is just okay. Dailies and gacha from this perspective are rather disadvantages, although I think people generally like routines because after a while games like CS and CoD turn into routine as well when after enough games you know which wall to shoot through or which bulding to throw grenade over to kill like 80% of rushing enemy team and then it turns into camping near objective spots/patrolling spots, so it&#039;s 90% the same. Gameplay is still comfy but story doesn&#039;t make that big of impression anymore and content sliced through the time might not be that good idea, though after some time you&#039;ll have more content than your typical game which in my opinion is a good thing. Music is really nice.<br><br>From the perspective of only &#039;modern&#039; games, I think it looks a bit better.
