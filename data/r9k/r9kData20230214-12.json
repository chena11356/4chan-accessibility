Intellectualism is frowned upon as middle class or upper middle class bullshit. Universities are burned or blown up. So are schools. The internet is restricted to a giant communal screen in the village. Everything must start from 1066 again in a nationalist-socialist Agrarian society.", "time": 1676365058, "resto": 72213906}, {"no": 72222136, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:01:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72222106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72222106</a><br>can&#039;t be any worse than the way things are now. might even bag a gf in such an environment", "time": 1676365273, "resto": 72213906}, {"no": 72222145, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Maddening how many times this bitch blinks whilst speaking<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvB<wbr>lPQjByd4<br><br>Obviously on some kind of upper", "time": 1676365341, "resto": 72213906}, {"no": 72222166, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:05:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72222106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72222106</a><br>I think you need to find employment", "time": 1676365500, "resto": 72213906}, {"no": 72222226, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)04:12:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72222136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72222136</a><br>My theory is based on looking at three trajectories.

Thanks for picking up the phone when I was saying goodbye as I was sure I was about to die even though I didnt tell you. You betrayed me though. You didnt realize how amazing I am and how I did everything in the world for you. I pushed myself past the breaking point and I never gave up. I was always there for you and always believed in you. Even when you betrayed me and lied to me I still believed in you. Too bad you didnt realize how strong I am. I endured everything even losing you which is the hardest thing that will ever happen to me. I was even biochemically tortured and I still stood back up. I used to think that you made me strong, but it was really me. I&#039;m the great thing, not you. I always hoped you would be and I did it all to lift you up to my level but you gave up on yourself and our future. I forgive you and accept that youre gone and you won&#039;t ever be good enough for me and who I&#039;ve become. You didnt deserve me then and you definitely don&#039;t now. Letting who you could have been and who that was to me go was nearly impossible, but I did it. All that was left was the reality of who you really were and that empty shell of who you really are means nothing to me. Im disappointed in how abusive and unloving you were. I&#039;ll always love that ghost of you that I never got to meet. I feel bad for you because you might one day realize all this and it will destroy you because it destroyed me and im infinitely stronger than you are and unlike my story there&#039;s no happy ending in yours so you have my pity.

I find it so pathetic how you worship and glorify that little loser excuse for a man you call a bf. I hate how reserved and cowardly you are about everything, you expect so much to be done for you. I hate how you think you know how to introspect but all you dwell on is blind self hate and reveling in being a victim. I can&#039;t believe you made me confirm these fucked up beliefs of femininity being equal to weakness, when there are so many girls who truly are competent and interesting and morally upstanding. I hate how my broken heart ignores them and stays stuck on your stupid ass. You genuinely don&#039;t have an ounce of self respect, and I despise how that reflects on me being here for you all this time.

Look at how the white girl gazes into him with pure enamored eyes. The white girls meekness and docile nature contrasts excellently with the black mans tough, hardened demeanor. For the innocent white girl to continue treading in this dark and cruel world she needs a strong, capable man who has seen all the darkness the world has to offer, stared into the abyss straight in its eyes with nothing but sheer determination, and came out of it as a battle hardened man. No other type of man fits that description better than the black male, for his resolve has proved to be immaculate in the face of many of the adversities they face in this country. The black man has shrugged off many of his inner and outer demons, and has come to terms with who he is and what he has been through. The black man now faces tasks with the utmost confidence, carries himself out in a way that is genuine and uplifting for those around him, and his strength exudes when faced with confrontation; the black man is not afraid of setting shit straight. The white women gawks in awe when they become personally connected with a black man, for she is not used to seeing such swagger, willpower and strength in her own white communities, where the men are more akin to boys than warriors. Her heart races with excitement when they see for themselves the toughened black mans resolve, his confidence, his humour.

some retard emotional and philosophical revelations i had about my problems, and that i was going to manage them with stimulant use.<br><br>some wise anon who seemed to have had a terrible history with stimulant or other hard drug abuse dug into me and did all of the correct things in order to scare me whilst in my altered state and warn me about the danger of addiction i was diving into head-first into. he refused to engage with my silly delusions or my fake, stimulant-induced good faith responses (i guess since its fake good i should say bad), and scared me enough to dump out all of the benzedrex i had left even though i had planned on not using again after that (because i thought i would have a steady supply of adderall instead, which is less harmful than propylhexedrine).<br><br>anyway, for reasons that would take awhile to explain, that event not too many days ago led me to find out that i have OCD, specifically a subtype Existential OCD which includes obsessions over existential/philosophical topics along with the absolute inability to tolerate uncertainty that characterizes OCD. i thought that my dysfunctional pacing around and &#039;thinking&#039; about the meaning of life for, at worst up to 6 hours but usually 1-2hrs a day was just my neurotic personality, but it turns out that its a neurotic pathology. go figure.<br><br>as can probably be figured from my writing, i am still taking stimulants and i must disappoint the anon that tried to get me to hard stop. i am not yet dependent, but that day will probably come soon-- thank you for trying to warn me, and i echo the warning to all others even though i have not fallen apart yet. i know now that my behavior and desire to use is an addiction, and for what it&#039;s worth i no longer deny that. im sorry to that anon, who probably remembers me if you&#039;re here.", "time": 1676289740, "resto": 72200880}, {"no": 72209386, "now":

mental problems prevent me from being productive. the OCD compulsions prevent me from enjoying things even when i am not compulsively performing them, since i am still obsessing about them.<br><br>i can&#039;t say it is only the OCD, because i have other problems too. the fact is that i have tried over the past few years very strongly to get my life together, but it continues to stay broken because i simply am not strong enough to do the right thing. this is not a justification for my use, this is an admission of weakness. an admission i probably would not be able to make if, as the previously mentioned anon had pointed out to me last time i stimposted, i wasn&#039;t extremely high on a drug that directly fires up my reward system.<br><br>my stimulant use has thus far made me able to be productive for time periods, certainly, however i recognize now that the main draw is of course how it just makes me feel good. one of the chilling things this anon said to me was something along the lines of &quot;with a high enough dose, you could receive news that would kill you with despair if you were sober, but still smile because your brain is all lit up from the drug&quot;. that was a truth i felt then enough to scare me to flush all of my retard-drug last time, and it is something i feel now. the OCD is still there while I am on stimulants, but it no longer inspires terrible agony inside of me. the drug cuts off the pain before it gets too deep and disables me, and it replaces it with that electric dopaminergic warmth. that is what i am addicted to, i suppose.<br><br>so, to anybody wondering about trying strong stimulants, i recommend you don&#039;t if you have bad mental problems (everybody on /r9k/) that you would like to be able to be free of. i liked what louis ck

but from what i gather there is addiction and there is hopeless addiction.<br><br>the first category seems to be filled with people who stay strongly in denial about their addiction but eventually come to terms with their behavior and understand that they are addicted, and try to beat the addiction. it seems that in many cases this takes time, and perhaps many fail, but they want to be helped and do stuff like go to rehab and try to be sober and whatnot<br><br>the second category seems to be filled with the people who, whether they are in denial or not, simply don&#039;t want to stop. they have no desire to stop-- i think these people often tend to be the ones to have nothing left to go back to when sober. they are the ones that don&#039;t want to be helped<br><br>i think i fall into this latter category. no doubt heartache and tears awaits me down this dark road i am staring down, but i think the fact is that i have nothing that makes me want to quit. if i stop doing stimulants i go back to the same life where most days i can&#039;t even get out of bed, where any productivity comes with the immense toll of fighting off my compulsions and ruminations, with the same pains over my own past events. even on stimulants, i still perform compulsions, but i am able to get some things done. i wrote about 4,000 words today. i have been studying mathematics again. but, again, mostly, the stimulants reduce the mental suffering that paralyzes me on most days sober. i don&#039;t choose addiction, even if i made the choices that lead to it. i just don&#039;t want to quit and i
