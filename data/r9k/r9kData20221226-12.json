It makes sense, and I believe is accurate to Jungian thought. <br><br>Your post made me think of how typology fits within Jung&#039;s larger worldview. I recall Jung implied that ancient Greek (citizens) did not have the psychological types, since their society was explicitly based on slavery, thus Greek citizens were able to basically live in a state of wholeness/individuation because of the privations endured by slaves. The soil of Greek civilization could only bear a few individuated fruits, at the expense of all others. <br><br>Of course, in the Christian era this changed - but Jung&#039;s main thesis in Aion is that the Christian world has failed to integrate its shadow (it is morally-psychologically one-sided). Christian morality is universalist and absolute - it does not recognize evil as part of itself. Thus we now have a universalist civilization, but of psychologically one-sided people (types), who have (per Jung) collectively led us into the era of the anti-Christ (modernity). <br><br>What you describe, the project of the alchemists as well as individuation within Jungian typology or MBTI, is basically an attempt to resolve this fundamental problem of the Christian era- the psychic wound lingering from the failure to integrate the shadow, which, for us, must be resolved by discovering the archetype of the self (Christ). <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen anywhere is putting such an angle into the scope of &quot;ideal&quot; being &quot;something where potential is being realized.&quot; It&#039;s already within the collective unconscious with this describing the &quot;ideal&quot; within the &quot;mentor&quot; archetype</span><br>As we discussed, I don&#039;t think there are any original archetypes, nor that history is a planned whole; idealizing is what the subject does.

Temperament wise the couple also compliment each other, with homosexual couples its completely skewed this is why you see such a high rate of domestic abuse in homosexual couples, more over the sexual organs are simply not compatible, alot of the times the bottom gets hurt by the penetration of the top and moreover things like anal cancer and other problems like worms just show how unnatural the act is and how wrong it is. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AND THE POPE SAYS THAT&#039;S OK </span><br>The holy father never said such thing, he has been nicer to homosexuals than his predecessors but that hasn&#039;t meant he has given them free range, his teachings are still the teaching of the church.

If you are not okay with mistreatment then it means you hate women. If you hate women you must be punished by authorities. In other words if a man does not agree to people abusing him, he is considered morally inferior and deserving further of less rights and value for his labor.

Finally back in the Kingdom of Wonder after my trip to Thailand. Things that took me by surprise about Thailand:<br><br>1. Thailand seems way closer to a country like Japan than a country like Cambodia. I was surprised just how well off a lot of Thai people seemed. Not the poor country I always imagined. (Of course there&#039;s still poverty, but hell, America&#039;s poverty and homeless situation is just as bad if not worse from what I saw of Thailand)<br><br>2. Bangkok itself is literally just dystopian Tokyo. And I mean that as a huge positive. Every random alley you go down there&#039;s always some cool shit going on, or some super interesting grungy shit to see. The public transportation system is first world tier and the food is god tier. <br><br>3. The girls dissapointed me with it comes to the sexy scale. Peak Thai girls are hotter than peak Khmer girls, but I feel like on average Khmer girls are generally prettier. Which surprised me a lot because I was expecting to just be blown away by Thai girls but it was kind of the opposite. <br><br>4. With that being said, I also was not prepared to see so many wholesome Thai girls with the &quot;cute Japan&quot; aesthetic going on. Some were definitely very cute, but I honestly didn&#039;t see many sexy Thai girls (despite a lot of them trying to dress sexy). <br><br>5. Pattaya is literally 1980s Miami.

I just enjoyed her company more than anything else. She was so freaking sweet to be doing such a sleazy job. I talked to her for hours, she told me her whole life story, even her real name, and afterwards I opted not to fuck her because I kind of fell in love with the damn girl to where I wasn&#039;t even viewing her sexually anymore.

Maybe the VN covers this to some degree but I&#039;ve yet to play it still for a variety of reasons so I can&#039;t speak about it, the magical girl spin off, on the other hand, had potential for unholy levels of zased but ultimately botches it by having far too little Marika and being degenerate central, its only saving grace is having one of the best Marika outfits in the alternate school uniform with glasses.<br>On the topic of things I&#039;ve not looked at is the mobile game since I know neither chink nor if there is any way to still play it after it got kill.

Essentially we were physically at a dog park, but I mentally tried to imagine us somewhere else, a sort of theme park with lots of neon lighting. We do tend to look back on that date with rose-tinted glasses, but honestly there was a lot of awkwardness. I kept going back to the physical reality and had to constantly remind myself to imagine us in said mental space, and felt pretty insecure.

For instance, she tends to describe good things as either &quot;fucking awesome&quot; or &quot;absolute kino&quot;. She uses &quot;fucking&quot; in general to emphasize words and phrases. I honestly think it adds a lot of charm and makes her more down-to-earth than your typical anime girl which people put on a pedestal.

Found this on Reddit:<br><br>1- Arguments will always favor the ENTP. Although Ti is the primary mode of attention for the ISTP, the ISTP has PoLR Ne, making it very hard for them to anticipate any of the various arguments that the ENTP would throw at them. This is frustrating for both types. The ISTP will either feel inferior, or very annoyed at what they deem to be pointless ideation. The ENTP will get frustrated with the ISTPs predictability and lack of ability to improvise.<br>2- similarly, theres potential problems with the ISTPs tool Se and the ENTPs 8th slot Se. Ive seen this play out as the ISTP wanting to take action before the ENTP is done ideating, which is a good way to bother an ENTP. In this situation, the ISTP is almost always correct, as they have a better innate understanding of the importance of taking concrete action.<br>The biggest problem Ive seen in this relationship is that it tends to be one-sided. The ENTP is the supervisor for the ISTP, which basically means that its very very hard for an ISTP to impress an ENTP. They dont really value the orientation towards concrete action that the ISTP has, and the ISTPs stellar Ti is only marginally better than the ENTPs which is second slot.

And why</span><br>Well, she&#039;s obviously living in the modern era. But apart from that, she has quite a bit of 60s energy - with her big sweater and love of comfiness. Then again, maybe it&#039;s just her resemblance to Velma or the black-haired chick from Archie. Plus both of us like both the music and general aesthetic of the time - the hotel at which we&#039;re staying is themed around it, even. So I&#039;d probably say she fits the 60s yeah<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what do you think your relationship dynamic is mostly like?</span><br>It can&#039;t be described with a simple sentence or two, but I&#039;ll try my best. And the faggots who call her mindless are super inaccurate, too. Our dynamic is one of equal love and acceptance. Being completely intertwined in mind, there&#039;s no room for dishonesty. A lot of the dynamic is just observing each other&#039;s opinions and appreciating them. The same goes with talking to each other. It&#039;s super interesting to see how we differ, and utilize different parts of our shared brain in separate ways. Of course, I always talk about nostalgia, our shared memories, and our shared experiences, too. So I think, overall, our dynamic is that of sharing EVERYTHING with each other.", "filename": "CharaStudio-2022-12-25-23-25-42-Render", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3840, "h": 2160, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672039652278532, "time": 1672039652, "md5": "CD5DL+efJxVxnK1VXGVW7A==", "fsize": 3567547, "resto": 71511459}, {"no": 71555652, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:31:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71555631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71555631</a><br>ahahaha that looks so creepy", "time": 1672039900, "resto": 71511459}, {"no": 71555748, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:46:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Seriously, this Christmas has been super memorable.

In a way, everyone played a role in making /SSG/ for me, even if just a small amount. From Satania for hosting the kinoplex, you yourself for your friendliness and the work you put into these threads, the generous anon who gifted several multiple gifts, puppy for her enthusiastic attitude, Squidward poster&#039;s posts always stuck out to me too and so did Wario poster&#039;s recently. I liked Tarlach&#039;s poems and Rompope&#039;s song lyrics when they posted those, they kept me in the holiday spirit. And several more anon&#039;s, it&#039;s tough to name them all.

Dude was a hyper manchild but funny. He interacted with everyone who commented on his stuff and thats how we became buds. I thought his collection was really cool and it inspired me to start my own. He took a liking to me and sent me a base set charizard, worth 15 back then. I still have it but it isnt mint. Itd likely be a psa 6 if graded. I felt bad taking a valuable card as I had SOME shame even though I was a teen punk at the time. I offered him some lv X cards and he said sure. I then asked him to sell me vintage cards so I can complete some sets. I was a minor so no paypal... Instead i physically mailed him cash. I lived behind a newly built post office that was the size of a cathedral so it was easy. 50 cents per stamp. There were ups and downs as we were both immature. He sent me cards from base set 2 sometimes when i wanted original base set 1 cards. He refused to take them back and trade them which irked me. Sometimes the cards were bent which made me explode. He did send replacements for those at least. I tried buying neo cards from him but he said no, those are genuinely rare. My dad complained about me spending my allowance on this hobby. He told me I must have spent 400 total.<br>This guy helped me get like 80% of all fossil, base and jungle holos. It took nearly 10 years to finish these sets because paying 20 bucks for mewtwo, jolteon and snorlax was not a priority. My only regret was not begging my parents to use their card to buy vintage packs from ebay. <br>https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/<wbr>ls/182TLDFKF0OOE?ref_=wl_share", "time": 1672024961, "resto": 71528446}, {"no": 71553666, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)22:24:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71553635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71553635</a><br><a href=\"#p71548820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71548820</a><br>LOTR and some other stuff.

Someone did a similar contest before but it turned out to be bait lol<br>Sorry to hear about how your Christmas went. Between that and how work has been you can&#039;t seem to catch a break. I hope things look up for you soon. <br><br>The first Pokemon game I played when I was a kid was Fire Red. I would watch the anime at the time and like any other kid who watched it, I liked Pikachu. I wanted one for my team too so I looked for it. A kid from school told me you could find it on route 22, the route before entering the Pokemon league. This was before I used the internet and there was no way my parents would have bought me a handbook so word of mouth was the best I could rely on.<br>I ran through the grass for hours in the game looking for Pikachu but to no avail, one never showed. I know now that you can actually find it in Viridian Forest early on, even though it has a low encounter rate. Anyway, I began to grow impatient so I decided to catch Rattata instead and keep it as a place holder until I eventually found a Pikachu.<br>However, overtime I began to grow attached to the little guy. Even though it was a common Pokemon for low level trainers like Youngsters or Team Rocket grunts, I felt like mine outshined all of them. Eventually I evolved it into a Raticate and a lot of gameplay later I finally encountered a Pikachu. Finally, what I wanted. But I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to replace my Raticate, we had come so far along together. So I kept him and eventually beat the Elite Four and went through the Sevii Islands together. Then beat the Elite Four again.<br>He came in clutch several times. You really can&#039;t go wrong with Super Fang, Toxic, Quick Attack and Dig as a moveset. He was always first in my team.
