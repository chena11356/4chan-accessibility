If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>\n2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>\n3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, \nyour mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>\n4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot.

That&#039;s one year compared to nearly 15 years of childhood trauma. I doubt I&#039;ll ever be the same. As much as you blame all of it on bipolar, you never once tried to change, get help, or make up for it. No, buying me something nice isn&#039;t making up for it. Even then, if you only made up for it with hugs, kisses, sorries, and cuddling, it wouldn&#039;t make it okay. At the end of the day, your refusal to change, go to the mental ward, get a therapist, or talk to your psych openly and honestly instead of &quot;I don&#039;t just snap at people randomly, they bring it on&quot; like I&#039;ve heard you say over and over on telehealth appointments is bullshit. I did not deserve to be punched, hit, thrown around, my belongings broken, your belongings broken, glass all over, windows, doors, and walls broken for anything. After a while I lost all attraction to you, being with you felt like trying to get used to having a knife periodically stabbed into my leg, and the good moments felt like cuddling a cold concrete brick that occasionally jacked me off. Even after that, I wanted to stay because of the promises you made that it was just mania and that you usually aren&#039;t like this. I hoped it&#039;d get better and that it&#039;d go back to feeling like being with the one person who understood my own mental illnesses because we had the same ones, laying next to the softest warmest teddy bear, and feeling like my entire head and chest was buzzing with welcomeness and love. Now, you only ever snort lines, scream about everyone being sociopaths, and call me a piece of shit for &quot;not getting you&quot;. I have bipolar too, I get psychosis too, we both have had trauma, but if I have freakouts and slip into mania or psychosis, I don&#039;t beat people until they&#039;re bleeding, I don&#039;t refuse help and beat the people who suggest it ...", "time": 1675139904, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035429, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:47:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "meaghan<br>my birthday tomorrow... all i want is to hear from you. i&#039;m doing so well i bought a house with the money i was saving up for us i&#039;ve done a lot and thought a lot.. i still have faith in you and i&#039;m waiting for you. i&#039;ve done so much just for us and i&#039;ve made some mistakes but you too have and we reflect and think about eachother, i want to do so many things with you. everyday i&#039;m waiting i miss you<br>john", "time": 1675140437, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035437, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:48:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72035300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72035300</a><br>I am a J otherwise I would not be replying to you, Anonymous.", "time": 1675140488, "resto": 72022805}, {"no": 72035440, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)23:48:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p72035349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;72035349</a><br>Cont.<br>When I&#039;m asked if I&#039;m okay, I don&#039;t punch them, when I see someone&#039;s upset, I don&#039;t take it personally, when I learn about someone&#039;s trauma, I don&#039;t call them a pussy for not wanting to be in places or situations that remind them of it, I don&#039;t blame people for not accepting when I do something shitty because of my mental illnesses, and lastly, when someone disagrees with me I don&#039;t get so upset that I nearly fucking murder them, and if I did do all of that, I would want to change. I would want to change so fucking much that I would have an entire mental health team, and maybe a neurologist just in case. After a while, you told me I had anger problems. Truth is I only agreed with you to avoid another fight. Before I moved in with you, the only fights I would have were while my mother was an alcoholic and minor arguments when my brother would try to rush me because I am too slow at a lot of tasks. You know what I did after those fights? Learn, try to get my mother help to quit drinking, try to speed up me doing chores. After I moved in with you is when I started having anger problems. I&#039;m not like you, at all, and even though part of me has hope you&#039;ll get better, proper medications, maybe even finally get a therapist, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m finally moving back to the house that originally gave me the trauma for a PTSD diagnosis. Maybe I do hate you, but I still love you, and I can only hope with time away that I stop both hating you and loving you. <br>But now, moving away brings another set of problems, since you are convinced everyone around you is sociopaths right now, you have all of my legal information memorized.

All it really would mean is that narcissists on average have more kids than the average person does, but there are plenty of things that correlate with fertility. For example intelligence is negatively correlated with fertility(meaning dumb people have more kids on average than smart people), albeit not too strongly and your politics is pretty well correlated with fertility(that being socially conservative individuals tend to have more kids). You&#039;d be a narcissist if you believed your needs are above others, that you&#039;re a very important person and that you&#039;re especially great. Generally you&#039;d also put in an excessive amount of time and effort into your appearance(more than would be normal for your peers) and that isn&#039;t necessarily just physical appearance but also how you appear morally/socially to others(I.E. you care more about how others perceive you in just about all senses). Narcissists also tend to care a lot about the kind of company they have and generally prefer being with people who&#039;re deemed important. Further narcissists tend to be incapable of understanding people other than themselves. If you genuinely care about others around you and will take their needs into consideration at the expense of your own interests then you&#039;re pretty far off from a narcissist.

He said that he had faith Centaur would do a push-up after fighting with him for days. He defended me in September. He never seemed to hold very long grudges even after I was horrible to him in arguments, despite the fact that he would have been justified to do so. I liked when he told off that one anon for making fun of someone&#039;s speech skills. The fact that he suppresses his sadistic tendencies is a good thing in itself, but I gained a greater appreciation for that when he said that he doesn&#039;t really enjoy much of anything.

For one, I know that I have a lot of expectations placed upon me to be perfect. This can feel very overwhelming at times and make me feel like I&#039;m not good enough. I also feel pressured by society to be a certain type of person. This can be very stressful for me as I often feel like I&#039;m not living up to what people expect from me. Since I&#039;m an introvert I feel like I need to force myself to be more outgoing and social in order to meet people&#039;s expectations of me.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you cope with pressure?</span><br>That&#039;s a tough question. I think the most important thing is to remember that I can only do my best and that it&#039;s okay to make mistakes. When I feel like I&#039;m under too much pressure, I usually try to take a step back and focus on what&#039;s important to me. I also try to let myself feel whatever I&#039;m feeling and not push it away. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone about what I&#039;m going through, or just to take some time for myself. Sometimes I like to take a bath or go for a walk or spend time with a friend who makes me feel calm.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your favorite candle scent</span><br>I love the scent of flowers.

Many of them are bullshit or aren&#039;t really proven. But there isn&#039;t much more about psychologists, they ask you what is your problem, then about your life, relationship with your parents, then they give you some psychological explanation of what happens to you and finally they try different therapies or drugs to see if something helps you. I have read that most of the times they give you one pill and see if it works, if it doesn&#039;t , then they try another one. They can&#039;t know exactly what you need.

I don&#039;t seek out news from them or anything. 95% of it is going to be complete dogshit, and then a lot of that remaining 5% is going to be stuff that just isn&#039;t for me but is still decently made.

The money goes into graphics and celebrity voice actors and figuring out how to make the gameplay as inoffensive as possible to as many people as possible.

Never even considered approaching women due to variety of reasons. Had some very traumatizing events in my life 4 months ago (nothing to do with relationships). Barely walked out of killing myself.<br>Over the last 2 years, I gradually grew to crave some intimacy.

You can imagine the anxiety I experience from even thinking about going out. I am so afraid of rejection and being perceived as a creep that I started hating myself more than ever before. I feel genuine gut-wrenching disgust. I wish I simply kept playing video games and eating junk without a care in my life, because I can&#039;t cope with the stress. I have also been steadily doing some mild self-improvement shit to my body, but with every step I feel like I realize how much of a fuckup I am even more and grow to hate myself for wasting my life all these years. Ignorance was a bliss.

I&#039;ll go over a few of the obvious ones.<br><br>1. Player vs Player. Self explanatory. PvP is exciting.<br>2. Push and pull gameplay. One team takes a lead, the other can take it back. One sided blowouts remove uncertainty and thrill, making the game boring<br>3. The reversal of fortune. All the big sports have this. The <br>Gridiron football has the interception and fumble, baseball has the home run. Hockey is chaos on ice and 3 goals can be scored in under a minute. Association football is so low scoring that any drive or mistake could result in a game winning goal. Basketball just moves so fast and is so high scoring that a team can pick up momentum and score 5 baskets back to back to back to back and close a 10 point deficit. A slight error in NASCAR can send the lead car to the back of the pack. These moments can happen at any time, and are a great surprise when they happen. Even gold has the occasional ace, albatross, or insane 30 foot putt to generate big hype.<br>4. Balanced rosters and leagues. If people wanted to see a display of skill then leagues would be open and all the top talent would gravitate to one or two franchises. Salary caps and restrictions ensure that competition is close and outcomes are uncertain. This is why nobody cares about college basketball until March madness. The lesser games are all runaway steamrollings.<br><br>If you want to understand sports, take $100 and deposit it ton a sports book. Place some bets, then watch the games.
