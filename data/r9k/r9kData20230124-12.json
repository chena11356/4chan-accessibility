An INTJ meanwhile creates a project as a form of passion, it may take more time to plan and get started, but when they do they tend to be extremely committed.

While such cases, likely caused by lack of introspection, are, in the long run, are cases of self-solving problems (at some point, the obsessed will either get over it or will just collapse due to consequences of actions stemming from no foresight), it&#039;s important to not allow oneself to be collateral damage of others&#039; downfalls.<br>And, besides, by mentally assessed statistical extrapolation (that should be accurate enough for me to not want it to back it up (as some knowledge is not a big factor)), no more people using techniques described in that book would use those techniques for purposes of genuine communications than compared to other people.<br>Of course, people&#039;s attempts can be played along with as long as there&#039;s no risk/loss in doing so.

Fapping to BBC is a case of internalized external values. The average r9ker who feels ashamed about fapping to bbc feels so due to knowing society (4chan) disapproves of it. They don&#039;t feel &quot;evil&quot; because of it or anything like that, just ashamed. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guilt: The regret of having done wrong. </span><br>Meaning: not being innocent, having done something that breaches an internal value system, or that of the &quot;inner critic&quot;.

It&#039;s the ultimate taboo. If we look at it from a normie perspective, it&#039;s the one thing that CANNOT happen to a mother and son relationship. Not only physically speaking, but mentally too. It&#039;s not just that a normie would think the desire to impregnate your mom is disgusting, they probably assume that it&#039;s impossible to exist at all, totally unthinkable.<br><br>Out of all the things people want from momcest, impregnating your own mom is probably the rarest that could realistically happen. I think even in these threads I&#039;ve seen some saying that inbreeding is too far for them, and this is literally the thread for motherfuckers. With anal it&#039;s more like they&#039;re either into it or not, but with pregnancy it&#039;s like it&#039;s the one thing that mustn&#039;t happen.<br><br>And now imagine the scenario itself. She is the woman that gave birth to you. When she held you in her arms as a newborn, she probably thought of the future that is ahead of you. At some point she probably thought about how your future wife is gonna look like and she is eager to eventually see your kids, her grandkids and play with them.<br>But instead what happened is that somehow you ended up wanting her instead, and somehow she let it happen. And even then, there is still a possible out, you can stop your relationship and try to go back to normal. But that possibility gets obliterated when you actually impregnate her. Even the act itself changes things. Imagine making love to your mom, she&#039;s fertile and not on the pill and you both know this, and either you&#039;re just too into it or maybe both of you even want it. Either way you shoot everything you have deep inside her and then you look into her eyes and give her a passionate kiss. You both know that this is not just sex, but the desire to mate and procreate, despite being mother and son. And all of this is just the start. You and your mom will be a couple and raise a child.

The good news is, life gets better when you accept that your mental state is rock bottom and you choose to reach out for help. What you&#039;re doing now is reaching out for help and I&#039;m telling you the solution is simple. Understand your mind through daily practice of meditation, learn your thoughts and why you think those thoughts, and when you think those thoughts, and where you were when you thought those thoughts. Then, simply let the thought go and breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Count to 4 in and 4 out. For deeper relaxation, 4 in, 6 out.

This site is supposed to be anonymous, breaking from that In order to prop urself up as a regular user of the site is against what the site is designed around and for, and goes against the reason why many people are here in the first place. The site is to be a place where discussions could happen independently of opinions being attached to notable figures or people you like or hate and thus forcing the opinion to stand on its own. Tripcodes only really exist for rare instances where knowing the identity of a poster is important to whatever is going on in the thread.

Never really faltering me. But lately it just feels like I cant get the same pleasant high from it anymore. And this is not because of tolerance, I always take breaks after like 2 months and the withdrawals always have been negligeable but recently I just feel like Kratom doesnt do shit anymore for me. No matter the t-break I just seldomnly really feel it and it doesnt compare to the times before.

Just today I was spending my &quot;high&quot; being sleepy and going to bed... <br><br>Is there a way to recover the pleasant effects? Warm euphoria, motivation, comfort is it all gone, no matter the t break? Forever?? That would be devastating... Is my only option switching to a heavier hitting opi like ODSMT?? Wont I lose effects on that one too after some time? Is this just the sad reality of opioids? I cant imagine that...

It&#039;s actually pretty a mild in moderate sane doses (25-100 mg max). People seem to run into trouble when they start dosing above 100 mg regularly or start dosong daily. t&#039;s a very stimulating opiod and last a long time. It&#039;s also as safe as any opiod is gonna get. It WILL cause dependent and surprisingly grimy withdrawals considering how mild it is, which is why you would ideally only dose once, MAYBE twice a week responsibly. If you believe you have that self control I would recommend it, save it for something to look forward to during the week or if you need the energy or pain relief. Keep the kratom as the daily driver (assuming your a daily user). Kratom also does a fine job diminishing the withdrawals of ODSMT if you do end up dependant, gabapentin helps too and doctors will percribw those pretty freely. Just try not to take any kratom 24-36 hours prior to your odsmt dose as it will dampen the effects . Don&#039;t do anything stronger than odsmt (hypocritical coming from me and my recent 2map post lol, but just trust me).

If you plan on using daily, just your self a favor and stick to kratom, odsmt withdrawals suck much more than kratom. Also, In my experience, it&#039;s best to wait 24-36 hours after your last kratom dose before dosing any other opiods, it will block their effects, but stronger ones like fent and heroin will break through. Odsmt won&#039;t. Taking kratom the day after odsmt works though, at least for me. As far as loosing the kratom magic, if you took an extended break of several months I bet you would regain it, maybe not completely l, but it might be worth a try. I wish you luck anon.

I think it&#039;s only to be expected, politics is the go-to platform to express one&#039;s values, beliefs, morality... and all of those one could argue, are what constitutes someones identity. And if you can&#039;t express your identity then you can&#039;t really exist in a society, hence why these kinds of opinions tend to be quite important to people. And of course there is also the simple practicality of the monopoly of violence being the main machinery which influences your food prices, employment conditions, freedoms and so on. Therefore even if someone isn&#039;t of a particularly opinionated mind, they might still find themselves getting political just to maintain basic subsistence.<br>So it does make sense that someone might care deeply about a friends political position, but if one cares even more about one&#039;s own and if one realizes that there is often many ways to skin a dead cat - then one might actually welcome a debate (if it&#039;s in good faith ofc). Furthermore those filters that we put to generalize peoples views (to navigate political discourse more easily) tend to become quite lax when in company of good friends. So you could expect a earnest and nuanced discussion instead of a instinctual reaction from them.<br>But you know your friends better anyone anon, so it&#039;s of course up to you to decide!
