We never showered at the same time after childhood, but at that time being in the same room while the other was washing up was still fine, we just didn&#039;t do it usually and gave each other privacy. I went to take a shower and had already undressed and going in when my sister said something, she was in the bathtub and I didn&#039;t notice her still being there. I was a bit embarrassed but I was already going in the shower so I did. We talked there while I washed, the tub was in a sort corner so I could wash just barely out of sight if I leaned right. She had huge tits already at this point, but I could still stop myself from looking at them too much. It was hard when we were looking directly at each other while talking. She was playing around in the tub and asked me something I couldn&#039;t hear. I leaned over to ask her what, and she was kind of swimming and turning around with her ass up. I could see her pussy splash out in to view above the water with her ass pointing towards me. At this point my body decided that it was too much and I got a boner. It wouldn&#039;t go down and she saw it after a while. I just excused myself and went to dry off and left soon later. <br>This was possibly a life changing moment now that I consider it.

I forgot to address the findom thing. I understand it as a fetish, I think having that deep level of control, and watching someone struggle with the indecisiveness over whether to relinquish their money or not can be cute, but it doesn&#039;t necessarily do anything for me personally I don&#039;t need the money and in the end I&#039;d rather just send it back after a bit of RP but if they know that beforehand it takes away the stakes for them and makes them struggle less which isnt fun. In the end its way more work for 0 personal sexual pleasure on my part so not something I like to peruse but I can play along once or twice. <br>https://voca.ro/1hHY8AVZT1aR", "filename": "uLLxeDRBF18hHsuuUjyDeiTgyVJ1aAJvvX2Q_y1F99A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 880, "h": 867, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1669569127011802, "time": 1669569127, "md5": "9izKPh+BXN9La+hL3oSPAA==", "fsize": 115212, "resto": 71129669}, {"no": 71154889, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:21:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p71154778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;71154778</a><br>Why are you so soulless.", "time": 1669569666, "resto": 71129669}], "last_modified": 1669569666}]}, {"page": 4, "threads": [{"no": 71154779, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:12:10", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "R.i.p to my nigga Madeline Mclaughlin", "com": "Real niggas die yung fr", "filename": "1666277703341956", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 2560, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669569130390006, "time": 1669569130, "md5": "p25wsb3hjpQeiCM/GYnNnw==", "fsize": 1876432, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "rip-to-my-nigga-madeline-mclaughlin", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 1, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 71154886, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:20:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "yeah most women are dropping dead, pfizerchuds keep losing", "filename": "1662242912876356", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 658, "h": 658, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669569658842085, "time": 1669569658, "md5": "+PxacEigr4payRI0GkafKA==", "fsize": 112071, "resto": 71154779}], "last_modified": 1669569658}, {"no": 71139648, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)11:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any other fembots here want to hypothetically groom a shota?

It feels like for years everytime someone in my family has to make a life decision they always somehow come up with a retarded solution? Even when I sit down with them and explain a more rational decision or solution to a problem. Typically, one that takes way less work and actually fixes the problem they refuse to listen. It&#039;s like they can&#039;t make rational decisions or they&#039;re npc&#039;s coming up with solutions that keep a plot moving forward. It&#039;s like they&#039;re retardedly stubborn. It&#039;s seems like most people are like this and I&#039;ve just submitted to the idea that endlessly frustrating myself trying to help hapless retards isn&#039;t worth it when they never take my advice. I just sit back quietly and just enjoy watching the antiques that come out of them endlessly failing.", "filename": "pepe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 468, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 228, "tim": 1669563477670445, "time": 1669563477, "md5": "jMal1YaKfd2Wo6HtKJfi8A==", "fsize": 18942, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-is-it-with-people-and-having-bad-decision", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1669563477}]}]
