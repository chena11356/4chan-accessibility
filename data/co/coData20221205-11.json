Also we should make a decision on what exactly the relationship between Astray and Tamau was before Penumbra and Momet got together.<br>-Penumba and Momet fall in love<br>-Penumbra and Momet marry<br>-Penumbra and Momet have Comet together<br>-Nebulious gets involved with Baastanian affairs in some way<br>-Some Tamautians get involved with attacking the Astray homeworld<br>-Momet winds up imprisoned/kidnapped<br><br>And tentative story beat, I suggested the idea that at the end of the Nebulious arc, Momet would be held prisoner on one of his dark ships (and the bad guys do the dramatic villainous move where they try to make the heroes choose between saving Trancia and saving Momet), but I think her initial imprisonment would be on Tamau, so if that happens it would mean at some point she is either stolen from her Baastanian captors or there is some kind of deal.<br>That last one might just not happen, free to just nix my ideas if you&#039;re all against them anyway.
