But besides maybe the mayor, are they driving the key events of the episodes because of the way they are? Their interaction with the main cast in order to build the narrative is their most vital reason for existing. Do they hold a grudge? Does their stubbornness cause an avoidable catastrophe? Are they so overly talented or overly attached the cast ends up in over their heads? <br>And even more importantly are they all genuinely diverse in their dispositions, or are they all eventually prone to outbursts of goofiness, undermining their roles for the sake of making a moment silly? Sometimes you need to sacrifice a minor reaction or a gag to build up a much bigger and more satisfying joke, but many many writers instead choose to sacrifice the integrity of their character to make a silly face or dumb moment for easy comedic gratification.
