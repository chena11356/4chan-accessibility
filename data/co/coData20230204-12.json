Certain characters and dynamics get more focus over others, for example Kyle and Cartman&#039;s rivalry becomes much more prevalent in the seasons after 7.

If they had just carried on with his continuity, maybe bit the bullet and recast actors earlier, and just generally carried on trying stuff, they\u2019d probably right now have a half way decent canon comparable to the MCU that was maybe a phase or so behind depending on how rigid you wanted to be about it. But all this crowing about not having the perfect start, the ego over whose fault it was and how they can reboot while still honoring old contracts, just left them spinning their wheels for over 6 fucking years and now no one is left in the audience to give a shit. If you cared about the Snyder canon, you\u2019re fucked because they\u2019ve dumped it, if you wanted a fresh slate you\u2019re fucked too because they\u2019re not fully dumping it just clearing away clutter. Either way there\u2019s nothing to latch onto, which is what Marvels secret has been for years. The MCU was never perfect, it fucked up constantly, but that unified central \u201ccontinuity\u201d they had kept people under the illusion it was going somewhere and now they won\u2019t quit watching even when it\u2019s become clear that the post Endgame era is directionless. WB meanwhile was always getting themselves twisted up over what Reddit thinks, fumbling to stand out yet be familiar yet be varied yet be uniform. The riddle of \u201chow do we undo Man of Steel\u201d was always as simple as just trying again with a different director or script in the sequel and not worrying about the first one so much. Cavil should\u2019ve been retired from the role already but with 4 films under his belt and being regarded as the modern Reeves. But instead his legacy is one of being jerked around and wasting his best years waiting for a chance that never came.

We&#039;re just telling more superhero, Guardians of the Galaxy stories, just using a different medium. It would be like if someone else was going to release another Guardians of the Galaxy comic book, you wouldn&#039;t necessarily need to go through and read all the previous comic books and pick and choose what you want to use.

You&#039;ve got your Infinity Gauntlet tie-ins, eyepatch Strange, but also things like Secret Defenders and Midnight Sons tie-ins. It&#039;s not high literature, or essential reading, but if you like Strange already they&#039;re good. There&#039;s still atmosphere, narration, epic scales, nothing like the awful recent runs like Aarons with the puking and quipping and all that trash. As a completionist of my favourite characters, I got them. If you&#039;re a casual fan looking for the best stories in the medium, I can&#039;t tell you that they&#039;re worth 300$ all in all. But if you know what you&#039;re walking into, they are great and entertaining 90s magical capestories. There&#039;s no edge and pouches overload, not even Paradox is that bad, or the Lennon makeover, it&#039;s just not some groundbreaking run. I personally collect them all, but I feel the same way for most cape runs these days.

The flashback issue that was released the same month as the Civil War movie had King&#039;s story trying to make it look like Wanda and Vision were always doomed from the start, and had egregious retcons like Vision always knowing their twins weren&#039;t real (in a comic published ten years after they ended up being real and coming back).<br><br>If Cain&#039;s Vision mini had been published, I imagine it would have been even worse, though I am curious about Volton being in it, that&#039;s an obscure deep cut.", "filename": "1590422110515", "ext": ".png", "w": 1224, "h": 1158, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1675510597772813, "time": 1675510597, "md5": "y0xJXXextz21qvhlDZTGuw==", "fsize": 2236129, "resto": 135358598}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 135359332, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)05:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((agent stones)))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a conspiracy theorist named sticks</span><br><br>it practically writes itself", "filename": "sticksandstones", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675508028668982, "time": 1675508028, "md5": "XejvEWDhYIUYAq0O0jKwsQ==", "fsize": 2038988, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "agent-stones", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 135359361, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)05:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "stick&#039;s thick unshaven bush...", "time": 1675508305, "resto": 135359332}, {"no": 135359422, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:08:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Knuckles has trust issues ever since eggman&#039;s betrayal.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He meets someone even more paranoid than him who breaks him out of his mental state.</span>", "time": 1675508897, "resto": 135359332}, {"no": 135359556, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)06:36:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "would sega even give the greenlight to using sticks ever again", "time": 1675510567, "resto": 135359332}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 135346805, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:06:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why the chubby face?", "filename": "83939333", "ext": ".png", "w": 766, "h": 724, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 236, "tim": 1675447583815380, "time": 1675447583, "md5": "I8hMFdPwCtxDocqU8inreA==", "fsize": 500664, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-the-chubby-face", "custom_spoiler": 5, "replies": 101, "images": 31, "unique_ips": 63, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 135346827, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:08:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Because she&#039;s fat, anon <s>and that&#039;s not a bad thing</s>", "time": 1675447684, "resto": 135346805}, {"no": 135346838, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p135346805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;135346805</a><br>She really should have been a creole girl and the movie be about her.", "time": 1675447720, "resto": 135346805}, {"no": 135346993, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p135346827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;135346827</a><br>Who would even assume that&#039;s a bad thing?", "filename": "bb84220f9347a9e6c28ad8146fe604fffd0d5bcb", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675448391135496, "time": 1675448391, "md5": "Y5VVfIGRNm+tZ6Sl6xUmPg==", "fsize": 1974487, "resto": 135346805}, {"no": 135347052, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:24:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p135346993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;135346993</a><br>Low-testoids", "time": 1675448649, "resto": 135346805}, {"no": 135347127, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)13:28:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s supposed to make her look cute without being too pretty to outshine Tiana.

WE asked for this shit to happen.<br><br>Because companies go where the money is and that is what we decide, the reaction to Spider-Verse seems to be a factor over how this movie was written, even tho Spider-Verse was initially written by talented directors who wanted to tell a Masterful Black Story, not a Multiverse Epic. <br><br>Normal movies are becoming an Artform from the past, everything now must be connected to one Giant Cinematic Universe.

In this survey, 80% of people worldwide identified as heterosexual, 3% as homosexual, 4% as bisexual, and 1% each as pansexual, asexual, and other. Results indicated that significant differences in sexual identity have emerged between generations across the globe, with the youngest group, or Generation Z, being more likely to identify as bisexual (9%) than Millennials (4%), Generation X (3%) and Boomers (2%). Generation Z and Millennials were also more likely to identify as homosexual, with 4% and 3% doing so respectively, compared to 2% of Generation X and 1% of Boomers. In addition, the survey found that men are more likely than women to identify as homosexual (4% vs. 1%).

Fine, they die easily but can be summoned for a bit of gold. You can magically see through their eyes making them excellent scouts. They don&#039;t do much in combat (unless they are an owl) but that&#039;s okay.<br><br>The beastmaster ranger however? when it first came out it was considered the worst class/subclass in the game. In order to have the beast companion make an attack, you had to give up one of your own attacks. And a lot of the time, a character&#039;s weapon attacks will just be better than the beast&#039;s attacks thanks to magic weapons and feats like sharpshooter. So you were actively weaker for using your subclass. The beast basically served as a meat shield on the battlefield, but the problem was that if it died you had to go find a whole new beast to form the bond with. Which obviously Laura didn&#039;t want to do anyway since she was attached to trinket. Also, the beast companions used actual monster stat blocks for different animals, and some were considerably more useful than others, but all were still pretty shit.<br><br>Since then they actually released a patched, updated version that fixes a lot of problems. First of all, you can instead of having it replace one or your attacks have it attack with a bonus action instead, meaning you still get your full action for yourself meaning your subclass actually makes you stronger, not weaker. They also changed it to three beast templates, a flying template, a swimming template and a land template that you can apply to a wide variety of animals so they are more balanced against each other. You can also resummon the beast like a familiar, so you don&#039;t have to go out into the forest to find a new one if you don&#039;t want.

I mentioned in that review how if someone said they liked it even more than the music video episode I could see where they&#039;re coming from on that opinion and now I feel that way even more. Great episode.<br><br>Now on to this one. I&#039;ve mentioned that ever since around episode three, the show has noticeably improved every episode and plateaud at a really nice place.

It&#039;s maintained the quality and the impression I get is as they&#039;ve gone on they&#039;ve simply figured out the nuances of the show&#039;s concept and how to structure, film it and time it.

What I mean by that is that it&#039;s not &#039;hey let me briefly bring this story to a halt so I can make a joke&#039; style comedy, instead all the gags are woven right into the narrative itself and are meaningful character-based buildups, payoffs or stuff that carries the plot along. Boy, I could gush about this all day because there were a lot of really excellent jokes. I feel like if I lose focus I&#039;m just gonna start rattling them all off and talking about how much I liked them and that&#039;ll end up being my review. But man, c&#039;mon. Even the acting was good. The whole &quot;nice to know I&#039;m your favorite person thing&quot; from Luna, the way that was all built up and Lynn&#039;s Sr.&#039;s exuberance and her teenage suspicion and how she moodily plays her dad out of the room. Top notch. It&#039;s only now that I really recall it that I was going to mention there was something tiny that bugged me about Luan&#039;s performance in that scene but the rest of it was so good it just wiped it from my mind and left me with a smile on my face the as we left.", "time": 1675394771, "resto": 135325293}, {"no": 135338235, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)22:30:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p135338166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;135338166</a><br>And damn, the reveal scene with everyone dressed up like each other! I don&#039;t watch the previews so for me that was a tremendous sight gag that really made me laugh, a surprise as I believe was intended. It was the kind of thing where if it was filmed in front of a live studio audience you&#039;d have to pause to give the audience time to laugh. Me personally I actually paused the video so I could laugh. I think it&#039;s because it&#039;s not something you were truly waiting for it to happen so there was no expectation. I mean, you knew they were going to have to act like each other but probably don&#039;t regard their outfits as part of their personalities, but when you give it some real thought you realize Lana dressing like she does and being a supposed pageant queen would lead to questions and ditto Lucy being a comedian that dresses like a mortician. So it makes sense why they&#039;d switch in hindsight but it&#039;s nuanced enough you&#039;re not on guard for it, which I think makes it hit even better.

That was actually really cleverly conceived as far as why it was all happening, the fucking &#039;eleven seemed excessive&#039; joke was world class first of all and a great and natural excuse to split the cast, but really the whole episode could have just been your classic &#039;the boss is over for dinner&#039; comedy of errors; having Flip very realistically fuck up putting names to faces/personalities in his letters about this family he barely knows and mixing up their idiosyncracies so now the kids have to act like each other on top of that, that was believable from a character perspective and smart from the grand perspective, really gave the whole plot a lot more to play with.<br><br>Funny, funny, funny. The whole thing reminded me of Cover Girls, one of my absolute favorite episodes. Having the sisters pretend to be each other is a total hit, it works every single time; it&#039;s enough to make me admire the restraint they have to have only really used that joke once (and now, I suppose, twice). Lisa visibly seething at having to pretend she needs a tutor. Lucy trying to make jokes.

How any excuse for theater gets Lynn Sr. stir crazy, that&#039;s where Luan gets it from. The basement situation devolving into Lord of the Flies once they get hungry enough, Luan jumping a panicked Luna for her chocolate bunny cracked me up, and then Lola assuming control.

I suppose didn&#039;t like that Flip&#039;s actor didn&#039;t do a vocal impression of Flip. It was cool to see the food and fuel in real life. Lastly, this is neither a like or a dislike, but I&#039;m confused why the plot is using a Princess Bride style storybook narrative framing device for its story. When I read the episode title I got the impression it was going to be like the power goes out episode from the cartoon where storytelling is used an excuse to put the characters in fantastical situations, but this is a pretty straightforward, grounded plot, so was there really a need?

If normalfags complain about women drive them crazy with their &quot;hints&quot; only themselves can figure out then they would go crazy if they were in Dean&#039;s place. Nothing makes sense there.

Exclamation finds out about the pastry and reveals to Nordle he&#039;s a supervillain, and Nordle has to basically decide whether to become evil and lose his friend Gretel (they work together in the ep fighting a robot which brings them closer together) or to stick by his friend but lose the approval of his dad. They also reveal why Exclamation&#039;s arms are so short too. Unlike the last episode I don&#039;t really have any issues with this because it was timed well and didn&#039;t feel rushed at all.
