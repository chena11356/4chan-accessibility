So Arnold does seem to really prefer nice girls. I think he also had an idealised version of Ruth, his other love interest of her being nice and intelligent but when he actually got the date with her and saw she was shallow he immediately lost interest for the rest of the series (besides I think that time he fantasied about her in the opera episode, but I guess they hadn&#039;t introduced lila yet to fill that role)<br><br>It&#039;s unfortunate, but that&#039;s just how it is. Pretty sure Craig Bartlett even considers Helga and Arnold to be soulmates so no way they weren&#039;t gonna be endgame. Lila feels like she was used as a tool to create drama and draw things out.<br><br>If I were to say from my own perspective as a guy, I&#039;d probably prefer Lila over Helga in real life. Obviously I wouldn&#039;t have as in depth of a view into Helga&#039;s life in real life as I would as a viewer so the appeal of her depth wouldn&#039;t be there. Lila is actually pleasant to be around, if not maybe a bit boring (I don&#039;t remember if she had any hobbies outside of being polite but maybe we can chalk this up to the lack of focus on her compared to Helga). Helga&#039;s more poetic side would make her much more appealing to be if it was something she actually showed off instead of hiding it behind violence and insecurity. And I feel bad about that, because if I knew this was the case I&#039;d actually want to help her and be a supportive friend as I imagine Arnold would too. But as it is, it&#039;s a problem that she has to work out herself, and I guess with the help of that therapist as well.<br><br>Maybe in an ideal future scenario if Helga&#039;s therapy helped she&#039;d consistently embrace more of her nice and poetic side and then she&#039;d feel better paired with Arnold.", "time": 1669628931, "resto": 134279011}, {"no": 134282016, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)06:55:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p134281469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;134281469</a><br>&lt;3 <br>Excellent explanations!<br><br>Helga&#039;s leaned so much into being a jerk that I doubt she&#039;ll ever be able to fully shake off the habit, even if her soul is kind.
