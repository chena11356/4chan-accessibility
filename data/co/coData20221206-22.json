I know that some people took that as a retcon of the pilot as if Fry and Leela&#039;s meeting was &quot;love at first sight&quot;. Fry&#039;s statement is still true without retroactively changing continuity. It wasn&#039;t love at first sight, it was lust. I would say the moment Fry fell in love with Leela was when the two had the heart-to-heart in the ruins of Old New York later that day. When Leela&#039;s hand touched Fry&#039;s hand is the moment the two fell in love with each other. Neither of the two realized it at the time, but the seeds were planted. The first season established a deep non-romantic bond between the two such as when the two sheltered inside the lunar lander in &quot;The Series Has Landed&quot; and Leela putting herself in danger to save Fry in &quot;My Three Suns&quot;. The episode &quot;A Farewell to Remember&quot; had Fry pretending to be Leela&#039;s fiance that culminated with the two almost kissing.<br><br>The second season had a few more moments leaning more towards a romantic relationship between the two. The season premiere &quot;I Second that Emotion&quot; has Leela claiming she loves every living creature. Fry asks &quot;even [him]&quot; to which Leela replies &quot;as a friend&quot;. Fry curses in disappointment, meaning that he likely wanted to explore a romantic component to their relationship. There&#039;s quite a few episodes that focus on the close relationship between the two and did have another almost kiss in &quot;Xmas Story&quot;. &quot;Anthology of Interest [I]&quot; shows that the two would sleep together if Leela was more impulsive. Leela, too, did seem excited about learning that Fry had a crush on her in a late season 2 episode &quot;War is the H-Word&quot;.
