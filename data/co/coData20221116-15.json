But in earlier versions of the movie, it was Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa mourning the loss of time. Like many in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, T\u2019Challa vanished at the end of 2018\u2019s AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR when Thanos used the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe. The Black Panther returned five in-universe years later at the climax of AVENGERS: ENDGAME. In its original form, Coogler saw his sequel as a story where T\u2019Challa struggles to resume life after the Blip.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe tone was going to be similar,\u201d Coogler says. \u201cThe character was going to be grieving the loss of time, you know, coming back after being gone for five years. As a man with so much responsibility to so many, coming back after a forced five years absence, that\u2019s what the film was tackling. He was grieving time he couldn\u2019t get back. Grief was a big part of it.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After Boseman died, Coogler worked with co-writer Joe Robert Cole to draft a new story. While the plot and protagonist changed, there are still elements of WAKANDA FOREVER left from Coogler\u2019s original script.

Part of it has to do with the fact that now these sort should of films have become a political statement to go see and there\u2019s no real winning move whether you see it or not depending on who you are. Not to say comics haven\u2019t had politics in the past (world war era shit springs to mind), but once you reach the point where your audience are either actively trying to bar races of people from seeing a film or insinuating that if you don\u2019t see it as part of their race you\u2019re a traitor, you really need to go back to the drawing board and figure something out. The other part is that you have a lot of writers trying to reinvent the wheel and pumping out a product that\u2019s honestly just mediocre at best because they want to give you their vision rather than just grabbing from the DECADES of good stories and interpreting them into a new visual media. Change the core aspects too much and you kill off a lot of potential for OG fans who tend to be loyal to a fault once you get them hooked coming to see it. I mean compare MCU stuff to the big monster movies genre. Yes MCU stuff will make a shit ton in the release but the drop off a week later is massive because they switch up the formula a bit too much for the die hards to recommend it to their circles. Unless you want to be lynched by the people that remember the travesty of 95 you can\u2019t really switch up the formula on Godzilla frying another monster\u2019s face off with atomic breath while destroying a city as that\u2019s the core aspect of the films.

No one had ever seen a shared continuity of films on such a scale, and for the layman who only knew a handful of Marvel characters like Spider-Man or Hulk, the MCU was providing them with an incredible slew of new characters they may not have paid attention to otherwise. But it\u2019s been nearly 15 years at this point. If the MCU started when you were in high school you\u2019re now in your 30\u2019s and still expected to get hyped for shit you may not see until you\u2019re almost 40. That\u2019s a long time to stay on the same hook, even if you are a nerd. The pay off of Endgame felt like a natural stopping point, but they kept going, and still with the same mentality that everyone will be hyped for the next big event when really the best thing for the brand is to slow down and do small stories that don\u2019t require 8 hours worth of other movies to get. People aren\u2019t enthralled by superheroes just being there, where once you couldn\u2019t imagine someone like Moon Knight having his own franchise, now we can barely turn our heads for the next Spider-Man project because it\u2019s just so ubiquitous it\u2019s not special.
