The character designs are ugly, the story is a mess just like Lightyear, and the Strange World itself is simply not appealing. The thing that was supposed to save this movie was the LGBT appeal, and clearly the LGBT either did not show up to watch it or Disney greatly overestimated how many of them there are.

It&#039;s a moralizing tale for dads more than for sons, so in a way it goes completely against the &quot;you need to behave&quot; morals of the original story. It is its own thing in many ways, not just by adding the wartme Italy aspect to it. The movie&#039;s more about how a couple father figures shape Pinocchio&#039;s motivations, and since Volpe and Podesta are terrible parents (even moreso to Spazzatura and Candlewick), and Gepetto&#039;s an alcoholic, traumatized wreck, he makes some terrible decisions wanting to please him. I think Pinocchio being sort of an incorruptible, pure soul really fits, he was just born, and you need people to guide you, it&#039;s all about how Gepetto should be there for him and love him for what he is. The story&#039;s kinda fallen apart by the time Volpe shows up at the nazi camp but I think the ending makes up for that.

You keep mentioning it like a boogey man juat because a few queers got baited into reading the comic by gay robots and it made news. But news for you, any true &quot;secondaries&quot; are now gone, because their favorite series is long over and they had no interest in other. What had happened, however, is long time fans, some here since 1984, have finally started admitting to their sexuality online. Those people were always here, they collected toys, posted on forums and have followed multiple series, you just started noticing them when they got vocally happy about being represented and stopped hiding who they are. To many of them, you are a &quot;secondary&quot; with comparably minor dedication put into being a fan. IDW didn&#039;t make the series or fans queer, it revealed how many of them already were.
