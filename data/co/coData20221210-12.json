It was thought their effors could be focused in separate directions. <br><br>So spoiler alert, Capeman is a mole in the intelligence agency Gadget works for.

They are fun and competent at what they do but you need to stop and give the MC something to do and feels forced, every bit of drama and conflict that he is involved feels somewhat forced and he just &quot;being there&quot; and having little to contribute with very little outside knowing music and in the end all he needs to play is 3 fucking notes? Weak sauce.<br><br>The movie drags a lot towards the beginning and middle, but the third act is actually really good and brought me back to it proving how tight the script. The animation also picks up and we do have a few cool action scenes towards the end but I can&#039;t help but picture this movie in a 90&#039;s classic style of animation like iron giant or Titan and you can see how much better it would have been. The jokes feel like classic disney somehow, like the Seth joke and the sort of villain he is and the pairing with the wannabe pharaoh, really felt like I was watching an mid 2000&#039;s Disney movie and you can tell. Lot&#039;s of darker jokes on this one too and most were pretty great. Overall is a 6;5, had potential to be better but is not really terrible. Really doesn&#039;t feel like an movie but more an episode from a series that somehow got stretched to be a entire movie but is not really bad.
