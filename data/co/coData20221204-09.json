In a post today, Gunn shared a shot of the heroes of Kingdom Come around the conference table on Green Lantern&#039;s satellite New Oa. The image, which served as the cover of the Kingdom Come 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition hardcover, features the Kingdom Come Superman as its focal point, along with a number of characters who have appeared or will soon appear in live action DC Univers eprojects, from Atom Smasher and Hawkman to Green lantern and Wonder Woman.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While fans are wondering if this means Kingdom Comecould be a project in the works, it&#039;s worth noting that this is a beautiful image of dozens of DC superheroes around a conference table, making plans. It&#039;s entirely possible that the message of the image is as simple as that.</span>", "time": 1670162618, "resto": 134376754}, {"no": 134376778, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:06:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i can&#039;t see gadot and cavill in this movie", "filename": "70fbc19d480f78d2318d5755a1a80ce3", "ext": ".png", "w": 418, "h": 480, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670162770214366, "time": 1670162770, "md5": "HPkVrARI8Pthr2b4UfNx8A==", "fsize": 373085, "resto": 134376754}, {"no": 134376797, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:08:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p134376778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;134376778</a><br>The Gadot casting was one of the largest fuck ups they made.
