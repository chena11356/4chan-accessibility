However, when he&#039;s at the crusp of victory, his own conscience and friendship with his own Princess, Princess Mayapple, causes him to call off the plan at the last second.

Hard to say but Likely a failure, but the owl show never struck me as one to be a cashcow. Not really due to competition but because of the death of cable. Owl house would be just as large as any cartoon from the 10s if it came out during the 10s.<br><br>Cultural success? Unquestionably a success- at least for people who watch cartoons. It may not be a large marketable entity like asoingbob or the Simpsons but I&#039;m sure most people who consume western cartoon and comic media are aware and have an opinion about the owl house. It has trended on Twitter multiple times and if you make a thread on 4chan&#039;s comic and cartoons board you&#039;re likely to reach bump limit.<br><br>So is owl house successful?
