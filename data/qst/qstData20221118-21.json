With the Hitman style, Mashiba can throw flicker jabs real quick, and from much farther away than an ordinary jab would reach. It comes at an odd angle too, so if you&#039;re not used to it, it&#039;s near impossible to get used to in a single round.&quot;<br><br>You&#039;ve heard of flicker jabs before - basically underhand jabs - but you&#039;ve never seen it in-person. &quot;Mashiba definitely has the reach advantage, but he&#039;s pretty tall for a featherweight.

They\u2019re fairly well-designed with few gaps around the treads, and with few exposed openings that could be used to plant explosives inside the armor. The only real weak spot that you know of is actually underneath, where the armor is relatively thin and some of the drive mechanism is exposed.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 34, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 29, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5465863, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)02:00:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465753</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consider the position you\u2019d likely be putting Sasuke-san in - this is the guy you look to as a mentor, right?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m giving you one chance to do the right thing before i kick your ass for real.</span>", "time": 1668668433, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LXejn+kJ"}, {"no": 5466636, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)19:48:47", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465753</a><br>\u201cIf you want Sasuke-san to be your mentor,\u201d you reason, \u201cthen why don\u2019t you stop and think about what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf it\u2019s Sasuke-san he\u2019s probably on an important mission, maybe a dangerous one, and you\u2019d be getting in his way,\u201d you declare, \u201cputting yourself at risk for sure, probably endangering his mission, and maybe even putting him at risk if he has to look out for you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll go one step further,\u201d Iwabee grumbles, \u201cyou\u2019re acting like exactly the kinda spoiled brat I thought you were on your first day at the academy.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely. That you are his unclaimed (and unknown) by-blow is only tangential. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you do deserve the honor of an audience with the viceroy?</span><br><br>1. Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system. Today, the trade network your built there is responsible for 12% of the Company&#039;s quarterly profits. <br>4.

Binding the primordial monstrosity of chaos and culture hero deity of order to your very being. In the process, your body was morphed by The Source, an infinite coalescence formed from both Aether (Tehut/The Light) and the Abyss (Tehom/Great Darkness), turning you into an avatar/demihuman (goddess).<br><br>Harnessing the Pleroma as well as its pneumatics on your fingertips, you call upon those words to transform into Pantheona, the divine avatar of the two cosmic forces residing inside your soul. Serving as the bridge between the natural world and the otherworldly realms, you slowly come to understand your placement as time goes on. With the essence of Shekhina and Tiamat residing within you, effectively serving as a balancer, you have the makings of true duality your additional role as arbiter balancer &amp; warrior emissary of Order &amp; Chaos. Known simply as the &quot;Galactic Angel of Retribution&quot;.<br><br>Although far from truly inheriting the title, you adjust to the responsibilities entrusted to you as you\u2019re thrust into the metahuman lifestyle. With a can-do spirit and spunk/moxie, you dive into the world of capes.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 61, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 56, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 5462240, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)13:13:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Yes</span><br>pussies", "time": 1668363205, "resto": 5452883, "id": "cQT39Lvu"}, {"no": 5462720, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)21:23:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No</span><br>oh shit we have to tell schala about this", "time": 1668392608, "resto": 5452883, "id": "IwW+brIw"}, {"no": 5463734, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:53:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No</span><br><br>This wasn&#039;t all for naught, however, as we still discovered the source and extent of the damage.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old\u2014mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some\u2014the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors\u2014spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some\u2014the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat\u2014regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill\u2026 Well, that remained to be seen.", "filename": "titlecard", "ext": ".png", "w": 2415, "h": 794, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1667183641201647, "time": 1667183641, "md5": "L4os8n7Hq2Vkwze5Lb0KEQ==", "fsize": 1336684, "resto": 0, "id": "CQjyTS+o", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 320, "images": 45, "omitted_posts": 315, "omitted_images": 45, "last_replies": [{"no": 5467376, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)16:27:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467275</a><br>What did I ever do to you", "time": 1668806871, "resto": 5448278, "id": "T3okjQwR"}, {"no": 5467423, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:14:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467376</a><br>Seeing you cry because we won&#039;t kill off a character you don&#039;t like is just as funny as seeing <a href=\"#p5465995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465995</a> cry because we&#039;re not voting to spend every waking moment with her.", "time": 1668809685, "resto": 5448278, "id": "2UQsCnSt"}, {"no": 5467435, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:23:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466810</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have what you need\u2014leave this silly place</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it was a bluff for intel, and you never had any real intent to employ her</span>", "time": 1668810229, "resto": 5448278, "id": "16eK+ySr"}, {"no": 5467488, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466810</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Return to the party, to enjoy yourself and plan your next move</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, she has kept her word and you will honour yours\u2014she is to join your forces</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ask her if she\u2019d like to be our dance partner for this gala</span>", "time": 1668812398, "resto": 5448278, "id": "W5F/5QkX"}, {"no": 5467704, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:49:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467488</a><br>Support", "time": 1668822580, "resto": 5448278, "id": "PyM5D6tB"}], "last_modified": 1668822580}, {"no": 5448110, "now": "10/30/22(Sun)19:11:31", "name": "HalloQM", "sub": "The Game of Games", "com": "As far back as you can recall you&#039;ve had inexplicable &quot;feelings&quot;. Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition. It&#039;s absolutely normal. Anyone would be nervous. <span class=\"mu-s\">There is no reason ton panic.</span><br><br>You continue repeating this to yourself as your best friend, Jason, drives the van. A minute ago you felt somewhat disassociated, as if you were really just an observer, floating behind yourself and staring, but that&#039;s getting better now. The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

Thankful for the carpeted floor, you creep over to the window and begin fiddling with your key ring as quietly as possible. Unlike the door keys, the window ones all look pretty similar. One design for the first lock, a different for the second, all identical between the windows. It takes a total of eight tries with different keys for you to unlock both of the window&#039;s locks, the sounds of sobbing and the creature loudly lumbering around downstairs providing a nerve-wracking backdrop.<br><br>With the window unlocked, you slowly push it up and open. Cold, moist air finds its way in and you involuntarily shiver. It&#039;s the middle of August, but it seems like you could do with a sweatshirt. Putting the cold aside, you poke your head out the window. The sill outside the window is rather narrow, but you could probably fit your feet on it if you had to. From there you think you could reach the roof, although it&#039;d definitely take a lot out of you to climb up there, and wouldn&#039;t be perfectly quiet.<br><br>To the left and the right are the windows to your uncle&#039;s office and bedroom, respectively. The office window is too far to reach from where you are, but you think you might be able to step over to the other bedroom&#039;s windowsill, albeit it with some difficulty. It should still be locked from the inside though, so you&#039;d probably have to smash your way in. Even ignoring what might be inside the room, it doesn&#039;t sound like a great escape route.<br><br>Below is an overgrown hedge, which you imagine would both cushion your fall and scratch you up. Speaking of the fall the distance is a bit dicey, but not the end of the world. If you were prepared ahead of time you don&#039;t think it&#039;d kill you or anything, at least. Although you guess you might sprain and ankle, which, well... might be the same as a death sentence in your current situation. It would all depend on your luck, you guess.<br><br>With that in mind, you close the window, turn your attention back to the room, and think of how you could get down safely. It doesn&#039;t take long for you to think of the most cliched approach in the book: make a rope out of your bedsheets. Sure, you don&#039;t know if it actually works but... well, you&#039;ve seen it in movies before, and it makes sense, logically. If you tied up your sheets, your blanket, and maybe some clothes or the curtains into a rope, and then fix it against something in the room, then it would probably provide a much safer path down.", "filename": "window", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668712882445551, "time": 1668712882, "md5": "CGV4HBQ25yanKy+/PmMDuw==", "fsize": 8408, "resto": 5448110, "id": "Y5+q259n", "trip": "!!qLL4RjByPPt"}, {"no": 5466312, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:23:14", "name": "HalloQM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466310</a><br>That does beg the question though- what would you fix it against? Your bed is the only thing here you can imagine easily bearing your weight, but it&#039;s also the first thing you added to the barricade. You guess you could use it, but it&#039;d be pretty far away from the window- you&#039;d need a longer rope, likely including lower quality materials. You&#039;re pretty sure your blanket wouldn&#039;t rip if used, but you can&#039;t quite say the same for your old shirts and jeans...<br><br>Besides the bed, you could also try something like your nightstand or a closet door that could easily be removed from your barricade, but you&#039;re certain they&#039;d move around once you started descending.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

If it isn\u2019t close to the one pit that\u2019s suitable to heave him into, then either we lead him there (unlikely given his insistence on going after the Elins in the pit right now) or deal with that last chain ourselves, which could get him moving again, but more importantly would open up the left pit. Task Izurin with the last Elin in the left pit, send Nilo and Elewyn in the middle and have Misha come in for a method 2, have everyone climb out the pit, get the boo into phase 2, push and Gale it down into the left pit, light the fuse, and fire in the hole.

But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 490, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 485, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463361, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Just wait till we get to page 10.<br>Also I hope this doesn&#039;t go the wait of that One Piece isekai quest i reagrds with &quot;the will to write&quot;, we already suffered enough.", "time": 1668462541, "resto": 5436238, "id": "NAMydAt2"}, {"no": 5463772, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Glad to see you haven\u2019t retired to your attack pod just yet.<br>It\u2019s fine to keep using this thread until page 9/10 if you want, there\u2019s plenty of time left before it falls off of the board.", "time": 1668494631, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5464248, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:38:18", "name": "KingQM", "com": "I&#039;ll wait til page 10 then, probably not that far away.<br><br>!!! BLOGPOST WARNING !!! <br><br><a href=\"#p5463361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463361</a><br>Will to write is a tough bippy to handle when you&#039;re QMing. It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

Clutching the goddess&#039; still living carces in his jaws, he flings her flayed form over his shoulder and onto his back.

THE FIRST RIDER strands the goddess&#039; Umbilical Cord and fashions it with the divine spark she left behind, causing it to burn his hands with an awesome power. Two pairs of hands working together bring the components to their Lord SABASTIOUS, a divine recreation of the Mohawker&#039;s favorite armament.

Your mom doesn\u2019t have a job, matter of fact, she has never held a job except for a few months in her early 20s. The relationship between you and your mother is very good and healthy. The relationship between you and your mother\u2019s boyfriend is distant and mostly not existent. But is not confrontational by any means. Your mother\u2019s boyfriend is a very rich individual, who works at a major bank. The 3 of you live in a very large 4-bedroom apartment in the nicest part of town. Your mom stays at home all day, she cleans cooks, and dose the normal roles of any housewife. But also has all the time in the world to pursue her hobbies. Which consist of, painting, playing guitar, and tons of other athletic hobbies. She spins way too much time at the gym, doing yoga and varies dance classes. Like her daughter, she is very athletic and is on the thin side.<br>The mother\u2019s boyfriend, Andrew is in his late 40s.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins.

We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection.

And that&#039;s when things went wrong.<br><br>99% of the people who do what you did are never found out. And even when they are spotted by someone, the media doesn&#039;t report it. And even when the media does report it, most of the time the story dissipates into the news stream within a few days. Unfortunately, you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The media talked about you, a few people were scandalized by your actions, and the next ones were influenced by the first ones. A national scandal, of which you are the main protagonist, followed very quickly.<br><br>Here you are, alone in front of several dozen journalists from all over the country, in a large room set up for the occasion. This is your first public appearance since the beginning of the scandal. There is no doubt that you have done wrong; you can no longer prove that you are innocent. However, you can limit the damage and save your reputation. Those journalists will be the pawns in the media chess game you are about to play. <br><br>Welcome to the most important press conference of your life.<br><br>[Cont.]", "filename": "intro", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 449, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 224, "tim": 1665528417296159, "time": 1665528417, "md5": "kzQ+fDQklBRKdLEq5g0iDw==", "fsize": 38297, "resto": 0, "id": "tMyBblQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-fucked-up", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 442, "images": 18, "omitted_posts": 437, "omitted_images": 18, "last_replies": [{"no": 5466759, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)22:14:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466364</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Can you tell me WHO leaked the story to the media?

There&#039;s no way one person could have found out everything there is to know about me in such a short time. It has to be the work of an enemy who has sworn to ruin my reputation, and has been investigating for years.

All you had to do was read the very first article TMZ published about Ace Amaze to see that the original source was a freelance journalist named Jill Shearer. No one said anything about it, but it was our job to cite our sources...and very few people here do their jobs well.

They left you a large enough fund to buy food and pay rent, but not much else beyond that. It had taken only once to learn that you needed to tightly budget, a lesson you learned at the cost of nearly going three weeks without food, but your parents never found out. You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets?

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

Everything of value has already been pillaged by the thralls of Gruumsh, and among the dead there is not even a single strand of silver hair to be found. The investigation is not in vain, however. Flipping over the corpse of a Cyricist dressed as any other commoner, you find a letter in his hands, which he pressed desperately against his chest before blood loss took him.

You decapitated her, and were then stopped by a dragon.<br>Not just A dragon, but something more akin to The dragon. A primordial dragon, titanic in size.<br>It had just offered you a boon.<br>\u2014----------------------------------<wbr>---------------<br><br>\u201c...I want to leave this place, unharmed and peacefully, with this corpse and my squires.\u201d<br>The dragon laughed. It was a deep, unsettling rumble, and eventually the dragon spoke once more.<br>\u201cI see\u2026 You expected me to betray you.Twist your words into something else. Very well. I had expected you to ask me to end your curse.\u201d<br>It leans in closer, still, and then it speaks as quietly as a creature of that size can manage. It\u2019s still enough to make you feel like you\u2019re dealing with an earthquake, and it\u2019s making your injuries hurt a little more from the vibration\u2026<br>And the cold.<br><br>\u201cClimb upon my back, then. I shall bring you to the base of the mountain, where your mate and hoard is waiting.\u201d<br>You clench your teeth\u2026 The Grey Knight.<br>\u201cI\u2026 appreciate the offer, of course.\u201d You say, looking for an escape\u2026 but the creature is using its wings to block off the cave entirely.<br>\u201cBut I\u2026 already have transportation.\u201d<br>\u201cIndeed you do\u2026 I spoke with her already. Such self-loathing she carries. But I shall make it right. She will be a dragon, as she deserves. A new breed, even. She will be free to do as she sees fit, once her transformation is permitted to finish.\u201d<br><br>\u2026.<br>Ohhh hell.<br>You\u2026<br>You might not be able to help the Grey Knight. Unless, of course, you walk back the boon somehow. Alternatively, you don\u2019t doubt the Grey Knight will fight this creature every step of the way, perhaps enough to be killed by it rather than suffer the fate of being something so inhuman.<br><br>But\u2026 What does he intend to do with her? Keep her around?<br>You\u2019re not sure if you should ask questions.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t get into it, you need to escape.</span><br>The Grey Knight is quite likely to try and kill this dragon.

After confronting a gang of lesser vampires on the hunt for prey in the railroad town of Farson, you were directed to the backwater mining town of Almy, which you found a practical ghost town. After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire. You were able to kill the strigoi, but it was hiding underground to conceal the fact it had bred an even rarer, deadlier type of vampire, a moroi. You were able to slay it, though Wiktoria was left exhausted. Now, you\u2019ve arrived in Montana, to deliver a report to Wiktoria\u2019s boss, the Vampire Prelate Cec\u00edlia. <br><br><span class=\"mu-s\">June 10th, 1884<br>Carpathia, Montana Territory</span><br><br>Sorry for the month-long wait for the Conclusion thread folks, been back to work and all that. <br><br>Previous Thread: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive/2022/5345941/", "filename": "DH OP", "ext": ".png", "w": 2708, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 138, "tim": 1665112917299315, "time": 1665112917, "md5": "9EcW4IXRUyja9O3BMFInBg==", "fsize": 6668274, "resto": 0, "id": "j2Di2wT6", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "damned-hunter-case-0-the-conclusion", "trip": "!!1MSx2/jclIz", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 17, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5436585, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)15:54:07", "name": "Wide Pride", "com": "\u201cSo, what now?

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them. And after so much events the sweet lady Takable was spending the evening with you. <br><br>But let us begin, as per tradition, by a small prologue about events that take place in other parts of the strange world that you call India.<br><br>PROLOGUE :<br><br>In the darkest tunnels of the terrible fortress that we already visited one can see a quite pitiful group. They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.

You saw how the pillars were decorated with runes and spiral motives and continued, carrying your torch towards the inside of the tomb. There was a corridor and some stairs and then you entered in a very strange place. A strange and beautiful place indeed. Stone engravings of high quality were showing on the four walls different motives. On the first one there were forests, hills and animals, and cattle herders caring for them. On the second one there were fishermen on the sea and whalers who tried to fight leviathans and monsters, on the third there were birds and clouds, with a man on a flying horse hunting a flying dragon with a bow and finally there a wall representing a burning village with warriors around it killing the people and burning fields and houses. In the middle of the room a simple stone altar seemed to represent all of this. Crumbling explained you.<br><br>-The hall of the elements my lord, it was here that mages did magic to ward the tomb and where Leman&#039;s brother performed his rituals. You can see earth, fire, water and air.<br><br>It was strange and you had another fit of pain in the hearth that forced you to lean on the altar. You continued to hear Crumbling explaining while you said. <br><br>-It is impressive, it is almost as if all the people and birds are alive.<br><br>-It was sculpted by dwarves my lord, Leman&#039;s Brother gave them food in exchange for gold and sculptures. They made it to commemorate their friendship, then when undead lead by Leman attacked them they tried to destroy this but never managed to do it. It is beautiful indeed and... What is this ?<br><br>You looked behind you and saw that the altar was now glowing with an eerie red light. You did the sign of the cross and unsheathed your sword while you screamed.<br><br>-Devilry ! <br><br>-We must leave the place my lord, it is accursed ! My lord...<br><br>You didn&#039;t hear anything because you were in pain, your hearth ached and you heard your blood pulse in your head, you didn&#039;t knew what this meant and tried to lean on a wall. But you fell, you tried to rise again when you saw that the room glowed with dark and white lights that seemed to chase and blind your men. You tried to raise when you heard a strangest voice, an old voice that was comparable to the croaking of a crow or of a frog, you heard in your head.<br><br>-An old enemy is dead, but a new enemy arises, it arises, it arises, it arises...<br><br>And it repeated it, hurting you, it was like knives were trying to carve out your brain from your skull. You arose and tried to lean on a wall, lights blinded your sights but you saw the walls of the room, they were moving, the boatmen were rowing, the birds were flying, the animals grazed in the fields and the town burned.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise. A little twirling move lets you evade his partner, who you would hazard a guess is his sister. Both are fast by any ordinary person\u2019s standards, and you can tell each attack carries a pretty good amount of force behind it, so that\u2019s not their problem.

It added a ton to the story. It is funny to think that was all from one write-in.<br><br>Couple more questions:<br><br>1. Could Tibius or something else, like Izitha, have taken advantage of Syb\u2019s doll in any way? Like, manipulated her with it? I had that as a niggling worry in the back of my head when we went after Tibius. I was afraid he could use anything magical on our person against us, since he was so powerful as a mage.<br><br>As an aside, I also kind of missed having Syb as a doll once she left her magical dimension. She was like a little Pok\u00e9mon that we could carry in our pockets and pull out when we wanted her to pound something with spells or pat on the head from time to time.<br><br><br>2. The holy water we picked up stung Stan even before she had Nats hitching a ride. Was that because of Tim\u2019s essence being inside of Stan, or because of some other quality inherent to her?

You overheard your older brother say something about a collapse during a speech, but he refused to explain himself before leaving with some important military looking men. He&#039;s only a little older than you but everybody treats him so much differently! It isn&#039;t fair. Father and mother have been gone since this morning as well, and it was left to the household servants to take care of you all day. They didn&#039;t explain anything, attempting to distract you with games and music but only succeeding in putting you more on edge. <br><br>Almost as soon as the servants put you to bed you snuck out of your room and back out into quiet halls of the mansion, tiptoeing along through the shadows until you caught sight of a group of adults entering your father\u2019s study\u2026<br><br>In the dim light you cannot make out who they are, but as the heavy double doors to the study close behind them you hurry over to try and listen in. You press your ear against the cold wooden door, straining to hear the muffled voices on the other side. It is difficult to make anything out, occasional footsteps and what sounds like the clinking of glass, or perhaps metal, interspersed between quiet conversation. It goes on for awhile, but you can\u2019t hear much of it clearly until the very end.<br><br>\u201c...He\u2019s not going to recover\u2026\u201d A deep male voice states matter-of-factly, the rest of the room briefly falling silent.<br><br>\u201c...Are you sure there\u2019s nothing that can be done?\u201d A female voice questions uncertainly, a murmur of others joining her soon after.<br><br>\u201cI am certain. Now would be a good time to\u2026\u201d The deep voice continues speaking, but the rest of his sentence is too indistinct to make out. You hear heavy footsteps on the other side of the door, slowly growing louder as they approach. You have only a few moments to back away, and your small strides don\u2019t carry you far over the smooth marble floor before you slip, falling in a heap as the great carved wooden door swings wide and reveals an imposing but aged man\u2026<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Your father, Degwin Zabi.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Your father Zeon Zum Deikun\u2019s most trusted physician, Girard.</span>", "filename": "MSGQ #1", "ext": ".png", "w": 555, "h": 480, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 216, "tim": 1664052269286096, "time": 1664052269, "md5": "HLrR1GlUphGegoFV+n+H4A==", "fsize": 73273, "resto": 0, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mobile-suit-gundam-quest", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 3322, "images": 135, "omitted_posts": 3317, "omitted_images": 134, "last_replies": [{"no": 5461622, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:34:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461596</a><br>I ain&#039;t never met a man who&#039;s name sounded like a flower, just sayin&#039;.", "time": 1668310440, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}, {"no": 5461641, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:49:41", "name": "Contolist", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461617</a><br>That&#039;s only when he&#039;s trying to hide. <br><br><a href=\"#p5461622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461622</a><br>Basil?", "time": 1668311381, "resto": 5414507, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr"}, {"no": 5461660, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:56:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461641</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basil</span><br>That&#039;s an herb, not a flower.", "time": 1668311777, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}, {"no": 5461677, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)23:12:21", "name": "Contolist", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461660</a><br>It flowers. <br><s>I know I&#039;m reaching a bit here.</s>", "filename": "Basil Flower", "ext": ".png", "w": 926, "h": 745, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1668312741108163, "time": 1668312741, "md5": "LNPaRLt4f7VSv4pNOfbVNQ==", "fsize": 1286194, "resto": 5414507, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr"}, {"no": 5461760, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)00:23:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461677</a><br>Much like Humanity&#039;s destiny to grasp at the stars with our fingered nails, it is your destiny to reach.<br>Hope your classes are going well by the way, education being important and all that.", "time": 1668317033, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}], "last_modified": 1668317033}, {"no": 5415595, "now": "09/25/22(Sun)18:56:36", "name": "91m10", "sub": "Do Your Best Quest #135", "com": "You\u2019re not sure how you ended up here, you were supposed to be cuddling with the two wonderful tomatoes that you love.

A heretical cleric shouldn\u2019t be so powerful; teleportation is practically on the level of True Magic, and he\u2019s using it on hundreds of targets simultaneously.\u201d Truvietianne said in subdued awe and frustration.<br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the entirety of the situation.\u201d Her Servant reminded her, \u201cIt may be one of that Servant\u2019s abilities, or the world we\u2019re in could allow for that type of magic more readily than the real one. I\u2019d also wager that however he\u2019s getting it done, he can only use power like that if it\u2019s directly involved in making the Grail War as a whole run more smoothly.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019d be pleased if that were true.

You assumed he was probably communicating with his familiar, which he\u2019d been rather careful about keeping concealed; perhaps revealing it would give a substantial hint regarding his true name. \u201cThere are hundreds of ghoulish creatures wandering all over the city now, I\u2019ll try to pick out the humans from the recent arrivals and guide you to their locations. It may behoove us to split up again as before, and then meet here again after we\u2019ve retrieved a civilian.
