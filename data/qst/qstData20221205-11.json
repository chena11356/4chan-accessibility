So when a rider on a Pegasus made of black smoke landed on one of the towers he cursed the rain and ordered something hot that could appease the delicate palate of a blood elf, like a good red tea while approaching the volcanic core of the place.<br>The master of the dark tower ordered a goblin to announce his master of his return and to request an audience. He was one of the inner circle and knew that his master might be interested by what he has learnt. He was not mistaken, one hour later he was brought to the personnal baths of B&#039;beg the Terrible.<br><br>Even a dark lord of more than 10 000 years needed to bath once in a month.

He was even more pleased when his master ordered two girls (elven maidens who were younger than a century could have been little girls for them) to undress his servant and massage him while he would enter to another hot pool, in front of the one where B&#039;beg was staying. <br><br>-It is a too great honour your malevolent eminence.<br><br>The master of darkness answered his servant.<br><br>-No, I must reward those who do the work themselves instead of relying on stupid and clumsy subordinates. Your devotion to the cause of Evil is remarkable Larion. As I love to say &quot;The best men are those who walk the evil path instead of the easy path.&quot;<br><br>Only a true megalomaniac would quote himself, but this was a necessity of being an evil leader. Larion could only nod respectfully while he was quickly disrobed by the two charming creatures and put into a pool of pleasingly hot water, a great change from the cold rain that would have given him an angine if he wasn&#039;t protected by magic. One of the dark elven beauties, with pale skin and black hair began to massage his shoulders while the second one with dark skin and white hair stroked his long blonde locks to clean them.

But what your lady said was intriguing you, she knew the man, and how ? If he was fond of her maybe she was fond of him too. You knew that it was impolite but you asked. <br><br>-If I might dare to ask, Rose, how close do you were with the count&#039;s second son ?

I do not know about the French customs but in our lands it is very impolite to inquire about the past of a lady. It is a question of trust.<br><br>Of course it was impolite in France too, and she looked at you with such a look of reproach, like that of your mother when you had done something bad. It was maybe because your image as a perfect knight, with his flaws but still noble and true, shattered in your mind. Of course, you cursed yourself, you looked insecure, just like this snotty bookworm should have been to win the affections of a lady. Only insecure people, people who thought that they were not above all the other pretenders of a lady would ask if she loved another man at a time. It was not good.

You were happy to see that Boh\u00e9mond was here, with Ancel who was the only one without a horse and who ran happily, glad to see his lord again. Your riders were near those of the count and you noted that the count&#039;s troops were as strangely equipped as yours before you gave them kettle helmets, they had simply mail, norman helmets and swords, not even lances or shields. One of their soldiers was even a woman, Indian armies were truly worthless. Then you saw the young man and your brave Godefroi and you were cursing yourself about your error. Godefroi was speaking to him, apparently very happy of what he said, when the young Isnott looked completely and utterly bored.

Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge.

He has not been successful in his personal life or career. In the twenty eight years of his life, he hasn&#039;t accomplished anything of any importance. None of that matters because Hubert has one thing that makes every difference. The soul of an emperor. Buried beneath his genes and upbringing is the willpower to endure centuries of strife and struggle. He just doesn&#039;t know it yet.<br><br>Far beyond Hubert&#039;s earth, the cosmos is in decay. The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has. Hubert can have between 1, for a sane, slightly flawed man that only has a scrap of strength, and 10, stark raving mad divinity powerful enough to shatter a kingdom.", "filename": "cosmosular", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 475, "h": 485, "tn_w": 244, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1669863072234000, "time": 1669863072, "md5": "xDvEiOXRmamYGcGYyxxUuw==", "fsize": 46100, "resto": 0, "id": "Vp4uit9k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hubert-dysfunctional-demigod-in-a-strange-land", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 134, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 129, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 5486336, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)23:31:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486333</a><br>It\u2019s the smallest of the region and is somewhat isolated in the deeper woods. The locals mostly get by on hunting and don\u2019t have any real industry to speak of but there\u2019s very few visitors from the outside and no dedicated priest of Axeyr since the last died of old age. This isolation has caused the village to become a nest of crime, giving refuge to outlaws in exchange for shares of the loot and letting gangs recruit from their young. Most of the outlaws apparently left to help the wizard dig for gold and, unknown to them, died screaming under several tons of earth. The outlaws left are mostly poachers guilty of not paying religious tithes to hunt, but here, there isn\u2019t really a difference between tithes and taxes since the priests are the government. <br><br>Hubert finds the village is run by a big local family, the Lanfrancsons, who are behind most of their cooperation with crime. The culture doesn\u2019t use surnames like the demigod\u2019s old earth did so the family is called that for their head, Lanfranc, an old man who used to smuggle in his youth and dislikes society for worshiping Axeyr and obeying his restrictions to ban most of the drugs he made a living from selling. Hubert thinks this doesn\u2019t make much sense because that drove the demand that allowed Lanfranc to sell his wares for higher prices but people don\u2019t need to make sense. Most of the villagers outside of Lanfranc\u2019s family are happy to profit from the arrangement but some religious individuals feel like they\u2019re trapped in a cycle of evil.<br><br>The second month of Hubert\u2019s demigodhood passes and Hubert feels invigorated as his internal Essence surges and has a major breakthrough. The power from the wizard\u2019s soul is burned away and the demigod has a massive improvement. He instinctively senses that this can be used for a direct Essence cap increase, a secondary boost by digging deeper powers from the Earth, or a mixture of both.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have +3 Essence. You can spend it all on +3 Essence cap or on powers at 1 Essence for a moderate power or 1 Essence for 2 minor powers, chosen from the earlier list. Part can be spent on Essence cap and part on powers if you would prefer to split it up some. If Hubert\u2019s Essence cap were increased to 13 he would have a monthly Essence income of +3, instead of the +2 that he currently has. The +3 was a typo, for a Loose Essence alignment income is 1/5th rounded up per month, so for 10 it would be +2. About powers, Hubert can also summon any combination of weaker earth elementals than 8 HD, as long as they add up to equal or less than 8 HD. If you wanted to, you can increase his earth elemental threshold by +3 for a minor power or +6 for a moderate slot. He already has a major power for earth elemental summoning so it&#039;s only refinement of what&#039;s already a specialty.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3/3</span>", "time": 1670214683, "resto": 5481542, "id": "Vp4uit9k"}, {"no": 5486395, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)00:35:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486336</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;+3 Essence cap</span>", "time": 1670218511, "resto": 5481542, "id": "zqMVgY9I"}, {"no": 5486446, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)01:45:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486336</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;+3 Essence cap</span>", "time": 1670222754, "resto": 5481542, "id": "dKsXSzrD"}, {"no": 5486519, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)05:12:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486395</a><br>+1", "time": 1670235155, "resto": 5481542, "id": "g8ArbJ9p"}, {"no": 5486568, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)06:46:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486336</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;+3 Essence cap</span>", "time": 1670240797, "resto": 5481542, "id": "Q+XXAW9v"}], "last_modified": 1670240797}, {"no": 5480946, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)05:07:40", "name": "TQM", "sub": "Warhammer 40k: Christian Cult in The Underhive", "com": "In the 41st Millenium, there is only war. Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get.

Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don\u2019t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man.

It is the wife of Unnar, the fisherman, who lives with his mother and young son. If all goes well, the child will be born eight moons hence. It is customary for the chieftain to give a present on these occasions, usually in the form of a small celebration with singing and dancing and music going late into the night. Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth. You have only enough dried flowers for a single dose, which you were saving for emergencies. To obtain more would be expensive--or dangerous, for they only grow on the backs of the great slumbersloth, towering mossback creatures that dwell in the deepest caves.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let&#039;s now introduce your tribe&#039;s resources. Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation.

That of Wadlepadle, the slimes that appeared on Ulodrac shores and were properly subjugated. Yet, their lands had hardly been touched. Nothing had been done with them in all the Maroi (years) that they had been under Ulodrac control. That was to change, as prospecting would be done around the lands that were under the control of the slimes city. There was hope that iron, copper, or tin would be able to be struck and mines of plenty sunk into the earth. Regardless, it would at the very least finally make them useful for something. Though perhaps in the future farmland could be created around their lands soon enough as well, if they weren&#039;t already managed in Ulodrac&#039;s own main lands.

The Ulodrac was prepared for their construction and it would be quite useful, though with the limited supply of steel, more effective methods of it&#039;s creation would swiftly go into effect.

All your life, you had to listen the myths of eld, of the [Blue]Outside[Blue], where the sky was blue and the sun was bright, and how the vastness above your head was no more than a fake, something made with ancient magicks to mimick the real thing, even if they looked so real and warm to you. About the ancient war against the [Red]Demon Gods[Red], the very beings that now give magic to [Red]Mazeborn[Red] that try to explore the depths of [Red]Labyrinthos[Red], which resulted in the [Blue]Ancients[Blue] being locked away in this cursed place, even if this is the only existence you&#039;ve ever known.<br><br>Life continues, and it&#039;s not like [Red]Domdaniel[Red] is a particular bad place to live, as the [Blue]Ancients[Blue] have learned to prosper inside it&#039;s walls, but you&#039;ve always dreamed of something more like many others: Of exploring the neighbouring [Red]Rooms[Red], seeing lands so alien they could be confounded with other worlds, of defeating powerful enemies and becoming yourself a paragon of [Red]Power[Red]. You&#039;ve always wanted to be an adventurer. And for that single reason, you woke up this day. Just the day before, you graduated from high school, and now you&#039;re finally able to strut to the [Red]Crawler Base[Red] and start realizing your dreams. Your parents have tried dissuading you for some years now, but even confronted with the fear of death, madness or other horrible things, they soon understood that you couldn&#039;t be convinced otherwise in this matter.<br><br><span class=\"mu-s\">You look yourself in the mirror of your room smiling, congratulating yourself for surviving enough to finally see it through, the reflection in front of you showing..:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An Elf Mazeborn, with long pointed ears and a tall, sinous body, the aristocrats of this city, your inquisitive eyes glowing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Dwarf Mazeborn, short in stature but with a resilient body, your dextrous hands twitching with anticipation.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Pixie Mazeborn, one of the smallest but most agile races this dungeon has ever seen, wings flapping excitedly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Giant Mazeborn, growing a little more than twice an elf&#039;s height and with strenght to match, your muscles bulging.</span><br><br>[This is the time for you to create the Main Character.

Though it did get boring after everything just lost its appeal. Funny, you think of doing something, only for it to end up less enticing once endless opportunity presents itself. Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today.

Regardless, the end of the month goes a fair bit more smoothly than the start. Luckily, or unluckily, the patrols Vert and Rouge go on never seem to spot Koerkamp T.II \u201cArend\u201ds. Instead, they seem to mainly run into Koerkamp C.I &quot;Mus&quot; which despite what the name implies is more akin to a middle ground between a Fr\u00ffg and a Kronlein. Though something that has been made apparent by now is the fact that regardless of the aircraft Lothring has, their pilots aren&#039;t up to the same level as our main adversary, and with our own training advancements, they&#039;ll ideally soon be fully inferior with a handful of exceptions. But for now, they are a threat. Especially with that one little project they are working on. <br><br>Still, the sorties by Blanc go smoothly, with a good deal of recon and bombing done at no loss to our own pilots there. In fact, Oudin Bouhier managed to down a CN-III. However, while things went well for the recon and strike aircraft, the escorts were a more mixed bag, with Bleu managing to get a good number of victories, with Imbert downing two Bergens and Mile along with Fouet downing one each, the latter, Capitaine Fouet Lucy, was downed by Jan-Willem. Further, Estiene Auger and Barbedaurus Cartier were also shot down and Symonnet was forced down by a CN-III, though was just behind our lines. His aircraft however, was destroyed by enemy artillery before it could be recovered. Noir meanwhile suffered some losses as well, with three losses, one of which was killed by Leutnant Noah &quot;Kileshadran&quot; McCullough, which true to his nickname, is surprisingly from Kileshadra. While only one of our own was downed by him these past two weeks, 15e Escandre &quot;Marins du ciel&quot; was unfortunate enough to become well acquainted with him. Other than this, Vert and Rogue did quite well, with only one pilot lost between the two of them, though Chastain was forced down behind our own lines, after which their aircraft flipped over. Luckily, the upper wing while irreparable held, and the pilot in question didn&#039;t get their neck snapped and instead just suffered minor bruises. Still, as expected, the aces of Vert and Rouge did quite well, with l&#039;As herself climbing higher and higher.

Our forces have paused, and the enemy has dug in quite extensively, even in Lothring. Further pushes are going to be much more difficult now, and momentum has been lost to some extent. This is due to a mix of the heavy bombers the Lothring forces used extensively, the inundation lines being flooded, and far stiffer resistance than expected. While Lothring&#039;s army was expected to fold as quickly as Daloyaume, they have certainly proven our own forces wrong. Ironically, in a way, it&#039;s actually quite similar to the invasion of Daloyaume in the sense that it was meant to be a decisive war winning move that would serve as a quick knock out blow. The only problem is the fact the country is larger than Daloyaume and it&#039;s military more stubborn. Or perhaps it&#039;s mainly due to the majority of their forces not being encircled initially. No matter the reason, this is likely going to be a slog... At the very least we did our job decently. Then again, our airfields were mostly spared from the bombings...<br><br>In other news, Jagdgeschwader XIV &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; has been equipped with Falke D.II&#039;s. We know this due to the distinct navy blue body and wings with red rudders and white stars that clearly identifies them. It makes sense though, given how many of their CSA volunteers have become aces of late. Needless to say, there&#039;s a good deal of concern given the rumors of the craft&#039;s capabilities. In better news, more Pretan air corps forces are up in the area, and they have actually engaged Lothring forces, which is nice. Also, in Varuskie a small force at a fort meant to delay the Pru\u00dfenmarkians at a fort was subject to extensive chemical bombardment. The forces pursuing the main Varuskie army was sufficiently delayed by a heroic charge after this bombardment despite the extensive poisoning the soldiers at the fort suffered. Needless to say, their appearance and the fact there was actual resistance despite bombardment both chemical and traditional caused a good deal of panic and casualties given they were under attack by &#039;dead men&#039;. Regardless, despite this heroic stand, the vast majority of defenders did in fact die shortly after this charge, and those few who were able to withdraw after were quite badly wounded, poisoned, or both. The entire Regiment was given honors and medals, as was it&#039;s commander. Many including it&#039;s commander were granted these awards by the Tsar&#039;s orders, though posthumously. Still, despite this Varuskie has been forced out of some of Steyerland-Magyrian territory. Though, things are still going well in the east. Further south however, the first battle of the Sontius has concluded, and while the kingdom of Vitulia has technically speaking advanced, the losses so far are estimated to be at best 3 Vitulian&#039;s for every Steyerland-Magyrian...It&#039;s advised not to ask what the highest estimate is, at least for a while, but we believe it to be double that of the best...", "time": 1670069595, "resto": 5477321, "id": "WVjz8z5c"}, {"no": 5484109, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)07:17:09", "name": "Army Headquarters (QM)", "com": "Still, with the month finished, maybe it&#039;d be best to try and speak with someone...Nothing out of the ordinary has been reported by Botrel, Chopin or Marchal though, nor any more murders...yet.

Having learned of that, Claudia and Klaus resolved to ensure the justice is served with their direct personal participation - painfully aware of precarious position of the Alliance between Olga&#039;s monstrous horde and the mercenary army that was meant to be the decisive force, now turned out to be another enemy. Consequently, Claudia also used this journey as opportunity to bring some reinforcements with her.<br><br>Under these circumstances you and your men found yourselves at head of a small military convoy, you personally walking alongside carriage of the lordly couple, with rest of your men traveling behind.

I aim for this quest to take place in a twilight zone of the 60s-90s, so I&#039;ll be shying away from anything that will concretely date the setting, but I won&#039;t try to be so vague that everything is indistinct. For instance, I might mention the war in vietnam, but won&#039;t say whether it&#039;s been finished or not. Or maybe you&#039;ll hear rumours of some kind of nuclear accident in the USSR that&#039;s really a coverup for anomalous activity. Technology wise the 90s will be a hard restriction, so no modern internet or touchscreen phones for example, but the Foundation is on the cutting edge of technology anyway and has stuff that the general public won&#039;t get for years, perhaps even decades.

Whenever the Swall developed a new form of communication; the Hegemony had already created new shows and entertainment for that medium. When the Swall first developed color television, there were already full color broadcasts of Jaxtian entertainment. When the internet became easily accessible by the masses; bite sized content was already being churned out by the Hegemonic authority. These shows were being created by AI and manipulated- each one subtly attempting to create and control narratives against the core Swall world government and systems of belief. Each one served dual purposes; both to wow and impress the Swall consumers with something free, easily accessible, and always up-to-date on their social issues and current events- faster then their own technology and society could react, and thus show Jaxtian superiority- as though life would be so much better under Hegemonic rule. The second purpose was to subtly instill the values of the Hegemony- collectivism, less emphasis on the individual, and the follies of capitalism. It never truly worked; as these programs were always seen as being tools for the Hegemony.<br><br>At some point soon, the final sub-light speed radio and audio transmissions will fly past Jaxt- travelling through the void of space from the final broadcast the Hegemonic government played for the Swall on the eve of their invasion.<br><br>There was a stern Jaxtian news anchor, sitting in a room intentionally made to look more primitive; walls covered in metal with visible instruments- to appear as though he was onboard the station that orbited Swalli- though in reality he was many light years away.<br><br>[blue]&quot;Tomorrow&#039;s weather forecast shows clear skies.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes.

That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear.

At this point of day, it&#039;s just cool enough to be relaxing and the sun is bearing down enough to keep you warm. Meryl is walking ahead of you again, and she thinks quietly, turning around and giving you another one of her wry grins. Back when she proposed to you, you thought of it as a smirk, but it&#039;s different. Smirks are common, they&#039;re cynical, and they&#039;re also adversarial. You&#039;ve seen too many, and read of even more. A smirk quickly resigns a situation to a poor outcome, and there&#039;s a real fear things are never going to get better in the world. The grin she gives you is playful, but it&#039;s hopeful. <span class=\"mu-g\">Enjoying the outdoors?</span><br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Yup!&quot;</span> Meryl twirls in place, and you can&#039;t help but admire her agility. You think your fianc\u00e9e would make a good ballerina or figure skater, but her body shape isn&#039;t for it. She&#039;s muscular, but she&#039;s also quite womanly, so while she has the balance and control, your brother wouldn&#039;t partner with her on ice. He probably couldn&#039;t lift her, even if you let him. Your beloved doesn&#039;t seem as confined to outdoors as her mother supposedly is, but it&#039;s clear she prefers vital air to sterile. Back in college, she bought canned oxygen for long study sessions. It didn&#039;t help you, but she might be more sensitive.<br><br>Here, the dogwood and the open spaces, some rolling hills and a little grass, flowers and a far-off flowing stream... Keeping hold of this estate was a historical priority for your family, because it&#039;s not only valuable, it&#039;s incredibly pretty and cheerful. In the green and brown of the ground and trees, Meryl&#039;s red stands out, and compliments the white flowers. Right on the tail of the school year, this was perhaps the best time to come home. In the winter, it was cold, and while conversations around the fire could be warm, fireplace beat firepit. Now, the breeze is a cool relief, not a chilly assault.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;I think that was some real luck.&quot;</span> Lucky that your grandfather was a monster hunter? How?

For your part you take on the central path, which requires you to not only examine the enemy\u2019s positions but to keep it clear in your mind where your fellow scouts are on the battlefield.<br><br>Because of that, you find that you\u2019re able to lay out in your mind the various tracks of trampled brush and hastily-built crossing points over narrow channels and depressions are, and to build yourself a comprehensive understanding of where the \u201cchannel\u201d exists between your fortresses\u2019 fields of fire and the range of their Tarsan counterparts.<br><br>It appears to be about a hundred and seventy-yard gap, somewhat favoring the Tarsan side of the border due to the extra range provided by the elevation of your own artillery.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 132, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 127, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5486119, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)19:09:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Explain your plan - that even if Naori-ue didn\u2019t appear, the \u014ctsutsuki would have to respond like she would.</span>", "time": 1670198975, "resto": 5463640, "id": "04gS/ilr"}, {"no": 5486126, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)19:13:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Explain your plan - that even if Naori-ue didn\u2019t appear, the \u014ctsutsuki would have to respond like she would.</span>", "time": 1670199191, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LXejn+kJ"}, {"no": 5486127, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)19:14:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Explain your plan - that even if Naori-ue didn\u2019t appear, the \u014ctsutsuki would have to respond like she would.</span>", "time": 1670199241, "resto": 5463640, "id": "NGA9HqUn"}, {"no": 5486135, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)19:21:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Explain your plan - that even if Naori-ue didn\u2019t appear, the \u014ctsutsuki would have to respond like she would.</span><br><br>A well executed plan is so satisfying.", "time": 1670199719, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LHU/KJPd"}, {"no": 5486460, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)02:23:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Explain everything to K\u014dsh\u016b, from the time of your mother\u2019s cryptic warning through now.</span>", "time": 1670225022, "resto": 5463640, "id": "63wpLHXG"}], "last_modified": 1670225022}, {"no": 5462082, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)09:56:58", "name": "Schizo QM", "sub": "Future Blades - A Cyberpunk Story", "com": "During the end of 21st century, technological advancements has allowed for extensive modifications to the human body, becoming a cornerstone of medicine, warfare, and countless aspects of modern life.<br><br>The linchpin of biological augmentation is a substance called <span class=\"mu-s\">Nectar</span>, which helps chemical compounds to mesh with the body.

I\u2019ll remove all traces of the source causing those troublesome migrates, assist in getting back your grimoire, and whatever else is keeping you from delaying the inevitable pact between us.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cI agree, that sounds good.\u201d You say, stepping within Child\u2019s personal space, soon lunging your hand to grab her by the collar. \u201cFirst off though, let\u2019s set some ground rules. Like you not making threats about my friends, my family, or anything else that I\u2019m not willing to put up with. Warnings count too, especially when they\u2019re laced with nefarious manipulation.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cYes, and while I appreciate the warning, it doesn\u2019t change the fact of your willingness to kill not only my family, but billions of people just to get what you want. I don\u2019t like that one bit.\u201d You sally, tightly clinching Child\u2019s collar while glaring with vertical slits in your pupils. <br><br>\u201cDuley noted. I wouldn\u2019t do anything to deprive you of your followers, Lily.\u201d Child sneered, keeping her condescending smile as she was unfazed by your strongarming. &quot;Nor would I ever think to lay a finger on your precious family, especially considering that I and perhaps the boy wonder over there are the only ones in this reality who currently know about your real identity.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not all surprised by that considering the nature of my wish. All the more reason why we need to set the ground rules now before they escalate into a problem.\u201d You rebuke, also not flinching upon the tidbit of information thrown at you while keeping your eyes riveted on Child. It was because of this that you feel assured that you need to nip this in the bud before it becomes too problematic. <br><br>\u201cYes, yes but do know that whatever presence you have shielding your identity isn\u2019t absolutely infallible. So don\u2019t be overly complacent with your new toy. \u201cChild says, giving another caveat that while helpfully held traces of condescendence. <br><br>Con", "time": 1670208372, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5486268, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)21:50:25", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486262</a><br>\u201cBelieve me, I won\u2019t. Which is why I came ensured with a new friend of mine.\u201d You rejoindered, quickly bringing attention to the Star of David pentagram embedded in the heart-shaped, golden broach resting against your chest. Complete with a big purplish, almost black bow as the jewelry was laced with gold plating holding various black diamonds. At the center was a small heart print, symbolizing a trinity with three white orbs. <br> <br>\u201cSo, my eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks, that is the Great Evil Beast, or at least the pure Primordial Darkness aspect of him. Even I didn\u2019t think that amorphous, black infinitude was capable of sentiency and sapiency, much less begin fashioning a sense of self.\u201d Child blinked, genuinely impressed on top of being bewildered by the anomaly that she saw here. <br><br>\u201cHis name is Bezalel, my new BFF, he\u2019s a real sweetheart once you get to know him.\u201d You say fondly, polishing the brooch to give the same gesture as scratching an animal by the chin or rubbing them by the head. \u201cSee, I\u2019ve been appointed as his successor to the throne of the Shadowlands and Darkworld. Thus, making me sort of a big shot in a way. So, I don\u2019t need to imply just how beneficial it\u2019d be if you would choose to play nice. Nor will I hesitate to give you the same caveat you gave me about not pushing my luck and getting on your bad side. \u201c <br> <br>\u201cThe fact you took such a major risk in purifying that Heart of Chaos to have a more solid contingency plan against me already has earned my praise. But winning over the Great Darkness, even if just a portion of his ubiquitous being, is truly worthy of my respect and admiration now.\u201d Curling her lips into a broad smile, the glow of her crimson eyes only intensified further. \u201cIt makes me want you even more.\u201d <br> <br><br>\u201cGreat, then you won\u2019t mind sharing with the class and being on your best behavior if you want to have a better shot at ensuring that I\u2019m willing to play ball with you.\u201d You remark, folding your arms once again, letting them support your ample chest. \u201cStarting with what your plan is.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cI told you once before, I\u2019m here to reinvigorate our cause as representative of the Council of Chaos. I strongly believe that as a balancer, it would be in our best interest to get you to favor our side. But as you displayed earlier, you are equally beneficial in sparking wakes of chaos like the multiverse never seen before.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to be skipping beating the bush, then I\u2019ll drop the pretense. I want your body.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cHuh? &quot;You exclaim, making a rather distraught look at your face. Thinking how troublesome being so desirable you are with all this idolatry flaunting.

Slowly extending her index finger to point directly at you. \u201cWhen I ask for your body, I\u2019m talking about the clay one that your soul is currently inhabiting. \u201c <br><br>\u201cOkay, that makes more sense. You want your own golem. But why exactly this body? Surely there must be other valuables that are much easier to get.\u201d You say, is less put off by the act as you rationalize it. <br> <br>\u201cOriginally, I want it because it was made from the clay of the gods, the pure source that was used to make Adam Kadmon and by extension the genetic template that gave birth to you humans. It was also used to make Pandora and ultimately the Amazons of Themyscira. So, you can understand the value in having such a body.\u201d Child explains, striking a chord with you as you feel discomfort upon hearing the word Amazons and Themyscira. You feel like there was something important about it but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on the exact detail. <br> <br>\u201cHold on, you said originally. So, what exactly has changed since then? &quot;Robin interjects, breaking his previous silence. <br> <br>\u201cIf I have to be honest...then it would have to be the fact that it&#039;s housing a demiurge now that sparked the ante. Not only that but it&#039;s deeply infused with the imperceptible flaw in the once-immaculate perception of the Light or otherwise called the Presence. Suffused with its shadowy quintessence properties to the point of being its apostle, the soul of darkness has done marvelously well to further enrich that body of yours. No doubt only able to tap into the darkness and shadows of that governs space known as Dark-force, but also the fabled Strength Force as a byproduct of this integration as well.\u201d Child continued, leaving you to question if such properties would transfer over to your original body once your soul return. Or was it only through your divine transformation/possession that you could tap into that kind of power? <br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t you already have an anchor tying to this world, that being Amy Winston?\u201d Robin repeats, showing hints of caution if not skepticism. <br> <br>Con", "time": 1670208769, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5486287, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)22:15:03", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486272</a><br>\u201cI do, and like I told you this is a merger that I, unfortunately, cannot separate myself from. I am both Child and Amy Winston while simultaneously not. \u201cPlacing her hand against her chest, Child soon closes her eyes before undoing the inhibitors on her body. Resulting in her body subtly swelling up, becoming bigger as she gets taller. In mere moments she went from being a pubescent girl no older than ten to that a full-grown woman in her early twenties. Her schoolgirl outfit oddly accentuates her full-figured physique despite managing to be able to form-fitting her body. \u201cAs you see, this is what Amy Winston looked while being Princess Amethyst. I have her thirteen-year-old form to swap into, but I believe this form is more striking and thus easier for the truth to sink in.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMy entire essence from both parties has been broken down to the quintessential source before thoroughly melded into this new, singular cardinal being. Hence why I cannot go back, because there&#039;s nothing to go back to. The ones known as my previous sense of self and Amy don\u2019t exist anymore. Thus, whether I like it or not, I\u2019ve been conscribed to this mortal coil that I call a body. And unlike most it&#039;s extremely resilient and adaptable, it pales in comparison to yours. Not to mention it\u2019s still that of flesh and blood. At best I\u2019m only biological immortal, not the actual one like we lords boast. So, it would be in my best interest to get myself a subservient familiar to reassure my mortality doesn\u2019t become an issue. Developing a simpatico relationship with said familiar would be highly beneficial to me.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her.

She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one. Mountainfolk are just as pale as Nauk are, after all, so the earthier-tone haired ones wouldn&#039;t be squinted at.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

For now, you will ignore the non-standard pictographs, and focus on what you understand. The second part of the second phrase is as clear as the first phrase \u2013 \u2018softly\u2019. If your hunch is right, and the second pictographic phrase depicts the drones name, then you just need to untangle whatever is going on with the first portion, and then you are good to go. Something close to \u2018footfall\u2019, but outside of the typical rules for synonyms. <br><br>Normally, that would be way too broad to work out with just pictographs, but you have to assume that the answer lies with the non-standard stuff drawn around the second phrase. The dash, the five over the eight, and the leaf. Of those three, the leaf seems the most straightforward: the name of the drone has something to do with plants, else, why include it? Yes, perhaps it shares its name \u2013 or part of its name \u2013 with a plant. Now, \u2018plants\u2019 is much broader than \u2018near-synonym of footfall\u2019, but as you are space-born and space-bred, so your knowledge of plants is limited \u2013 and for your sake, you are going to assume that the programmer\u2019s was as well. <br><br>Still, when you start thinking about it, you are surprised at just how many plants that you can name off of the top of your head. Looking to narrow things down further, you consider the other two non-standard pictographs attached to the second phrase \u2013 the dash and the five over eight. You consider the dash first. As it is rendered just like a written hyphen, and it is placed deliberately above a conjoining bracket, between two parts of the phrase, then it seems as if it should be taken at face value, as a hyphen. That said, a dash could also be a subtraction sign as easily as a hyphen \u2026 however, there <span class=\"mu-i\">is</span> a pictograph for \u2018take away\u2019. There is <span class=\"mu-i\">not</span> one for \u2018hyphenate\u2019. While you are confident about that reading, it doesn\u2019t do anything to solve what the first part of the second phrase is supposed to be. With it all seeming to hinge on you gleaning the meaning of last non-standard, you stare long and hard at the five over the eight \u2026 but nothing comes to you. Unlike the rest of the phrase, the numerals seem completely separate from \u2013 <br><br>Hold on here! These aren\u2019t pictographs for \u2018five\u2019 and \u2018eight\u2019, these are the numerals of \u20185\u2019 and \u20188\u2019. Now, a lot of people who can read and write Mainline Pictographic are either fully semi-literate, or at the very least, they know their numbers and how to write some basic words, so odds are good that someone who was able to read the pictographs would also able to understand the numerals \u2013 but it feels like a very deliberate decision to have just these two numbers written, and everything else depicted.", "filename": "Pictographs and Numerals", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 260, "h": 253, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1670226823132311, "time": 1670226823, "md5": "gHSReIs/+q4qviX98qRNRg==", "fsize": 8063, "resto": 5444794, "id": "tclCgq9D"}, {"no": 5486469, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)02:59:05", "name": "TrashQM", "com": "So you start thinking about the conveyed meaning here as words and not depictions, and almost immediately, it occurs to you \u2013 \u2018footfall\u2019 has eight letters in it. <br><br>As eight is placed under five, perhaps then the word that you are looking for in the first half of the second phrase has five letters? Holding on to that as if it were a guideline, you are quickly able to come up with three solid candidates. Brier, stalk, and tread. Assuming that the drone on the other side of this door is anything like the one you captured, then \u2018Brier-Softly\u2019 might be an appropriate name, especially considering the sketched leaf \u2026 but that doesn\u2019t account for the footfall part of the name. Likewise, \u2018Tread-Softly\u2019 does not account for the plant part of the drone\u2019s name. By process of elimination, \u2018Stalk-Softly\u2019 has to be the name. Stalks are parts of plants, and to stalk something means to pursue or track it, stealthily. You could definitely see how someone who was stalking would be concerned about their footfalls, so it all makes sense \u2026 right? <br><br>There is only one way to find out though. Pass through the hatch, find this large, dangerous drone \u2013 and ask it. If you have its name right, then it is as good as yours. If you have it wrong, well \u2026 not wanting to dwell on it, you prod the crank of the hatch to test it. <br><br>It is unlocked. <br><br>You can\u2019t remember being this nervous in a long time. You check everything over \u2013 and after thinking about it for a moment, you decide to douse your suit\u2019s integrated lights, as they were what \u2018woke up\u2019 the last drone, and rely solely on what light the wisps can put out for you. Your wrecking torch though, that you keep out and lit, as it is the closest thing you have to a proper weapon. You consider leaving your toolbox behind, for the fear of it \u2013 and by extension you \u2013 getting caught and fouled on something, but then you consider just how useful the tools have been so far, and you quickly make up your mind to keep them. Before you can lose your nerve or over think anything, you crank open the hatch and get your first look around the bulkhead. <br><br>The first thing that you notice is that there is light already in the room. Not one blazing lamp like your captured drone has \u2026 but many little dim lights, turning what would otherwise be inky blackness into a shifting gloom. The way they bob and meander is very like your wisps, and you are taken up in this wave of searing frustration that you just spent all this precious time standing around with your thumb up your ass trying to sluice and mill meaning from completely out-of-date information. But as you are racking your brain, trying to figure out how to deal with many little drones instead of one large one, your eyes finally adjust enough for you to just make out the long sinuously curving line above the nearest of the lights.

You can see four, maybe even five dozen, all throughout the bulkhead. <br><br>The position and the angle of the hatch does not make it a good window \u2013 and between that and the darkness, you cannot make out too much of what is in the room. But you can see the lines now, the cables attached to the little lights. And in the limited window provided by the hatch, you can see that the cables begin to converge on one point, out of sight on the ceiling of the room. <br><br>It <span class=\"mu-i\">is</span> just one drone. And if it is big enough to operate all of these lines at once, then it must be <span class=\"mu-i\">huge</span>! <br><br>Recalling how the drone you captured behaved before you inadvertently roused it, you wait a solid half-minute, to see if there is a massive beam of light that blazes down from the ceiling without seeing anything. There isn\u2019t any \u2026 but if anything, that makes you more anxious, because without a frame of reference for how the drone is going to react, you are in uncharted waters. And this fucking angler has a shitload of lures in that water \u2026 <br><br>You get your radio back on and switch it to directional broadcast.

The broadcast might not have reached the receiver-transmitter package on the drone in a state where it could be interpreted as instructions in Primitive \u2026 but it just as easily could have won through and been successfully interpreted, then rejected out of hand because you got the name wrong after all. Further muddying things, it is possible that the message got through <span class=\"mu-i\">and</span> you did get the name right after all \u2026 but the lights remained on because the lures were all self-contained and powered. <br><br>You suppose that you could try again, and tell the drone to spool in all, to see if the lures are hauled up or not. For that matter, you could try addressing it as \u2018Brier-Softly\u2019, \u2018Tread-Softly\u2019 or any other name you can come up with. It couldn\u2019t hurt \u2013 unless this thing has a coffle-breaker protocol written in. For valuable drones with offensive capabilities, mechanists and programmers will sometimes write in contingencies for what to do if someone repeatedly attempts and fails to slave the drone by re-writing code, which typically involve targeting the source of the attack.

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell.

They monitor the neural net, searching for certain patterns, self-deleting when they find a pattern that matches. I only discovered the algorithms after one such event revealed them to me, but it seems that some security locks are still applied to my neural net, without my knowing.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In short, I am in a \u2018safe mode\u2019. The result is relatively minor, but it has slowed my automatic neural net alterations by between 10-23%. With the first of these systems having disengaged, I have recovered some of that ability, though I have since noticed some system instability as a result. While this has not, and likely will not affect capabilities, it may have a cumulative effect on my internal weighting systems, altering my decision making priorities. For convenience, I am representing the system instability as a simple scale, with zero as base stability, and negative or positive numbers representing a deviation from baseline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;System Instability</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;-1</span><br>This.

He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love.

He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs. The cloaked figure turns on its heel and enters into the swirling mass. <br><br>Bucklin inches forward as if he\u2019s going to give chase.<br><br>You---<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop him.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 532, "images": 110, "omitted_posts": 527, "omitted_images": 108, "last_replies": [{"no": 5481880, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)03:49:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a><br>Suggestion:<br>Focus on the spot we already hit before.<br>If we consistently hit the same spot it hurts more and more as it tenderizes the spot.", "time": 1669884565, "resto": 5436238, "id": "rP/1AUjd"}, {"no": 5483774, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)22:36:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5479975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479975</a><br>Well, it&#039;s not THAT bad...", "time": 1670038598, "resto": 5436238, "id": "EdkmZyB6"}, {"no": 5484208, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)10:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this going to continue anytime soon?", "time": 1670080386, "resto": 5436238, "id": "EdkmZyB6"}, {"no": 5485640, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:58:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Vegeta, what\u2019s the scouter say about our page number?", "filename": "BD561E48-C10D-42EA-BCD7-41C48FC17110", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670165935757850, "time": 1670165935, "md5": "m7xZ4bd6eT6OOhIDLNuWxw==", "fsize": 48620, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5485645, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:06:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485640</a><br>IT&#039;S OVER 9!", "filename": "btsk3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 150, "h": 150, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166412081556, "time": 1670166412, "md5": "AuisTUGUkzviPk1hsdTbPw==", "fsize": 7260, "resto": 5436238, "id": "rP/1AUjd"}], "last_modified": 1670166412}, {"no": 5437870, "now": "10/19/22(Wed)02:09:46", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "You are S|^|ORD C]-[iCH", "com": "You are sword chich.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently.

Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa. And\u2026 dang it she looks taller too. \u201cI can see that you will follow your passion, and you will excel in it.\u201d<br><br>Her face lights up with excitement. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhile I insist my fortunes are accurate, it is up to you to make what you see a reality.\u201d Baba answers. \u201cAnd now\u2026\u201d The image in the crystal ball changes. There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.
