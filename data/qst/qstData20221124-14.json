For the last several months, I have been running this project with individual players controlling their own civilizations on a randomly-generated fantasy world of my design. The game is played out in a series of ages, in which players experience random events, are given the choice to perform a number of actions of their desire, and progress along technological and magical trees. Much like in a Civilization-style game, once each player has finished their actions for an age, all players advance to the next era and the cycle continues.<br><br>I have decided to allow you, the anonymous players of /qst/, in on the project, now that we are about ten ages into the world&#039;s history.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai.

Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 58, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 53, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5474412, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)00:12:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 4 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5474404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5474404</a>", "time": 1669266745, "resto": 5463640, "id": "04gS/ilr"}, {"no": 5474451, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)01:18:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 5 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5474404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5474404</a>", "time": 1669270690, "resto": 5463640, "id": "y/xNGhTG"}, {"no": 5474475, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)01:42:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 3 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5474404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5474404</a>", "time": 1669272164, "resto": 5463640, "id": "Q6wRUTZU"}, {"no": 5474549, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)03:30:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 6 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5474404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5474404</a>", "time": 1669278627, "resto": 5463640, "id": "+kaVoPW0"}, {"no": 5474803, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:18:45", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5474404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5474404</a><br>By noon, you can\u2019t keep rushing forward in even feigned ignorance of what\u2019s been going on behind you, and so your group is obliged to turn and fight.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

From humble beginnings on the now long gone Planet Vegeta, Karn has become the pride of his people, and their greatest champion.<br><br>Character sheets and other info: <br>https://controlc.com/46ec566d<br>https://pastebin.com/u/GrandDragonQ<wbr>M<br>Archive:<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/qstarchive.html?searchall=Saiyan<wbr>+Conqueror+Quest<br>Help fund quest art commissions here: https://www.patreon.com/GrandDragon<wbr>QM<br><br>Quest rules are as follows:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;30 minute voting windows</span><br><span class=\"mu-r\">&gt;Pick ONLY ONE option when voting(unless otherwise noted)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dice rolls are all best of first three, only correctly rolled dice pools will count</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One dice roll per person per post unless three players have not yet rolled, and ten minutes has passed since your last roll</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crits are 100 on a d100(a 99 or paired rolls may net you an extra bonus)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crit fails are a 1/100 with no passing rolls, or if two 1s are rolled regardless of the third</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Write-ins are both allowed and encouraged, but OOC options will be ignored</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can change any of the above rules at any time for any or no reason</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If your goal is simply to troll, at least put in enough effort to make it funny</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have fun</span><br><br>SCQ will usually start on Saturdays at noon Eastern Standard Time, and run throughout the weekend.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn\u2019t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types.

You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept. But I have no idea what makes Cass appealing, what you saw in her or what the MC saw in her. She was just a random blob, a slime, that did random things for no rhyme or reason. What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 493, "images": 106, "omitted_posts": 488, "omitted_images": 105, "last_replies": [{"no": 5464348, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)17:00:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464248</a><br>Admitting a problem is the first step to fixing it, and it seems you are already on the second one.<br>I look foward to whatever this story ends up getting us to.", "time": 1668549651, "resto": 5436238, "id": "gmO9gUI1"}, {"no": 5464414, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)18:27:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464248</a><br>How dare you blog post, Forever QM!

It intends to let its full wrath explode out of its carcass, until either the hamlet is nothing but accursed dirt, or its master comes to slay it a final time. As it moves, however, its flickering ears pick up the sound of hoofbeats trailing through the forest. It looks up, witnessing the fourth God to have shown its face in Bottomrite. The Moon-Touched Prey beholds the DEMON HORSE, feeling a solitary thread of connection to its infernal splendour. Though they may not be kin or allies yet, they are both Divine Beasts. Their existences themselves are wild and untamed, and thus it feels more respect for this hoofed fiend than it ever could for all the deities of the world. <br><br>Its body, no longer able to tower over the treetops like before, sheds waterfalls of flesh that crawl across the leaf litter like great grey maggots. The Moon-Touched Prey gathers up the discarded meat, working it into rotten appendages and tubes of biomass. It braces its legs against the ground and heaves, snapping them off and showering the earth with the black tar that poses as its blood. Finally, after mutilating itself into a deplorable mass of mangled meat, it gets to work on rebuilding. Its joints twist the other way, fully turned around in their sockets. The old flesh clings to lanky vertebrae that extend from the gaping wound in its back, forming numerous tendrils to push it across the ground. It softly rejects the offer to be carried in the jaws of its saviour. Instead, it will show Him that it can still run on its own twisted feet despite its weak state.

With a lack of worship, its flesh is now decomposing in earnest, but it fondly recalls when it was able to easily stave off the degeneration. Mortal beasts don&#039;t have the same sort of influence that it does, but their bodies ought to be far easier to sculpt. It tries its hand at granting them this gift. As it gallops alongside the mighty stallion, it allows wisps of its magic to latch onto passing creatures and propagate between species. Eventually, it will reach the forest and be among its kin once more. Their bodies shall attempt to keep themselves preserved as long as they live, preventing their cells from reacting to pathogens from the outside world. Heinous wounds are able to stave off infection, and oftentimes, beasts who receive injuries are unaware of them, spared from the shock. It becomes common to see animals with segments of their body missing, or chunks gouged out by the accursed predators who still wander the fringes of the swamps.

Being mindless animals, they know not what they&#039;re being compelled to do. They kneel in silence throughout the night, with Sirvee watching from atop trees as the stars gradually wink out. Broken corpses are gathered up in their jaws and dragged across the swamps, haphazardly arranged to form more altars.

Your mom stays at home all day, she cleans cooks, and dose the normal roles of any housewife. But also has all the time in the world to pursue her hobbies. Which consist of, painting, playing guitar, and tons of other athletic hobbies. She spins way too much time at the gym, doing yoga and varies dance classes.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks.

And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm.

He already knew a little of alchemy because he is a shaman apprentice. I figured I could use his help.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you working with goblins?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>&quot;They&#039;re monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;Don&#039;t be a bigot. They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night. They are vulnerable to the sun.&quot;<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1666139465, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437509, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437500</a><br><br>&quot;Vulnerable to the sun, huh? Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me. I decided to help them as well.&quot;<br>&quot;They will just rob and rape people once their tribe is strong enough.&quot;<br>&quot;Rude!&quot;, says the goblin tending to the cauldrons.<br>&quot;Not all goblins are rapist and thieves. Most of them are too scared of their own shadow to try doing anything like this.&quot;<br>&quot;Could you spare us some poultice as well?

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}]}, {"page": 8, "threads": [{"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

A national scandal, of which you are the main protagonist, followed very quickly.<br><br>Here you are, alone in front of several dozen journalists from all over the country, in a large room set up for the occasion. This is your first public appearance since the beginning of the scandal. There is no doubt that you have done wrong; you can no longer prove that you are innocent. However, you can limit the damage and save your reputation. Those journalists will be the pawns in the media chess game you are about to play. <br><br>Welcome to the most important press conference of your life.<br><br>[Cont.]", "filename": "intro", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 449, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 224, "tim": 1665528417296159, "time": 1665528417, "md5": "kzQ+fDQklBRKdLEq5g0iDw==", "fsize": 38297, "resto": 0, "id": "tMyBblQL", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "you-fucked-up", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 480, "images": 18, "omitted_posts": 475, "omitted_images": 18, "last_replies": [{"no": 5473952, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)17:00:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5473548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5473548</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;A little, but I&#039;d rather have lived that life than the one my parents wanted me to have.&quot;</span>", "time": 1669240812, "resto": 5431180, "id": "82qHYcPi"}, {"no": 5473983, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)17:18:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5473548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5473548</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;Honestly, I don&#039;t know.

We follow oaths bound by law before God, and keep true to the codes of chivalry and honor. In fact, I followed a vow of silence until recently, as part of a pledge for my order.&quot;<br>\u201cSilence?\u201d<br>\u201cYes, it is a trial that allows for self-reflection and discipline. It is not often taken up, but I wanted to show my fellow knights that no obstacle is too great if one puts their mind to it.\u201d<br>\u201cWoah, like not talking at all? Even one bit?\u201d<br>\u201cNot even one bit.\u201d<br>\u201cBut what if you need help?\u201d<br>\u201cIt is good when aid comes to thee, but as someone championing thy people, should never rely upon the hope of its arrival.\u201d<br><br>She looks down contemplatively as you continue.<br>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong! There are trials thee cannot risk failing, and therefore mustn\u2019t try to overcome on your own. On such occasions, everyone knows what they work for, and that is the most important. Not one\u2019s own safety.\u201d<br>She bites her lips listening to you, and her eyebrows knit together.<br>\u201cI understand thy worry, but duty is something shared across people, and across generations. Claiming it is upon one or a mere few disrespects the effort and convictions of all others. There were people before you, and if they could do it, you won\u2019t be found wanting either as long as you do not give up.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSo how long did this vow last?\u201d<br>\u201cA little short of a two years.\u201d<br>\u201cHow did the others react to it?\u201d<br>\u201cAt first bemused, and I admit it transformed into annoyance before it became respect. They started to accept it as a fact of life before my liege asked me to accept a leadership position, where I had to cast it off.\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, makes sense. I don\u2019t think I could do that. Spells require spoken words.\u201d<br>\u201cI can see how that could be a deterrent.\u201d<br>Silence sets in, as she seems to be deep in thought. While you are used to the quiet, so you let her ponder. You\u2019ve seen young squires \u2013 though she is too old to be a squire \u2013 with similar problems before their first campaign. They sometimes need time and encouragement.<br><br>\u201cSo you are in a \u2018command position\u2019, like Headmistress Olivia?\u201d<br>\u201cSort of I suppose. I share the same rank with eleven others in our host, with many knights under my command.\u201d<br>\u201cAre they like you?\u201d<br>\u201cIn a manner of speaking? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, even knights. Though I suppose I have the advantage of experience.\u201d<br>\u201cI remember seeing Headmistress Olivia move around all the time, telling people what to do and often stopping them. When I was little, I used to think she just likes ordering people around.\u201d she chuckles \u201cIt took me embarrassingly long to realize she doesn\u2019t seem as happy about it.

You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets?

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

Mercenary captain. Dark Flier. Witch. Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession brought you into conflict against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church, with you coming out on top each bout.

With great difficulty and almost zero visibility, you and your best mercenaries ventured through the terrifying forest, when you were ambushed by Dolofonos, an assassin eerily similar to Kronya. Having been separated from the group, you were forced to duel the assassin.

We cannot afford to throw away experienced soldiers on a whim! The Sword of the Creator has reappeared in Garreg Mach! Even now, she rallies the Knights of Seiros to her.

The Sword of the Creator will be ours. We\u2019ve suffered a minor setback, but you know better than anyone what we are capable of. After all, do you not owe your current position to our aid?\u201d<br><br>Bennett sat back into his chair, examining Montgomery, no, Odesse, as though looking at him for the first time. Though he knew it was a necessary step, he loathed having asked these Agarthans for their help with each passing day. Odesse might have been playing the part of doting servant, but Bennett knew when he was being looked down on. And he knew the man in front of him well enough to understand the underlying threat within his speech. If only he still had reliable servants like Fritz and Ivan at his side. But Ivan was now dead, likely a calculated move by this monster. And as for Fritz, he\u2019d been missing ever since Garreg Mach fell. He was nowhere to be found within the monastery\u2019s dungeon, likely having either escaped or been killed.<br><br>\u201cMy lord, please leave everything to me.\u201d Montgomery bows once more. \u201cMy associates are already making their move, and I assure you in just a short time, these problems will disappear overnight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bennet says. \u201cHandle it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThen by your leave.\u201d Montgomery exits the study, leaving Bennett alone to his thoughts.<br><br>\u201cAgarthans\u2026\u201d Bennett muttered alone. It wasn\u2019t just him that Odesse was looking down on. It was all of humanity. That they viewed themselves as superiors was a notion that caused the Patriarch no shortage of amusement. Would a superior people have been nearly wiped out by the Goddess? Would they spend their lives cowering underground, as far away from her light as possible? Would they carry out elaborate schemes and plots, unable to act out in the open, lest humanity rise up and destroy whatever remnants of their tattered empire remained? Would they be blind to their own machinations, unable to see when even one of their own was plotting to betray them?<br><br>The Patriarch exited his chair to look out his window, and gaze upon all that his \u201cpartnership\u201d had earned him. He looked forward to the day he crushed the Agarthans under his heel. Until then, he\u2019d play his part dutifully.

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them.

They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.
