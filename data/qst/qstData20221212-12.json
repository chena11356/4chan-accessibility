Thousands of faint lights twinkle across the curving sky of the colony\u2019s cylindrical interior, the urban landscape of Zeon\u2019s capital stretching in every direction. Dark clouds pass over distant crisscrossing streets upon the opposite side of the great closed-type colony.<br><br>Footsteps sound in the dark, Casval and Atresia keeping along your left as the three of you jog your way across the vast grounds of the Zabi estate. The spiked and imposing silhouette of the Zabi\u2019s hideous mansion stares down at you, a pair of green windows near its top appearing almost as eyes set within a great spiked helmet. It\u2019s watching. <span class=\"mu-i\">They\u2019re</span> watching. Your every move is being watched, and will continue to be, almost every second of every day for the foreseeable future.<br><br>The carefully manicured grounds surrounding the mansion are expansive, and even in the dim light you can pick out the bright hues of red and white flowers - but there is something lifeless to them. A soulless sort of blandness which almost escaped your notice, everything in ordered rows and careful geometric displays - there\u2019s nothing natural or flowing to any of it, no true life. Other than the guards keeping watch along the entrances to the estate, and the gardeners that tend the plots, you doubt anyone ever visits them. The grounds and gardens are meant to be observed from above, looked down upon from the mansion&#039;s highest levels, just one of countless details in a landscape controlled entirely by the Zabis. <br><br>\u201cI doubt we\u2019ll be heard out this far.\u201d Casval says, slowing slightly, his blue eyes scanning intently over the brightly lit guardhouses along the tall outer wrought iron fence, \u201cThe guards look distracted. We\u2019re clear to talk for a few minutes.\u201d<br><br>Following his gaze toward the guardhouses you quickly come to the same conclusion. Your eyesight has always been a little better than his, but he\u2019s not wrong - it\u2019s difficult to tell much from this distance, but the green uniformed guards stationed along the distant fence don&#039;t seem to be watching the three of you right now.", "filename": "Mobile Suit Gundam Quest 2", "ext": ".png", "w": 542, "h": 508, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 234, "tim": 1670700702245281, "time": 1670700702, "md5": "EJgifKhaIIOyQIpZ+++Oug==", "fsize": 74815, "resto": 0, "id": "KWuoNayv", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mobile-suit-gundam-quest-2", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 90, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 85, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5493947, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)01:14:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493938</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dCasval, do you think they\u2019re all networked?

Having just reunited with your fellow Shangralans and Astartes sons, whom have traveled the webway alongside your Beloved Emerald Lotus blossom, Kanzeon, and her sister, Anahita, to reinforce Angron&#039;s own every growing army of former gladiators and slaves, you noticed your followers amongst the Aeldari race were keeping a distance between themselves and your once enslaved brothers. Seeking answers from Noble Carys and valorous Folant, you learned the truth of how your brother was made a slave to begin with and the role the ever prophecy chasing Aeldari of the craftworlds played in it in their attempt to avert the dread future they beheld.<br><br>So, as you are not a simpleton who blames the world for one the ill deeds of the few, you decided it would be best for Angron to know of the truth of his capture and the cause for his attempted assassination, in the pursuit of bringing peace to his mind and preventing any misunderstandings or resentment from arising between him and the fair Aeldair, because of the misguided and foolish actions of those sycophants of destiny. After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens. And you know that as well as you know that those whom are different are often held with unwarranted suspicion and mistrust.<br><br>Which is why it is best to reveal the truth to your brother and introduce him to Aeldari whom are not distant and deserving of said mistrust.<br><br>&quot;And who better than myself and Folant&quot; Carys says jauntily, as the more dour ranger marches at your side &quot;To prove that not all of our people are apathetic to the plight of humanity, or retain the overwrought sense of pride that lead us to ruin&quot;<br>Cont", "filename": "2nd Primarch 1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2581, "h": 1629, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 157, "tim": 1670495207074792, "time": 1670495207, "md5": "JWOS55uFl9loV5F4cGuQ+g==", "fsize": 1119220, "resto": 0, "id": "RBVYiFdu", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-2nd-primarch-quest-22", "trip": "!!RS7NSuo3fkv", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 56, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 51, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5493104, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)07:14:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493093</a><br>I mean it could be best not to play all of our cards, you never know who might be watching.", "time": 1670760882, "resto": 5489667, "id": "hVJ4mXfA"}, {"no": 5493111, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)07:53:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493093</a><br>Because Angeron doesn&#039;t have a martial art and we do?

A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline. To which you&#039;ll be deciding as well.<br><br><br>Continue in the next post.", "filename": "image_2022-12-07_210410966", "ext": ".png", "w": 3840, "h": 2400, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 156, "tim": 1670465366009997, "time": 1670465366, "md5": "2mNexXWkJtNLD9RHIpdfOg==", "fsize": 7042000, "resto": 0, "id": "p/s8vl0p", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dragon-ball-origins-1", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 91, "images": 10, "omitted_posts": 86, "omitted_images": 10, "last_replies": [{"no": 5493542, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)18:02:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493535</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Commit to fulfilling the duties that Lord Beerus desire.

Here, the sky is crystal blue, the grass is lush green, and the homes are purity white. From the centre of it all, St.Maria watches over all she sees. From the foot of her door, to the far off horizon. More often than not, the three bells of St.Maria ring to remind all of her ever baleful gaze. <br><br>Yet most who live within the long reach of St.Maria know not what each chime and gong means. For the farmers, there is simply a bell to wake, a bell to work, and a bell to sleep. Conversely, for those in the know, the bells carry much more rigid instructions with every nuanced change in octave. They tell when to exercise, when to praise the god emperor, and even how high to jump.

Mercenary Captain. Dark Flier. Witch. Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession has brought you into several conflicts against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church. Currently, you are in the direct employment of Claude von Riegan, leader of the Leicester Alliance, on a diplomatic mission to provide aid to the embattled Church of Seiros.<br><br>After a grueling battle in the remote Edmund Woods with not only the Orthodox Knights, but one of the Seven Sages of Agartha as well, the Blackwings emerged victorious. Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

All the while during the revolt, the Planetary Governor asked for more troops from Icarus, and more time to meet the Tithe from the Administratum.<br><br>From his correspondence alone, the culprit and motives seemed much more straightforward. A rebel snuck into the stubborn and unyielding Governor\u2019s estate to strike a decisive blow against a callous despot. The theory didn\u2019t seem airtight with you, especially with the missing documents from the desk. Something didn\u2019t add up, so you all tried your hand at interrogating the civilians present during the murder at the estate\u2019s guest house. <br><br>The interviews were fruitful. You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald\u2019s murder only minutes before his body was found. You heard about several potential suspects whose jobs in the government were threatened by the ongoing revolt. You learned of a young staffer that had gone missing the evening prior. Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor\u2019s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald\u2019s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room. You raced with your comrade back to the office, whereupon opening the large window behind the desk, you found a torn piece of fabric hanging on a wooden lattice on the exterior wall. It was the same kind of fabric the house servants wore.<br><br>So far, for being mere Arbites Troopers, you all were doing pretty good. So good in fact, that you had nearly forgotten you weren\u2019t assigned to this murder by the time the person who was arrived: Inquisitor Weiss. You couldn\u2019t get a good read on Weiss, she seemed aggravated at being undercut, but after you told her all that you had uncovered, she went ahead and let you keep investigating. Weiss took over interrogations, of course, and with the recovered fabric as a catalyst, she proceeded to march all the house servants down the hill to their quarters to begin questioning.<br><br>She didn\u2019t take the fabric, though. Requisitioning one of the hounds the local government used to catch fleeing laborers(and some cool bikes from the PDF), you tracked the scent of the fabric all the way from the courtyard of the estate\u2026 down to the well near the servant\u2019s quarters.

Remembering those odd, body-rifling bloodstains by Archibald\u2019s corpse, you wondered if any of the killer\u2019s scent might remain on his body. Turns out, it did. Your steadfast canid ran right out of the house after a couple whiffs, and you all finally got to ride those bikes over some terrain, going out a couple klicks behind the estate to the edge of a forest.<br><br>Once there, it seemed the trail had gone cold again, but the only problem was that the dog couldn\u2019t fly. There were skid-marks on the ground(the vehicular kind), that indicated some kind of light aircraft had touched down recently. You took measurements of the skid impressions in the dirt and returned to the estate.<br><br>When you returned, the Inquisitor had managed to get the safe open, and graciously gave you all the chance to peek at its contents. There were letters from friends, letters from a (possibly illegitimate) son, and, most concerningly, correspondence with an Ecclesiarchal Cardinal Theodore Flemming. The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers. The cardinal\u2019s response was a gentle <span class=\"mu-i\">\u2019please, Emperor, do not do that.\u2019</span><br><br>With seemingly nothing left to investigate, the Inquisitor kindly flew you off-planet to the voidship where the rest of your superiors were being held by the Mechanicus(long story). You took the opportunity to enlist the aid of a young Tech-Priest in finding out what kind of vessel matched the dimensions of the skid-marks you found planetside, and what voidships those matching vessels embarked upon.<br><br>It was an Arvus Lighter, and it docked with a grain carrier bound for Icarus. You left the Mechanicus ship for the Inquisitor\u2019s personal strike-cruiser, but not before the Tech-Priest blessed your shock maul. You\u2019re not sure it actually did anything, but he seemed nice.<br><br>On the way back to Icarus, you could have gotten laid. You didn\u2019t, but you could have. Redmore told you all that the Inquisitor requested your squad continue investigating the murder once you all were back on Icarus, and there might have been some backroom deal made with her in exchange for saving them from the wrath of the Mechanicus(long story, it\u2019s seriously cool now, don\u2019t ask).<br><br>Due to a riot that happened at the Arbites Department of Justice\u2019s prison, your squad split up, and you and Groves arrived at the Icarian Orbital Spire with just Grist and Redmore.

The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good.

Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth.

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do?</span>", "filename": "emberbloom", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 230, "h": 232, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166406325092, "time": 1670166406, "md5": "ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==", "fsize": 7437, "resto": 5481579, "id": "lnm/GTa9"}, {"no": 5485686, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea", "time": 1670168397, "resto": 5481579, "id": "OHAWgWLt"}, {"no": 5485828, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers", "time": 1670181491, "resto": 5481579, "id": "qHCPuy7I"}, {"no": 5486015, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1", "time": 1670192389, "resto": 5481579, "id": "E+RiA0+u"}, {"no": 5486052, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

Having learned of that, Claudia and Klaus resolved to ensure the justice is served with their direct personal participation - painfully aware of precarious position of the Alliance between Olga&#039;s monstrous horde and the mercenary army that was meant to be the decisive force, now turned out to be another enemy.

Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear.

Intense red was never really your thing. One of the stencils includes fish, and you use it to tease Meryl, but she demands it be excluded, causing raised eyebrows as to what the fuss is about. The hasty excuse that her dad&#039;s a marine biologist is enough to make it work.<br><br>The final result coming from your little coordinated attempt didn&#039;t render as well as you had thought.

But you suppress it for now, because once you start that, you won&#039;t be able to stop. Okay, maybe you can get in a quick squeeze while the artist isn&#039;t looking.

Jane was right, he is a handsome devil. Bit of a lost puppy look to him, though. If his bio is right, he spent his childhood in a rich man&#039;s home, then an orphanage, and now lives on the road with no permanent address. Probably has little to no idea how to interact with society. Still, he has a reason to help you, maybe, depending on how his relationship with his old man and his former organization turns out. And he&#039;s definitely strong, which would be a valuable asset. He&#039;s your best bet.<br><br>&quot;I&#039;m thinking we give Carter a shot,&quot; you say, and toss his photograph onto the table in front of the others.<br><br>Jane smirks. &quot;You sure your motives are pure, here, Fields?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, seriously.&quot; You lean back in your chair as you think it over. &quot;Our only real options are Carter, the Saito brother, and Rosa. Rosa&#039;s tough, but she seems like the type to put family first. Outside of keeping them safe, it&#039;s not personal for her, so she has no reason to help us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what about Saito?&quot; Jane asks. &quot;He&#039;s a real color-inside-the-lines kid, probably be happy to be on the side of the law. And he&#039;s already got a grudge against the Circle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#039;s what worries me,&quot; you say. &quot;People like that, the tightly wound ones, they&#039;re the kind who might snap when things get personal.

I&#039;d rather keep him out of it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which leaves us with him,&quot; Jane says, tapping the photograph.<br><br>Dupont says, &quot;You think that this ... fighting hobo is our best chance at an ally.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#039;s not a good option, but it&#039;s the best we&#039;ve got,&quot; you say. &quot;Where is he now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, about that ...&quot; <br><br>&quot;You lost him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#039;m afraid a dense mountainous forest populated mostly by truck drivers and lumberjacks is hardly the ideal environment for an Interpol observer.&quot; Dupont shuffles some papers. &quot;We believe he was on hand to witness Ryoma Saito&#039;s victory -- the two appear to share a personel connection of some kind. This took place in a tiny village up in British Columbia, Canada. But we&#039;re not sure where either of them went afterwards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#039;ll make it a priority,&quot; Jane says. &quot;These two will stand out.

So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 179, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 174, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 5493991, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)02:07:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;It\u2019s fine.

Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time.

The windows are large and light. Surrounding the lake there is a garden, and near the main building stands a low, but spacious wood-and-glass structure, inside which you spot various unknown mechanisms.<br><br>You knock on the gates of the house.

She is a young girl dressed in uncharacteristically light, draped clothing. Flowing lines of gentle, white fabric fall over her shoulders and loosely hug her hips.

How do you get your supplies?&quot;<br>&quot;I need very little conventional food. I mostly get the nourishment I need from the magical energy I gain through meditation and conversing with the Black Wolf itself. Though I do trade my harvests for some supplies.&quot;<br>&quot;You trade?&quot; -- Eos asks, curiosity in her voice. -- &quot;I thought you were a hermit or something.&quot;<br>The White Lady laughs.<br>&quot;Nothing like that. Though I do disguise myself when I go to Seetu. The folk don&#039;t need to worry about me being among them. I also get fabric for my clothes there, some other supplies such as tools and materials. A lot of things, really.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell us more about the Black Wolf.&quot; -- you ask, noting several of your companions have taken seats around the table.<br>&quot;What magic do you use to keep it at bay?&quot; -- Diodorus adds.<br>&quot;It&#039;s a set of talismans encircling an area with a protective barrier of taut arcane strings. As for the Black Wolf... A long time ago, there was a sorcerer who, for one reason or another, constructed a magical being of darkness to fulfill his wishes. Eventually, as the being kept amassing power, it took over its master and brought untold destruction upon the lands. The heroes that eventually defeated it were unable to completely erase its presence, and so made this prison and appointed the first White Lady to oversee it. The tradition is kept to this day.&quot;<br>&quot;Is it possible to discover a way to end this being?&quot; -- you ask.<br>&quot;If it was, someone would&#039;ve done that already.&quot; -- she answers with a tint of sorrow in her voice. -- &quot;I guess it would require a major purification spell. Some of the adventurers are already engaged in this task, but I am yet to hear of any success in their endeavours.&quot;<br>&quot;Has the Black Wolf ever breached the barrier?&quot; -- you ask.<br>&quot;It has.

Is it a lifetime position, anyways?&quot;<br>&quot;No. Once the position is passed to a successor, we revert to our original look. We stay young for the duration of the service, but this, unfortunately, disappears as well. As for how long it lasts... We usually recruit a girl of 10 years. For 10 years, she remains an apprentice to the current White Lady, then the position is passed to the new one. What follows is 10 years of solitary work and 10 more years in which the new White Lady trains her successor in turn.

Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

Both the volumetric yield and accuracy of the weapon seem to be limited by our sensor readouts. However, even in its reduced state, its unique advantages are considerable. Personally, I find this device disconcerting. At rest, the structure reminds me of the impossible diagrams I would puzzle over as a child - a cousin to the ever-rising staircases or the self-intersecting knots. In motion, the squirming movement of its whisking, turning blades exudes a sense of wrongness that is difficult to describe.&quot; [Roll required for each attack; roll penalties when fired close to large gravitational bodies.]</span>", "time": 1670842999, "resto": 5453877, "id": "kz0iEG6J"}, {"no": 5494164, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)06:38:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5494081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5494081</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Biology. &quot;...carbon based scavenger/herbivore species with a two-stage life cycle...&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THE FOOL [CLASS IV HYPOMETRIC WEAPON].</span>", "time": 1670845094, "resto": 5453877, "id": "t/1UkO62"}], "last_modified": 1670845094}, {"no": 5456890, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)22:38:57", "name": "Life Fiber OP", "sub": "Kill la Kill Quest 5: &quot;Friend or Foe&quot;", "com": "Welcome to Part 5 of Kill la Kill Quest!<br><br>Your name is Anon Meipan, you were a member of the lower class, the no-star student body until a chance encounter gave you an opportunity you&#039;d never dreamed off.

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 150, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 145, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5492351, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)15:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5492329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5492329</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&quot;Even if she&#039;s not perfect, this is the Schala I want to be with.&quot;</span>", "time": 1670705105, "resto": 5452883, "id": "CT3ZnOkP"}, {"no": 5492373, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:13:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5492329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5492329</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of us is &#039;perfect&#039;, though you come pretty close.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I accept you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t want to argue your assessment though.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I only want to be with you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(if you would have me)</span><br><br>in weakness or in strength, above clouds or below.<br>We don&#039;t want to acquiesce entirely to her self esteem issues, or deny her effort or choice if she wants to move in some direction, her inner kindness is unlikely to change if it hadn&#039;t during what she already went through.<br><br><br>Lavos headmate is worrying though.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one. Mountainfolk are just as pale as Nauk are, after all, so the earthier-tone haired ones wouldn&#039;t be squinted at.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn\u2019t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types. But eventually, all you received was a phone call directing you to a rooftop overlooking a bunch of warehouses in downtown Austin, Texas. <br><br>And to \u201cprocure critical ordinance, then wait for instructions.\u201d<br><br>The ordinance in question was a stylish black full-body suit and helmet, perfectly fitting your form.
