3,5489400,,,12/07/22(Wed)21:09:26,Koku,Dragon Ball Origins #1,"Welcome to another Dragon Ball Quest thematically named Dragon Ball Origins™. This is inspired by the original DBO but also a play on DB Online as it will be taking many pieces from there. We&#039;ll be playing a Youthful upstart in the world of Dragon Ball and their involvement in many of the series&#039; iconic events. Although we will be going through the Original DB and perhaps beyond, this quest will be taking elements from multiple interpretations (Kakarot, Jaco, etc.) and adjusting them accordingly to fit a cohesive narrative. As well as incorporating other related works from the Toriyamaverse.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Who do we play specifically?</span><br>A Character named Pinich/Pinchi depending on the choice below. A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline. To which you&#039;ll be deciding as well.<br><br><br>Continue in the next post.",1670465366,0,p/s8vl0p,,dragon-ball-origins-1,0,57,7,"[{'no': 5491331, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)19:01:08', 'name': 'Koku', 'com': '<a href=""#p5491324"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491324</a><br>More or less. I don’t have the erratic insecurities of a child or any impurities to cloud my judgment. The presence of mind-forged from nine straight years of meditation all but ensures my emotions will never overpower my rationale. No matter how explosive or tempestuous. Hence, I also had the foresight to realize that even if I did go it would’ve painted a target on my back. While I’m confident I could eliminate countless saiyans, the Frieza Force is another matter. As I am now, I’m uncertain whether or not I could beat Frieza. And I certainly don’t have the intention of hijacking another’s a body to obtain the power necessary to ensure victory. &quot;You explained, slowly grasping your hand. <br> <br>“That’s most fortunate. It would be rather disappointing to have another Beerus running around.” Whis chimes, keeping an otherwise neutral smile on his face. “And it would equally be troublesome if you tried to leave this planet only to march straight to your imminent demise. Lord Beerus would extremely be unhappy about losing his idol. Perhaps to the point that I don’t think even killing Frieza himself would quell his fury.” <br><br>“I see. That’s good to know.” You mutter, still gauging the angelic attendant as your sight saw no signs of weakness or flaws to give way for an opening. “You called me Konzen Douji. Tell me, is that my name?” <br> <br>Whis nods, keeping his eyes solely on you. “That’s right, Lord Beerus asked of me to come up with a proper name for you. Of course, I did some research on what the project that gave existence dubbed you. I believe the name is Pinich/Pinch, mostly born as a play on the pressing situation that gave birth to you I’d imagine. Hoping that you thrived in response to adversity and become stronger as well as gradually becoming immune to the crisis. ” <br> <br>Pondering this tidbit of information for a moment, your gaze softens for a bit before remaining stoic. “I understand, but that still doesn’t answer the meaning of my name. Only why I was renamed at all.” <br> <br>“The reason why I choose Kozen Douji or Konzenshi as its alternatively pronounced lies with that of the cicadas.” Whis remarks, turning to fetch his wand and prompt up the imagery of said insectoid. <br> <br>“Cicadas, please elaborate.” For a brief flicker, there was a tinge of genuine curiosity radiating from your eyes.

This is especially the case with the Golden Cicada. There’s even a phrase revolving around deceiving your enemies by shedding the Golden Cicada&#039;s exuviae or skin. Acting like a decoy or Kagemusha.“Whis informs, having a jovial laugh about it much to your chagrin. “Anyway, the Cicada is all about renewal and personal change, not just the aforementioned symbolism I’ve mentioned earlier. Unlike butterflies, moths, or other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, cicadas have no pupal state. They transition from one fully-function state to another. One viable form, in a small amount of time, changing to another.” <br> <br>“In comparison, the cicada’s transformation is similar to that of human beings. If a person wants or needs to make a change in their life, they don’t enclose themselves in a pod and emerge next spring. Rather, they remain in their mortal form as they change throughout the seasons. Something you have shown splendidly throughout these last nine years. “Whis explains, tapping his staff to show you the Golden Cicada before transitioning to showing you the parallels between it and your cocoon. Specifically, how it changes throughout the nine years of slumber. “Of course, I’m more focused on the personal change rather than solely the physical one. Though that shouldn’t take away the stark change you made since we acquired you on that fateful day.” <br> <br>“A Golden Cicada that radiates a light that illuminates all like the rising sun or supernova. “You muttered, keeping a serious expression as you relay the message from Whis. Musing deeply at the explanation, you feel rather content with the reasoning. Going as far as to crack a small yet soft smile at the attendant. “That’s a satisfying answer, I thank you for giving me the name.” <br> <br>“Don’t mention it, you gave me a lot to work with during your metamorphosis. Left me rather impressed with your maturity and innate talent. I didn’t think you would already learn how to tap into both the spiritual side and acquire the capability to use your latent energy, otherwise known as ki, to this extent.” Whis says, giving you praise for the performance. As well as how fluid and tranquil your aura currently displayed itself. <br><br>“Ki, so that’s what this gushing overflow of life energy is.” You said, glancing back at your hand. It was different from the paradox that what you were feeling, and yet it was loosely connected in some way.

Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

Having just reunited with your fellow Shangralans and Astartes sons, whom have traveled the webway alongside your Beloved Emerald Lotus blossom, Kanzeon, and her sister, Anahita, to reinforce Angron&#039;s own every growing army of former gladiators and slaves, you noticed your followers amongst the Aeldari race were keeping a distance between themselves and your once enslaved brothers. Seeking answers from Noble Carys and valorous Folant, you learned the truth of how your brother was made a slave to begin with and the role the ever prophecy chasing Aeldari of the craftworlds played in it in their attempt to avert the dread future they beheld.<br><br>So, as you are not a simpleton who blames the world for one the ill deeds of the few, you decided it would be best for Angron to know of the truth of his capture and the cause for his attempted assassination, in the pursuit of bringing peace to his mind and preventing any misunderstandings or resentment from arising between him and the fair Aeldair, because of the misguided and foolish actions of those sycophants of destiny. After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens. And you know that as well as you know that those whom are different are often held with unwarranted suspicion and mistrust.<br><br>Which is why it is best to reveal the truth to your brother and introduce him to Aeldari whom are not distant and deserving of said mistrust.<br><br>&quot;And who better than myself and Folant&quot; Carys says jauntily, as the more dour ranger marches at your side &quot;To prove that not all of our people are apathetic to the plight of humanity, or retain the overwrought sense of pride that lead us to ruin&quot;<br>Cont",1670495207,0,RBVYiFdu,,the-2nd-primarch-quest-22,0,25,0,"[{'no': 5489980, 'now': '12/08/22(Thu)15:14:19', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5489675"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5489675</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Give Angron a tour through Anahita&#039;s Manufactorums, and allow him to design his weaponry and armor </span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Give Oenomaus a young dragon to care for, and thank him for teaching and caring for your brother</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Spar with your brother, before you lose your chance to as the war heats up</span>', 'time': 1670530459, 'resto': 5489667, 'id': 'NND7xV4C'}, {'no': 5490469, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)00:06:50', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<span class=""quote"">&gt;Give Angron a tour through Anahita&#039;s Manufactorums, and allow him to design his weaponry and armor</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Give Oenomaus a young dragon to care for, and thank him for teaching and caring for your brother</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Spar with your brother, before you lose your chance to as the war heats up</span>', 'time': 1670562410, 'resto': 5489667, 'id': 'j1496+UD'}, {'no': 5490662, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)05:27:06', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '“Behold the greatest of my dear brothers sons Ahriman!” Magnus gestured over the company that had fallen into two lines as an honour guard for the Giant of Prospero whom had come to visit his eccentric brother, his own retinue of eight others was somewhat intimidated by the appearance of the Second legions First Company; The Brotherhood of Panthers.

Most of the old world died, and those few that remained had to remain in the old Burrows for over a century. Your parents&#039; generation was the first to emerge from the Burrows, and they set up the scrap-states and the Laws of Blood you know today, so that the wars from the old world would never occur again. No, people, food, and fuel were simply too rare for such wasteful wars. Instead, the duels and the scrap knights came to be, using what Eldertech mechs that could be scavenged to engage in personal combat to resolve conflict on behalf of their scrap states. <br><br>Now, with tensions rising among the scrap lords and more and more Duels of Honor and Duels of Blood being declared, the need for scrap knights is greater than ever.

I say we boost now, minimize risks to the convoy while we still have the rest of our journey ahead.” The ebony knight turns to the two youngest knights at the table, including you, and nods dismissively. “Well?

It’s been a while since you’ve been in the building, but you have no idea what floor you’re on, let alone where the rest of your unit is. Additionally, and more concerningly, you’re not sure how long you’ve been incapacitated. The more you wonder about how long you’ve been out, the more you remember what critical, important evidence you’ve unearthed right before losing enough blood to sleep on Grove’s shoulder of all places.

All the while during the revolt, the Planetary Governor asked for more troops from Icarus, and more time to meet the Tithe from the Administratum.<br><br>From his correspondence alone, the culprit and motives seemed much more straightforward. A rebel snuck into the stubborn and unyielding Governor’s estate to strike a decisive blow against a callous despot. The theory didn’t seem airtight with you, especially with the missing documents from the desk. Something didn’t add up, so you all tried your hand at interrogating the civilians present during the murder at the estate’s guest house. <br><br>The interviews were fruitful. You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald’s murder only minutes before his body was found. You heard about several potential suspects whose jobs in the government were threatened by the ongoing revolt. You learned of a young staffer that had gone missing the evening prior. Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor’s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald’s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room. You raced with your comrade back to the office, whereupon opening the large window behind the desk, you found a torn piece of fabric hanging on a wooden lattice on the exterior wall. It was the same kind of fabric the house servants wore.<br><br>So far, for being mere Arbites Troopers, you all were doing pretty good. So good in fact, that you had nearly forgotten you weren’t assigned to this murder by the time the person who was arrived: Inquisitor Weiss. You couldn’t get a good read on Weiss, she seemed aggravated at being undercut, but after you told her all that you had uncovered, she went ahead and let you keep investigating. Weiss took over interrogations, of course, and with the recovered fabric as a catalyst, she proceeded to march all the house servants down the hill to their quarters to begin questioning.<br><br>She didn’t take the fabric, though. Requisitioning one of the hounds the local government used to catch fleeing laborers(and some cool bikes from the PDF), you tracked the scent of the fabric all the way from the courtyard of the estate… down to the well near the servant’s quarters.

Remembering those odd, body-rifling bloodstains by Archibald’s corpse, you wondered if any of the killer’s scent might remain on his body. Turns out, it did. Your steadfast canid ran right out of the house after a couple whiffs, and you all finally got to ride those bikes over some terrain, going out a couple klicks behind the estate to the edge of a forest.<br><br>Once there, it seemed the trail had gone cold again, but the only problem was that the dog couldn’t fly. There were skid-marks on the ground(the vehicular kind), that indicated some kind of light aircraft had touched down recently. You took measurements of the skid impressions in the dirt and returned to the estate.<br><br>When you returned, the Inquisitor had managed to get the safe open, and graciously gave you all the chance to peek at its contents. There were letters from friends, letters from a (possibly illegitimate) son, and, most concerningly, correspondence with an Ecclesiarchal Cardinal Theodore Flemming. The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers. The cardinal’s response was a gentle <span class=""mu-i"">’please, Emperor, do not do that.’</span><br><br>With seemingly nothing left to investigate, the Inquisitor kindly flew you off-planet to the voidship where the rest of your superiors were being held by the Mechanicus(long story).

You left the Mechanicus ship for the Inquisitor’s personal strike-cruiser, but not before the Tech-Priest blessed your shock maul.

For this betrayal, King Aiden Perenolde was dethroned and Alterac City was sacked. The nobles and population fled the land and the Kingdom of Alterac was no more.<br><br>You are Alric Perenolde, the Prince and second heir of Alterac. By the order of King Aiden, you were sent into temporary exile to be safe from the Second War.

You also learned about the secrets of the city, the existence of the slums in the sewers made you loathe Kirin Tor.

Lady Nalice proposed to teach you magic and you accepted her offer. You didn’t have the magical aptitude your sister or Jaina Proudmoore had when they were children, so you would have to work extra hard to realise the potential Lady Nalice is seeing in you.

He has not been successful in his personal life or career. In the twenty eight years of his life, he hasn&#039;t accomplished anything of any importance. None of that matters because Hubert has one thing that makes every difference. The soul of an emperor. Buried beneath his genes and upbringing is the willpower to endure centuries of strife and struggle. He just doesn&#039;t know it yet.<br><br>Far beyond Hubert&#039;s earth, the cosmos is in decay. The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has. Hubert can have between 1, for a sane, slightly flawed man that only has a scrap of strength, and 10, stark raving mad divinity powerful enough to shatter a kingdom.",1669863072,0,Vp4uit9k,,hubert-dysfunctional-demigod-in-a-strange-land,0,221,2,"[{'no': 5490562, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)03:01:02', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5490559"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5490559</a><br>The servitor is dead, very dead.

So when a rider on a Pegasus made of black smoke landed on one of the towers he cursed the rain and ordered something hot that could appease the delicate palate of a blood elf, like a good red tea while approaching the volcanic core of the place.<br>The master of the dark tower ordered a goblin to announce his master of his return and to request an audience. He was one of the inner circle and knew that his master might be interested by what he has learnt. He was not mistaken, one hour later he was brought to the personnal baths of B&#039;beg the Terrible.<br><br>Even a dark lord of more than 10 000 years needed to bath once in a month.

He was even more pleased when his master ordered two girls (elven maidens who were younger than a century could have been little girls for them) to undress his servant and massage him while he would enter to another hot pool, in front of the one where B&#039;beg was staying. <br><br>-It is a too great honour your malevolent eminence.<br><br>The master of darkness answered his servant.<br><br>-No, I must reward those who do the work themselves instead of relying on stupid and clumsy subordinates.

As I love to say &quot;The best men are those who walk the evil path instead of the easy path.&quot;<br><br>Only a true megalomaniac would quote himself, but this was a necessity of being an evil leader. Larion could only nod respectfully while he was quickly disrobed by the two charming creatures and put into a pool of pleasingly hot water, a great change from the cold rain that would have given him an angine if he wasn&#039;t protected by magic. One of the dark elven beauties, with pale skin and black hair began to massage his shoulders while the second one with dark skin and white hair stroked his long blonde locks to clean them.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark.

It is the wife of Unnar, the fisherman, who lives with his mother and young son. If all goes well, the child will be born eight moons hence. It is customary for the chieftain to give a present on these occasions, usually in the form of a small celebration with singing and dancing and music going late into the night. Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth.

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;What will you do?</span>', 'filename': 'emberbloom', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 230, 'h': 232, 'tn_w': 123, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670166406325092, 'time': 1670166406, 'md5': 'ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==', 'fsize': 7437, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'lnm/GTa9'}, {'no': 5485686, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea', 'time': 1670168397, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'OHAWgWLt'}, {'no': 5485828, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers', 'time': 1670181491, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'qHCPuy7I'}, {'no': 5486015, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485828"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1', 'time': 1670192389, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'E+RiA0+u'}, {'no': 5486052, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

Fortunately, you were able to mercy kill the Grey Dragon, and then made your way down the mountain. Now, you’re with friends once more, and considering your next move.<br>-----------------------------------<wbr>------------------<br><br>Over your food... You think.<br>You think for a good, long while. Food is a good way to keep thinking, fortunately, as it leaves your mouth full of food rather than words.<br>A lot of people speak too much to think, you figure.<br>At any rate...<br>It&#039;s looking tempting to just... leave it be, really. At this point, you don&#039;t have to fear your mind being taken from you, and you&#039;ve mercifully stopped Ogg from making things a lot worse. It might even be prudent to retire outright… though you don’t think you could.<br><br>Being the dragon knight isn’t… that unappealing anymore. You’ve got many, many years before you continue to progress into a full-on dragon, after all. But you couldn’t leave your duties behind. Helping people has been your life for several years, and you made the oath to keep doing that as long as you are able. Being able to breathe fire and having natural armor doesn’t really impede that.<br>It didn’t even stop any attempts at love.<br><br>You look at Paracelsus, who is resting against the cart and staring right back at you. She looks… content. Relieved, most likely. It’s been a few days, and she’s been very patient for waiting for you here. You did ask if that wisp actually came to them, which it did… Though, the message was garbled. They only took it as a sign you were alive, and decided to wait for some time rather than leave… Not that they were ever going to do anything else, these kobolts love you too much to give up like that…<br>Same goes for Paracelsus, really. Anna stuck around too, for “her man”, who she is currently still hugging from behind, putting her head on his shoulder. Without her mask, a lesser man might have called it scary. Having gotten used to her… it’s nothing less than she deserves, after a life of hardship. <br><br>Chad happily returns the tenderness, of course, though he’s quite busy eating at the moment. He’s starving, especially after he had the misfortune of vomiting up the blood back in that cave, alongside the rest of whatever meal he had left in him.<br>No wonder you were all so tired from a short run.<br><br>Hmm. You’ve gotten off track. You eat some of the mushrooms that were also helpfully provided by the hunting team, noting that they taste a bit like nuts when cooked like this.

For now you&#039;d have to trust that they would do the right thing.

For the past few days, you refused to do exactly that, instead staying to the confines of your home. Not like anyone has noticed, otherwise they would have checked up on why you were absent after the second or third day. If they would&#039;ve noticed they surely must&#039;ve by now, with daily attendance and all. Your parents would have something to say about this if they weren&#039;t away on business all the time, though the school should have their number and would&#039;ve called by now, so either they know and let it happen, or the school neglected to even inform them. Either way, works for you. <br><br>Were you going to attend again? Eh, maybe when you feel like it. Being able to sleep in on weekdays should not be a luxury relegated to the holidays. Though it did get boring after everything just lost its appeal. Funny, you think of doing something, only for it to end up less enticing once endless opportunity presents itself. Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today. There&#039;s a hobby shop on the other side of the city, one you didn&#039;t know was even there. Granted, you never looked either, having expected nothing to be in the vicinity, but it&#039;s somewhere to check out. <br><br>You woke up early, just for this morning. The trip over will take a couple of hours by public transportation, and that&#039;s assuming it runs on time, which you just know it won’t. You throw on a random shirt and some pants and prepare breakfast. Normally you never get the time to do this, having to prepare some more for school as well as just wanting to get in every minute of sleep you could. Being able to sit down and eat, instead of having to buy something to go on the way, or gulf down something hurriedly.

Seeing as that was one of the first stations of the district, there wasn’t another you could take a train at, at least one that’ll get you closer to home. This was a distance nobody really wants to walk, so the ill-used walkways on the bridge’s side sees its first pedestrian in you. As you were on the side where the accident should be, the road on your side is much more vacant, basically drip feeding cars from the one lane you see is unaffected. <br><br>On a whim, you look up, expecting to just see the skyline, but there was someone just standing on the upper structures of the bridge as well. You have no reason to think why someone would be up there, but at the same time, no reason to question it either. Whoever it was though, didn’t take kindly to being noticed. Something was flying your way, and the figure leapt off out of sight. On instinct, you skipped back, the object pinning itself down where you just were. It’s… Strangely familiar to you.

The Taito ward wasn’t very close to you, and it probably wouldn’t have been Rider of Red since he was busy supervising your discussion with his master.

She&#039;s always so casual, so this is a nice look on her. She&#039;s got a long skirt on, a shirt-vest combo, and is also wearing high heels, something she rarely does outside of dresses. Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=""mu-b"">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing. You listen carefully, but it all bleeds together, like some sort of fast-forwarded movie. Still, your serenity remains with you. Just looking at the aqua-eyed beauty is enough to keep you happy.<br><br>---<br><br>Meryl proposed to you only recently- Which would have been odd enough, as far as you were concerned, until she explained why: It was now or never, at least until you showed up.<br><br>She&#039;s got demi-human physiology, some kind of fish-woman, and her father is a magician. Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fiancée cares about you. And you definitely care about her.

For the last several months, I have been running this project with individual players controlling their own civilizations on a randomly-generated fantasy world of my design. The game is played out in a series of ages, in which players experience random events, are given the choice to perform a number of actions of their desire, and progress along technological and magical trees. Much like in a Civilization-style game, once each player has finished their actions for an age, all players advance to the next era and the cycle continues.<br><br>I have decided to allow you, the anonymous players of /qst/, in on the project, now that we are about ten ages into the world&#039;s history.

You will vote on everything that happens to your civilization, which will be the only one in this game with more than one person controlling it and the only anonymously-controlled society.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you’ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He’s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It’s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you’ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that’s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto’s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn’t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone’s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You’re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei’s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>“Raiton: Raiden!”<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto’s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. “Multi-shadow clone!”<br><br>He can’t see what you did.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

With the essence of Shekhina and Tiamat residing within you, effectively serving as a balancer, you have the makings of true duality your additional role as arbiter balancer &amp; warrior emissary of Order &amp; Chaos.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object.

Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Before the Nauk the continent was naught but chaos, and the order of conquest united the stricken, barbaric land. A thousand years after the landings of Sversk the Conqueror, the last strained ties holding the Nauk Imperial together fell apart, but all would remember the Nauk Imperial being the beginning of history- and the inheritors of its glory, proud to call themselves the first of Vinstragan men.<br><br>The southern country of Vynmark claims a part of this lost glory, successors of the Nauk as both princes of the land, and lords of the sea, the latter which has made them exceptionally wealthy in recent times as the goods of the newly opened east flow around the isolationist Twaryi and through the greedy and unquestioning merchants of Vynmark’s shores, overseen by the noble Landgrafs and their high courts. Confident atop their enormous wealth, and their subjects content to feed off the succulent scraps of luxury, Vynmark has found itself ill prepared for the rapid change of today’s world…<br><br>Our generation was meant to know nothing but peace.<br><br>Vynmark was safe, and prosperous. Not without its flaws, but it was set apart from the rest of Vinstraga. From the world, Velekam. For decades, we knew nothing such as war, as battle, not in the heart of Vynmark, where the sun’s glow and the sea mist scattered fairy-blooms all about hills and plains that never knew the smell of blood. We believed that our ancestors had won us this idyll, and that we were meant to do naught but enjoy it, whilst whomever wished to play at war would never see something like the whispered-of yet so far off brutality of the rest of the continent.<br><br>Soon enough, we found that we had not earned peace in our lives.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=""mu-i"">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man.

Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;', 'time': 1668025581, 'resto': 5450791, 'id': 'BNEmL1fM', 'trip': '!!QwBTV801Tcj'}, {'no': 5457687, 'now': '11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23', 'name': 'Fireborn QM', 'com': '<a href=""#p5457685"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Their objective was to reclaim them from a mysterious horror which had rallied the primitive, monkey-like ‘ghouls’ who picked at their dead into a terrifying and organized horde. Nobody knew quite who or what this mysterious adversary was, but those who had survived encounters with the feral beasts described some sort of ‘Ghoul Supreme’ egging the lesser creatures on.<br><br>At the elven militia’s head was no Drow noble, but reptilian foreigner of monstrous description: a lizardman called ‘Theral’ for his shining, coppery hide. Those elves who guarded the borders and patrolled the far reaches beyond the eyes of Wevenore’s nobility whispered tales of this dreadful being’s exploits. <br><br>They said that he had slain the Devourer, a great king-slayer of the westernmost caverns, and that he had subdued and subjugated the ancient and shapeless Shoggoth with his own two hands. <br><br>They said he spoke like an elven poet—that he could soothe the heart of any elfman or elfmaid with his rumbling polemics to peace, and stir any elf or animal to righteous fury with his fiery sermons to war. Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old—mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some—the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors—spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some—the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat—regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill… Well, that remained to be seen.",1667183641,0,CQjyTS+o,,dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6,0,517,68,"[{'no': 5485432, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)04:07:23', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485165"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485165</a><br>can we deal with necromancer on the way out?', 'time': 1670144843, 'resto': 5448278, 'id': 'tV5YrKmF'}, {'no': 5485561, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)07:51:02', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485409"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485409</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Ghouls and dogbolds</span><br>[Dogbolds/ghouls are a mysterious collective of mostly-hairless, albinistic baboon-things.

And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

Peace reigns across the galaxy, under the rule of Lord Freeza, Emperor of the Universe. But not all wish it to be this way. Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge. Despite this newfound age of peace swiftly spreading across the stars, there are those who would seek its end. Will you be able to stop them, or shall the universe once more be plunged into the fires of war?<br><br>Welcome to Saiyan Conqueror Quest! This story takes place in an alternate timeline within the greater Dragonball EU. You the players control Karn: once an ordinary Saiyan warrior with a meager powerlevel of 2,830 who has risen to become a mighty Berserker Super Saiyan, and so much more. Throughout your many adventures, the “Dragon of New Salda” has grown into the symbol of Saiyan might and power, widely recognized across the universe as Freeza&#039;s close friend and confidant, not to mention his right hand man and General of his forces.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren’t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=""mu-i"">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren’t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don’t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been … well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here – except those in the Belly, of course – are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won’t make trustee, won’t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>“Alright, you are back within safe parameters.” <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>“On dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I’ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won’t bother reading it unless you tell them to.” <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic … but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>“In consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

You know MagiPol is known to operate in strange ways, but this is a bit ridiculous.<br><br>Your name is Arthur Roland. You’re a 25 year old detective, well, ex-detective now. Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson’s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn’t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types. But eventually, all you received was a phone call directing you to a rooftop overlooking a bunch of warehouses in downtown Austin, Texas. <br><br>And to “procure critical ordinance, then wait for instructions.”<br><br>The ordinance in question was a stylish black full-body suit and helmet, perfectly fitting your form. As soon as you settled in, the helmet lit up with a display, and a prerecorded message.<br><br>“WELCOME, MARVELOUS BLACK.”<br><br>You’d only heard passing rumors of the Marvelous Rangers, a covert anti-terror group that did missions all around the world. Speculation was abound. Were they vigilantes? Terrorists themselves, perhaps? <br><br>Nope.

There doesn’t seem to be many other folks left inside that aren’t working, actually, considering that the place seems dead. Guess they’re wrapping up? Either way, you need to inform your assistant. “Gartoum, they’ve made this place into a big hazard trap,” you mention. “We might need to pull protection duty if she ends up in here.”<br><br>“That’s what it’s looking like~!” he notes. “She’s not bad at this bit, surprisingly. I have to admit, I appreciate the snuffing out of lights…well, to a good extent, anyway.”<br><br>Right. “Just keep an eye on her, and we’ll go from there,” you tell him, and from there the connection cuts.<br><br>You’re not really keen on spending the night here, but it seems like you might be.

As the fog clears, you sort through your recent memories with the tentative dread of a man checking for bombs in his mailbox. You remember nearly finishing the bottle of Jameson by yourself, and you remember taking the pills. You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

You however, have nothing to do with the coal mining business of your community.<br><br>All your life you&#039;ve been a scavenger; picking over the remains of the old world in search of all the things your community needed but couldn&#039;t produce; medicine, ammunition primers, electrical components, engine parts. It is thankless work, despite the importance of these goods you never receive anything more than a pittance.<br>That begs the question; why do you put up with it? What made you turn to this lifestyle in the first place? (This will determine your starting gear and your relationship with the townsfolk.

When the opportunity arose you sold all your knick knacks for a gun and volunteered to become one of the town&#039;s scavengers.

One Two rode the car without the headlamps’ assisting brightness over the park’s overgrown meadow grass and covered in crusty branches broken by the wind. One Two had turned away from you and instead looked onto the path faint from the yawning morning. To access the Retiree Park with a car was illegal, but it was also not meant for them. He drove you through bogs and fields and only infrequently used the paths and trails on the way to the semi-cemetery’s exit. Unlike Mary’s pride—her taxicab—the automobile didn’t wobble, convulse, or fling the seats up or down as rode away.<br><br>Instead of smashing through the fog, the luminous clouds rolled over the car like welcoming bedsheets. With only an inch or less of a margin between the brick stone pillars and the width of the automobile, One Two passed through the exit arch and cruised into the two-lined road. He held the wheel with a weak grip. He checked you, the outlandish watch on his wrist illuminating only his arm and a small part of his shoulder. He motioned to the notebook with his hand.<br><br>“Anything else you can tell me about ‘Cass’, Elmer Briant?”<br><br>You had to speak irrelevant half-truths. “She can change the shape of her body, but it’ll still remain gelatinous and orange.”<br><br>He waited until you, surrounded by the veneer, wrote that in the notebook … to the best of your ability, as scribbles you couldn’t even see anymore in the dark interior. <br><br>“How did you manage to keep the thing’s form a secret as you moved through the town?”<br><br>“I found her a dress” —Mary’s groan was furlong yet loud— “and a lid to cheese it. It worked well when it was still the middle of the night.”<br><br>“And that thing had this dress and hat on it as it got away from you?”<br><br>Your fingers sank into your thigh as you grit your teeth. “She did, it was a white dress, and I gave her a cloche hat.”<br><br>The automobile came to a complete yet fluent stop before the red bleeding traffic light. One Two hung his gaze in front of the road, the three-coloured brass cone several feet above unimportant to him as if he already knew when it was going to turn green. A few seconds after, he was forced to raise his head. <br><br>The suspended ceiling sky cracked and the grey paint fell to reveal the brilliant cream-white beneath the facade. Companionless lighting flashed and shattered the clouds. It lasted a couple of seconds and then the sombre overhang rumbled to close the crack. Beneath the same cloud, a small dot, shimmering like a polar star, was descending.<br><br>You heard One Two’s glove crease and creak. His grip tightened.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept. But I have no idea what makes Cass appealing, what you saw in her or what the MC saw in her. She was just a random blob, a slime, that did random things for no rhyme or reason. What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.
