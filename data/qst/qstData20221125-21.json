Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down.

That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along.

The weight of ages threatens to crush you, but you move up the stairs, remembering that every individual along the way must have seen their life the same way you saw yours- just your own.

The Woodsmen will carry on with or without their Virginia residence- after all, there had to be other brothers in the past.<br><br>There&#039;s something else odd about some of the photos that strikes you. Looking at several, you try and put your finger on what it is. Trees are often in the background, but they&#039;ve never been anything but a comfort to you- the clan has a habit of reforesting. Taking a look at the oldest one there, you can&#039;t see anything other but a familiar-looking ancestor and the men who work beside him, alongside their tools and some felled logs, which are stacked as benches for the photo. But... There&#039;s an anxiety, something just outside the cropped image. You put the image of the loggers and Hans Woodsman away. You can make memories and photos of your own, with the woman you&#039;re neglecting to wake up.<br><br>Opening the door, you&#039;re reminded that this room used to be painted in accordance to a childhood love of the Grimm fairy tales. Now all of those have a modern housing sheen covering up the images beneath. But your Red Riding Hood is fast asleep. Well, she isn&#039;t really little, and she&#039;s not wearing a hood, and she&#039;s the one sleeping... and this metaphor is useless. You walk over in the dark, only the light bleeding through the blinds guiding you, and gently whisper to her. Meryl keeps snoring, and drooling a little bit. So you nudge her gently, and she still doesn&#039;t move. You try to work on slowly increasing the intensity, but what happens instead is her snoring louder. Is she playing at being asleep? Well, she can save that for when you&#039;re in Maine.<br><br>Pinching the bridge of her nose to cut off her snoring, she opens her eyes immediately, proving she was playing at it. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Awex.&quot;</span> <span class=\"mu-g\">Yes, beloved?</span> <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Whe?&quot;</span> <span class=\"mu-g\">Food.</span> She groggily pulls your hand from her face and brings herself to sitting. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;You could have just said that, you know.&quot;</span> She&#039;s wearing the bra she was wearing when you got in, and it does a nice job of showing off her cleavage.

So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai.

Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 71, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 66, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5475415, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)05:53:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5475368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475368</a><br>Thanks<br>I still cant remember that at all, it is completely gone, but at least i know who she is now.", "time": 1669373613, "resto": 5463640, "id": "wnsWu9eY"}, {"no": 5475969, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:33:53", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5475022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475022</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1d6, first three</span>", "time": 1669419233, "resto": 5463640, "id": "yd1zDu14", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm"}, {"no": 5475974, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 3 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5475969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475969</a>", "time": 1669419447, "resto": 5463640, "id": "04gS/ilr"}, {"no": 5475990, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)18:46:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 6 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5475969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475969</a>", "time": 1669419984, "resto": 5463640, "id": "fbFmp0d0"}, {"no": 5476003, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)19:02:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 6 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5475969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475969</a>", "time": 1669420949, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LHU/KJPd"}], "last_modified": 1669420949}, {"no": 5462082, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)09:56:58", "name": "Schizo QM", "sub": "Future Blades - A Cyberpunk Story", "com": "During the end of 21st century, technological advancements has allowed for extensive modifications to the human body, becoming a cornerstone of medicine, warfare, and countless aspects of modern life.<br><br>The linchpin of biological augmentation is a substance called <span class=\"mu-s\">Nectar</span>, which helps chemical compounds to mesh with the body.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely. That you are his unclaimed (and unknown) by-blow is only tangential. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you do deserve the honor of an audience with the viceroy?</span><br><br>1. Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

You no longer need attend the Gymnasium on four days out of the week to learn how to live as an adult.

Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered.

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 85, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 80, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5473181, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)01:42:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472649</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Talk about the weird voice, feeling and what she just did.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

While current practices prevent the worst ravages of space-living, for generations they wreaked havoc on vulnerable populations of migrant workers. These effects can still be seen in their descendants. After his parents and then his grandfather died, he was indentured aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Pinnacle</span> as as cabin boy, underneath an abusive master. Then he was captured by pirates on the <span class=\"mu-i\">Salacious Scheme</span>. Under the pain of death, him and the other survivors were impressed into the &#039;provisional&#039; crew of the <span class=\"mu-i\">Scheme</span> - which turned out to be a improvement for Enoch. After some time, he was taken under the wing of Jibbs, the Quartermaster and Gunnery Officer of the <span class=\"mu-i\">Scheme</span>. On Jibbs&#039; recommendation, he was inducted as a full crew member. Less than a year after that, the <span class=\"mu-i\">Scheme</span> was taken by the Port Authority and the surviving crew was sent to the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span>. Determined to work his way out of peonage and eventually to freedom, he approached Boss Barone, an ombudsman - the highest echelon of trustee - and negotiated an arrangement where Barone would get him into the coveted EVA certification track.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Please choose ONE of the following:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; tfw space-manlet: It might seem almost counter-intuitive, but the space-bred actually tend to have smaller or stockier builds than their planet-bred counterparts.

His is an benign case, as his kidneys, fingers and face are all typical, save for some slight skull bossing, giving him a prominent brow. His mouth though, while functionally normal, is atypical - he has a split tongue and severe Hyperdontia. This gives his smiles an unsettling and predatory aspect. Even at a young age, he understood how to impress or intimidate with a grin. However, this is a very superstitious time. If it was to become common knowledge that his tongue was forked, and he hadn&#039;t cultivated a reputation of reliability or trustworthiness, then at the very least, people would be more inclined to disbelieve what he had to say. The more superstitious might shun him entirely.</span>", "filename": "1669167488642144", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 651, "h": 494, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1669356949235853, "time": 1669356949, "md5": "Z9sN8ghb3HA1JV44Zus8Tw==", "fsize": 52357, "resto": 5444794, "id": "tclCgq9D"}, {"no": 5475301, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)01:31:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5475292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5475292</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; tfw space-manlet: It might seem almost counter-intuitive, but the space-bred actually tend to have smaller or stockier builds than their planet-bred counterparts.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.

From the fog swept valley&#039;s of Shangrala, you now stand by the side of one of your warpswept and once lost brothers, Angron Thal&#039;kyr, the former gladiator slaved of the wicked house of the Thal&#039;kr, one of the lineages of the tyranical high riders who have long misruled and abused the fair sphere of Nuceria and her chained and brow beaten populace. As Angron began his war against tyranny, you sent your brother Feng, the first of your companions to join you in the struggle against those fools who believe they rode so high as to rule the heavens, to weaken the opposition by assassinating the general of the Thal&#039;kr armies sent against the last high rider army that marched from the city of Loc&#039;ea.<br><br>For, as blood was shed, you once more donned the wrinkled mask of kindly Kynigos, an ancient wandering sage and scholar, rarely merciful and caring Lanista and the confident and herald of the Loc&#039;ria family, having already woven a tale of treachery and betrayal to remove from the city and house alike the stain of tyranny and the sinful and cruel excesses of those forever lost to the lure of corruption and fleeting pleasures. Setting into motion the final stroke, to remove the drunkard head of Lycuarch the patriarch of the Loc&#039;ria house, a short sighted and blind man who considered Kynigos a close friend and indebted himself to him for saving his house from an outbreak of scurvy, you gave commands to the various virtuous sects within the city to at once act together, throw off their chains and kill the tyrants before them.<br><br>From the Beggar sect, who alone knew your identity as more than just a doddering old man even if fewer among them knew the whole truth, to the city guard and gladiators, to the wealthy merchants and even the scions of Lycuarch&#039;s own bloodline, as one, those who saw the filth around themselves marched, and overthrew the high riders of Loc&#039;ea.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 493, "images": 106, "omitted_posts": 488, "omitted_images": 105, "last_replies": [{"no": 5464348, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)17:00:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464248</a><br>Admitting a problem is the first step to fixing it, and it seems you are already on the second one.<br>I look foward to whatever this story ends up getting us to.", "time": 1668549651, "resto": 5436238, "id": "gmO9gUI1"}, {"no": 5464414, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)18:27:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464248</a><br>How dare you blog post, Forever QM!

The relationship between you and your mother\u2019s boyfriend is distant and mostly not existent. But is not confrontational by any means. Your mother\u2019s boyfriend is a very rich individual, who works at a major bank. The 3 of you live in a very large 4-bedroom apartment in the nicest part of town. Your mom stays at home all day, she cleans cooks, and dose the normal roles of any housewife. But also has all the time in the world to pursue her hobbies. Which consist of, painting, playing guitar, and tons of other athletic hobbies. She spins way too much time at the gym, doing yoga and varies dance classes. Like her daughter, she is very athletic and is on the thin side.<br>The mother\u2019s boyfriend, Andrew is in his late 40s. He isn\u2019t ugly, but is significantly less attractive then you and your mother. You and your mother are creative and athletic. But he is the opposite. He sits and analyzes information on his computer all day. And has been gaining weight. But he is still not obese. He is very kind to your mother. And they often go out to eat dinner without you. He tries to engage with your mother in conversation. But he thinks two much. And his conversations about the economy, politics, news, and world events bore your mother. But you have a passing interest in these topics, and once in a blue moon you will engage him about these topics.", "filename": "3956241246_very_skinny_tan_brown_haired_18_year_old_girl", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1665884898460751, "time": 1665884898, "md5": "BB7Ozh+RKbtK0hukS59m5w==", "fsize": 455266, "resto": 0, "id": "b09BYF8i", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "a-story-of-a-girl", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 99, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 94, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5440005, "now": "10/21/22(Fri)22:20:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5439936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5439936</a><br>You can crash here until you&#039;re fine.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently.

And I love being with you.\u201d She kisses your forehead gently. \u201cYou\u2019re my Peppa.\u201d<br><br>Your heart feels all aflutter. \u201c\u2026I love you too Cocoa.\u201d You sit up and hold her close as you kiss her back, on the lips this time. \u201cMy Cocoa.\u201d<br><br>The ride sadly comes to an end, but you\u2019ve got a smile on your face that hasn\u2019t faded yet. \u201cStill up for a look into the fortune teller?\u201d Cocoa asks you.<br><br>\u201cReady if you are.\u201d<br><br>The two of you reach the fortune teller\u2026 and get a bit of a surprise. Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa.

There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

What kind of monster would you kill?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I guess we should start with something small and weak.&quot;<br>&quot;Small and weak?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, I mean, if we went straight to kill a dragon we would be killed by it. We need to gain some experience first.&quot;<br>&quot;I see. Oh look, it&#039;s Elise.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What the two of you doofus are doing in here?&quot;<br>&quot;Well, we were just sparring.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, you better get good at it real quick. Guess who will be the next priestess of this town?&quot;<br>&quot;Have you been accepted for Temple training?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but it is in a distant town. I could wait until the merchants show up and go with them there, but then again I would lose one year. I figured since the two of you are so eager to get killed by monsters, you could protect me on the way there. Not that I think there are many monsters to go around, but even a weak monster could kill me if I travel alone and it finds me asleep.&quot;<br>&quot;So you want us to watch your sleep as you travel?&quot;<br>&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>&quot;Hold on a second. This is mercenary work. We require pay.&quot;<br>Elise laughs.<br>&quot;I assumed you&#039;d ask something weird like that. Well, I&#039;ll give you food. I also asked the smith to make a couple swords for the two of you. Real swords.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, awesome! You think of everything Elise.&quot;<br>&quot;Someone has to do the thinking. Go take a bath you two, you are stinking.&quot;<br>&quot;Sure thing, mom.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll meet you at my place for lunch, but you have to be presentable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Last to the river is a bladderfish!&quot;<br><br>The two of you take a bath and go back home wear your good clothes.<br><br>&quot;Where are you going boys?&quot;, ask you mother.<br>&quot;Lunch at Elise&#039;s place.&quot;<br>&quot;She is such a nice girl. The two of you will end up marrying.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t think so, mom. She is training to be a priestess. Priestesses don&#039;t marry.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, have fun.&quot;<br><br>You head to Elise&#039;s home. It is a large stone house, much bigger than yours our your friend&#039;s house. You knock on the door. A middle aged man finely dressed and with a comically large mustache opens the door.<br><br>&quot;What business do you have at the Mayor&#039;s house?&quot;<br>&quot;Elise invited us for lunch.&quot;<br>&quot;Ah! Very well. I heard she has important work for the two of you.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, she wants us to escort her to where she will become a priestess.&quot;<br>&quot;Do you think yourselves prepared for such a task?&quot;<br>&quot;Indeed. We train for such an opportunity everyday.&quot;<br>&quot;It is great to be so confident. Come, enter. I&#039;ll show you to the dining room.&quot;<br><br>(1/3)", "filename": "seth", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 2160, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1665758118183318, "time": 1665758118, "md5": "OcU2WRo6KVFdmrQ3Sa0WGw==", "fsize": 1826420, "resto": 0, "id": "BdPsEFfK", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hellforged-quest-1", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 50, "images": 8, "omitted_posts": 45, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 5437136, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)10:39:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437135</a><br><br>&quot;I don&#039;t remember the exact circumstances, but I died in this place sometime in the past. This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

It used to feed our whole tribe. Now we just come here now and then. It is risky, there are bloodthirsty monsters inside the ruins.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, we met a few.&quot;<br>&quot;Now excuse me, I have to go back to my tribe.&quot;<br>&quot;Should we kill him?&quot;, asks the bard.<br>&quot;It is just a hungry goblin.

He already knew a little of alchemy because he is a shaman apprentice. I figured I could use his help.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you working with goblins?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>&quot;They&#039;re monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;Don&#039;t be a bigot. They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night. They are vulnerable to the sun.&quot;<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1666139465, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437509, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437500</a><br><br>&quot;Vulnerable to the sun, huh? Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me. I decided to help them as well.&quot;<br>&quot;They will just rob and rape people once their tribe is strong enough.&quot;<br>&quot;Rude!&quot;, says the goblin tending to the cauldrons.<br>&quot;Not all goblins are rapist and thieves. Most of them are too scared of their own shadow to try doing anything like this.&quot;<br>&quot;Could you spare us some poultice as well?

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

It is not often taken up, but I wanted to show my fellow knights that no obstacle is too great if one puts their mind to it.\u201d<br>\u201cWoah, like not talking at all? Even one bit?\u201d<br>\u201cNot even one bit.\u201d<br>\u201cBut what if you need help?\u201d<br>\u201cIt is good when aid comes to thee, but as someone championing thy people, should never rely upon the hope of its arrival.\u201d<br><br>She looks down contemplatively as you continue.<br>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong! There are trials thee cannot risk failing, and therefore mustn\u2019t try to overcome on your own. On such occasions, everyone knows what they work for, and that is the most important. Not one\u2019s own safety.\u201d<br>She bites her lips listening to you, and her eyebrows knit together.<br>\u201cI understand thy worry, but duty is something shared across people, and across generations. Claiming it is upon one or a mere few disrespects the effort and convictions of all others. There were people before you, and if they could do it, you won\u2019t be found wanting either as long as you do not give up.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSo how long did this vow last?\u201d<br>\u201cA little short of a two years.\u201d<br>\u201cHow did the others react to it?\u201d<br>\u201cAt first bemused, and I admit it transformed into annoyance before it became respect. They started to accept it as a fact of life before my liege asked me to accept a leadership position, where I had to cast it off.\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, makes sense. I don\u2019t think I could do that. Spells require spoken words.\u201d<br>\u201cI can see how that could be a deterrent.\u201d<br>Silence sets in, as she seems to be deep in thought. While you are used to the quiet, so you let her ponder. You\u2019ve seen young squires \u2013 though she is too old to be a squire \u2013 with similar problems before their first campaign. They sometimes need time and encouragement.<br><br>\u201cSo you are in a \u2018command position\u2019, like Headmistress Olivia?\u201d<br>\u201cSort of I suppose. I share the same rank with eleven others in our host, with many knights under my command.\u201d<br>\u201cAre they like you?\u201d<br>\u201cIn a manner of speaking? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, even knights. Though I suppose I have the advantage of experience.\u201d<br>\u201cI remember seeing Headmistress Olivia move around all the time, telling people what to do and often stopping them. When I was little, I used to think she just likes ordering people around.\u201d she chuckles \u201cIt took me embarrassingly long to realize she doesn\u2019t seem as happy about it. Instead, its not easy to make sure everyone does as they should.\u201d<br>\u201cNo. No it isn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A) How did you become a maiden?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B) You and her both mentioned other maidens.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C) What do you know about this place we are going?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;D) Write-in</span>", "time": 1669120319, "resto": 5431908, "id": "bLViMmnY"}, {"no": 5472035, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)08:20:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472010</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;A) How did you become a maiden?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;B) You and her both mentioned other maidens.</span>", "time": 1669123225, "resto": 5431908, "id": "Sabwi+OF"}, {"no": 5472094, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)09:34:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472010</a><br><a href=\"#p5472035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472035</a><br>Support", "time": 1669127665, "resto": 5431908, "id": "FiMkdFdX"}, {"no": 5472123, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)09:50:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472010</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A) How did you become a maiden?</span>", "time": 1669128628, "resto": 5431908, "id": "I1yfnafB"}, {"no": 5472160, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)10:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472010</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;C) What do you know about this place we are going?</span><br><br>QM, you made the mistake of putting dialog and hoping we don&#039;t get lost.

You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets?

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace.

I ordered a glass coffin for her, so no mangling, understand?&quot; Vierna jabs Phaere in the side with her scepter, employing just enough force to leave a bruise. &quot;You waste my time with your grandstanding,&quot; insists the elder Delyl. &quot;Get on with it.&quot;<br><br>Phaere laughs mirthfully, despite her recent injury. &quot;Yes.

Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession brought you into conflict against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church, with you coming out on top each bout.

In exchange for a full translation, Elias wished for you to venture through the infamous Edmund Woods, a location reputed as being haunted, and aid his master against an attack from the Orthodox Church. With great difficulty and almost zero visibility, you and your best mercenaries ventured through the terrifying forest, when you were ambushed by Dolofonos, an assassin eerily similar to Kronya. Having been separated from the group, you were forced to duel the assassin.

We cannot afford to throw away experienced soldiers on a whim! The Sword of the Creator has reappeared in Garreg Mach! Even now, she rallies the Knights of Seiros to her.

After all, do you not owe your current position to our aid?\u201d<br><br>Bennett sat back into his chair, examining Montgomery, no, Odesse, as though looking at him for the first time. Though he knew it was a necessary step, he loathed having asked these Agarthans for their help with each passing day. Odesse might have been playing the part of doting servant, but Bennett knew when he was being looked down on. And he knew the man in front of him well enough to understand the underlying threat within his speech. If only he still had reliable servants like Fritz and Ivan at his side. But Ivan was now dead, likely a calculated move by this monster. And as for Fritz, he\u2019d been missing ever since Garreg Mach fell. He was nowhere to be found within the monastery\u2019s dungeon, likely having either escaped or been killed.<br><br>\u201cMy lord, please leave everything to me.\u201d Montgomery bows once more. \u201cMy associates are already making their move, and I assure you in just a short time, these problems will disappear overnight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bennet says. \u201cHandle it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThen by your leave.\u201d Montgomery exits the study, leaving Bennett alone to his thoughts.<br><br>\u201cAgarthans\u2026\u201d Bennett muttered alone. It wasn\u2019t just him that Odesse was looking down on. It was all of humanity. That they viewed themselves as superiors was a notion that caused the Patriarch no shortage of amusement. Would a superior people have been nearly wiped out by the Goddess? Would they spend their lives cowering underground, as far away from her light as possible? Would they carry out elaborate schemes and plots, unable to act out in the open, lest humanity rise up and destroy whatever remnants of their tattered empire remained? Would they be blind to their own machinations, unable to see when even one of their own was plotting to betray them?<br><br>The Patriarch exited his chair to look out his window, and gaze upon all that his \u201cpartnership\u201d had earned him. He looked forward to the day he crushed the Agarthans under his heel. Until then, he\u2019d play his part dutifully.

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them.

They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.
