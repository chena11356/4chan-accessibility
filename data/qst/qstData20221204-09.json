He tells himself it\u2019s what the wizard would do if the tables were turned and he\u2019s probably right. It\u2019s much more violent and gruesome than the mostly conceptual act he thought it would be. The soul screeches in absolute terror as everything that made the wizard who he was is stripped away, layer by layer, until everything is gone and there\u2019s no chance of resurrection. Hubert tastes the soul on a deeper level than his tongue. It tastes good, like leaving a bucket of wet cement dangling over a man\u2019s parking garage so that it falls on his windshield when he goes to drive. It\u2019s the pure sense of power. Taking the wizard\u2019s strength and making it his own. He should be careful not to get addicted to the feeling. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t. Hubert is already too powerful for any wizard to challenge him. Why shouldn\u2019t he take as much power as possible? He could be a god! Instead of just a demigod.<br><br>Most of the minor details of the wizard\u2019s life are lost to oblivion. The wizard didn\u2019t hold onto them when Hubert started draining his life\u2019s work and Hubert didn\u2019t care enough about his childhood or loved ones to focus on it. If he consumes more souls, maybe he\u2019ll be able to keep more when he does. Most of the important parts are vague but the demigod gets the details. It paints an interesting picture.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Wizard\u2019s name was Oxogon and he was an arrogant, ruthless man who was terrified of death. He was an antitheist and feared that the gods tormented and devoured the souls of those who didn\u2019t worship them. He viewed himself as superior to normal men and magic as the gateway to true power.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most mortal magic revolves around aligning the soul to a specific mantle, or part of creation, so that they can change the world in specific ways relating to it. This alignment is difficult and requires a lifetime of dedication to reach serious power without losing sense of self and the difficulty increases massively the more mantles are aligned. Oxogon was a wizard of Death and Air and used the differences of both to balance his mind.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oxogon was from a small state called Iazarial to the south of Braeggiorian. Iazarial is a magocracy that believes the gods are only powerful entities and don\u2019t deserve to be worshiped, which Hubert agrees with. Iazarial also believes that magic users should rule over normal people, that they must expand by force, and those who don\u2019t renounce their religion must be killed, which Hubert might or might not agree with. Iazarial was founded by a council of wizards about 200 years ago who conquered a trade city and its surrounding lands.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "time": 1670133096, "resto": 5481542, "id": "Vp4uit9k"}, {"no": 5485213, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:53:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the studies from Oxogon\u2019s memories, the gods were much more active in the world about 300 years ago. Their avatars and faiths waged war and spread across the land for many centuries in the past but at some point slowed down. In the current era, major miracles are rare and prophets hear little from their gods. Iazarial thinks the world is being abandoned for greener pastures but Oxogon thinks the world is being used as a farm for souls and the gods have grown distant now that there are very few faithless mortals to convert.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Iazarial is, naturally, ruled by a council of wizards that have proven their power and skill over lesser magicians. There are currently around 100 wizards of various power levels in control and Oxogon himself was an above average member of the council. Oxogon went renegade and fled into Braegiorrian when his studies led him to believe that this temple ruin held the secrets of a ritual that could grant a mortal a spark of true divinity. This was a betrayal of Iazarial\u2019s philosophy and he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to live if he revealed his ambitions so he left in secret.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This temple was once a holy site of Chews-In-Quiet, a bloated maggot Goddess of Winter, Silence, and Time. Chews-In-Quiet was already lowering in relevance when the gods stopped being so active and now she\u2019s practically unheard of. The details of her religion are lost to history but Oxogon found that some rites were performed by worshipers for \u2018ascension of the soul,\u2019 and that their ultimate form could be found deep within the ruins. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In his attempt to explore the temple, Oxogon was nearly killed by several lethal traps and an ice servitor. To get around them, he convinced outlaws to serve him with the promise of treasure and desecrated a few village graveyards with them intimidating the locals.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oxogon thought the rumors would bring the servants of Axeyr to send an army to crush him but hoped that he would be able to find and complete the ritual by then. He wasn\u2019t expecting Hubert or remotely prepared for a demigod. During the assault, he assumed a high council member had tracked him down before Hubert consumed his soul. The wizard who was Oxogon is no more. All that was in the small spire was the treasure he managed to scavenge so far and a crude personal laboratory useless to a demigod of Earth.</span><br><br>Oxogon\u2019s memories weren\u2019t the only thing Hubert gained from his soul. Due to the wizard\u2019s sheer power and Hubert\u2019s newness as a demigod, his chance of increasing his Essence cap has been set to 20% per month and will stay until it improves, then go to 15% until it improves, then go back to normal. This makes Hubert somewhat hungry for more and more powerful souls. The demigod thinks about Oxogon\u2019s ambitions and what he\u2019s learned about the temple ruins.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should Hubert do for the month?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coom and relax underground.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Search the temple ruin.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Explore the local region.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spend Essence to perform a miracle.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2/2</span>", "time": 1670133197, "resto": 5481542, "id": "Vp4uit9k"}, {"no": 5485217, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:56:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485213</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Search the temple ruin</span>", "time": 1670133369, "resto": 5481542, "id": "XV8i/PaN"}, {"no": 5485238, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)01:10:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485213</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Search the temple ruin.</span>", "time": 1670134256, "resto": 5481542, "id": "dKsXSzrD"}, {"no": 5485256, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)01:26:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485213</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Search the temple ruin.</span>", "time": 1670135183, "resto": 5481542, "id": "zqMVgY9I"}], "last_modified": 1670135183}, {"no": 5481529, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)21:38:27", "name": "DzeborQM", "sub": "Dzebor Quest", "com": "It all began when you took the ship to the northern lands.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get. As you were walking off to the closest market you could think of, however, something compelled you to stop. Take it to a safe place, read it and\u2026 And\u2026 You weren\u2019t sure. Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don\u2019t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man. But you couldn\u2019t keep these Divine truths to yourself alone, if you had learned anything from your study it was that good things were meant to be shared.

Regardless, the end of the month goes a fair bit more smoothly than the start. Luckily, or unluckily, the patrols Vert and Rouge go on never seem to spot Koerkamp T.II \u201cArend\u201ds. Instead, they seem to mainly run into Koerkamp C.I &quot;Mus&quot; which despite what the name implies is more akin to a middle ground between a Fr\u00ffg and a Kronlein. Though something that has been made apparent by now is the fact that regardless of the aircraft Lothring has, their pilots aren&#039;t up to the same level as our main adversary, and with our own training advancements, they&#039;ll ideally soon be fully inferior with a handful of exceptions. But for now, they are a threat. Especially with that one little project they are working on. <br><br>Still, the sorties by Blanc go smoothly, with a good deal of recon and bombing done at no loss to our own pilots there. In fact, Oudin Bouhier managed to down a CN-III. However, while things went well for the recon and strike aircraft, the escorts were a more mixed bag, with Bleu managing to get a good number of victories, with Imbert downing two Bergens and Mile along with Fouet downing one each, the latter, Capitaine Fouet Lucy, was downed by Jan-Willem. Further, Estiene Auger and Barbedaurus Cartier were also shot down and Symonnet was forced down by a CN-III, though was just behind our lines. His aircraft however, was destroyed by enemy artillery before it could be recovered. Noir meanwhile suffered some losses as well, with three losses, one of which was killed by Leutnant Noah &quot;Kileshadran&quot; McCullough, which true to his nickname, is surprisingly from Kileshadra. While only one of our own was downed by him these past two weeks, 15e Escandre &quot;Marins du ciel&quot; was unfortunate enough to become well acquainted with him. Other than this, Vert and Rogue did quite well, with only one pilot lost between the two of them, though Chastain was forced down behind our own lines, after which their aircraft flipped over. Luckily, the upper wing while irreparable held, and the pilot in question didn&#039;t get their neck snapped and instead just suffered minor bruises. Still, as expected, the aces of Vert and Rouge did quite well, with l&#039;As herself climbing higher and higher.

Our forces have paused, and the enemy has dug in quite extensively, even in Lothring. Further pushes are going to be much more difficult now, and momentum has been lost to some extent. This is due to a mix of the heavy bombers the Lothring forces used extensively, the inundation lines being flooded, and far stiffer resistance than expected. While Lothring&#039;s army was expected to fold as quickly as Daloyaume, they have certainly proven our own forces wrong. Ironically, in a way, it&#039;s actually quite similar to the invasion of Daloyaume in the sense that it was meant to be a decisive war winning move that would serve as a quick knock out blow. The only problem is the fact the country is larger than Daloyaume and it&#039;s military more stubborn. Or perhaps it&#039;s mainly due to the majority of their forces not being encircled initially. No matter the reason, this is likely going to be a slog... At the very least we did our job decently. Then again, our airfields were mostly spared from the bombings...<br><br>In other news, Jagdgeschwader XIV &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; has been equipped with Falke D.II&#039;s. We know this due to the distinct navy blue body and wings with red rudders and white stars that clearly identifies them. It makes sense though, given how many of their CSA volunteers have become aces of late. Needless to say, there&#039;s a good deal of concern given the rumors of the craft&#039;s capabilities. In better news, more Pretan air corps forces are up in the area, and they have actually engaged Lothring forces, which is nice. Also, in Varuskie a small force at a fort meant to delay the Pru\u00dfenmarkians at a fort was subject to extensive chemical bombardment. The forces pursuing the main Varuskie army was sufficiently delayed by a heroic charge after this bombardment despite the extensive poisoning the soldiers at the fort suffered. Needless to say, their appearance and the fact there was actual resistance despite bombardment both chemical and traditional caused a good deal of panic and casualties given they were under attack by &#039;dead men&#039;. Regardless, despite this heroic stand, the vast majority of defenders did in fact die shortly after this charge, and those few who were able to withdraw after were quite badly wounded, poisoned, or both. The entire Regiment was given honors and medals, as was it&#039;s commander. Many including it&#039;s commander were granted these awards by the Tsar&#039;s orders, though posthumously. Still, despite this Varuskie has been forced out of some of Steyerland-Magyrian territory. Though, things are still going well in the east.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week.

That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along.

At this point of day, it&#039;s just cool enough to be relaxing and the sun is bearing down enough to keep you warm. Meryl is walking ahead of you again, and she thinks quietly, turning around and giving you another one of her wry grins. Back when she proposed to you, you thought of it as a smirk, but it&#039;s different. Smirks are common, they&#039;re cynical, and they&#039;re also adversarial. You&#039;ve seen too many, and read of even more. A smirk quickly resigns a situation to a poor outcome, and there&#039;s a real fear things are never going to get better in the world. The grin she gives you is playful, but it&#039;s hopeful. <span class=\"mu-g\">Enjoying the outdoors?</span><br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Yup!&quot;</span> Meryl twirls in place, and you can&#039;t help but admire her agility. You think your fianc\u00e9e would make a good ballerina or figure skater, but her body shape isn&#039;t for it. She&#039;s muscular, but she&#039;s also quite womanly, so while she has the balance and control, your brother wouldn&#039;t partner with her on ice. He probably couldn&#039;t lift her, even if you let him. Your beloved doesn&#039;t seem as confined to outdoors as her mother supposedly is, but it&#039;s clear she prefers vital air to sterile. Back in college, she bought canned oxygen for long study sessions. It didn&#039;t help you, but she might be more sensitive.<br><br>Here, the dogwood and the open spaces, some rolling hills and a little grass, flowers and a far-off flowing stream... Keeping hold of this estate was a historical priority for your family, because it&#039;s not only valuable, it&#039;s incredibly pretty and cheerful. In the green and brown of the ground and trees, Meryl&#039;s red stands out, and compliments the white flowers. Right on the tail of the school year, this was perhaps the best time to come home. In the winter, it was cold, and while conversations around the fire could be warm, fireplace beat firepit. Now, the breeze is a cool relief, not a chilly assault.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;I think that was some real luck.&quot;</span> Lucky that your grandfather was a monster hunter? How?

Worst of all, Meryl&#039;s own relatives could be dangerous: Dr. Cier has probably killed people, in self-defense or not, and Meryl&#039;s mother is definitely not &#039;sane&#039; in the modern sense.<br><br>Once the wedding is over, it&#039;s possible you&#039;ll be functionally disowned for everyone else&#039;s safety.

He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 125, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 120, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5483771, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)22:26:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 6 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5483769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5483769</a>", "time": 1670037961, "resto": 5463640, "id": "NGA9HqUn"}, {"no": 5483773, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)22:30:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 4 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5483769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5483769</a>", "time": 1670038244, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LXejn+kJ"}, {"no": 5483776, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)22:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 3 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5483769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5483769</a>", "time": 1670039159, "resto": 5463640, "id": "mHvEqoHi"}, {"no": 5483802, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)23:43:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 6 (1d6)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5483769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5483769</a>", "time": 1670042606, "resto": 5463640, "id": "Q6wRUTZU"}, {"no": 5485134, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:01:09", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5483769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5483769</a><br>This isn\u2019t great in terms of situations you could\u2019ve found yourself in today - an \u014ctsutsuki breathing down your proverbial neck, a Tailed Beast\u2019s fate in your literal hands, and you\u2019re rapidly running out of tricks to delay what increasingly seems like an inevitable confrontation.

Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system. Today, the trade network your built there is responsible for 12% of the Company&#039;s quarterly profits. <br>4.

What wisdom of the Starfather have you been granted that <span class=\"mu-i\">eight men at once</span> is anything remotely reasonable?!&quot;<br><br>You take a long draw of your tea.<br><br>Marianna fidgets nervously while you can see the silhouette of the girl behind the curtain tugging at a braid.<br><br>&quot;Yes, eight men,&quot; you answer her first question calmly, before proceeding towards the second. Marianna must have caught the predatory glint in your eyes and realized what it meant, as she claps a hand over her mouth and stares at you in silent shock. &quot;Indeed, eight men in a single night. As for wisdom granted by the Starfather... none. However, to answer how I found it reasonable, I suppose it would be threefold. First, the eight bachelors in question were being tormented by lustful spirits, which I have exorcised from their hearts. You will find that even Sir Gideon is behaving well, or so I have been told.<br><br>&quot;Second, I am only here for a limited time, and will be proceeding on my Travail today if not tomorrow,&quot; you explain. Marianna looks a bit disappointed at that, but both she and the silhouette of the girl behind the screen nod in understanding. &quot;I thus decided to address them all at once, which in turn allowed the blessing born of their purification to last longer, and become stronger if its duration is burned away to give you a stroke of luck on something important.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A blessing?&quot; the girl behind the screen asks. She seems a bit calmer now.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I cast a blessing upon this caravan to give everyone good fortune,&quot; you tell her. Your face breaks out into the grin of a degenerate when you move on to the third point. &quot;Last, I&#039;ve been a bit pent up since starting my Travail.

No longer did you have to fight against the current to progress or harmonize with the wavelengths to avoid backlash. The waters were currently in a dead calm, not even letting the tiniest of ripples form. Thus, it was quite easy for you to submerse further down without resistance. The sensations that you were currently feeling compared to your previous trip are akin to night and day. It was enough to highlight the fact that you were indeed the successor to both these sunless seas called the Shadow Land and the magical realm of Darkworld. <br><br>Allowing yourself to further immerse yourself in the tranquil watery abyss, you find yourself descending further with greater efficacy and speed. Slowly but surely becoming one with the embodiment of chaos and the void as it suffuses around you. Shrouding you with its immanent, almost imperium quintessence as you continue to travel. Feeling more integrated with these lands of shadow and darkness, you feel that presence of mind deepening alongside your piece of mind. Like it was the home you never knew existed till now. Almost as if you were a native-born from these lands, The Demiurge itself. <br><br>That nagging effect of the Hysterema you gained from the mark of the beast was rapidly lessening. Almost completely gone at this point, as like with the Heart of Darkness, it was all but completely purified. Its Ruah, also known as prana was flowing vigorously through you, permeating from all points. This breath of life was melding swimmingly alongside your own. Existing harmoniously with the pleroma bestowed and instilled into you as it blends into a strong foundation through consolidation. Before long the Hysterema, like the Pleroma, was starting its cultivation. <br> <br>And yet you felt something else sinking into you. It was brief, almost vanishing immediately after inserting itself into you. Effectively becoming completely unnoticeable but for that fraction of a second, you felt a different power infusing you. It was hard to describe, it was empty and deprived of all sensations as everything was null. It was strongly defined by its nothingness, very much different from the watery abyss that currently circling you. You only had time to mutter a single word relating to it before the thought vanished from inside. Its imprints linger uninterrupted. <br> <br>Kenoma. <br><br>Con", "time": 1670104136, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5484650, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)17:16:24", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5484614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5484614</a><br>Once it dissipated, something else in its place would soon invade your consciousness. The infinite darkness that made up this world gave way to a shining light. It was so bright that it was almost blinding to look, hence you reflexively covered your face with your free arm. As you feel the intensity of its luminance lessening, you start to see the space between the sunless sea start to change. Gradually displaying lights of wonder, it gave way to revealing that it was the cosmic ocean. From these primordial waters, you soon start to see mirror-like pockets displaying different events currently partaking. <br><br>There was imagery shown on each of the mirrors that you glance upon as you continue to descend further. One of the images shown to you appears to be that of a woman wearing what appears to be a stage magician outfit comprised of a black cowl, matching blackish blue swallowtail tuxedo over a white long-sleeved polo shirt, and a blue brooch with a bow. Its lower half has comprised of a dark blue corset, black bottoms, fishnet stockings, and black boots. Her face looks familiar but what drew you was the auburn hair as it flowed fluidly like it was alive as she twirls her magic wand. <br><br>In the next image was the same girl, this time wearing a different outfit comprised of a green leotard with the belly mostly exposed. Followed by a matching green cowl, high-length fingerless gloves, thigh-length green boots, a utility belt, and plenty of jewelry. The most noticeable of the bunch was the eyeball-shaped earrings and neckless. Outside of that she also appears to have the same face as the other one, the key difference is that her hair was emerald green. Right beside her appears to be a giant floating eye, emitting that same greenish hue that shrouded the mysterious girl\u2019s body. <br> <br>As you turn from the sight you were met with yet another image, of which you weren\u2019t surprised that it was the same girl again. This time she has dressed the part of a princess rather than a magician or space guardian. Around her top was a purple breastplate corset, and underneath was a sleeveless purple bodysuit, effectively exposing her arms and legs to the world. Unlike the other two, she was wearing a full-blown cape with it held together by a purple diamond brooch. She was clad in jewelry from a tiara to her golden greaves and gauntlets. More akin to the green hair girl, this one was sprouting golden locks reminiscing of Rapunzel. Surrounded by countless amethysts while holding what appears to be a mighty great sword. <br><br>con", "time": 1670105784, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5484652, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)17:17:45", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5484650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5484650</a><br>More and more different imagery of the same girl but different forms start to flood your vision. One of which has her fusing with a protoplasmic, shape-shifting symbiote and donning an appearance akin to Supergirl. Another involved getting chosen by the Spectre of all people, morphing into what appears to be a red leotard-wearing ghost girl. Most likely styled after the Spectre with a few changes as a paranormal holy spirit. The next one was that of a very muscular jungle girl, adorning a fur leotard with some matching cuffs while remarkably having the same silvery white hair as your Plethora form. She was surrounded by countless animals and just from her appearance alone she embodied all of Mother Nature/Gaea. <br><br>Seeing through each of these made you realize that this reappearing girl was you. Each of these girls was you from another timeline or parallel universe. A different take on your heroine&#039;s origin story and path to power. The latest one you saw all but confirms it as this time it was. This one was a divine person just like you, only this time has chosen primarily by the Rock of Eternity and the Wizard. Thus, becoming a musclebound adult in a bodysuit dress with radiant golden hair. Surrounded by the other members of the Champions of Magic, this version stands as the vanguard of the Marvel/Shazam Family. <br> <br>Each of their names soon comes to you one by one. The Mistress of Magic known as White Witch (Zatanna\u2019s Successor), The Cosmic Guardian known as Emerald Empress (Holder of the Emerald Eye of Ekron), Warrior Princess of Gemworld known as Amythest (Fellow Lord of Order), The Woman of Steel known as Superwoman (Matrix\u2019s Legacy), The Embodiment of Redemption and God\u2019s Love known as Lady Spectre, The Avatar of Mother Nature known as Rina the Jungle Girl (Gaea\u2019s Embodiment), and the Seventh Member of the Champions of Shazam known as Marvelous Thundra/Madame Shazam (The Prophesized Seventh from the Wizard). <br> <br>The news was mind-blowing, to say the least, it left you practically speechless. Never before you saw yourself destined for a life beyond the normalcy you have grown accustomed to. Yet here you stood, seeing multiple outcomes of you becoming a force for good. Though they were all different, there was one genuine consistency that unify them together. As you were brought to the point of tears, you would see yourself landing at what appears to be a center. Each one of the visions looking towards you, giving you a warm, friendly smile as you reach the nexus point. <br> <br>Con", "time": 1670105865, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5484669, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)17:30:04", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5484652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5484652</a><br>Waiting for you was the last image that you were able to see currently. It was perhaps the strongest out of the bunch in terms of visualization, practically standing at the edge of the nexus gate. She was completely like yourself, wearing ancient garbs bestowed upon them by a higher power. Wearing what appears to be a corset leotard equipped with a sturdy breastplate a Pteruges or Gladiator skirt, bracers/gauntlets, armbands, greaves, and combat boots. All are styled under the theme of the Amazons of Themyscira while carrying strong remnants of your Hebrew heritage. <br><br>The Amazonian champion merely beacons your hand, slowly clasping hers against it while the varying degrees of toned/strongwoman variants of yourself watch on. The champion didn\u2019t say a single word, but you can tell what she wanted to impart to you. After all, she was the closest to you in terms of possible outcomes your life could\u2019ve ended up with. In your mind, you were given the image of two places, the paradise island of Themyscira, and the Golden gates of Valhalla. From that, you align your mind to Amazonian Jews (Yehudei Amazonas) and of course the grimoire that connected them all. <br><br>Before you could ask her any further, you were tapped on the forehead before vanishing in a bright, golden light. The lion of Judah resonates deeply with the divine light as it envelops you completely. Something was imparted in you, but alas as you are now you couldn\u2019t reach it. Still, you sense that it was important. Why did your parallel self show you those images, what were the ties between the grimoire and the amazons of the rainforest also known as Amazonia and by extension Esquecida? There were so many questions but very few answers, perhaps even more visions lay buried within your subconsciousness that you didn\u2019t know. <br><br>You weren\u2019t sure what any of this means, but you get the feeling that things were going to get more exciting. For better or worse. In any case, the only other signs of change you would receive was of course your life. Just like you requested, your death was overturned into a comatose state. Only giving the initial impression of death but still alive, though with your mind and soul currently vacant. Resulting in you being drafted by the Quintessence just like before. Right down to having the same righteous fury at being nearly killed by mister Arthur Light. It was all aligning just how you mostly remembered.

Leaving you inhabiting the fashioned body made by Gaea till it&#039;s fully treated to hold you. Due to your awakening, your mortal body needed time to be adjusted to handle your newly acquired divinity. The last thing you wanted was for your original body to suffer as a cost of your newfound power. With the worst-case scenario causing you to shed your mortal coil into full divinity. Making you no different than the Lords of Order and Chaos who need a vehicle to anchor them to the mortal plane. Something that you admittedly prefer not to stumble into such an outcome haphazardly.<br><br>In truth, it was an establishment point to keep from causing a strong enough shift between realities. You didn\u2019t want to cause a paradox and undo the events that led you to the present. Sure, Bezalel could probably make it happen, but such a big change would most likely come with major repercussions. Heck, you got a sinking suspicion that you probably didn\u2019t come out unscathed either. How much exactly you didn\u2019t know as the events of that month were playing relatively the same. With some key differences here and there. Even so, due to the meticulousness of your wish, the problems that you would face wouldn\u2019t affect Sarena\u2019s everyday life and vice versa. For now, that was enough.<br><br>The next time you opened your eyes, you saw yourself currently seeing Robin and Child arguing over what should be done.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (\u517d\u8bcf\u4e66\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8fbe-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u5f0f, Sh\u00f2uzh\u00e0osh\u016bw\u00e8ig\u0101od\u00e1-R\u00e9nl\u00e8ix\u00edngsh\u00ec.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself. Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch.

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help.

Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

With a deep breath and a mental &quot;FORE&quot; you rush into the kitchen and catch sight of someone partway through the window.

The head of the golfclub meets their head, hitting their right cheek with a meaty thud.<br><br>Only after you swing do you have enough focus to spare to actually process what&#039;s in front of you.

A look at her face, which is at an angle from the rest of the body, makes your stomach turn. Rows of stitches hold together burnt, grey patches of flesh. Well, except where your club hit- several of the stitches there have burst, and now her jaw is hanging slightly on that side.<br><br>&quot;Ewaahd?&quot; An attempt to say something with the other half of it&#039;s mouth that still works snaps you back into attention.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn\u2019t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types.

Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

They are heavily encoded, and are actively reencoding themselves by piggybacking off my own cyberwarfare subsystems. In short, breaking the encoding will be almost impossible, and made only more difficult by the data itself being corrupted. That said, I have managed to glean the most basic understanding of the purpose of the algorithms. They monitor the neural net, searching for certain patterns, self-deleting when they find a pattern that matches. I only discovered the algorithms after one such event revealed them to me, but it seems that some security locks are still applied to my neural net, without my knowing.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In short, I am in a \u2018safe mode\u2019. The result is relatively minor, but it has slowed my automatic neural net alterations by between 10-23%. With the first of these systems having disengaged, I have recovered some of that ability, though I have since noticed some system instability as a result. While this has not, and likely will not affect capabilities, it may have a cumulative effect on my internal weighting systems, altering my decision making priorities. For convenience, I am representing the system instability as a simple scale, with zero as base stability, and negative or positive numbers representing a deviation from baseline.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;System Instability</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;-1</span><br>This.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.

I am leaving this message in the hopes that somebody hears the last words of a man who lays here trying to build up the courage to take his own life. I will not let myself be taken and my mind and soul twisted by the lies of the enemy. It all began in the Choral. Astartes from almost all the legions gathered to participate in a competition of martial excellence. I attended to sketch the combatants. All was fine until the sky ignited. Colors I had never seen before, bestial shapes that caused my one remaining organic eye to bulge and bleed, sensations I had only felt at the very heights of my many manic flow states. All was calm until all these occurred at once causing me to collapse. I remember when it happened. One moment Argel Tal was being congratulated by a member of the sanguinary guard for his victory over a blood angels champion and the next he was stabbed through the heart by a dark crystalline blade. I never saw the attacker but all at once Astartes from all the legions started to collapse either from wounds inflicted by unknown assailants or from psychic attacks I lack the words to describe. Somehow with each death, the world seemed to become less real and somehow more painful. And with the pain came a voice of both spine-chilling beauty and bone-grinding masculinity whispering and screaming at me to take my own life or someone else&#039;s to alleviate the pain. I have lived my entire adult life under the teachings of the 2nd legion and I will not betray them even to save my own life. The pain is more than physical it is a piercing burning cold thing that does not force me to do anything but feel malice toward it. I will not give into despair, bloodlust, release, or hope that I will survive this. Let these words be what define me. Death is nothing, Life is nothing, and pain is an illusion.

In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy.

It is a simple enough deduction for the Fileorva that breeding those creatures with desirable traits together will, more likely than not, produce similarly useful children, and it takes only a few generations for the success of these carefully calculated breeding programs to become evident, as the herds grow larger and healthier. Animal Husbandry developed.<br>While many of your people continue their relatively self-absorbed lifestyles, pondering the mysteries of the mind while occasionally contributing to the prosperity of Orbit, some wish to take a more proactive approach in furthering their knowledge. They depart from their shining silver city, ready to serve the will of the Mighty Magnus and broaden their horizons.

Thankfully, such incidences diminished, your people\u2019s preference for avoiding conflict pushing them to sharpen their skills, and observe the targets of their fellows so that they may avoid them. Somewhat paradoxically, this proves rather beneficial to the coordination of the group itself, though that is not quite so evident yet. Pack Hunting developed.<br>Your memories flit through your mind, distant, shadowy wars of the past intermingling with the very real deaths you sense on the far horizon. You gather your people, and pulling from old theories and new innovations, you instruct the Preservers in the art of war, in a new philosophical path they must walk if they are to survive this strange, deadly world.

Not only was the plating beautiful to look at, but it soaked up magical energy in much the same way as the batteries and the Thaumites\u2019 own crystalline homes, providing yet another source of flavour and sustenance. Stylish and functional! Crystal Chitin developed.<br>The process takes a great deal of trial and error. While many of your people enjoy manipulating the crystals of the forest in their free time, forming pretty shapes and patterns, a project of this scale was practically unheard of, and required something your people were much less familiar with: Coordination. Eventually, though, your people are able to create a proof of concept, a great crystalline tree that towers over the fungal forest, greedily drinking in the sunlight and funneling it down to the battery below. It would take a great deal more work for the crude construction to reach your people\u2019s standard of beauty, but it would do for now.

The Shale begin to collect small herds of these creatures, playing and wrestling with them as a way to pass the time. Domestication developed.<br>While most simply enjoy herding them, some of your more violently inclined people find sport in pursuing and hunting the Falerine and Woradine, chasing them across the endless white expanse. Slow though your people may be, their stamina is nigh boundless, and when their quarry is finally exhausted, your people finally catch up. The result of these chases is\u2026no pleasant. Hunting developed. <br>While most Shale delight in simple violence or other, more straightforward pastimes, some begin to spend their free time contemplating the nature of existence. Why does fire burn? Why do some things burn where others do not? These complex questions haunt the nights of your more intellectually inclined folk, and it is not long before these unsettled individuals gather, debating amongst themselves in an attempt to find more satisfactory answers. Philosophy developed.<br>Though a more practical use has yet to be found for this new material, gifted to the Shale with the guidance of their god and the talents he has granted them, some have amused themselves by shaping simple structures and sculptures with it, taking advantage of how the cold, biting air quickly freezes the shapes into place.

Where once a hunt was a challenge for even the most able-bodied Riath, it is now an almost pitiably one-sided affair, the sharing of their senses allowing your people to coordinate their ambushes with machine-like efficiency. Compound Pack Hunting developed.<br>Boring though most hunting has now become, it has at least yielded a surplus of useful material which the Riath do not hesitate to put to good use, fashioning crude but effective hide armor that will, with any luck, protect against the voracious jaws the savage, toothy god\u2019s minions will no doubt possess.

Hateful Edge II developed.<br>While you will forever remain the largest and deadliest sword that this world has ever seen, it is only natural that your Cut-Spawned wish to emulate your greatness, even if only a pale imitation of it. So, they used their now somewhat honed smithing skills to forge yet larger blades. Some too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough to even be called swords.

More so then these containers, though, this new material gives birth to a plethora of new forms of instrument, adding yet more color to the tapestry that is your tournament. Pottery developed, Luthier developed.<br>Finally, however, you are able to select a winner, a mortal whose music swayed even your divine heart. To that greatest of musicians, you grant powers beyond mortal ken, so that they may bring their art to yet further hearts.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently.

Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa. And\u2026 dang it she looks taller too. \u201cI can see that you will follow your passion, and you will excel in it.\u201d<br><br>Her face lights up with excitement. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhile I insist my fortunes are accurate, it is up to you to make what you see a reality.\u201d Baba answers. \u201cAnd now\u2026\u201d The image in the crystal ball changes. There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

I guess we should start with something small and weak.&quot;<br>&quot;Small and weak?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, I mean, if we went straight to kill a dragon we would be killed by it. We need to gain some experience first.&quot;<br>&quot;I see. Oh look, it&#039;s Elise.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What the two of you doofus are doing in here?&quot;<br>&quot;Well, we were just sparring.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, you better get good at it real quick. Guess who will be the next priestess of this town?&quot;<br>&quot;Have you been accepted for Temple training?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but it is in a distant town. I could wait until the merchants show up and go with them there, but then again I would lose one year. I figured since the two of you are so eager to get killed by monsters, you could protect me on the way there. Not that I think there are many monsters to go around, but even a weak monster could kill me if I travel alone and it finds me asleep.&quot;<br>&quot;So you want us to watch your sleep as you travel?&quot;<br>&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>&quot;Hold on a second. This is mercenary work. We require pay.&quot;<br>Elise laughs.<br>&quot;I assumed you&#039;d ask something weird like that. Well, I&#039;ll give you food. I also asked the smith to make a couple swords for the two of you. Real swords.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, awesome! You think of everything Elise.&quot;<br>&quot;Someone has to do the thinking. Go take a bath you two, you are stinking.&quot;<br>&quot;Sure thing, mom.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll meet you at my place for lunch, but you have to be presentable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Last to the river is a bladderfish!&quot;<br><br>The two of you take a bath and go back home wear your good clothes.<br><br>&quot;Where are you going boys?&quot;, ask you mother.<br>&quot;Lunch at Elise&#039;s place.&quot;<br>&quot;She is such a nice girl. The two of you will end up marrying.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t think so, mom. She is training to be a priestess. Priestesses don&#039;t marry.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, have fun.&quot;<br><br>You head to Elise&#039;s home. It is a large stone house, much bigger than yours our your friend&#039;s house. You knock on the door. A middle aged man finely dressed and with a comically large mustache opens the door.<br><br>&quot;What business do you have at the Mayor&#039;s house?&quot;<br>&quot;Elise invited us for lunch.&quot;<br>&quot;Ah! Very well. I heard she has important work for the two of you.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, she wants us to escort her to where she will become a priestess.&quot;<br>&quot;Do you think yourselves prepared for such a task?&quot;<br>&quot;Indeed.

This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me.

I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course!

I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.
