Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get. As you were walking off to the closest market you could think of, however, something compelled you to stop. Take it to a safe place, read it and\u2026 And\u2026 You weren\u2019t sure. Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don\u2019t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man.

His voice is more gruff than that of Abraxas, and he said, <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cOn my request, my Master has allowed me to answer you personally. Your entreaty is acceptable to me: we shall not prioritize assailing you or your Servant until the foes in our vicinity have been dealt with, and my desire to do battle with your Servant shall be clearly announced before we engage. I will also not raise my hand against you should you yourself abstain from joining that battle. However, know that should you resort to perfidy, I will slay you myself.\u201d </span><br><br>Abraxas\u2019 ability to manipulate telepathy surprised you again; perhaps he merged the connection of his Servant\u2019s contract with the one he made with you?

Now, there are a few secondary conditions I was hoping to append to our agreement, Abraxas: we should consider further cooperation if some unexpected event arises, such as the present situation of the undead and civilians being brought here at random, some monstrous existence beyond the norm arising during the war, or a large group of Servants be discovered that poses a grave threat to all others. Ideally our agreement can last until the war is sorted out, as I also don\u2019t personally wish ill upon you.\u201d </span> You continue, though as you finish you recall that you made a similar non-aggression pact with Truvietianne Edelfelt and her Lancer.

Still, a lovely instructor is speaking.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The inner cell mass undergoes changes to form three germ layers known as the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm,&quot;</span> Meryl declares, looking very professional and elegant. She&#039;s always so casual, so this is a nice look on her. She&#039;s got a long skirt on, a shirt-vest combo, and is also wearing high heels, something she rarely does outside of dresses. Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing. You listen carefully, but it all bleeds together, like some sort of fast-forwarded movie. Still, your serenity remains with you. Just looking at the aqua-eyed beauty is enough to keep you happy.<br><br>---<br><br>Meryl proposed to you only recently- Which would have been odd enough, as far as you were concerned, until she explained why: It was now or never, at least until you showed up.<br><br>She&#039;s got demi-human physiology, some kind of fish-woman, and her father is a magician. Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fianc\u00e9e cares about you. And you definitely care about her. You&#039;ve decided to celebrate life with her, despite her fear of being a burden due to her origins.

You want to know why she wants you to leave, and you want her to know you really are serious. Maybe it&#039;s a little more romantic than practical, but that&#039;s life. Sometimes you make serious decisions for reasons other than convenience. While you do your best to remain level-headed, you don&#039;t have a heart of stone. You&#039;re really in love with her, and she&#039;s really in love with you. Meryl reaches out to take your hand, and you feel a wave of warmth as she takes hold of it.<br><br>Your mother looks aside, bitterly gathering her resolve. It&#039;s tragic that she&#039;s showing so much resistance to the woman she herself advocated you marry, but she doesn&#039;t seem to believe your story. She walks away from the table in a haze, heading into the master bedroom, and you&#039;re unsure of what&#039;s going to happen. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;I&#039;m sorry,&quot;</span> Meryl whispers, but you re-assure her. <span class=\"mu-g\">There&#039;s nothing to apologize for.</span> She doesn&#039;t seem to agree, and is inches from crying, suppressing her tears. It&#039;s clear she believes that her nature has ruined your relationship with your family instantly. You assure her you&#039;ll be with her, and she nods. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;I know.&quot;</span><br><br>But rather than calling your father or beginning to cry, Mom returns with a jewelry box small enough for a ring. Opening it, she places it on the table in front of you. &quot;This belonged to your grandfather,&quot; she states, and refuses to look at either of you. There&#039;s a symbol on the ring that you don&#039;t recognize, and when you take a closer look at it, Meryl pulls away. It&#039;s a simple ring, and it looks like it&#039;s made of steel, but it doesn&#039;t seem rusted or scratched in the slightest. Whatever this is, its significance is lost on you.<br><br>&quot;My father-in-law couldn&#039;t keep a job outside of the government.&quot; she arches her fingers over her nose and closes her eyes, moderating her breathing. You remember Grandpa as being quite fun, if a bit odd, but you attributed that to age. &quot;Your father was put in charge of the family business at the age of eighteen, by his grandfather. As soon as that happened, his mother divorced, back when that was becoming more common.&quot; You always wondered why you never saw Grandma for a while, but that was an age ago. She still talks to Dad, but barely knows the rest of you.<br><br>Meryl is still staying away from the ring, and seems to understand its significance. You still don&#039;t, so you want more information, and ask about it from Mom. &quot;That ring is part of a fraternity, called Yggdrasil. It&#039;s closer to a conspiracy, really. Obviously, your grandfather was a member. I didn&#039;t think much of it- I wanted to stay out of it, and so did your father. The reason we have the ring at all is that your grandfather quit over an ideological split but held onto the ring just in case.&quot;<br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "elder_ring", "ext": ".png", "w": 602, "h": 625, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669778804419672, "time": 1669778804, "md5": "dGBSgLV123p69gpzhMSCdw==", "fsize": 255897, "resto": 5471260, "id": "eGnC3dl0", "trip": "!1oveagvAGI"}, {"no": 5480748, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)22:29:48", "name": "Sebastian", "com": "(2/2)<br><br>A conspiracy?

Whether you intended to or not, they probably think you picked him specifically to piss them off, or to corrupt him.

So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 106, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 101, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5481250, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)14:53:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5480834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480834</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Uzumaki Shiki, K\u014dsh\u016b.

Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

His speech is also Tritonian, the accent indicating an education in one of Triton&#039;s more elite institutions of learning.

In her arms, my cousin would&#039;ve found me. From that, she spun such a tale, eh? How droll! What imagination!&quot;<br> &quot;How lucky for you, Mr. Chapham,&quot; adds Lady Valeria. &quot;The rival you may have expected is merely a figment of your fiancee&#039;s imagination.&quot;<br> &quot;No, no, dearest. Chappingham wouldn&#039;t think so basely as that, would you Chappingham? For, how could I have eyes for anyone else but you, dearest?&quot; He kisses her hand again.<br> You smile tightly. &quot;Would you excuse me for a moment?&quot; You calmly walk out of the grand hall and would have broken into a full sprint back to your chambers, had you not spotted the Princess sitting alone on a bench in the hall, below a mural of her father, weeping pitifully into her hands.", "time": 1669930249, "resto": 5461059, "id": "MJPRW9/N"}, {"no": 5482305, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:31:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5482301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5482301</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you do?</span><br>1.

Because of that, there will be facets of myself that will take form. Like the lingering feelings of contempt towards the subject that caused them that I have, or my ancient instincts towards returning to the period where everything is null. Both of these paroxysmal abstracts will gain sentience and manifest into beings of their own. I cannot say if they will be your ally like I am or will turn out to be your enemy. It is the price of the imaginary properties that reside within my power to alter reality as well as what defines the magic of the darkworld. To which you should make privy towards imagination and conceptual systems such as Numerology/Arithmancy, Gematria, Isopsephy, and English Qaballa will be the focal point of your magic.\u201d Bezalel explains. <br><br>\u201cSo, the concept of numbers will have power and serve as a conduit for my magic? Not just words like Temurah, Notarikon, or any Kabbalistic method. That sounds very technical in comparison to what I\u2019ve understood magic to be. Makes me feel like some sort of coder or admin rather than a sorceress.\u201d You lamented, stroking the back of your head. Quickly, however, your mind soon registered the more significant issue once it rebounded back to those paroxysmal abstracts. <br> <br>Choosing to brush aside your magical concerns for another time, Bezalel went back to his explanation. \u201cIf it ends up being the latter, then you\u2019ll have quite the formidable adversary to face. So, if you don\u2019t want to be burdened with the responsibility of handling such paroxysm then this is your last chance to back down.\u201d <br> <br>Not even giving a chance to humor such notions with a thought, you quickly frown and enact your inner nag. \u201cWhat did I tell you about not letting you feel any regrets? I thank you for the warning, but it won\u2019t prevent me from doing what I have to do. The regret I\u2019ll feel If I don\u2019t take you out of this space far outweighs any potential regret or strife that\u2019ll come from my actions. So don\u2019t feel like you have to apologize or attempt to sway me from doing this for my sake. I know full well the consequences and accept them wholeheartedly without hesitation.\u201d You smile, standing proudly and firmly as you were glowing with resolve. <br><br>\u201cI understand, I won\u2019t insult your resolve by troubling you with this matter any further. So, let\u2019s resume with your request.\u201d Bezalel answers, respecting your wishes.<br><br>Con", "time": 1669926623, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5482256, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)15:42:25", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5482254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5482254</a><br>\u201cOkay, to get straight to the point. I want to get my life back. The life of regular human Sarena Rosenberger. Where nothing that I did as a vessel and avatar tracks back to.\u201d You say, being concise as possible for an opening statement. <br> <br>\u201cAlright, sound simple enough to do.\u201d Before Bezalel can act, you quickly start waving your arms back and forth to get his attention. Quickly trying to stop him with your wild gestures before it was too late. <br> <br>\u201cPlease hold on, I\u2019m not finished. This is pretty complex, and I don\u2019t want to miss this up by not being thorough.\u201d You pant, trying to regain your rhythm as you explain yourself. <br> <br>\u201cOh, well continue then so I might better understand and fulfill your wish.\u201d Bezalel requests. <br> <br>\u201cThank you. Anyway, I want my old life back, but I also need to continue to be that champion emissary and ambassador, the Lord of Eternal Balance/Cosmic Balancer, and divine avatar. Although it has only been a month, I\u2019ve come to learn something important about myself. &quot;Stopping yourself for a moment, you take a brief moment to reflect. Looking down at your chest, noticing the brooch and the lion of Judah symbol as a reminder. Without realizing it your facial expression soon relaxed into an authentic smile. \u201cI genuinely love being a hero.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cI love being able to do some real good for this world, just like my father but on a bigger scale. I can protect what I cherish most while offering a helping hand to those that need it. Although the stuff that I\u2019ve done so far might be small time, with the sole exceptions of today, I know that it all has merit\u2014serving as the foundation for a truly magnificent forest to bloom and come into its own. \u201cYou say, feeling the smile on your face widening before your eyes ended up becoming more solemn. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life being complete without this aspect, just like how I can\u2019t imagine giving up my old life for this new venue of living.\u201d <br> <br>Folding your arms and puffing your cheeks into a pout, you metaphorically and quite literally put your foot down. \u201cI absolutely do not want to be the hero that gives up personal happiness and forgo personal relationships for hero work. I&#039;m just as selfish as I am selfless, so I\u2019m willing to do what needs to be done. But I won\u2019t compromise and sacrifice something if I can fight with all my heart and soul to preserve it. After all, just as I am Plethora Champion of Quintessence, I am also Sarena Rosenberger of Jump City. The two can coexist in harmony and I don\u2019t need to choose one or the other as the real me. For they\u2019re both me, and I wouldn\u2019t have any other way.\u201d<br><br>Con", "time": 1669927345, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5482266, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)15:56:21", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5482256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5482256</a><br>\u201cTo repeat myself, this is but a simple matter to perform. Far easier than just flat out rewriting your fate entirely or sending you back to the moment of your death to change the outcome completely.\u201d Bezalel remarked, giving a word of confidence. \u201cBut continue with your request, for I can sense that you\u2019re not finished yet.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAlright, cool. Glad you understand. Now what I\u2019d like is a magical well in perception between those two Identities. So that only I and people I deem trustworthy can see through and perceive accordingly. This next part will be pretty tricky considering that I think it&#039;s basically rewriting history, but it&#039;s just a smidge. Can it be possible that Serena Rosenberger never died, but rather that she was put in a coma the entire time in between? Whereas my soul was transferred into the clay body of Gaea, becoming Plethora like originally while both the lords of chaos and order and the quintessence mend to my real body. Repairing and adjusting it to be able to handle my ascensions while remaining human.\u201d You explain, choosing to be quite meticulous in your phrasing. You weren\u2019t sure if the Great Darkness operated like one of those genies who need the wording to be exact or could give more wiggle room and follow the spirit of your wish. <br><br>\u201cI figure that way the events that came forth after my resurrection originally would come into fruition without causing any irregularities or dissonance. I don\u2019t want any time paradoxes after all. Oh, for a paper trail, I kind of also need the hospital bills to be paid. As for the future, I also need a proper excuse to slip out of the Sarena identity, to go be a hero as Plethora. Both spontaneously, and for whatever period needed. All the while without it being too weird for people, thus not causing complications or contradiction. Thus, with that magical perception barrier, nobody would be able to figure out that Sarena Rosenberger is Plethora and vice versa. You can throw whatever else you think would be necessary for keeping up with the spirit of my request. &quot;you say, finally reaching the end of your explanation. <br><br>\u201cHaving heard it in full, I can say with all honestly that it can be done. Those who you choose to share this information will also be able to perceive the previous state if they and/or you choose to.\u201d Bezalel says, preparing himself to form the necessary forces to pull off this wish perfectly. <br> <br>\u201cReally, that\u2019s great. If you had a physical form, I\u2019d hug the hell out of you Bezalel. Practically jumping for joy, you were at the point of gushing with the sentient darkness. At long last you feel like the impenetrable great wall keeping you from your old life...has finally broken down. <br> <br>Con", "time": 1669928181, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5482289, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:15:23", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5482266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5482266</a><br><br>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else, we can depart. When you wake up back in the material world, your request will have been fulfilled. I promise you that. &quot;With that you allowed yourself to slip back into slumber. You were leaving the dark hands to wrap around you and begin to encase you in a cocoon. There were a lot of other things you wanted to speak about. But it was fine, you were reassured that the two of you could converse through your dreams and the brooch when needed.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (\u517d\u8bcf\u4e66\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8fbe-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u5f0f, Sh\u00f2uzh\u00e0osh\u016bw\u00e8ig\u0101od\u00e1-R\u00e9nl\u00e8ix\u00edngsh\u00ec.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself. Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her.

For decades, we knew nothing such as war, as battle, not in the heart of Vynmark, where the sun\u2019s glow and the sea mist scattered fairy-blooms all about hills and plains that never knew the smell of blood. We believed that our ancestors had won us this idyll, and that we were meant to do naught but enjoy it, whilst whomever wished to play at war would never see something like the whispered-of yet so far off brutality of the rest of the continent.<br><br>Soon enough, we found that we had not earned peace in our lives.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one. Mountainfolk are just as pale as Nauk are, after all, so the earthier-tone haired ones wouldn&#039;t be squinted at.

But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them.

Anyone would be nervous. <span class=\"mu-s\">There is no reason ton panic.</span><br><br>You continue repeating this to yourself as your best friend, Jason, drives the van. A minute ago you felt somewhat disassociated, as if you were really just an observer, floating behind yourself and staring, but that&#039;s getting better now. The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things. What were you saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was asking what major you were planning on doing again. You were still undecided last month, right?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you still are. You have no idea what you want to do, just that you want a cushy white-collar job, and that you probably need a degree to do it. You&#039;ll just do gen eds for now.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Biology. You&#039;re too dumb for med school, but you figure you could still do plenty of good helping with the non-human things.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Computer Science. Ever since you dug a working laptop out of the school garbage you&#039;ve been fucking around on the things, and it&#039;d sure be nice if you could keep doing that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Art.

You can&#039;t think of any way to hide your entrance fully- a broken window is a dead giveaway of something odd after all- but a broken window that someone has bothered to cover up and one that&#039;s just missing half the glass are very different. The former kind of fits in with the, er, &#039;aesthetic&#039; out back, and could maybe be the result of a broken window that they just haven&#039;t gotten around to fixing yet. It&#039;s possible to overlook. The latter not only draws attention, but is also drafty and possible to get through while making almost no noise. Not a good combination of features, especially now.<br><br>While not an expert in window repair, you do have 18 years of pop culture to help you in figuring out what to do. In zombie movies and in hurricanes and stuff like that people nail wood over their windows to stop things from getting in, right? You don&#039;t really have the time for that, but that does provide you with some inspiration. There&#039;s plenty of wood in the garage, and there should be duct tape or something similar around to. That&#039;d certainly make for a quick fix that&#039;s just a little more solid than &quot;shove something in front of it&quot;.<br><br>With that decided, you head downstairs. You turn the flashlight off at the bottom of the stairs, wanting to stay cautious given the exposed window. Several seconds later you&#039;re very glad you made this decision. Just as you pass through the living room and walk up to the kitchen counter so that you can examine the hole in the window and determine how much you&#039;re going to need to fix it, you hear something. A faint noise to your front and left. In the back yard.<br><br>You freeze up. A moment later, you hear it again. Something that sounds like the rustling of shoes on grass. Another moment, and you snap to attention. You definitely aren&#039;t imagining that noise. Something is just outside, and probably coming closer. You need to act- NOW.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drop down to the floor and hide using the counter as cover so that you can&#039;t be seen through the window.

From humble beginnings on the now long gone Planet Vegeta, Karn has become the pride of his people, and their greatest champion.<br><br>Character sheets and other info: <br>https://controlc.com/46ec566d<br>https://pastebin.com/u/GrandDragonQ<wbr>M<br>Archive:<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/qstarchive.html?searchall=Saiyan<wbr>+Conqueror+Quest<br>Help fund quest art commissions here: https://www.patreon.com/GrandDragon<wbr>QM<br><br>Quest rules are as follows:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;30 minute voting windows</span><br><span class=\"mu-r\">&gt;Pick ONLY ONE option when voting(unless otherwise noted)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dice rolls are all best of first three, only correctly rolled dice pools will count</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One dice roll per person per post unless three players have not yet rolled, and ten minutes has passed since your last roll</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crits are 100 on a d100(a 99 or paired rolls may net you an extra bonus)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crit fails are a 1/100 with no passing rolls, or if two 1s are rolled regardless of the third</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Write-ins are both allowed and encouraged, but OOC options will be ignored</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can change any of the above rules at any time for any or no reason</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If your goal is simply to troll, at least put in enough effort to make it funny</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have fun</span><br><br>SCQ will usually start on Saturdays at noon Eastern Standard Time, and run throughout the weekend.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Better wages, more privileges, and addition consideration when you are eligible for sentencing (to be eligible for sentencing, a peon or trustee must have paid off the full cost of their capture and transport to their prison. For most peons, this isn&#039;t too difficult - but for pirates, this is a huge and often insurmountable hurtle. &#039;Full cost of capture and transport&#039; means the entire cost of the Purging Lancet&#039;s expedition, including supplies, consumables, wages, repairs, even deprecation of the hull, equipment and weapons on the ship is divided equally among the pirates that she captured on that expedition. Lucky for Enoch, there were a lot of survivors taken off of the Scheme, and Lancet took other two other pirate ships on the expedition, meaning that Enoch could conceivably pay off his share in a somewhat reasonable timeframe if he had a decent job - like a wrecker - then get sentenced, and pay that off as well. And once you are sentenced, you have the advantage of paying with time as well as your earnings. Once everything is paid up, the Peon or Trustee is sent before the Release Board (there is a Parole board as well, but as a pirate, Enoch is not eligible for sentencing arbitrage - and that stuff often comes with some serious strings attached anyway) and then it is determined where and how the Peon or Trustee will be released. As a a pirate, Enoch will probably not be considered for release back into &#039;civilization&#039;, but there are many frontier settlements that are willing to take skilled workers. Some are desperate enough that they will even help Peons and Trustees pay off their sentence, though that is typically reserved for prisoners with exceptional skills, like doctors and mechanists). <br><br><a href=\"#p5482003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5482003</a><br>I suppose I should clarify a point. You have cellmates regardless of your vote here. In both cases, none of them have EVA certs, but if you vote for being on good terms and get Tinpenny and Allman as your mates, you might be able to convince them to become wreckers like you - though it is not going to be easy. Besides the inherent dangers, and the time that it takes to take the classes - time that you are not earning money - they would also have work an arrangement out with Boss Barone as well, which they are reasonably leery of. <br><br><a href=\"#p5481951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5481951</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I see what you did there.

This thought that you already knew deep down spreads through the crowd and burrows into the minds of even her children, no matter how heretical they may think it is.<br><br>None of them has ever seen their mom struggle, let alone be hurt by someone. They thought they were invincible, their strength infallible. More than the legions of homies that your men have destroyed and more than all the bruises they received, this lone act managed to dampen their morale. Now there is room for doubt. And like a festering wound its taint spreads quickly. Now the Big Mom Pirates no longer have the certainty of victory.<br><br>And that&#039;s not all. The Silver Pirates may be tired. They may have given themselves a handicap by not using lethal attacks and they may be outnumbered. But now their fervor builds. Like sharks in the water they can smell the blood and know what it means. Murray roars to his fellows.<br>&quot;SILVERS! DRAG THEM TO THE NEW AGE!&quot;<br><br>After they let out a warcry the fighting breaks out again. The only two people who don&#039;t join them and coincidentally the only two people who do not react to this shift in the tide of battle are you and Mama. At first it seems like she hasn&#039;t even registered that she&#039;s been wounded. But she quickly disproves that by raising her palm and licking it clean without looking.<br>&quot;SLURP. I hate the taste of iron!&quot;<br>She grips Napoleon with both hands.<br>&quot;COGNAC!&quot;", "filename": "1636818951685", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1666450694118912, "time": 1666450694, "md5": "8qgxREGdFqaMMetGX1oRyw==", "fsize": 106601, "resto": 0, "id": "bzVdb5s4", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "west-blue-seadogs-quest-21", "trip": "!!Dfn1WI/0wvw", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 876, "images": 66, "omitted_posts": 871, "omitted_images": 65, "last_replies": [{"no": 5469454, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)05:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5469231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5469231</a><br>How would that get us Eliza back? <br>Same with the ideas of attacking outposts, bases and forts: How would any of that get us Eliza back?

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die.

There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 528, "images": 108, "omitted_posts": 523, "omitted_images": 108, "last_replies": [{"no": 5479975, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)07:25:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 44 (1d100)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a>", "time": 1669724747, "resto": 5436238, "id": "sDkL31vW"}, {"no": 5479987, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)07:52:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 30 (1d100)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a>", "time": 1669726363, "resto": 5436238, "id": "vSpk5uGM"}, {"no": 5480115, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)10:43:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 37 (1d100)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a>", "time": 1669736617, "resto": 5436238, "id": "vqdwcc9o"}, {"no": 5480831, "now": "11/30/22(Wed)00:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 13 (1d100)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a><br>Ima roll better", "time": 1669787542, "resto": 5436238, "id": "3nFGcbac"}, {"no": 5481880, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)03:49:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5479973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5479973</a><br>Suggestion:<br>Focus on the spot we already hit before.<br>If we consistently hit the same spot it hurts more and more as it tenderizes the spot.", "time": 1669884565, "resto": 5436238, "id": "rP/1AUjd"}], "last_modified": 1669884565}, {"no": 5437870, "now": "10/19/22(Wed)02:09:46", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "You are S|^|ORD C]-[iCH", "com": "You are sword chich.

It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Then\u2026 maaaybe we can see that fortune teller here. For fun, y\u2019know. Sound good?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt does! Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently. As the ride nears the end, Cocoa speaks up again. \u201cHey\u2026 Peppa?\u201d<br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "e6829f83f276ecebfb259a3bbb0bef91c02f590d_hq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669026901119487, "time": 1669026901, "md5": "BQgdhF6DkDD9PpjP9TM4YQ==", "fsize": 72663, "resto": 5434173, "id": "dTPM+4xx", "trip": "!!cxhpY4QLASr"}, {"no": 5470811, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)05:36:27", "name": "Kato", "com": "<a href=\"#p5470809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470809</a><br>https://youtu.be/vtjxwhVXqbg<br><br>\u201cMm?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI love you.\u201d<br><br>You smile, letting out a relaxed and content sigh. And then your brain finally registers that. You sit up a bit, blushing. That was a very sincere, very clear declaration. \u201cC-Cocoa\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cI mean it, Peppa. I do love you. And I love being with you.\u201d She kisses your forehead gently. \u201cYou\u2019re my Peppa.\u201d<br><br>Your heart feels all aflutter. \u201c\u2026I love you too Cocoa.\u201d You sit up and hold her close as you kiss her back, on the lips this time. \u201cMy Cocoa.\u201d<br><br>The ride sadly comes to an end, but you\u2019ve got a smile on your face that hasn\u2019t faded yet. \u201cStill up for a look into the fortune teller?\u201d Cocoa asks you.<br><br>\u201cReady if you are.\u201d<br><br>The two of you reach the fortune teller\u2026 and get a bit of a surprise. Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa. And\u2026 dang it she looks taller too. \u201cI can see that you will follow your passion, and you will excel in it.\u201d<br><br>Her face lights up with excitement. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhile I insist my fortunes are accurate, it is up to you to make what you see a reality.\u201d Baba answers. \u201cAnd now\u2026\u201d The image in the crystal ball changes. There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

I figured since the two of you are so eager to get killed by monsters, you could protect me on the way there. Not that I think there are many monsters to go around, but even a weak monster could kill me if I travel alone and it finds me asleep.&quot;<br>&quot;So you want us to watch your sleep as you travel?&quot;<br>&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>&quot;Hold on a second. This is mercenary work. We require pay.&quot;<br>Elise laughs.<br>&quot;I assumed you&#039;d ask something weird like that. Well, I&#039;ll give you food.

This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground.

I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

It is risky, there are bloodthirsty monsters inside the ruins.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, we met a few.&quot;<br>&quot;Now excuse me, I have to go back to my tribe.&quot;<br>&quot;Should we kill him?&quot;, asks the bard.<br>&quot;It is just a hungry goblin.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me.

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course!

I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She?

There were people before you, and if they could do it, you won\u2019t be found wanting either as long as you do not give up.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSo how long did this vow last?\u201d<br>\u201cA little short of a two years.\u201d<br>\u201cHow did the others react to it?\u201d<br>\u201cAt first bemused, and I admit it transformed into annoyance before it became respect. They started to accept it as a fact of life before my liege asked me to accept a leadership position, where I had to cast it off.\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, makes sense. I don\u2019t think I could do that. Spells require spoken words.\u201d<br>\u201cI can see how that could be a deterrent.\u201d<br>Silence sets in, as she seems to be deep in thought.

They sometimes need time and encouragement.<br><br>\u201cSo you are in a \u2018command position\u2019, like Headmistress Olivia?\u201d<br>\u201cSort of I suppose. I share the same rank with eleven others in our host, with many knights under my command.\u201d<br>\u201cAre they like you?\u201d<br>\u201cIn a manner of speaking? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, even knights. Though I suppose I have the advantage of experience.\u201d<br>\u201cI remember seeing Headmistress Olivia move around all the time, telling people what to do and often stopping them. When I was little, I used to think she just likes ordering people around.\u201d she chuckles \u201cIt took me embarrassingly long to realize she doesn\u2019t seem as happy about it.

You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets?

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge.

To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace.
