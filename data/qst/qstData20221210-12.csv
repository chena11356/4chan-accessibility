Having just reunited with your fellow Shangralans and Astartes sons, whom have traveled the webway alongside your Beloved Emerald Lotus blossom, Kanzeon, and her sister, Anahita, to reinforce Angron&#039;s own every growing army of former gladiators and slaves, you noticed your followers amongst the Aeldari race were keeping a distance between themselves and your once enslaved brothers. Seeking answers from Noble Carys and valorous Folant, you learned the truth of how your brother was made a slave to begin with and the role the ever prophecy chasing Aeldari of the craftworlds played in it in their attempt to avert the dread future they beheld.<br><br>So, as you are not a simpleton who blames the world for one the ill deeds of the few, you decided it would be best for Angron to know of the truth of his capture and the cause for his attempted assassination, in the pursuit of bringing peace to his mind and preventing any misunderstandings or resentment from arising between him and the fair Aeldair, because of the misguided and foolish actions of those sycophants of destiny. After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens. And you know that as well as you know that those whom are different are often held with unwarranted suspicion and mistrust.<br><br>Which is why it is best to reveal the truth to your brother and introduce him to Aeldari whom are not distant and deserving of said mistrust.<br><br>&quot;And who better than myself and Folant&quot; Carys says jauntily, as the more dour ranger marches at your side &quot;To prove that not all of our people are apathetic to the plight of humanity, or retain the overwrought sense of pride that lead us to ruin&quot;<br>Cont",1670495207,0,RBVYiFdu,,the-2nd-primarch-quest-22,0,27,0,"[{'no': 5490662, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)05:27:06', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '“Behold the greatest of my dear brothers sons Ahriman!” Magnus gestured over the company that had fallen into two lines as an honour guard for the Giant of Prospero whom had come to visit his eccentric brother, his own retinue of eight others was somewhat intimidated by the appearance of the Second legions First Company; The Brotherhood of Panthers.

The Brotherhood guiding them between them even as they walked upon a path of blossoms and white stone, this place was truly beautiful.

6,5489400,,,12/07/22(Wed)21:09:26,Koku,Dragon Ball Origins #1,"Welcome to another Dragon Ball Quest thematically named Dragon Ball Origins™. This is inspired by the original DBO but also a play on DB Online as it will be taking many pieces from there. We&#039;ll be playing a Youthful upstart in the world of Dragon Ball and their involvement in many of the series&#039; iconic events. Although we will be going through the Original DB and perhaps beyond, this quest will be taking elements from multiple interpretations (Kakarot, Jaco, etc.) and adjusting them accordingly to fit a cohesive narrative. As well as incorporating other related works from the Toriyamaverse.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Who do we play specifically?</span><br>A Character named Pinich/Pinchi depending on the choice below. A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline.

Your newfound profession has brought you into several conflicts against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church.

Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

Professor Walker nods and replies &quot;it is, this is the only way to manifest them. Mind you, you&#039;ll be giving it a bit of your DNA which might sound weird but see it as you&#039;re both bonded genetically.&quot; You ignore his comment and the subsequent thought of having something be born with your DNA, with that you slowly touch the panel and concentrate. The binaries begin to swirl and swirl within the canister drawing the attention of all the lab assistants as they watch and marvel, slowly it begins to dissipate and the binary digits become no more. With a sudden THOOM accompanied with a blinding light the canister is once again overloaded with all sorts of alphanumeric symbols, you notice the professor and the lab assistants all wearing sunshades and you&#039;re clearly taking the brunt of the light&#039;s intensity.

Not like the duels that the Oldbloods conduct today, but great gargantuan wars, millions of men dying for their scrap-state. They say that the honored mechs were much more common then, like foot soldiers instead of the steeds of the most prestigious scrap lords or their scions. Personally, you find it hard to believe that there could be so many without them all starving.<br><br>Believe it or not though, that age came to an end on the Day the Sun Fell. Most of the old world died, and those few that remained had to remain in the old Burrows for over a century. Your parents&#039; generation was the first to emerge from the Burrows, and they set up the scrap-states and the Laws of Blood you know today, so that the wars from the old world would never occur again. No, people, food, and fuel were simply too rare for such wasteful wars. Instead, the duels and the scrap knights came to be, using what Eldertech mechs that could be scavenged to engage in personal combat to resolve conflict on behalf of their scrap states. <br><br>Now, with tensions rising among the scrap lords and more and more Duels of Honor and Duels of Blood being declared, the need for scrap knights is greater than ever. Your father and your father’s father pledged their ancestral Eldertech mech to the scrap lord of Scarlet Barrows, a small but wealthy scrap nation.

They’re fast fuckers too, so we’d have to push the engines if we’re gonna outrun them. That’d burn our fuel like mad, so we can only afford a few boosts like that on this journey. Alternatively, we try to ghost them, turn off anything that gives a heat signature and hope they’re dumb enough to fall for it this time. Problem is, we do that and we’re sitting ducks if they aren’t that stupid. Last option is, we stand and fight, surround the convoy and wait for them. We’ll have the initiative, but a fully grown ghoul ape can brawl with a heavy mech and live. We ought to choose carefully. Personally, I’d recommend we lay low; like I said, ghoul apes are nasty fuckers.” <br><br>While you’re still processing the barrage of information, Sir Tofar slams his fists on the meeting table. “Fuck that coward’s shit, we stand and fight! I’ve always wanted to bring home a pelt from one of those big dastards, we can take ‘em.” Dame Loxon narrows her eyes. “What did I say about your pride! Do you forget what we are protecting?

Known throughout the universe as the warrior race, their power and combat prowess proved invaluable in the Covenant&#039;s downfall. And with the largest threat to the PTO destroyed, their remnants scattered across space, the universe has been united under one banner. Peace reigns across the galaxy, under the rule of Lord Freeza, Emperor of the Universe. But not all wish it to be this way. Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge. Despite this newfound age of peace swiftly spreading across the stars, there are those who would seek its end. Will you be able to stop them, or shall the universe once more be plunged into the fires of war?<br><br>Welcome to Saiyan Conqueror Quest! This story takes place in an alternate timeline within the greater Dragonball EU. You the players control Karn: once an ordinary Saiyan warrior with a meager powerlevel of 2,830 who has risen to become a mighty Berserker Super Saiyan, and so much more. Throughout your many adventures, the “Dragon of New Salda” has grown into the symbol of Saiyan might and power, widely recognized across the universe as Freeza&#039;s close friend and confidant, not to mention his right hand man and General of his forces.

It’s been a while since you’ve been in the building, but you have no idea what floor you’re on, let alone where the rest of your unit is. Additionally, and more concerningly, you’re not sure how long you’ve been incapacitated. The more you wonder about how long you’ve been out, the more you remember what critical, important evidence you’ve unearthed right before losing enough blood to sleep on Grove’s shoulder of all places.

All the while during the revolt, the Planetary Governor asked for more troops from Icarus, and more time to meet the Tithe from the Administratum.<br><br>From his correspondence alone, the culprit and motives seemed much more straightforward. A rebel snuck into the stubborn and unyielding Governor’s estate to strike a decisive blow against a callous despot. The theory didn’t seem airtight with you, especially with the missing documents from the desk. Something didn’t add up, so you all tried your hand at interrogating the civilians present during the murder at the estate’s guest house. <br><br>The interviews were fruitful. You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald’s murder only minutes before his body was found. You heard about several potential suspects whose jobs in the government were threatened by the ongoing revolt. You learned of a young staffer that had gone missing the evening prior. Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor’s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald’s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room. You raced with your comrade back to the office, whereupon opening the large window behind the desk, you found a torn piece of fabric hanging on a wooden lattice on the exterior wall. It was the same kind of fabric the house servants wore.<br><br>So far, for being mere Arbites Troopers, you all were doing pretty good. So good in fact, that you had nearly forgotten you weren’t assigned to this murder by the time the person who was arrived: Inquisitor Weiss. You couldn’t get a good read on Weiss, she seemed aggravated at being undercut, but after you told her all that you had uncovered, she went ahead and let you keep investigating. Weiss took over interrogations, of course, and with the recovered fabric as a catalyst, she proceeded to march all the house servants down the hill to their quarters to begin questioning.<br><br>She didn’t take the fabric, though. Requisitioning one of the hounds the local government used to catch fleeing laborers(and some cool bikes from the PDF), you tracked the scent of the fabric all the way from the courtyard of the estate… down to the well near the servant’s quarters. Inquisitor Weiss wasn’t very happy about being interrupted, but when she saw where the dog was pointing, she had the same feeling you all did.', 'time': 1670394287, 'resto': 5484734, 'id': '2wiHY9ZM'}, {'no': 5488395, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)01:26:11', 'name': 'Servo-Scribe', 'com': 'The missing maid, Yuliya, was pulled out of the drink, her naked body bloated from drowning.<br><br>Now, the idea that Yuliya was attacked so the killer could take her uniform had crossed your minds long before finding the poor girl, but it seemed like the scent-trail had ended at her corpse, rather than her killer. Remembering those odd, body-rifling bloodstains by Archibald’s corpse, you wondered if any of the killer’s scent might remain on his body. Turns out, it did. Your steadfast canid ran right out of the house after a couple whiffs, and you all finally got to ride those bikes over some terrain, going out a couple klicks behind the estate to the edge of a forest.<br><br>Once there, it seemed the trail had gone cold again, but the only problem was that the dog couldn’t fly. There were skid-marks on the ground(the vehicular kind), that indicated some kind of light aircraft had touched down recently. You took measurements of the skid impressions in the dirt and returned to the estate.<br><br>When you returned, the Inquisitor had managed to get the safe open, and graciously gave you all the chance to peek at its contents. There were letters from friends, letters from a (possibly illegitimate) son, and, most concerningly, correspondence with an Ecclesiarchal Cardinal Theodore Flemming. The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers. The cardinal’s response was a gentle <span class=""mu-i"">’please, Emperor, do not do that.’</span><br><br>With seemingly nothing left to investigate, the Inquisitor kindly flew you off-planet to the voidship where the rest of your superiors were being held by the Mechanicus(long story). You took the opportunity to enlist the aid of a young Tech-Priest in finding out what kind of vessel matched the dimensions of the skid-marks you found planetside, and what voidships those matching vessels embarked upon.<br><br>It was an Arvus Lighter, and it docked with a grain carrier bound for Icarus. You left the Mechanicus ship for the Inquisitor’s personal strike-cruiser, but not before the Tech-Priest blessed your shock maul. You’re not sure it actually did anything, but he seemed nice.<br><br>On the way back to Icarus, you could have gotten laid. You didn’t, but you could have. Redmore told you all that the Inquisitor requested your squad continue investigating the murder once you all were back on Icarus, and there might have been some backroom deal made with her in exchange for saving them from the wrath of the Mechanicus(long story, it’s seriously cool now, don’t ask).<br><br>Due to a riot that happened at the Arbites Department of Justice’s prison, your squad split up, and you and Groves arrived at the Icarian Orbital Spire with just Grist and Redmore.

By the order of King Aiden, you were sent into temporary exile to be safe from the Second War.

During the visit Prince Kael’thas suggested more closer cooperation between Kirin Tor and Alterac, while Dalaran rightfully still holds the grudge against your family, the cooperation still could be possible. You also learned about the secrets of the city, the existence of the slums in the sewers made you loathe Kirin Tor. The Underbelly was for them just a tool for them.<br><br>But the visit was successful for you, hiring the goblin Krix Wiklish to be your mechanic and acquiring Raethan, the corrupt Captain of the Guard in Underbelly, as your agent.

33,5481542,,,11/30/22(Wed)21:51:12,Anonymous,Hubert: Dysfunctional Demigod in a Strange Land Quest,"Hubert is not an impressive specimen, with his recessed chin, coke-bottle glasses, and scrawny physique. He has not been successful in his personal life or career. In the twenty eight years of his life, he hasn&#039;t accomplished anything of any importance. None of that matters because Hubert has one thing that makes every difference. The soul of an emperor. Buried beneath his genes and upbringing is the willpower to endure centuries of strife and struggle. He just doesn&#039;t know it yet.<br><br>Far beyond Hubert&#039;s earth, the cosmos is in decay. The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has. Hubert can have between 1, for a sane, slightly flawed man that only has a scrap of strength, and 10, stark raving mad divinity powerful enough to shatter a kingdom.",1669863072,0,Vp4uit9k,,hubert-dysfunctional-demigod-in-a-strange-land,0,239,2,"[{'no': 5491729, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)02:09:13', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<b>Rolled 8 (1d100)<br><br></b><a href=""#p5491670"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491670</a><br><a href=""#p5491704"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491704</a><br>Hubert is not a very patient man.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;-1 Essence, 9/13 Essence</span><br><br>He burns 1 Essence and forces the scroll to reveal its secrets. Now he understands why it was confusing. This scroll was written in a language steeped in the mantle of Silence, a paradox that makes it almost impossible to hear the phonemes of the words to understand them. He or his gem daughter would’ve been able to decipher the scroll but it could’ve taken several months. Hubert knows that Time is important and Chews-In-Quiet would’ve agreed. <br><br>The actual meaning of the scroll takes a few minutes to understand. The beginning of the scroll details the rites of the cult of Chews-In-Quiet, which worshipers used to anoint their souls in the Silence of their maggot goddess. As Hubert reads on, it begins to explain a purer, deeper ritual meant for only the most exalted members of their cult, hand-chosen by their goddess. Hence the maze and guardians. In exchange for the sacrifice of a cultist’s soul, their existence would be hollowed out into a permanent, trancelike state called the Deep Quiet and their bodies and minds would be empowered to enforce the will of their goddess. These Silent Few were able to negate nearby magic, kill nonbelievers with a thought, and even resist hostile divine powers to a degree. <br><br>His divine instincts tell him that although it was intended for mortal cultists, the ritual could be changed and an act of sacrifice performed to grant him the mantle of Silence. Such a profound act would render the ritual impossible for mortals to attempt in the same way as before due to the sheer resonance destroying their soul without the benefit. In theory, a similar ritual could be created or the echo of his ascension removed by the goddess but the effect would remain. The Silence would be a part of him and he would be able to make miracles or create with its power. His divine instincts also tell him that the ritual could be performed and its meaning inverted, taken advantage of, to simply grant him power without the mantle, although power comes with time and the opportunity to gain a mantle is rare indeed. He also knows that the meaning could be twisted to the nature of his soul, granting him any of a few different mantles, but the possibilities are impossible to know and it would require a greater sacrifice. In any event, it is an interesting find.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;1/2</span>', 'time': 1670656153, 'resto': 5481542, 'id': 'Vp4uit9k'}, {'no': 5491731, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)02:17:15', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5491729"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491729</a><br>The particulars of the ritual are so precise and its nature so powerful that a single scroll can’t hold it. There are three more, their locations aren’t hinted at, only their existence, but the scroll radiates such power that Hubert knows he could find them even if he didn’t memorize the pattern of the Essence. He did, however, and he can sense them even now, at an unimaginable distance. One scroll lies in the incredibly distant lair of a beast powerful enough to give even him pause. One scroll lies in a place that doesn’t exist in this mortal time but could be found if he took a specific mountain path in the dead of winter. Lastly, one scroll is in what seems to be a normal castle that actually isn’t very far. Finding them all will be a quest of its own but probably not as repetitive as penetrating the senses of this temple ruin has been.<br><br>If any of Chews-In-Quiet’s cult remains or if, the demigod himself forbid, she is still around, they could find out and try to put a stop to him after the second scroll was taken. Or they could not. There’s just no way to know. Hubert thinks about this and pockets the scroll. Luckily its divine parchment is incredibly durable and doesn’t require any serious precautions to keep safe. He and the others leave the ruin and think about what they’ve found.

So when a rider on a Pegasus made of black smoke landed on one of the towers he cursed the rain and ordered something hot that could appease the delicate palate of a blood elf, like a good red tea while approaching the volcanic core of the place.<br>The master of the dark tower ordered a goblin to announce his master of his return and to request an audience. He was one of the inner circle and knew that his master might be interested by what he has learnt. He was not mistaken, one hour later he was brought to the personnal baths of B&#039;beg the Terrible.<br><br>Even a dark lord of more than 10 000 years needed to bath once in a month.

He was even more pleased when his master ordered two girls (elven maidens who were younger than a century could have been little girls for them) to undress his servant and massage him while he would enter to another hot pool, in front of the one where B&#039;beg was staying. <br><br>-It is a too great honour your malevolent eminence.<br><br>The master of darkness answered his servant.<br><br>-No, I must reward those who do the work themselves instead of relying on stupid and clumsy subordinates. Your devotion to the cause of Evil is remarkable Larion. As I love to say &quot;The best men are those who walk the evil path instead of the easy path.&quot;<br><br>Only a true megalomaniac would quote himself, but this was a necessity of being an evil leader. Larion could only nod respectfully while he was quickly disrobed by the two charming creatures and put into a pool of pleasingly hot water, a great change from the cold rain that would have given him an angine if he wasn&#039;t protected by magic. One of the dark elven beauties, with pale skin and black hair began to massage his shoulders while the second one with dark skin and white hair stroked his long blonde locks to clean them.

With the ascension of the mad god Cyric, Prince of Lies, and the recent return of the tyrant god Bane, Lord of Darkness, the future of Faerûn seems increasingly uncertain. It falls to bold individuals who possess an abundance of cunning, might, and determination to shape the future... should they be up to the challenge.<br><br>The tromping of boots stirs you from your restful slumber as the early evening approaches. Prying you eyelids open, you direct your attention at the ground below your vantage point upon a hefty tree&#039;s branch. The mouth of the muddy cavern vomits forth several gangs of orcs, armed and as barbaric in manner as they have ever been. Inhaling sharply, you stretch your neck and observe as they disperse to go about their duties.<br><br>An unexpected development gives you pause as you are formulating a plan of action. Occasionally, a group of orcs is accompanied by one or two humanoid creatures of remarkable musculature contrasted starkly by their rotund bellies and clumsy movements. You recognize these as ogres; the most diminutive and buffoonish of giantkin. Ogre slaves are the worklizards of Underdark industry, their dumb brawn an invaluable contribution to a multitude of projects.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get. As you were walking off to the closest market you could think of, however, something compelled you to stop. Take it to a safe place, read it and… And… You weren’t sure. Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn’t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don’t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man.

Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet.

Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;What will you do?</span>', 'filename': 'emberbloom', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 230, 'h': 232, 'tn_w': 123, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670166406325092, 'time': 1670166406, 'md5': 'ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==', 'fsize': 7437, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'lnm/GTa9'}, {'no': 5485686, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea', 'time': 1670168397, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'OHAWgWLt'}, {'no': 5485828, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers', 'time': 1670181491, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'qHCPuy7I'}, {'no': 5486015, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485828"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1', 'time': 1670192389, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'E+RiA0+u'}, {'no': 5486052, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

You&#039;ve always wanted to be an adventurer. And for that single reason, you woke up this day.

For now you&#039;d have to trust that they would do the right thing.

For the past few days, you refused to do exactly that, instead staying to the confines of your home. Not like anyone has noticed, otherwise they would have checked up on why you were absent after the second or third day. If they would&#039;ve noticed they surely must&#039;ve by now, with daily attendance and all. Your parents would have something to say about this if they weren&#039;t away on business all the time, though the school should have their number and would&#039;ve called by now, so either they know and let it happen, or the school neglected to even inform them. Either way, works for you. <br><br>Were you going to attend again? Eh, maybe when you feel like it. Being able to sleep in on weekdays should not be a luxury relegated to the holidays. Though it did get boring after everything just lost its appeal. Funny, you think of doing something, only for it to end up less enticing once endless opportunity presents itself. Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today. There&#039;s a hobby shop on the other side of the city, one you didn&#039;t know was even there. Granted, you never looked either, having expected nothing to be in the vicinity, but it&#039;s somewhere to check out. <br><br>You woke up early, just for this morning. The trip over will take a couple of hours by public transportation, and that&#039;s assuming it runs on time, which you just know it won’t. You throw on a random shirt and some pants and prepare breakfast. Normally you never get the time to do this, having to prepare some more for school as well as just wanting to get in every minute of sleep you could. Being able to sit down and eat, instead of having to buy something to go on the way, or gulf down something hurriedly.

You almost took this as an insult, but since he threw in a free polybag kit, you decide to just take it in good faith this time. Now what?

Seeing as that was one of the first stations of the district, there wasn’t another you could take a train at, at least one that’ll get you closer to home. This was a distance nobody really wants to walk, so the ill-used walkways on the bridge’s side sees its first pedestrian in you. As you were on the side where the accident should be, the road on your side is much more vacant, basically drip feeding cars from the one lane you see is unaffected. <br><br>On a whim, you look up, expecting to just see the skyline, but there was someone just standing on the upper structures of the bridge as well. You have no reason to think why someone would be up there, but at the same time, no reason to question it either. Whoever it was though, didn’t take kindly to being noticed. Something was flying your way, and the figure leapt off out of sight. On instinct, you skipped back, the object pinning itself down where you just were. It’s… Strangely familiar to you.

However, before the war I spent much of my adult life studying at a university in Auriluçon.

Having learned of that, Claudia and Klaus resolved to ensure the justice is served with their direct personal participation - painfully aware of precarious position of the Alliance between Olga&#039;s monstrous horde and the mercenary army that was meant to be the decisive force, now turned out to be another enemy.

Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=""mu-b"">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing. You listen carefully, but it all bleeds together, like some sort of fast-forwarded movie. Still, your serenity remains with you. Just looking at the aqua-eyed beauty is enough to keep you happy.<br><br>---<br><br>Meryl proposed to you only recently- Which would have been odd enough, as far as you were concerned, until she explained why: It was now or never, at least until you showed up.<br><br>She&#039;s got demi-human physiology, some kind of fish-woman, and her father is a magician. Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fiancée cares about you. And you definitely care about her.

I use Project instead of Quest because you, the players, are going to control a civilization from nomadic hunter-gatherers to a massive empire instead of a traditional story-driven quest. The only story here will be an emergent one that concerns the history of an ever-growing population of people and the struggles they face throughout the ages. Eventually, at the end of the project, a fully fleshed-out world will have emerged.<br><br>You, the anons of /qst/ will not be the only ones controlling a civilization. For the last several months, I have been running this project with individual players controlling their own civilizations on a randomly-generated fantasy world of my design. The game is played out in a series of ages, in which players experience random events, are given the choice to perform a number of actions of their desire, and progress along technological and magical trees. Much like in a Civilization-style game, once each player has finished their actions for an age, all players advance to the next era and the cycle continues.<br><br>I have decided to allow you, the anonymous players of /qst/, in on the project, now that we are about ten ages into the world&#039;s history. You will be playing the game alongside my players, eventually interacting with them through the lens of these threads. You will vote on everything that happens to your civilization, which will be the only one in this game with more than one person controlling it and the only anonymously-controlled society. Once we catch up to where my others players are located in the timeline, we shall postpone the game until the next age, at which point I will make another thread.<br><br>This is going to be a long-form game, and may not be akin to traditional civ-style quest threads on this board.",1668914606,0,bXUpy8V0,,untamed-civilization-project-1,0,1280,146,"[{'no': 5486654, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)10:15:38', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Yeah, although I&#039;ll be hatin on Ratfolk allday erryday I won&#039;t stand for discriminating vampires who have been nothing but Bros!', 'time': 1670253338, 'resto': 5468991, 'id': 'Y3OUnIzB'}, {'no': 5486657, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)10:19:17', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Ratfolk are too culturally different.

A cavalry charge against defended position, on sandy uphill, looks a tad foolish. The arrows alone should diminish their effectiveness and waste manpower. Then again, if he is Thona&#039;s bloodline, he may have tricks up his sleeve.

Something between feeling, tasting and smelling? You mostly feel the musky aura of Lionel with it, most others leaving a faint trace of cinnamon. You also feel, even from back here the metallic tasting swirling energy vortex inside the tent that has Thona in the middle. You focus this new sense in front of you. The men feel mostly the same as the nomads near you. Except Astor. He feels different. He tastes like rotten meat? Or maybe it is his armor that has this taste, the man inside feels cold and saffron. The more you try to feel it, the more you can make out the difference. This man may be near physical perfection and wear some kind of special armor, but he is no mage, you&#039;re almost certain of it.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;73...74...</span><br><br>And now that you look around, you see sharpened poles laying around from the earlier battle.

A spikewall like that was how the ancients stopped cavalry charges, you thnk. Roughly 3 and a half minutes...

Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge.

So far that’s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto’s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn’t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone’s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You’re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei’s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>“Raiton: Raiden!”<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto’s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. “Multi-shadow clone!”<br><br>He can’t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you’ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn’t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto’s counterpunch in the chin there’s a moment of shock on your cousin’s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn’t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone’s back.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;1/2</span>",1668484186,0,yd1zDu14,,shinobi-sidestory-quest-44,0,158,0,"[{'no': 5490973, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)13:54:40', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5490957"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5490957</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;I&#039;d prefer if we didn&#039;t have to fight like that, but we don&#039;t have much choice in the matter.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

So, I’m going to have to put a stop to that.” <br> <br>“How unfortunate, it seems like we have to tussle with this young maiden, cladded in revealing warrior garbs.” The Gentleman Ghost laments, casually shrugging as he begins to float to Nocturna. <br> <br>“It matters not, with the Sepher Rezial Hemelach in our grasp, we can just beckon your undead friends to assist us.” Tapping at the grimoire, Nocturna cocks a confident, sultry smile to the specter. Revealing her sharpened elongated canines in the process. <br> <br>“Sound like a plan, meanwhile I’ll knock the socks off of her for the undead to finish off.” With a tap of his staff, the gentleman&#039;s ghost suddenly disappears. Vanishing without a trace, the specter would place himself directly behind you lickety-split. Before he could deliver the staggering blow, you would quickly disappear from his sight. “What the deuce?!” <br> <br>As swiftly as you disappeared, you reappear right beside Gentleman Ghost’s blind spot, quickly grabbing his shoulder with a toothy smile. “You’re not the only one who can teleport. Though in this case, it was just high-speed movement. ~” Grabbing him tightly on the shoulder, astonishing the specter in the process you quickly clock Gentleman’s Ghost in the face. <br> <br>Nocturna watching this couldn’t help but be bewildered by the silvery white-haired virago in front of her. “Well, I’ll be damned, clearly we’re dealing with someone who is either capable of interacting with the astral or is a virgin.” <br><br>Pulling himself up in an unsettling windup doll fashion, the Gentleman Ghost merely brushes his outfit. “This one certainly packs a punch. If I wasn’t already dead, I’d swear that punch would’ve knocked my head off.” He remarks, turning his attention back to you. “So, which is it? I want to say the former &#039;cause there’s no way someone dressed like you would be a virgin.” <br><br>Con', 'filename': 'image_2022-12-10_012912393', 'ext': '.png', 'w': 1040, 'h': 694, 'tn_w': 125, 'tn_h': 83, 'tim': 1670653756181871, 'time': 1670653756, 'md5': '9ZOnrCAEDdHkr81ePprOrw==', 'fsize': 1358641, 'resto': 5458625, 'id': 'KI2TAcHu'}, {'no': 5491724, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)02:01:14', 'name': 'MarutaQM', 'com': '<a href=""#p5491706"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491706</a><br>Before Gentleman’s Ghost would get the chance to make a counter, you gritted your feline-like teeth before clinching your fist tightly. With a single pounce, you quickly close the distance between you and Gentleman’s ghost. Striking with tremendous speed and explosive force, the Gentleman Ghost found himself once again blind-sighted by your ferocious assault. Not even giving him a chance to teleport or attempt to phase through by ghosting. “I am a virgin you archaic asshole!” You bellowed, acting more like a beast than a woman. <br> <br>Noctura meanwhile let out a small chuckle before presuming to reach for the grimoire. “Let’s not be resorted to using our trump card thanks to your prophesied return to life early now, Craddock.” Just as Nocturna was beginning to recite a spell from the book, a robin-like grappling hook quickly wraps around the tomb. With a single tug, it would deeply wrap around the book before being yanked from the podium and into the darkness. “Tsc.” <br> <br>You knew that Robin was the one who did that as you chose not to blow his cover by screaming words of praise. Instead, you focused on continuing to lay another smackdown on Gentleman’s Ghost as he was trying to bounce back from the dizzying stupor your heavy blows were causing him. As a ghost, it would only be natural that he would boast a highly durable astral body. Doubly so with whatever empowerment he was receiving that currently has yet to make its appearance. At the same time, he would find himself at the backfoot as you were still stronger by more than a fair margin. <br><br>“Change of plans, you go grab the book from our crafty thief and I’ll handle this powerhouse here.” Nocturna barked, stabbing herself with her claws, hitting specific acupuncture points on her body. As a result, she would begin to swell up like a balloon, but rather than getting more bloated with a rotund body. The vampiric diva instead starts packing some serious meat as she was bulking up. A mixture of shapeshifting and doping was the main source for her now hulking amazon body. <br> <br>“Holy crap...” You uttered, looking at the statuesque stunner as she came charging at you like a speeding bullet train. Having just enough time to catch her into a grapple as you firmly anchor yourself to the ground. Keeping yourself from moving an inch while simultaneously wrestling with the supped-up strength of the vampire. “You know, I don’t recall vampires being able to do something like this.” <br> <br>Con', 'filename': 'image_2022-12-10_015354499', 'ext': '.png', 'w': 520, 'h': 1064, 'tn_w': 61, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670655674179586, 'time': 1670655674, 'md5': 'U9XJi45vS0QWonahQJ7rAQ==', 'fsize': 605828, 'resto': 5458625, 'id': 'KI2TAcHu'}, {'no': 5491732, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)02:19:59', 'name': 'MarutaQM', 'com': '<a href=""#p5491724"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491724</a><br>“Believe me, I’m well versed in all of the myths foretold about the creatures of the night. But unlike them, I’m willing to get experimental and go for a more modern depiction.” Nocturna remarks, exerting more of her supernatural strength in the exchange, living up to the monster moniker. All the while holding you in place with this tug of war to let Gentleman Ghost recover fully. “That being said, I could go for quite the hearty snack and virgin blood most certainly taste the sweetest.” Nocturna smiled. <br> <br>Gritting your teeth, you let out a mighty roar in protest, exerting more strength to try and overpower her. As well as jerking your body around to avoid Nocturna’s well-timed bites. “Sorry, I might look positively tantalizing for a five-course meal, but I’m not on the menu.” <br> <br>Having regained his composure, Gentleman Ghost simply recalls his cane back to him. Tapping his jewel accessory to morph the device’s bottom into a flintlock-style barrel gun. “Sounds good to me.” Aiming where he believed the Boy Wonder was located, Gentleman Ghost prepared to launch a mighty blast of spectral fire. <br> <br>Catching him in the act, however, you jerk your head forward toward the flight path of the upcoming attack. With a mighty inhale, you pulled the attack directly at you with the force of a vacuum space. The powerful suction was enough to siphon the spectral fire completely into your mouth. Sucking all of its essences down with deep, loud gulps as Gentleman Ghost tried firing more blasts. Every one of them met the same fate. All the while you kept Nocturna from acting with your vice-iron grip locking hands with hers. As such, the vampire wouldn’t be to stop your retaliation as you let out a mighty shockwave at Gentleman Ghost. Masking the burp as a bellowing howl towards your adversary. <br> <br>“Well, don’t that beat all.” Gentleman Ghost mutters, not even mad at the brilliant display of oral tricks as he was hit head-on with the attack. Having just enough time to shield himself from the brunt of the blow but getting knocked back a considerable distance. <br> <br>Seeing this happen in real-time, Nocturna lunges forward to finally take the opportunity and sink her fangs into you. But as she does so, she would find her sharpened fangs unable to puncture the dense, rubbery flesh. She would find herself currently stuck around your jugular vein as your muscles clench tightly around her vampiric canines. “This is ridiculous!

I’ll make you regret taunting a creature of the night, especially when you’re on my home-field advantage.” Nocturna growl, her sclera becoming pitch black as her eyes glow ominously.

Violence is unending, war is but a constant reality, In the grim darkness of the future, your life is already dictated by the Imperium of Man. But one can try, and try as you will. You are but a mere human, incapable of shaping the galaxy, even your fate and thoughts are not yours to command. In this grim dark future, you are Alethia Amadeus, Undersecretary Of The Adeptus Administratum, a rank below the Master Of The Administratum and a rank created just for you. <br><br>Your responsibility is to oversee all the divisions of the Administratum, from the smallest matters like record-keeping, to authorizing what supplies go to whom, there is never an easy day for you.

Madam Undersecretary?” <br><br>“Please.”<br><br>At least when you were on a pleasure planet, you were given the luxury you deserved. You retrieve your quill from the pile of parchment to sign off some documents. Supplies here, weapons there, construction approval there. All in all, it was a productive day. Of course, it was, this is you after all. When have you ever failed in your perfect life? You gently swirl the amber liquid in the crystal chalice. The wind was blowing gently, and the sun was just at the right temperature.

As the adepts entered Veteran-Sergeant Feratu stood in front of the door, stopping any more adepts to enter. <br><br>Testatus came to your side. <br><br>“You need to rest Madame.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (兽诏书为高达-人类形式, Shòuzhàoshūwèigāodá-Rénlèixíngshì.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter.

Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Before the Nauk the continent was naught but chaos, and the order of conquest united the stricken, barbaric land. A thousand years after the landings of Sversk the Conqueror, the last strained ties holding the Nauk Imperial together fell apart, but all would remember the Nauk Imperial being the beginning of history- and the inheritors of its glory, proud to call themselves the first of Vinstragan men.<br><br>The southern country of Vynmark claims a part of this lost glory, successors of the Nauk as both princes of the land, and lords of the sea, the latter which has made them exceptionally wealthy in recent times as the goods of the newly opened east flow around the isolationist Twaryi and through the greedy and unquestioning merchants of Vynmark’s shores, overseen by the noble Landgrafs and their high courts. Confident atop their enormous wealth, and their subjects content to feed off the succulent scraps of luxury, Vynmark has found itself ill prepared for the rapid change of today’s world…<br><br>Our generation was meant to know nothing but peace.<br><br>Vynmark was safe, and prosperous. Not without its flaws, but it was set apart from the rest of Vinstraga. From the world, Velekam. For decades, we knew nothing such as war, as battle, not in the heart of Vynmark, where the sun’s glow and the sea mist scattered fairy-blooms all about hills and plains that never knew the smell of blood. We believed that our ancestors had won us this idyll, and that we were meant to do naught but enjoy it, whilst whomever wished to play at war would never see something like the whispered-of yet so far off brutality of the rest of the continent.<br><br>Soon enough, we found that we had not earned peace in our lives.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=""mu-i"">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=""mu-i"">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them.

Their objective was to reclaim them from a mysterious horror which had rallied the primitive, monkey-like ‘ghouls’ who picked at their dead into a terrifying and organized horde. Nobody knew quite who or what this mysterious adversary was, but those who had survived encounters with the feral beasts described some sort of ‘Ghoul Supreme’ egging the lesser creatures on.<br><br>At the elven militia’s head was no Drow noble, but reptilian foreigner of monstrous description: a lizardman called ‘Theral’ for his shining, coppery hide. Those elves who guarded the borders and patrolled the far reaches beyond the eyes of Wevenore’s nobility whispered tales of this dreadful being’s exploits. <br><br>They said that he had slain the Devourer, a great king-slayer of the westernmost caverns, and that he had subdued and subjugated the ancient and shapeless Shoggoth with his own two hands. <br><br>They said he spoke like an elven poet—that he could soothe the heart of any elfman or elfmaid with his rumbling polemics to peace, and stir any elf or animal to righteous fury with his fiery sermons to war. Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old—mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some—the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors—spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some—the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat—regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill… Well, that remained to be seen.",1667183641,0,CQjyTS+o,,dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6,0,517,68,"[{'no': 5485432, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)04:07:23', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485165"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485165</a><br>can we deal with necromancer on the way out?', 'time': 1670144843, 'resto': 5448278, 'id': 'tV5YrKmF'}, {'no': 5485561, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)07:51:02', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485409"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485409</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Ghouls and dogbolds</span><br>[Dogbolds/ghouls are a mysterious collective of mostly-hairless, albinistic baboon-things.

And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

124,5444794,,,10/27/22(Thu)11:28:42,TrashQM,Space Peon Wrecker Quest,"Earlier today, you had an unscheduled heart attack. And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren’t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=""mu-i"">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren’t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don’t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been … well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here – except those in the Belly, of course – are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won’t make trustee, won’t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>“Alright, you are back within safe parameters.” <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>“On dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I’ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won’t bother reading it unless you tell them to.” <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic … but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>“In consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

You know MagiPol is known to operate in strange ways, but this is a bit ridiculous.<br><br>Your name is Arthur Roland. You’re a 25 year old detective, well, ex-detective now. Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson’s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn’t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types. But eventually, all you received was a phone call directing you to a rooftop overlooking a bunch of warehouses in downtown Austin, Texas. <br><br>And to “procure critical ordinance, then wait for instructions.”<br><br>The ordinance in question was a stylish black full-body suit and helmet, perfectly fitting your form. As soon as you settled in, the helmet lit up with a display, and a prerecorded message.<br><br>“WELCOME, MARVELOUS BLACK.”<br><br>You’d only heard passing rumors of the Marvelous Rangers, a covert anti-terror group that did missions all around the world. Speculation was abound. Were they vigilantes? Terrorists themselves, perhaps? <br><br>Nope.

She has a penchant for this.”<br><br>Your words in support of the exchange harrows her resolve. She begins to shrink into her own shoulders. “B-but, it isn’t right that someone else should suffer this.

However, hers takes a different shape. Much more subtle…” You move your hand in smooth, flat circles over the crest of Izurin’s head. “One of an azure stillness that, for better and for worse, drowns her own suffering. But it also is easily disrupted because of the sensitivities all Elin carry.” You settle your hand again and lightly rub the top of the azure form, kicking up small wisps from her aura. “Exterior pain is augmented. She especially feels the suffering of those she connects with even stronger than they feel it. Pain from another are stones plunging into that stillness creating disruptive waves.”<br><br>“She wouldn’t inherently suffer here, but she would suffer to leave someone here…” Sayazade silently gazes upon Izurin’s form, reckoning with this new revelation.<br><br>You close your eyes in satisfaction of the vampyr’s words as you hear Alys shuffle restlessly as she tries to find words to support an argument that she’s losing grasp on herself.', 'time': 1670669492, 'resto': 5443579, 'id': 'HiLKlBqc', 'trip': '!TidesHQn0s'}, {'no': 5491856, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:00:13', 'name': 'Hien', 'com': '<a href=""#p5491853"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5491853</a><br><br>You open your eyes to continue. “In a selfish selfless way, she’s doing what she thinks is right, and what she knows she can do best…” You gently transfer the clinging nascent goddess to Izurin’s grasp before calmly approaching Alys. “You’ve more than earned the right act in the same way.” You rest your hands upon her tense shoulders. “While she stays safe here to pacify Thera-Yuugoth, you can possibly reclaim your gifts to help me and others beyond this realm, and…” You transfer a hand of yours to your chest. “If nothing else, you can help me with Rynna. When I told you that your murder left such significant trauma in her, I sensed that you wanted to help her. But you had already accepted your position within Thera-Yuugoth. Now things can be different… but only if you’re willing to take what we all know to be the best course of action.”<br><br>“Rynna…” Alys shudders heavily, unable to speak.<br><br>Your animal ears catch the sound of significant movement from within the sea cave, but not directed toward you.

The decision now lies with you.” You gently squeeze her shoulder before turning back to Izurin and the nascent goddess. “This one…”<br><br>You take the chance to study the form that Thera-Yuugoth takes within her own fleshscape. Putting aside her nearly translucent skin and nonsensical arrangement of visible organs underneath, most would see her reflecting an Elin, which is certainly aligns with significant portions of her appearance. Yet, there’s traces of something undeniably human within her. <br><br>Elin composed the tissue of her brain with their memories are indelible etched between its folds, and Humans reared the growing flesh god. Both have contributed images for her to unconsciously reflect while she is yet unthinking. <br><br>Thought may slowly arise following the reunification, and if so, it would largely reflect the thoughts of those Elin woven into her being.

She smiles subtly as she turns her azure gaze between Alys, then Thera-Yuugoth, and then you.

But now is the time leave this accursed land with those you can yet save.<br><br>“It’s time for us to depart.” You first turn toward the vampyr who’s quickly fading from the fleshscape. “See if southern docks allow for approach. If not, draw anchor further south and we’ll meet you and your servants on along the shore.”<br><br>Not the most detailed of instructions, but time is severely limited. <br><br>“I eagerly look forward to our meeting, Elewyn of the Holy Light, and whatever may come afterward…” Her voice becomes a faint whisper as she departs first form the fleshscape.<br><br>“Alys…” Your tone conveys the finality of the moment, and that there’s no more time for deliberation.<br><br>Her mouth quivers as she tries to speak, and her gaze is cast low and away from Izurin. However, a slow nod signals her answer. “Take me with you…” <br><br>You push away any feelings of melancholy growing in sympathy for the two Elin, and instead hurriedly move to take Alys within your arms. You can feel your presence within the fleshscape further weakening. “Think of nothing but Izurin’s body, its physical form, and your own memories of having a body.

And his dying words drove countless souls to the seas.<br>&quot;You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything I gathered together in one place. Now you just have to find it!&quot;<br><br>The Pirate Kings words ring in your ears as you break away from Mama after the last clash the entire cake covered town, or at least those who have not managed to evacuate the area yet gawk at Big Mom. After all that fighting and all the destruction that you&#039;ve wrought finally there is tangible proof that what you&#039;re doing isn&#039;t futile. The Emperor bleeds. After all the effort you put into it you managed to deal genuine damage to her and not just something surface level. She can be hurt! She can be beaten! This thought that you already knew deep down spreads through the crowd and burrows into the minds of even her children, no matter how heretical they may think it is.<br><br>None of them has ever seen their mom struggle, let alone be hurt by someone. They thought they were invincible, their strength infallible. More than the legions of homies that your men have destroyed and more than all the bruises they received, this lone act managed to dampen their morale. Now there is room for doubt. And like a festering wound its taint spreads quickly. Now the Big Mom Pirates no longer have the certainty of victory.<br><br>And that&#039;s not all. The Silver Pirates may be tired. They may have given themselves a handicap by not using lethal attacks and they may be outnumbered. But now their fervor builds. Like sharks in the water they can smell the blood and know what it means. Murray roars to his fellows.<br>&quot;SILVERS!

As the fog clears, you sort through your recent memories with the tentative dread of a man checking for bombs in his mailbox. You remember nearly finishing the bottle of Jameson by yourself, and you remember taking the pills. You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell.

A conflict between empires? A mistake? Ultimately it doesn&#039;t matter, the shining towers of old won&#039;t be restored to their former glory when someone figures out what caused their destruction.<br><br>You come from a relatively prosperous town called Safford, home to a population of no more than 500. The people here owe their meager wealth to an active coal mine in town, a source of power and heat that they trade with others. You however, have nothing to do with the coal mining business of your community.<br><br>All your life you&#039;ve been a scavenger; picking over the remains of the old world in search of all the things your community needed but couldn&#039;t produce; medicine, ammunition primers, electrical components, engine parts. It is thankless work, despite the importance of these goods you never receive anything more than a pittance.<br>That begs the question; why do you put up with it? What made you turn to this lifestyle in the first place? (This will determine your starting gear and your relationship with the townsfolk. Basic gear is a gas mask + leather satchel)<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You&#039;ve always been the sort that looks for trouble, you were not meant for the mines like your friends. When the opportunity arose you sold all your knick knacks for a gun and volunteered to become one of the town&#039;s scavengers.

One Two rode the car without the headlamps’ assisting brightness over the park’s overgrown meadow grass and covered in crusty branches broken by the wind. One Two had turned away from you and instead looked onto the path faint from the yawning morning. To access the Retiree Park with a car was illegal, but it was also not meant for them. He drove you through bogs and fields and only infrequently used the paths and trails on the way to the semi-cemetery’s exit. Unlike Mary’s pride—her taxicab—the automobile didn’t wobble, convulse, or fling the seats up or down as rode away.<br><br>Instead of smashing through the fog, the luminous clouds rolled over the car like welcoming bedsheets. With only an inch or less of a margin between the brick stone pillars and the width of the automobile, One Two passed through the exit arch and cruised into the two-lined road. He held the wheel with a weak grip. He checked you, the outlandish watch on his wrist illuminating only his arm and a small part of his shoulder. He motioned to the notebook with his hand.<br><br>“Anything else you can tell me about ‘Cass’, Elmer Briant?”<br><br>You had to speak irrelevant half-truths. “She can change the shape of her body, but it’ll still remain gelatinous and orange.”<br><br>He waited until you, surrounded by the veneer, wrote that in the notebook … to the best of your ability, as scribbles you couldn’t even see anymore in the dark interior. <br><br>“How did you manage to keep the thing’s form a secret as you moved through the town?”<br><br>“I found her a dress” —Mary’s groan was furlong yet loud— “and a lid to cheese it. It worked well when it was still the middle of the night.”<br><br>“And that thing had this dress and hat on it as it got away from you?”<br><br>Your fingers sank into your thigh as you grit your teeth. “She did, it was a white dress, and I gave her a cloche hat.”<br><br>The automobile came to a complete yet fluent stop before the red bleeding traffic light. One Two hung his gaze in front of the road, the three-coloured brass cone several feet above unimportant to him as if he already knew when it was going to turn green. A few seconds after, he was forced to raise his head. <br><br>The suspended ceiling sky cracked and the grey paint fell to reveal the brilliant cream-white beneath the facade. Companionless lighting flashed and shattered the clouds. It lasted a couple of seconds and then the sombre overhang rumbled to close the crack. Beneath the same cloud, a small dot, shimmering like a polar star, was descending.<br><br>You heard One Two’s glove crease and creak. His grip tightened.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept. But I have no idea what makes Cass appealing, what you saw in her or what the MC saw in her. She was just a random blob, a slime, that did random things for no rhyme or reason. What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.
