2,5489400,,,12/07/22(Wed)21:09:26,Koku,Dragon Ball Origins #1,"Welcome to another Dragon Ball Quest thematically named Dragon Ball Origins™. This is inspired by the original DBO but also a play on DB Online as it will be taking many pieces from there. We&#039;ll be playing a Youthful upstart in the world of Dragon Ball and their involvement in many of the series&#039; iconic events. Although we will be going through the Original DB and perhaps beyond, this quest will be taking elements from multiple interpretations (Kakarot, Jaco, etc.) and adjusting them accordingly to fit a cohesive narrative. As well as incorporating other related works from the Toriyamaverse.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Who do we play specifically?</span><br>A Character named Pinich/Pinchi depending on the choice below. A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline.

Focusing your gaze right back on your right arm, and soon your left leg, and so forth. Bit by bit you examine yourself some more, letting your brain try and figure out the mystery as to why you felt so disquietude to the point of discontent. The angel was right that your performance wasn’t satisfying for you. Naturally, you knew you could do better despite not having actual training and the bare minimum of guidance. You’re the ultimate lifeform, the living embodiment of the supreme being, such was to be expected from you. <br> <br>However, it wasn’t the source of your disquietude, only the symptom of it. Something was wrong, and you couldn’t put your finger on it. At first, the feeling was dull and muddy, not something worth paying an iota of attention to. Upon unleashing your ki and reigning in the ferocious life energy, it was becoming more apparent that something was off. <br><br>As a highly advanced mechanical being, it was to be expected that your organic properties would far exceed any Machine Mutant’s composition. It was safe to say that your biomechanical structure extended to the cellular level rather than the tissue level. Far surpassing the fusion of synthetic organic tissue built around various cybernetic implants that most Machine Mutant and Bio-Androids were tailored with. Hence the living metal aspect that made up your amorphous physique and passed off as an organic lifeform. Yet you could tell from the exposure that your biomass and bio-essence far exceeded even what you should logically be capable of—diving into microscopic unification and synchronization. <br><br>A true, natural amalgamation of inorganic cybernetics and organic matter beyond imagination. The synthetic organic tissues had been altered to be no different from purely organic constructs. The fact you held a navel which is indicative of an umbilical cord, implying your germination came from an otherworldly, natural womb than the synthetic version from the incubation tank speaks volumes alone. If you choose to, you could fully envelop your metallic, mechanical form with a fully organic exoskeleton or fully convert yourself to that flesh and blood. With the reverse for both ends being possible too. <br><br>Giving way to achieving a level of bionics that surpasses even the best Tsufruian science and engineering can muster. Which in retrospect is impressive in itself when put into perspective. Their biological systems are streamlined and minimalized for efficiency as well as optimization. Further maximized by various cybernetic implants incorporated to boost physical and mental capabilities, dependent upon desired functions. So, for you to exceed that with cybernetics that is beyond full understanding while having a fully functioning organ system of a human being. It was simply unheard of, even with the best organic circuitry around.', 'time': 1670760083, 'resto': 5489400, 'id': 'p/s8vl0p'}, {'no': 5493098, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)07:03:31', 'name': 'Koku', 'com': '<a href=""#p5493097"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5493097</a><br>All of that you could be eased into without distress, it just made you all the more assured of your duality between man and machine. The problem was the genetic template that you were currently feeling through your presence. It was still Tsufruian through and through, but there was another source mixed within. A source that would honestly be sacrilegious to your ancestors and/or creators. Thus, you were inclined to believe it was a mistake or a lapse in judgment. The more you ponder about it, the more certain that the facts point to the singular truth. You just needed to confirm it. <br> <br>“Whis.” You calmly called, dropping your hand to rest at your side. “You are correct that I am feeling a tinge of frustration. At first, I thought it was because I wasn’t living up to my expectations. But the more I pondered, the truth came closer to the light. I’m not just bio-mechanical/technorganic aren’t I.” <br> <br>“It would appear so. When taken in by Super Shenron, the wish must have changed you down to the definitive source in myriad ways. Whether you were born or capable of having a soul prior, you most certainly do now. As well as a body that’s truly a hybrid of technological and biological components unified into a single entity. It seems you can choose to take either a fully mechanical or organic lifeform composition. Though it seems it’s the natural state for you is to remain in your hybrid state from what I can tell. Combining the best precision functionality in machines with the myriad adaptability present within living tissue.” Whis chirpily explained. “I’m getting the feeling that in some way, it ended up invoking your primal desires into the mix.” <br> <br>“If only being a Biodroid; a living, breathing, pulsating cluster of living and non-biological micromachines was the reason that I’m at a loss. Because you are right since I can tell my programming that I’m essentially capable of possessing organic matter and siphoning its biomass and essence to strengthen and develop my physical body. But as you mentioned, I don’t need to evoke such microscopic parasitic abilities to achieve my developed form. I couldn’t be happier since an ultimate lifeform shouldn’t need an inferior body to take refuge in to develop accordingly.” You rhetorically answer, practically reiterating what Whis mentioned but putting your thoughts on it as well. <br> <br>“So, what is it that troubles you,” Whis asks.', 'time': 1670760211, 'resto': 5489400, 'id': 'p/s8vl0p'}, {'no': 5493101, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)07:11:10', 'name': 'Koku', 'com': '<a href=""#p5493098"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5493098</a><br> <br>Pausing for a bit until you gain the nerve to ask, you look Whis directly in the eyes before speaking. Taking a more severe expression upon your face. “Whis, why do I sense the essence of a Saiyan within me?” <br> <br>“Because there is. The biomass and energy of the proud, warrior race reside within you, courtesy of Beerus’s wish. It seems his subconscious desire really does yearn to fight a Saiyan God. I thought it was a fleeting whim like eating dinosaur meat or playing hide and seek on King Kai’s planet. But like with this idol business I should’ve taken it more seriously.” Whis nods, musing over the paradox that stands before him. “There&#039;s quite possibly more given your explanation about your parasitic abilities and again the nebulous nature of the wish. But for now, you’re just as much of a full-blooded Saiyan as you are a Tsufruian. And that cognitive dissonance between the two is precisely why you’re struggling to tap into your full capability.” <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Break into a fit of laughter as you unleash the full extent of your aura.

Having just reunited with your fellow Shangralans and Astartes sons, whom have traveled the webway alongside your Beloved Emerald Lotus blossom, Kanzeon, and her sister, Anahita, to reinforce Angron&#039;s own every growing army of former gladiators and slaves, you noticed your followers amongst the Aeldari race were keeping a distance between themselves and your once enslaved brothers. Seeking answers from Noble Carys and valorous Folant, you learned the truth of how your brother was made a slave to begin with and the role the ever prophecy chasing Aeldari of the craftworlds played in it in their attempt to avert the dread future they beheld.<br><br>So, as you are not a simpleton who blames the world for one the ill deeds of the few, you decided it would be best for Angron to know of the truth of his capture and the cause for his attempted assassination, in the pursuit of bringing peace to his mind and preventing any misunderstandings or resentment from arising between him and the fair Aeldair, because of the misguided and foolish actions of those sycophants of destiny. After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens. And you know that as well as you know that those whom are different are often held with unwarranted suspicion and mistrust.<br><br>Which is why it is best to reveal the truth to your brother and introduce him to Aeldari whom are not distant and deserving of said mistrust.<br><br>&quot;And who better than myself and Folant&quot; Carys says jauntily, as the more dour ranger marches at your side &quot;To prove that not all of our people are apathetic to the plight of humanity, or retain the overwrought sense of pride that lead us to ruin&quot;<br>Cont",1670495207,0,RBVYiFdu,,the-2nd-primarch-quest-22,0,51,0,"[{'no': 5492525, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)18:42:42', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5492431"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5492431</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;With the Night Crane stance, stand still, and wait for Angron to begin his attack, and see if the style works on other Primarchs</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Go full out brother, For nothing less will be an insult to us both.</span>', 'time': 1670715762, 'resto': 5489667, 'id': 'Wu+37BIZ'}, {'no': 5492645, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)21:02:40', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'It just occurred to me that the mechanicus might have been a massive engineering club that got co-opted by a religious zealot....

A soulless sort of blandness which almost escaped your notice, everything in ordered rows and careful geometric displays - there’s nothing natural or flowing to any of it, no true life. Other than the guards keeping watch along the entrances to the estate, and the gardeners that tend the plots, you doubt anyone ever visits them.

We’re clear to talk for a few minutes.”<br><br>Following his gaze toward the guardhouses you quickly come to the same conclusion. Your eyesight has always been a little better than his, but he’s not wrong - it’s difficult to tell much from this distance, but the green uniformed guards stationed along the distant fence don&#039;t seem to be watching the three of you right now.",1670700702,0,KWuoNayv,,mobile-suit-gundam-quest-2,0,41,3,"[{'no': 5492816, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)23:29:02', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5492811"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5492811</a><br>Blanche isn&#039;t a kuudere.

Most of the old world died, and those few that remained had to remain in the old Burrows for over a century. Your parents&#039; generation was the first to emerge from the Burrows, and they set up the scrap-states and the Laws of Blood you know today, so that the wars from the old world would never occur again. No, people, food, and fuel were simply too rare for such wasteful wars. Instead, the duels and the scrap knights came to be, using what Eldertech mechs that could be scavenged to engage in personal combat to resolve conflict on behalf of their scrap states. <br><br>Now, with tensions rising among the scrap lords and more and more Duels of Honor and Duels of Blood being declared, the need for scrap knights is greater than ever. Your father and your father’s father pledged their ancestral Eldertech mech to the scrap lord of Scarlet Barrows, a small but wealthy scrap nation.

And with the largest threat to the PTO destroyed, their remnants scattered across space, the universe has been united under one banner. Peace reigns across the galaxy, under the rule of Lord Freeza, Emperor of the Universe. But not all wish it to be this way. Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge. Despite this newfound age of peace swiftly spreading across the stars, there are those who would seek its end. Will you be able to stop them, or shall the universe once more be plunged into the fires of war?<br><br>Welcome to Saiyan Conqueror Quest! This story takes place in an alternate timeline within the greater Dragonball EU. You the players control Karn: once an ordinary Saiyan warrior with a meager powerlevel of 2,830 who has risen to become a mighty Berserker Super Saiyan, and so much more. Throughout your many adventures, the “Dragon of New Salda” has grown into the symbol of Saiyan might and power, widely recognized across the universe as Freeza&#039;s close friend and confidant, not to mention his right hand man and General of his forces.

It’s been a while since you’ve been in the building, but you have no idea what floor you’re on, let alone where the rest of your unit is. Additionally, and more concerningly, you’re not sure how long you’ve been incapacitated.

All the while during the revolt, the Planetary Governor asked for more troops from Icarus, and more time to meet the Tithe from the Administratum.<br><br>From his correspondence alone, the culprit and motives seemed much more straightforward. A rebel snuck into the stubborn and unyielding Governor’s estate to strike a decisive blow against a callous despot. The theory didn’t seem airtight with you, especially with the missing documents from the desk. Something didn’t add up, so you all tried your hand at interrogating the civilians present during the murder at the estate’s guest house. <br><br>The interviews were fruitful. You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald’s murder only minutes before his body was found. You heard about several potential suspects whose jobs in the government were threatened by the ongoing revolt. You learned of a young staffer that had gone missing the evening prior. Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor’s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald’s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room. You raced with your comrade back to the office, whereupon opening the large window behind the desk, you found a torn piece of fabric hanging on a wooden lattice on the exterior wall. It was the same kind of fabric the house servants wore.<br><br>So far, for being mere Arbites Troopers, you all were doing pretty good. So good in fact, that you had nearly forgotten you weren’t assigned to this murder by the time the person who was arrived: Inquisitor Weiss. You couldn’t get a good read on Weiss, she seemed aggravated at being undercut, but after you told her all that you had uncovered, she went ahead and let you keep investigating. Weiss took over interrogations, of course, and with the recovered fabric as a catalyst, she proceeded to march all the house servants down the hill to their quarters to begin questioning.<br><br>She didn’t take the fabric, though. Requisitioning one of the hounds the local government used to catch fleeing laborers(and some cool bikes from the PDF), you tracked the scent of the fabric all the way from the courtyard of the estate… down to the well near the servant’s quarters. Inquisitor Weiss wasn’t very happy about being interrupted, but when she saw where the dog was pointing, she had the same feeling you all did.', 'time': 1670394287, 'resto': 5484734, 'id': '2wiHY9ZM'}, {'no': 5488395, 'now': '12/07/22(Wed)01:26:11', 'name': 'Servo-Scribe', 'com': 'The missing maid, Yuliya, was pulled out of the drink, her naked body bloated from drowning.<br><br>Now, the idea that Yuliya was attacked so the killer could take her uniform had crossed your minds long before finding the poor girl, but it seemed like the scent-trail had ended at her corpse, rather than her killer. Remembering those odd, body-rifling bloodstains by Archibald’s corpse, you wondered if any of the killer’s scent might remain on his body. Turns out, it did. Your steadfast canid ran right out of the house after a couple whiffs, and you all finally got to ride those bikes over some terrain, going out a couple klicks behind the estate to the edge of a forest.<br><br>Once there, it seemed the trail had gone cold again, but the only problem was that the dog couldn’t fly. There were skid-marks on the ground(the vehicular kind), that indicated some kind of light aircraft had touched down recently. You took measurements of the skid impressions in the dirt and returned to the estate.<br><br>When you returned, the Inquisitor had managed to get the safe open, and graciously gave you all the chance to peek at its contents. There were letters from friends, letters from a (possibly illegitimate) son, and, most concerningly, correspondence with an Ecclesiarchal Cardinal Theodore Flemming. The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers. The cardinal’s response was a gentle <span class=""mu-i"">’please, Emperor, do not do that.’</span><br><br>With seemingly nothing left to investigate, the Inquisitor kindly flew you off-planet to the voidship where the rest of your superiors were being held by the Mechanicus(long story). You took the opportunity to enlist the aid of a young Tech-Priest in finding out what kind of vessel matched the dimensions of the skid-marks you found planetside, and what voidships those matching vessels embarked upon.<br><br>It was an Arvus Lighter, and it docked with a grain carrier bound for Icarus. You left the Mechanicus ship for the Inquisitor’s personal strike-cruiser, but not before the Tech-Priest blessed your shock maul. You’re not sure it actually did anything, but he seemed nice.<br><br>On the way back to Icarus, you could have gotten laid. You didn’t, but you could have. Redmore told you all that the Inquisitor requested your squad continue investigating the murder once you all were back on Icarus, and there might have been some backroom deal made with her in exchange for saving them from the wrath of the Mechanicus(long story, it’s seriously cool now, don’t ask).<br><br>Due to a riot that happened at the Arbites Department of Justice’s prison, your squad split up, and you and Groves arrived at the Icarian Orbital Spire with just Grist and Redmore.

The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has.

He was one of the inner circle and knew that his master might be interested by what he has learnt. He was not mistaken, one hour later he was brought to the personnal baths of B&#039;beg the Terrible.<br><br>Even a dark lord of more than 10 000 years needed to bath once in a month.

Larion could only nod respectfully while he was quickly disrobed by the two charming creatures and put into a pool of pleasingly hot water, a great change from the cold rain that would have given him an angine if he wasn&#039;t protected by magic. One of the dark elven beauties, with pale skin and black hair began to massage his shoulders while the second one with dark skin and white hair stroked his long blonde locks to clean them.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get. As you were walking off to the closest market you could think of, however, something compelled you to stop. Take it to a safe place, read it and… And… You weren’t sure. Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn’t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don’t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man. But you couldn’t keep these Divine truths to yourself alone, if you had learned anything from your study it was that good things were meant to be shared.

It is the wife of Unnar, the fisherman, who lives with his mother and young son. If all goes well, the child will be born eight moons hence. It is customary for the chieftain to give a present on these occasions, usually in the form of a small celebration with singing and dancing and music going late into the night. Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth.

Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;What will you do?</span>', 'filename': 'emberbloom', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 230, 'h': 232, 'tn_w': 123, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670166406325092, 'time': 1670166406, 'md5': 'ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==', 'fsize': 7437, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'lnm/GTa9'}, {'no': 5485686, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea', 'time': 1670168397, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'OHAWgWLt'}, {'no': 5485828, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers', 'time': 1670181491, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'qHCPuy7I'}, {'no': 5486015, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485828"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1', 'time': 1670192389, 'resto': 5481579, 'id': 'E+RiA0+u'}, {'no': 5486052, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485644"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

For now you&#039;d have to trust that they would do the right thing.

If they would&#039;ve noticed they surely must&#039;ve by now, with daily attendance and all. Your parents would have something to say about this if they weren&#039;t away on business all the time, though the school should have their number and would&#039;ve called by now, so either they know and let it happen, or the school neglected to even inform them. Either way, works for you. <br><br>Were you going to attend again? Eh, maybe when you feel like it. Being able to sleep in on weekdays should not be a luxury relegated to the holidays. Though it did get boring after everything just lost its appeal. Funny, you think of doing something, only for it to end up less enticing once endless opportunity presents itself. Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today. There&#039;s a hobby shop on the other side of the city, one you didn&#039;t know was even there.

Having learned of that, Claudia and Klaus resolved to ensure the justice is served with their direct personal participation - painfully aware of precarious position of the Alliance between Olga&#039;s monstrous horde and the mercenary army that was meant to be the decisive force, now turned out to be another enemy.

Still, a lovely instructor is speaking.<br><br><span class=""mu-b"">&quot;The inner cell mass undergoes changes to form three germ layers known as the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm,&quot;</span> Meryl declares, looking very professional and elegant. She&#039;s always so casual, so this is a nice look on her. She&#039;s got a long skirt on, a shirt-vest combo, and is also wearing high heels, something she rarely does outside of dresses. Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=""mu-b"">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing. You listen carefully, but it all bleeds together, like some sort of fast-forwarded movie. Still, your serenity remains with you. Just looking at the aqua-eyed beauty is enough to keep you happy.<br><br>---<br><br>Meryl proposed to you only recently- Which would have been odd enough, as far as you were concerned, until she explained why: It was now or never, at least until you showed up.<br><br>She&#039;s got demi-human physiology, some kind of fish-woman, and her father is a magician. Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fiancée cares about you. And you definitely care about her.

Intense red was never really your thing. One of the stencils includes fish, and you use it to tease Meryl, but she demands it be excluded, causing raised eyebrows as to what the fuss is about.

But you suppress it for now, because once you start that, you won&#039;t be able to stop. Okay, maybe you can get in a quick squeeze while the artist isn&#039;t looking.

Probably has little to no idea how to interact with society. Still, he has a reason to help you, maybe, depending on how his relationship with his old man and his former organization turns out.

Outside of keeping them safe, it&#039;s not personal for her, so she has no reason to help us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what about Saito?&quot; Jane asks. &quot;He&#039;s a real color-inside-the-lines kid, probably be happy to be on the side of the law.

This took place in a tiny village up in British Columbia, Canada. But we&#039;re not sure where either of them went afterwards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#039;ll make it a priority,&quot; Jane says. &quot;These two will stand out.

I use Project instead of Quest because you, the players, are going to control a civilization from nomadic hunter-gatherers to a massive empire instead of a traditional story-driven quest. The only story here will be an emergent one that concerns the history of an ever-growing population of people and the struggles they face throughout the ages. Eventually, at the end of the project, a fully fleshed-out world will have emerged.<br><br>You, the anons of /qst/ will not be the only ones controlling a civilization. For the last several months, I have been running this project with individual players controlling their own civilizations on a randomly-generated fantasy world of my design. The game is played out in a series of ages, in which players experience random events, are given the choice to perform a number of actions of their desire, and progress along technological and magical trees. Much like in a Civilization-style game, once each player has finished their actions for an age, all players advance to the next era and the cycle continues.<br><br>I have decided to allow you, the anonymous players of /qst/, in on the project, now that we are about ten ages into the world&#039;s history. You will be playing the game alongside my players, eventually interacting with them through the lens of these threads. You will vote on everything that happens to your civilization, which will be the only one in this game with more than one person controlling it and the only anonymously-controlled society. Once we catch up to where my others players are located in the timeline, we shall postpone the game until the next age, at which point I will make another thread.<br><br>This is going to be a long-form game, and may not be akin to traditional civ-style quest threads on this board.",1668914606,0,bXUpy8V0,,untamed-civilization-project-1,0,1280,146,"[{'no': 5486654, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)10:15:38', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Yeah, although I&#039;ll be hatin on Ratfolk allday erryday I won&#039;t stand for discriminating vampires who have been nothing but Bros!', 'time': 1670253338, 'resto': 5468991, 'id': 'Y3OUnIzB'}, {'no': 5486657, 'now': '12/05/22(Mon)10:19:17', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Ratfolk are too culturally different.

From your position the situation doesn&#039;t look too dire. This Astor guy looks like a sort of a bonehead from the way he talks and acts. A cavalry charge against defended position, on sandy uphill, looks a tad foolish. The arrows alone should diminish their effectiveness and waste manpower. Then again, if he is Thona&#039;s bloodline, he may have tricks up his sleeve.

But with panic comes something else. Something new. If you were into New Age hippy bullshit you&#039;d probably say that your third eye is opening, but as a man of Science, you call it a new sense. Something between feeling, tasting and smelling? You mostly feel the musky aura of Lionel with it, most others leaving a faint trace of cinnamon. You also feel, even from back here the metallic tasting swirling energy vortex inside the tent that has Thona in the middle. You focus this new sense in front of you. The men feel mostly the same as the nomads near you. Except Astor. He feels different. He tastes like rotten meat? Or maybe it is his armor that has this taste, the man inside feels cold and saffron. The more you try to feel it, the more you can make out the difference. This man may be near physical perfection and wear some kind of special armor, but he is no mage, you&#039;re almost certain of it.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;73...74...</span><br><br>And now that you look around, you see sharpened poles laying around from the earlier battle. They were probably intended to be used for a palisade at some point, but were forgotten after the battle. If they were to be lifted up and held at an angle, they might help to even the odds further. A spikewall like that was how the ancients stopped cavalry charges, you thnk. Roughly 3 and a half minutes...

Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you’ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He’s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It’s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you’ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that’s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto’s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn’t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone’s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You’re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei’s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>“Raiton: Raiden!”<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto’s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. “Multi-shadow clone!”<br><br>He can’t see what you did.

Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (兽诏书为高达-人类形式, Shòuzhàoshūwèigāodá-Rénlèixíngshì.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself. Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

Before the Nauk the continent was naught but chaos, and the order of conquest united the stricken, barbaric land. A thousand years after the landings of Sversk the Conqueror, the last strained ties holding the Nauk Imperial together fell apart, but all would remember the Nauk Imperial being the beginning of history- and the inheritors of its glory, proud to call themselves the first of Vinstragan men.<br><br>The southern country of Vynmark claims a part of this lost glory, successors of the Nauk as both princes of the land, and lords of the sea, the latter which has made them exceptionally wealthy in recent times as the goods of the newly opened east flow around the isolationist Twaryi and through the greedy and unquestioning merchants of Vynmark’s shores, overseen by the noble Landgrafs and their high courts.

We believed that our ancestors had won us this idyll, and that we were meant to do naught but enjoy it, whilst whomever wished to play at war would never see something like the whispered-of yet so far off brutality of the rest of the continent.<br><br>Soon enough, we found that we had not earned peace in our lives.

Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man.

Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them.

Their objective was to reclaim them from a mysterious horror which had rallied the primitive, monkey-like ‘ghouls’ who picked at their dead into a terrifying and organized horde. Nobody knew quite who or what this mysterious adversary was, but those who had survived encounters with the feral beasts described some sort of ‘Ghoul Supreme’ egging the lesser creatures on.<br><br>At the elven militia’s head was no Drow noble, but reptilian foreigner of monstrous description: a lizardman called ‘Theral’ for his shining, coppery hide. Those elves who guarded the borders and patrolled the far reaches beyond the eyes of Wevenore’s nobility whispered tales of this dreadful being’s exploits. <br><br>They said that he had slain the Devourer, a great king-slayer of the westernmost caverns, and that he had subdued and subjugated the ancient and shapeless Shoggoth with his own two hands. <br><br>They said he spoke like an elven poet—that he could soothe the heart of any elfman or elfmaid with his rumbling polemics to peace, and stir any elf or animal to righteous fury with his fiery sermons to war. Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old—mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some—the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors—spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some—the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat—regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill… Well, that remained to be seen.",1667183641,0,CQjyTS+o,,dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6,0,517,68,"[{'no': 5485432, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)04:07:23', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485165"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485165</a><br>can we deal with necromancer on the way out?', 'time': 1670144843, 'resto': 5448278, 'id': 'tV5YrKmF'}, {'no': 5485561, 'now': '12/04/22(Sun)07:51:02', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p5485409"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5485409</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Ghouls and dogbolds</span><br>[Dogbolds/ghouls are a mysterious collective of mostly-hairless, albinistic baboon-things.

And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

129,5444794,,,10/27/22(Thu)11:28:42,TrashQM,Space Peon Wrecker Quest,"Earlier today, you had an unscheduled heart attack. And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren’t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=""mu-i"">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren’t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don’t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been … well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here – except those in the Belly, of course – are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won’t make trustee, won’t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>“Alright, you are back within safe parameters.” <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>“On dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I’ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won’t bother reading it unless you tell them to.” <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic … but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>“In consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

You know MagiPol is known to operate in strange ways, but this is a bit ridiculous.<br><br>Your name is Arthur Roland. You’re a 25 year old detective, well, ex-detective now. Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson’s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt. You couldn’t have gained the crucial evidence without speaking to the dead. <br><br>You were quickly contacted by MagiPol, who have now recruited you into some sort of program. You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types. But eventually, all you received was a phone call directing you to a rooftop overlooking a bunch of warehouses in downtown Austin, Texas. <br><br>And to “procure critical ordinance, then wait for instructions.”<br><br>The ordinance in question was a stylish black full-body suit and helmet, perfectly fitting your form. As soon as you settled in, the helmet lit up with a display, and a prerecorded message.<br><br>“WELCOME, MARVELOUS BLACK.”<br><br>You’d only heard passing rumors of the Marvelous Rangers, a covert anti-terror group that did missions all around the world. Speculation was abound. Were they vigilantes? Terrorists themselves, perhaps? <br><br>Nope.

Your experience, and what you once were has taught you better than anyone not to underestimate any of your kin. No matter their stature, no matter how they carried themselves in this world, and even now with the greatest of your gifts stripped from your kind after the death of Elinu, you would never believe them weak. <br><br>But you have your own designs that weave in the thread of this choice and so many others. While setting Izurin and Thera-Yuugoth to venture beyond the grasp of the Sanctuary may halt their hands, you must ensure that no errant thread unravel your craft. <br><br>You will not take the risk of setting them to wander.<br><br>Darkness fills in the void of the eroding fleshscape, and azure essence once vibrant as fire diminishes like the setting sun. Cold once again seeps into the fringes of your perception.<br><br>“Do your best to ensure that she behaves, but don’t ever forget the body and world waiting for you and…” Despite her standing just out of grasp of your hand, despite the form of your arm having already faded from this realm, despite now not even seeing her azure presence any longer, you reach out to Izurin. “Thank you.”<br><br>`<br><br>You snap your head back from where it came to rest against the hot flesh of the colossal organ and a thin strand of blood briefly connects you to Thera-Yuugoth before severing. Struggling to your feet, the shifts you heard within the sea cave come into view as you hastily pull Izurin’s body to standing with you.<br><br>The shrouded figures have moved toward the pointed precipice hanging out of the mouth of the cave, and laid down a great net of woven rope in front of the flesh gods brain. They kneel in reverence, facing the darkened skies in which a rift of infected sunlight hangs softly glowing. Even the tides have ceased in the presence of the pulsating wound casting its sickening shade upon all those who bear witness. It hums. <br><br>Within the oppressive silence, it hums to you with a pulse of primal and unformed energy that evokes a time far before that of heroes or even gods. <br><br>As you take hold of Izurin’s body, it shivers and shakes like a startled newborn with arms and legs moving with uncertainty. Beyond the body, a faint presence of mana resides. One that you haven’t sensed in over ten years. <br><br>“Can you stand?” Your near silent whisper conveyed right into Alys’ new ears.<br><br>She gasps upon hearing your voice, and blue eyes open to the world beyond the fleshscape and beyond the organ that she resided within only seconds ago. “I…I…can.” Her voice a tone of realization rather than answer.', 'filename': 'Sanc5', 'ext': '.png', 'w': 1963, 'h': 2000, 'tn_w': 122, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670756738746490, 'time': 1670756738, 'md5': '5R9B4mFF5DXaMXINqvPmqg==', 'fsize': 6440903, 'resto': 5443579, 'id': 'HiLKlBqc', 'trip': '!TidesHQn0s'}, {'no': 5493086, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)06:23:35', 'name': 'Hien', 'com': '<a href=""#p5493080"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;5493080</a><br><br>You relax your grip momentarily to test her words, and though the Elin begins to stumble, her reflexes catch her before you need reach.<br><br>Even if you had expected this result, seeing Alys occupy Izurin&#039;s body is nothing short of remarkable. You must remain vigilant for any bodily or mental effects that may result from the exchange, but for now you have to fulfill the final part of this mission and safely depart from this frigid sanctuary. <br><br>The sound of Enais’ voice behind you pulls your focus away from the reborn Elin. “My, I was worried that we would have to cut your meeting short, but I’m quite pleased it didn&#039;t come to that.” She closes her eyes and inhales deeply. “The suffering that once wafted so heavily from Alys is only a trace of what it once was. I assume that you and her came to an understanding that will be mutually beneficial for both our sides.”<br><br>You slowly lead Alys a few steps away from the flesh god’s brain. “Alys will not fight against your god’s emerging consciousness, nor will she interfere any further from within its body. You have my promise.”<br>Enais rests her hand against her cheek. “I’m so happy to have that promise, Elly.” She sighs in satisfaction and opens her piercing blue eyes. “I knew our conversation would be fruitful for the two of us, and now that our final pieces are in place, I need not occupy you any further.” <br><br>With eyes locked upon the tainted sun in the sky, she walks with arms outstretched toward the brain of Thera-Yuugoth. “Brethren, the moment we’ve worked so tirelessly toward for so many years is finally at hand. For your service, you will have the honor of embracing the very brain of divine benefactor and leading it to its rightful place.” She stops to lovingly rest her hand upon the organ. “Afterward, we will see to a proper reward for your enduring faith…”', 'time': 1670757815, 'resto': 5443579, 'id': 'HiLKlBqc', 'trip': '!TidesHQn0s'}]",1670757815,OPF,.png,1798.0,1289.0,249.0,179.0,1666754797255254.0,fIwWn35oAej+SKSdMMQHbg==,2618472.0,0.0,0.0,!TidesHQn0s,388.0,31.0

This one’s no different, if you’re being honest. After leaving the sounds of the break party, you slip off to the other end of the mansion, where you can look into just what’s making all that rumbling. There doesn’t seem to be many other folks left inside that aren’t working, actually, considering that the place seems dead. Guess they’re wrapping up? Either way, you need to inform your assistant. “Gartoum, they’ve made this place into a big hazard trap,” you mention. “We might need to pull protection duty if she ends up in here.”<br><br>“That’s what it’s looking like~!” he notes. “She’s not bad at this bit, surprisingly.

After all that fighting and all the destruction that you&#039;ve wrought finally there is tangible proof that what you&#039;re doing isn&#039;t futile. The Emperor bleeds. After all the effort you put into it you managed to deal genuine damage to her and not just something surface level. She can be hurt! She can be beaten! This thought that you already knew deep down spreads through the crowd and burrows into the minds of even her children, no matter how heretical they may think it is.<br><br>None of them has ever seen their mom struggle, let alone be hurt by someone. They thought they were invincible, their strength infallible. More than the legions of homies that your men have destroyed and more than all the bruises they received, this lone act managed to dampen their morale. Now there is room for doubt. And like a festering wound its taint spreads quickly. Now the Big Mom Pirates no longer have the certainty of victory.<br><br>And that&#039;s not all. The Silver Pirates may be tired.

148,5441326,,,10/23/22(Sun)06:19:23,Chewlius,Infernity: Welcome to Hell,"You awaken into the blissful fog of the usual half-minute or so it takes your brain to remember all of yesterday&#039;s problems. As the fog clears, you sort through your recent memories with the tentative dread of a man checking for bombs in his mailbox. You remember nearly finishing the bottle of Jameson by yourself, and you remember taking the pills. You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell.

A conflict between empires? A mistake? Ultimately it doesn&#039;t matter, the shining towers of old won&#039;t be restored to their former glory when someone figures out what caused their destruction.<br><br>You come from a relatively prosperous town called Safford, home to a population of no more than 500. The people here owe their meager wealth to an active coal mine in town, a source of power and heat that they trade with others. You however, have nothing to do with the coal mining business of your community.<br><br>All your life you&#039;ve been a scavenger; picking over the remains of the old world in search of all the things your community needed but couldn&#039;t produce; medicine, ammunition primers, electrical components, engine parts. It is thankless work, despite the importance of these goods you never receive anything more than a pittance.<br>That begs the question; why do you put up with it? What made you turn to this lifestyle in the first place? (This will determine your starting gear and your relationship with the townsfolk. Basic gear is a gas mask + leather satchel)<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You&#039;ve always been the sort that looks for trouble, you were not meant for the mines like your friends. When the opportunity arose you sold all your knick knacks for a gun and volunteered to become one of the town&#039;s scavengers. [Sawn-off pump action shotgun, holds six shells, you&#039;ve got 8 + 1 syringe of morphine]</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Your parents died shortly after you were born, as an orphan you needed to fend for yourself, you begged, you stole and eventually you became a scavenger. You were always an outcast so it was only natural you&#039;d end up on this path. [rusty 9mm pistol, comes with one 17 round magazine + crowbar + flashlight]</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You were content to live an ordinary life but a night of drinking and a debt to a shady man had forced you to leave the comfort of your settlement&#039;s walls. After paying off your debt you came to realize working for old &quot;Saul&quot; (as you are sure that is not his real name) has it&#039;s benefits. He supplies you with quality gear but the jobs are a little strange and quite dangerous. Your employer seems to keep a close eye on you. [body armor vest + 9mm SMG with two 30 round mags + flashlight]</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The ruins of the old ones always fascinated you. Your ancestors seemed infinitely more advanced than the people of your town. Infinitely more interesting too. You wanted to study them and the best way to do that was out in the ruins.
