Having just reunited with your fellow Shangralans and Astartes sons, whom have traveled the webway alongside your Beloved Emerald Lotus blossom, Kanzeon, and her sister, Anahita, to reinforce Angron&#039;s own every growing army of former gladiators and slaves, you noticed your followers amongst the Aeldari race were keeping a distance between themselves and your once enslaved brothers. Seeking answers from Noble Carys and valorous Folant, you learned the truth of how your brother was made a slave to begin with and the role the ever prophecy chasing Aeldari of the craftworlds played in it in their attempt to avert the dread future they beheld.<br><br>So, as you are not a simpleton who blames the world for one the ill deeds of the few, you decided it would be best for Angron to know of the truth of his capture and the cause for his attempted assassination, in the pursuit of bringing peace to his mind and preventing any misunderstandings or resentment from arising between him and the fair Aeldair, because of the misguided and foolish actions of those sycophants of destiny. After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens. And you know that as well as you know that those whom are different are often held with unwarranted suspicion and mistrust.<br><br>Which is why it is best to reveal the truth to your brother and introduce him to Aeldari whom are not distant and deserving of said mistrust.<br><br>&quot;And who better than myself and Folant&quot; Carys says jauntily, as the more dour ranger marches at your side &quot;To prove that not all of our people are apathetic to the plight of humanity, or retain the overwrought sense of pride that lead us to ruin&quot;<br>Cont", "filename": "2nd Primarch 1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2581, "h": 1629, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 157, "tim": 1670495207074792, "time": 1670495207, "md5": "JWOS55uFl9loV5F4cGuQ+g==", "fsize": 1119220, "resto": 0, "id": "RBVYiFdu", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-2nd-primarch-quest-22", "trip": "!!RS7NSuo3fkv", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 27, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 22, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5490662, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)05:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201cBehold the greatest of my dear brothers sons Ahriman!\u201d Magnus gestured over the company that had fallen into two lines as an honour guard for the Giant of Prospero whom had come to visit his eccentric brother, his own retinue of eight others was somewhat intimidated by the appearance of the Second legions First Company; The Brotherhood of Panthers.

This is inspired by the original DBO but also a play on DB Online as it will be taking many pieces from there. We&#039;ll be playing a Youthful upstart in the world of Dragon Ball and their involvement in many of the series&#039; iconic events. Although we will be going through the Original DB and perhaps beyond, this quest will be taking elements from multiple interpretations (Kakarot, Jaco, etc.) and adjusting them accordingly to fit a cohesive narrative. As well as incorporating other related works from the Toriyamaverse.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who do we play specifically?</span><br>A Character named Pinich/Pinchi depending on the choice below. A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline.

Your newfound profession has brought you into several conflicts against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church.

Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

The Professor shrugs and drags you along, taken a back you try and shrug off his grip but you noticed for an old man he is kinda tough. After a minute of awkward shuffling and trying to escape his grapple while you both moved towards the canister, he let&#039;s go of you abruptly. You were about to give you a piece of your mind but the loud clanking of the canisters threw you off, they seem to be in full gear at the moment as if they had finished a booting protocol. Professor Walker points at the canister and the pulsating binaries inside saying &quot;there lies your dream, vision and destiny. Your whole career depends on what you can call forth from within you, I trust you have the aptitude to decide that.&quot; With that professor Walker fiddles with the canister&#039;s console a bit and a new panel slowly shuffles from it, &quot;looks like a Biometric scanner&quot; you exclaim out loud. Professor Walker nods and replies &quot;it is, this is the only way to manifest them. Mind you, you&#039;ll be giving it a bit of your DNA which might sound weird but see it as you&#039;re both bonded genetically.&quot; You ignore his comment and the subsequent thought of having something be born with your DNA, with that you slowly touch the panel and concentrate. The binaries begin to swirl and swirl within the canister drawing the attention of all the lab assistants as they watch and marvel, slowly it begins to dissipate and the binary digits become no more. With a sudden THOOM accompanied with a blinding light the canister is once again overloaded with all sorts of alphanumeric symbols, you notice the professor and the lab assistants all wearing sunshades and you&#039;re clearly taking the brunt of the light&#039;s intensity.

You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald\u2019s murder only minutes before his body was found.

Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor\u2019s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald\u2019s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room.

The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers. The cardinal\u2019s response was a gentle <span class=\"mu-i\">\u2019please, Emperor, do not do that.\u2019</span><br><br>With seemingly nothing left to investigate, the Inquisitor kindly flew you off-planet to the voidship where the rest of your superiors were being held by the Mechanicus(long story). You took the opportunity to enlist the aid of a young Tech-Priest in finding out what kind of vessel matched the dimensions of the skid-marks you found planetside, and what voidships those matching vessels embarked upon.<br><br>It was an Arvus Lighter, and it docked with a grain carrier bound for Icarus. You left the Mechanicus ship for the Inquisitor\u2019s personal strike-cruiser, but not before the Tech-Priest blessed your shock maul. You\u2019re not sure it actually did anything, but he seemed nice.<br><br>On the way back to Icarus, you could have gotten laid. You didn\u2019t, but you could have. Redmore told you all that the Inquisitor requested your squad continue investigating the murder once you all were back on Icarus, and there might have been some backroom deal made with her in exchange for saving them from the wrath of the Mechanicus(long story, it\u2019s seriously cool now, don\u2019t ask).<br><br>Due to a riot that happened at the Arbites Department of Justice\u2019s prison, your squad split up, and you and Groves arrived at the Icarian Orbital Spire with just Grist and Redmore. There, you found that the grain hauler the killer escaped in was still docked, and acquired a long arrivals manifest that you expertly narrowed down to three potential suspects through the process of elimination.", "time": 1670394371, "resto": 5484734, "id": "2wiHY9ZM"}, {"no": 5488398, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)01:27:24", "name": "Servo-Scribe", "com": "You and Groves agreed unanimously on which one suspect to pursue, Gerard Tiber, while Redmore and Grist took the other two by themselves.<br><br>As fate would have it, Gerard Tiber totally did it.

The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has.

Now he understands why it was confusing. This scroll was written in a language steeped in the mantle of Silence, a paradox that makes it almost impossible to hear the phonemes of the words to understand them. He or his gem daughter would\u2019ve been able to decipher the scroll but it could\u2019ve taken several months. Hubert knows that Time is important and Chews-In-Quiet would\u2019ve agreed. <br><br>The actual meaning of the scroll takes a few minutes to understand. The beginning of the scroll details the rites of the cult of Chews-In-Quiet, which worshipers used to anoint their souls in the Silence of their maggot goddess. As Hubert reads on, it begins to explain a purer, deeper ritual meant for only the most exalted members of their cult, hand-chosen by their goddess. Hence the maze and guardians. In exchange for the sacrifice of a cultist\u2019s soul, their existence would be hollowed out into a permanent, trancelike state called the Deep Quiet and their bodies and minds would be empowered to enforce the will of their goddess. These Silent Few were able to negate nearby magic, kill nonbelievers with a thought, and even resist hostile divine powers to a degree. <br><br>His divine instincts tell him that although it was intended for mortal cultists, the ritual could be changed and an act of sacrifice performed to grant him the mantle of Silence. Such a profound act would render the ritual impossible for mortals to attempt in the same way as before due to the sheer resonance destroying their soul without the benefit. In theory, a similar ritual could be created or the echo of his ascension removed by the goddess but the effect would remain. The Silence would be a part of him and he would be able to make miracles or create with its power. His divine instincts also tell him that the ritual could be performed and its meaning inverted, taken advantage of, to simply grant him power without the mantle, although power comes with time and the opportunity to gain a mantle is rare indeed. He also knows that the meaning could be twisted to the nature of his soul, granting him any of a few different mantles, but the possibilities are impossible to know and it would require a greater sacrifice. In any event, it is an interesting find.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "time": 1670656153, "resto": 5481542, "id": "Vp4uit9k"}, {"no": 5491731, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)02:17:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5491729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5491729</a><br>The particulars of the ritual are so precise and its nature so powerful that a single scroll can\u2019t hold it. There are three more, their locations aren\u2019t hinted at, only their existence, but the scroll radiates such power that Hubert knows he could find them even if he didn\u2019t memorize the pattern of the Essence. He did, however, and he can sense them even now, at an unimaginable distance. One scroll lies in the incredibly distant lair of a beast powerful enough to give even him pause. One scroll lies in a place that doesn\u2019t exist in this mortal time but could be found if he took a specific mountain path in the dead of winter. Lastly, one scroll is in what seems to be a normal castle that actually isn\u2019t very far. Finding them all will be a quest of its own but probably not as repetitive as penetrating the senses of this temple ruin has been.<br><br>If any of Chews-In-Quiet\u2019s cult remains or if, the demigod himself forbid, she is still around, they could find out and try to put a stop to him after the second scroll was taken. Or they could not. There\u2019s just no way to know. Hubert thinks about this and pockets the scroll. Luckily its divine parchment is incredibly durable and doesn\u2019t require any serious precautions to keep safe. He and the others leave the ruin and think about what they\u2019ve found. Hubertina is proud of him. \u201cI knew you had it in you, father!

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do?</span>", "filename": "emberbloom", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 230, "h": 232, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166406325092, "time": 1670166406, "md5": "ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==", "fsize": 7437, "resto": 5481579, "id": "lnm/GTa9"}, {"no": 5485686, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea", "time": 1670168397, "resto": 5481579, "id": "OHAWgWLt"}, {"no": 5485828, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers", "time": 1670181491, "resto": 5481579, "id": "qHCPuy7I"}, {"no": 5486015, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1", "time": 1670192389, "resto": 5481579, "id": "E+RiA0+u"}, {"no": 5486052, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

Jacquot, a good friend of mine and the family also was quite supportive of the endeavor to join. And it&#039;s thanks to both that I joined. As for my family, they are doing well last I heard. My younger brother Gamelet joined the navy for example, though I haven&#039;t heard much from home of note since I last was able to visit them early in the year...As for my interests, at the moment they involve you. Firstly, what is that? Perfume?&quot; You ask calmly in a fairly friendly tone. Calantha didn&#039;t seem too bad just yet after all.<br><br>&quot;Ah, you must have quite zhe keen sense of smell!&quot; The smell is kind of obvious, given how it sticks out at a military base about as badly as a ship on land. Though she continues &quot;It is one of my own creations, &#039;Baiser de Lillie&#039;! My family is quite talented in zhe arts of Fragrance products, and even when fighting in zhe skies, I have zhe time to craft such wonderful scents!&quot; She seems fairly pleased speaking about this, almost a bit proud of herself.<br><br>&quot;So, you are a chemist sort of like Ermengardis?&quot; You swiftly ask.<br><br>&quot;I suppose one could say zhat I am a kind of one. Zhough I did not know she was one. I have not had zhe chance to speak to her, given she is in a separate escadron. Zhough perhaps she could be somewhat skilled in zhe art as well?&quot; She seems to think to herself after this for a bit.<br><br>&quot;I suppose this isn&#039;t really related but, where are you from?&quot; You were half tempted to mention the accent but decided it might not be best to bring that up.<br><br>&quot;Well, zhe place I call home is a suburb near Nanlun, to zhe south of zhe city in a nice district with plenty of fancy homes. However, before the war I spent much of my adult life studying at a university in Aurilu\u00e7on. After I worked to start up a company for perfumes and zhe like, but with zhe war starting, I had to put a pause to zhat. But I believe at zhis stage it is worth zhe minor delay.&quot; She seems fairly confident with herself with the last statement, you get the feeling she&#039;s likely referring to the popularity she&#039;d get as an ace, especially with the PR tours.", "time": 1670462270, "resto": 5477321, "id": "WVjz8z5c"}, {"no": 5489302, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)20:18:51", "name": "Army Headquarters (QM)", "com": "&quot;Well I&#039;m glad to hear that. I take it you are interested in perfume and the like. Is there anything else you are interested in particularly?&quot; You are a bit curios as to what she&#039;ll say but given what was said, you have a slight worry she might stroke her ego a bit much.<br><br>&quot;I zhink it is obvious zhat I am quite interested in perfume! It is one of my passions! Another is ensuring my physique and appearance is magnificent and beautiful.&quot; She says with a clear smile as she gently moves a hand to twirl a few strands of her short red hair as she continues. &quot;However, I also am quite interested in zhe mythology, fantasies and stories of zhe world, both in europa and far abroad. Zhey are quite interesting in my opinion. And I very much enjoy being able to hear and learn about zhem. Zheir creativity and exotic nature can serve as great inspiration for zhe work zhat I do as well. Somewhat related, I also enjoy exploration! Specifically seeing zhe various beautiful lands zhat exist in zhe world! Zhe view from a cockpit onto zhe land below is quite a breathtaking one, zhough I do wish I could see zhe jungles of south Abmeryk or Asu, zhe plains of Varuskie, zhe mountains of Cipanto and many other places. Related to zhis, I actually occasionally enjoy painting zhem. Zhough, do not tell Am\u00e9lie, while I know she is probably better than myself I would rather her not be bothered by her about it and have her constantly attempt to teach me. She is still a child in heart and soul... She may have talent in a plane, but I do wonder if her curiosity and childlike nature will cause us trouble in zhe future...Zhat aside, I am mainly able to make landscapes, but other zhings are a bit beyond me at zhe moment.&quot; She explains in a friendly tone.<br><br>&quot;What exactly do you mean by those stories inspiring you? You aren&#039;t a writer are you?&quot; You honestly had no clue what she meant, unless it was just to inspire her with names for perfumes she made. That was the only thing that made sense, though...how would those sorts of stories inspire her for perfume names? Well, good ones anyway. <br><br>&quot;Oh, no, I am not a writer, sadly. But... zhe descriptions... zhe fantastic creatures... It serves as such great inspiration for my perfume! I try in all my power to recreate zhe fragrance and beauty of zhe stories I read, to make those perfect descriptions become... reality.&quot; Either she&#039;s reading different stories than the ones you know or she probably is probably going to be using fairly...unique names for sure.

Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear.

Intense red was never really your thing. One of the stencils includes fish, and you use it to tease Meryl, but she demands it be excluded, causing raised eyebrows as to what the fuss is about.

But you suppress it for now, because once you start that, you won&#039;t be able to stop. Okay, maybe you can get in a quick squeeze while the artist isn&#039;t looking. That puts her back into bashful mode.<br><br>After a few minutes, the practiced platemaker proposes a much better counter-offer, and Meryl is stunned. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Woah.

Jane was right, he is a handsome devil. Bit of a lost puppy look to him, though. If his bio is right, he spent his childhood in a rich man&#039;s home, then an orphanage, and now lives on the road with no permanent address. Probably has little to no idea how to interact with society. Still, he has a reason to help you, maybe, depending on how his relationship with his old man and his former organization turns out.

Rosa&#039;s tough, but she seems like the type to put family first. Outside of keeping them safe, it&#039;s not personal for her, so she has no reason to help us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what about Saito?&quot; Jane asks. &quot;He&#039;s a real color-inside-the-lines kid, probably be happy to be on the side of the law.

This took place in a tiny village up in British Columbia, Canada. But we&#039;re not sure where either of them went afterwards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#039;ll make it a priority,&quot; Jane says. &quot;These two will stand out.

From your position the situation doesn&#039;t look too dire. This Astor guy looks like a sort of a bonehead from the way he talks and acts. A cavalry charge against defended position, on sandy uphill, looks a tad foolish. The arrows alone should diminish their effectiveness and waste manpower. Then again, if he is Thona&#039;s bloodline, he may have tricks up his sleeve. You look at Lionel quizzically, but he is too busy negotiating with the guard captain.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20...21...</span><br><br>Time passes and you feel a tiny bit of panic raising up from the back of your mind and covering it like a blanket. But with panic comes something else. Something new. If you were into New Age hippy bullshit you&#039;d probably say that your third eye is opening, but as a man of Science, you call it a new sense. Something between feeling, tasting and smelling? You mostly feel the musky aura of Lionel with it, most others leaving a faint trace of cinnamon. You also feel, even from back here the metallic tasting swirling energy vortex inside the tent that has Thona in the middle. You focus this new sense in front of you. The men feel mostly the same as the nomads near you. Except Astor. He feels different. He tastes like rotten meat? Or maybe it is his armor that has this taste, the man inside feels cold and saffron. The more you try to feel it, the more you can make out the difference. This man may be near physical perfection and wear some kind of special armor, but he is no mage, you&#039;re almost certain of it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;73...74...</span><br><br>And now that you look around, you see sharpened poles laying around from the earlier battle. They were probably intended to be used for a palisade at some point, but were forgotten after the battle. If they were to be lifted up and held at an angle, they might help to even the odds further. A spikewall like that was how the ancients stopped cavalry charges, you thnk. Roughly 3 and a half minutes... You might have just enough time to explain your idea to the others and rouse these additional defenses. With them, the terrain advantage, the arrow fire and whatever Lionel is able to cook up you might have a path to victory.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Help with the defense</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fuck this, You&#039;re a bastard, not a warrior!

The resulting orbital debris field has halted any plans of expansion into space.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNow surviving nations leverage their remaining industry to fortify their fragile borders, petty warlords squabble over wastelands scarred by kinetic bombardment, the remnants of the IF\u2019s elite peacekeepers haunt the battlefields like vengeful spirits, and over it all looms the threat of Neromius; empowered by a new generation of genetically engineered mega-cavalry and unrestricted by the sanctions of the IF; the rider-chiefs of its disparate tribes and city states sally forth into the broken world in search of spoils and glory.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt all began in the Great Interior Desert. Resources deposits discovered in unclaimed territory sparked border conflicts which escalated into the Satellite war. But just because the world ended didn\u2019t mean the war did.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 158, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 153, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5490973, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)13:54:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5490957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5490957</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;d prefer if we didn&#039;t have to fight like that, but we don&#039;t have much choice in the matter.

Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3.

Striking with tremendous speed and explosive force, the Gentleman Ghost found himself once again blind-sighted by your ferocious assault. Not even giving him a chance to teleport or attempt to phase through by ghosting. \u201cI am a virgin you archaic asshole!\u201d You bellowed, acting more like a beast than a woman. <br> <br>Noctura meanwhile let out a small chuckle before presuming to reach for the grimoire. \u201cLet\u2019s not be resorted to using our trump card thanks to your prophesied return to life early now, Craddock.\u201d Just as Nocturna was beginning to recite a spell from the book, a robin-like grappling hook quickly wraps around the tomb. With a single tug, it would deeply wrap around the book before being yanked from the podium and into the darkness. \u201cTsc.\u201d <br> <br>You knew that Robin was the one who did that as you chose not to blow his cover by screaming words of praise. Instead, you focused on continuing to lay another smackdown on Gentleman\u2019s Ghost as he was trying to bounce back from the dizzying stupor your heavy blows were causing him. As a ghost, it would only be natural that he would boast a highly durable astral body. Doubly so with whatever empowerment he was receiving that currently has yet to make its appearance. At the same time, he would find himself at the backfoot as you were still stronger by more than a fair margin. <br><br>\u201cChange of plans, you go grab the book from our crafty thief and I\u2019ll handle this powerhouse here.\u201d Nocturna barked, stabbing herself with her claws, hitting specific acupuncture points on her body. As a result, she would begin to swell up like a balloon, but rather than getting more bloated with a rotund body. The vampiric diva instead starts packing some serious meat as she was bulking up. A mixture of shapeshifting and doping was the main source for her now hulking amazon body. <br> <br>\u201cHoly crap...\u201d You uttered, looking at the statuesque stunner as she came charging at you like a speeding bullet train. Having just enough time to catch her into a grapple as you firmly anchor yourself to the ground.

All the while holding you in place with this tug of war to let Gentleman Ghost recover fully. \u201cThat being said, I could go for quite the hearty snack and virgin blood most certainly taste the sweetest.\u201d Nocturna smiled. <br> <br>Gritting your teeth, you let out a mighty roar in protest, exerting more strength to try and overpower her. As well as jerking your body around to avoid Nocturna\u2019s well-timed bites. \u201cSorry, I might look positively tantalizing for a five-course meal, but I\u2019m not on the menu.\u201d <br> <br>Having regained his composure, Gentleman Ghost simply recalls his cane back to him. Tapping his jewel accessory to morph the device\u2019s bottom into a flintlock-style barrel gun. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Aiming where he believed the Boy Wonder was located, Gentleman Ghost prepared to launch a mighty blast of spectral fire. <br> <br>Catching him in the act, however, you jerk your head forward toward the flight path of the upcoming attack. With a mighty inhale, you pulled the attack directly at you with the force of a vacuum space. The powerful suction was enough to siphon the spectral fire completely into your mouth. Sucking all of its essences down with deep, loud gulps as Gentleman Ghost tried firing more blasts. Every one of them met the same fate. All the while you kept Nocturna from acting with your vice-iron grip locking hands with hers. As such, the vampire wouldn\u2019t be to stop your retaliation as you let out a mighty shockwave at Gentleman Ghost. Masking the burp as a bellowing howl towards your adversary. <br> <br>\u201cWell, don\u2019t that beat all.\u201d Gentleman Ghost mutters, not even mad at the brilliant display of oral tricks as he was hit head-on with the attack. Having just enough time to shield himself from the brunt of the blow but getting knocked back a considerable distance. <br> <br>Seeing this happen in real-time, Nocturna lunges forward to finally take the opportunity and sink her fangs into you. But as she does so, she would find her sharpened fangs unable to puncture the dense, rubbery flesh. She would find herself currently stuck around your jugular vein as your muscles clench tightly around her vampiric canines. \u201cThis is ridiculous!

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately.

Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one. Mountainfolk are just as pale as Nauk are, after all, so the earthier-tone haired ones wouldn&#039;t be squinted at.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs. The cloaked figure turns on its heel and enters into the swirling mass. <br><br>Bucklin inches forward as if he\u2019s going to give chase.<br><br>You---<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop him.
