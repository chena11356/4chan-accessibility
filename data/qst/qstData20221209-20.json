This is inspired by the original DBO but also a play on DB Online as it will be taking many pieces from there. We&#039;ll be playing a Youthful upstart in the world of Dragon Ball and their involvement in many of the series&#039; iconic events. Although we will be going through the Original DB and perhaps beyond, this quest will be taking elements from multiple interpretations (Kakarot, Jaco, etc.) and adjusting them accordingly to fit a cohesive narrative. As well as incorporating other related works from the Toriyamaverse.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who do we play specifically?</span><br>A Character named Pinich/Pinchi depending on the choice below. A unique being given life through the powers of Shenron after a certain someone made a wish.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we play?</span><br>This quest operates no differently than any other. You will be going through a choose-your-own-adventure setup with options on what to do brought up via letters. Dice will be used but won&#039;t be the primary deciding factor/end all be all. This quest is more narrative based as I&#039;m looking for player input and giving urgency by choice. This is a story that&#039;s being shaped by your actions, for better or worse. Write-ins are encouraged. <br><br>As for the Dice System, we will be using the simple d100 setup. For mundane stuff or non-combative things, however, I will elect to use a d20 or d50 depending on complexity. Sounds simple enough right? Depending on your growth, the number of dice will change, so for now you&#039;ll be starting with a 2-dice roll with the best one out of the two being chosen for the result. Typical setups like crit succession and crit failure are a part of the quest. But like I said this is more narrative based so I&#039;m not going to hold you accountable if your rolls end up screwing you over or absolutely trivialize the quest as a result. This isn&#039;t like SOM. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you use Bo3 or Bo5?</span><br>Neither, I got the idea to use a Best of 4 based on previous experiences. A Bo3 is sometimes too cruel while Bo5 is sometimes too easy. Thus, it makes sense to me to do the best of both worlds with a Bo4. That and the number 4 fits Dragon Ball given the callbacks to the 4-star dragon ball. To explain for those who don&#039;t know what a Best of X is, it means that the first x rolls are the only ones that count (exceptions can be made), and the best result in each column rolled will be the one(s) used.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You said we&#039;re created by a wish, so what kind of character will we be able to make?</span><br>That&#039;s entirely up to you given the nebulousness of the wish made upon Shenron. From age to species, you&#039;ll be deciding what sort of character you are. The only other main factor is when exactly this will be taking place in the timeline.

I don\u2019t have the erratic insecurities of a child or any impurities to cloud my judgment. The presence of mind-forged from nine straight years of meditation all but ensures my emotions will never overpower my rationale. No matter how explosive or tempestuous. Hence, I also had the foresight to realize that even if I did go it would\u2019ve painted a target on my back. While I\u2019m confident I could eliminate countless saiyans, the Frieza Force is another matter. As I am now, I\u2019m uncertain whether or not I could beat Frieza.

It would be rather disappointing to have another Beerus running around.\u201d Whis chimes, keeping an otherwise neutral smile on his face. \u201cAnd it would equally be troublesome if you tried to leave this planet only to march straight to your imminent demise.

Tell me, is that my name?\u201d <br> <br>Whis nods, keeping his eyes solely on you. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Lord Beerus asked of me to come up with a proper name for you. Of course, I did some research on what the project that gave existence dubbed you. I believe the name is Pinich/Pinch, mostly born as a play on the pressing situation that gave birth to you I\u2019d imagine. Hoping that you thrived in response to adversity and become stronger as well as gradually becoming immune to the crisis. \u201d <br> <br>Pondering this tidbit of information for a moment, your gaze softens for a bit before remaining stoic. \u201cI understand, but that still doesn\u2019t answer the meaning of my name. Only why I was renamed at all.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cThe reason why I choose Kozen Douji or Konzenshi as its alternatively pronounced lies with that of the cicadas.\u201d Whis remarks, turning to fetch his wand and prompt up the imagery of said insectoid. <br> <br>\u201cCicadas, please elaborate.\u201d For a brief flicker, there was a tinge of genuine curiosity radiating from your eyes.

This is especially the case with the Golden Cicada. There\u2019s even a phrase revolving around deceiving your enemies by shedding the Golden Cicada&#039;s exuviae or skin. Acting like a decoy or Kagemusha.\u201cWhis informs, having a jovial laugh about it much to your chagrin. \u201cAnyway, the Cicada is all about renewal and personal change, not just the aforementioned symbolism I\u2019ve mentioned earlier. Unlike butterflies, moths, or other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, cicadas have no pupal state. They transition from one fully-function state to another. One viable form, in a small amount of time, changing to another.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cIn comparison, the cicada\u2019s transformation is similar to that of human beings. If a person wants or needs to make a change in their life, they don\u2019t enclose themselves in a pod and emerge next spring. Rather, they remain in their mortal form as they change throughout the seasons. Something you have shown splendidly throughout these last nine years. \u201cWhis explains, tapping his staff to show you the Golden Cicada before transitioning to showing you the parallels between it and your cocoon. Specifically, how it changes throughout the nine years of slumber. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m more focused on the personal change rather than solely the physical one. Though that shouldn\u2019t take away the stark change you made since we acquired you on that fateful day.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cA Golden Cicada that radiates a light that illuminates all like the rising sun or supernova. \u201cYou muttered, keeping a serious expression as you relay the message from Whis. Musing deeply at the explanation, you feel rather content with the reasoning. Going as far as to crack a small yet soft smile at the attendant. \u201cThat\u2019s a satisfying answer, I thank you for giving me the name.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, you gave me a lot to work with during your metamorphosis. Left me rather impressed with your maturity and innate talent. I didn\u2019t think you would already learn how to tap into both the spiritual side and acquire the capability to use your latent energy, otherwise known as ki, to this extent.\u201d Whis says, giving you praise for the performance. As well as how fluid and tranquil your aura currently displayed itself. <br><br>\u201cKi, so that\u2019s what this gushing overflow of life energy is.\u201d You said, glancing back at your hand. It was different from the paradox that what you were feeling, and yet it was loosely connected in some way.

Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession has brought you into several conflicts against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church. Currently, you are in the direct employment of Claude von Riegan, leader of the Leicester Alliance, on a diplomatic mission to provide aid to the embattled Church of Seiros.<br><br>After a grueling battle in the remote Edmund Woods with not only the Orthodox Knights, but one of the Seven Sages of Agartha as well, the Blackwings emerged victorious. Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

After all, it would be a great tragedy if one day, your brother by blood leveled the blades of his axes against those whom are your brothers by thought and philosophy. <br><br>Of course, it is an easy task to separate Angron from his army, and his flock of advisors, since you have a feeling they would take greater offence and be outraged to learn the truth of his capture than he himself would be, and would also be less open minded towards your alien allies, especially after learning of the dark deeds committed by their kind. It may be a misplaced worry, but you yourself feel more insulted and angered when those you hold dear are mocked or threatened, and amongst Angron&#039;s circle of confidants is his father Oenomaus. And a father&#039;s instinct to protect their children is strong indeed, a father&#039;s wrath is a forced to be reckoned with one so powerful it can even shake the heavens.

No, people, food, and fuel were simply too rare for such wasteful wars. Instead, the duels and the scrap knights came to be, using what Eldertech mechs that could be scavenged to engage in personal combat to resolve conflict on behalf of their scrap states. <br><br>Now, with tensions rising among the scrap lords and more and more Duels of Honor and Duels of Blood being declared, the need for scrap knights is greater than ever.

All the while during the revolt, the Planetary Governor asked for more troops from Icarus, and more time to meet the Tithe from the Administratum.<br><br>From his correspondence alone, the culprit and motives seemed much more straightforward. A rebel snuck into the stubborn and unyielding Governor\u2019s estate to strike a decisive blow against a callous despot. The theory didn\u2019t seem airtight with you, especially with the missing documents from the desk. Something didn\u2019t add up, so you all tried your hand at interrogating the civilians present during the murder at the estate\u2019s guest house. <br><br>The interviews were fruitful. You worked out a basic timeline that put Archibald\u2019s murder only minutes before his body was found. You heard about several potential suspects whose jobs in the government were threatened by the ongoing revolt. You learned of a young staffer that had gone missing the evening prior. Intriguingly, there was also no indication that any of the governor\u2019s closest associates had any knowledge of the hidden safe in his office, meaning the killer was better informed than Archibald\u2019s right-hand man, and probably was not one of the ordinary country bumpkins currently embarrassing Harvestite and Icarian PDF troopers at the frontlines.<br><br>The most important bit of information, gleamed from the Administratum adept who discovered the Governor, was that there was a draft in his room. You raced with your comrade back to the office, whereupon opening the large window behind the desk, you found a torn piece of fabric hanging on a wooden lattice on the exterior wall. It was the same kind of fabric the house servants wore.<br><br>So far, for being mere Arbites Troopers, you all were doing pretty good. So good in fact, that you had nearly forgotten you weren\u2019t assigned to this murder by the time the person who was arrived: Inquisitor Weiss. You couldn\u2019t get a good read on Weiss, she seemed aggravated at being undercut, but after you told her all that you had uncovered, she went ahead and let you keep investigating.

There were skid-marks on the ground(the vehicular kind), that indicated some kind of light aircraft had touched down recently. You took measurements of the skid impressions in the dirt and returned to the estate.<br><br>When you returned, the Inquisitor had managed to get the safe open, and graciously gave you all the chance to peek at its contents. There were letters from friends, letters from a (possibly illegitimate) son, and, most concerningly, correspondence with an Ecclesiarchal Cardinal Theodore Flemming. The first letter from the governor to the cardinal suggested that the Governor was going to attempt to negotiate with the revolting farmers.

The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has. Hubert can have between 1, for a sane, slightly flawed man that only has a scrap of strength, and 10, stark raving mad divinity powerful enough to shatter a kingdom.", "filename": "cosmosular", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 475, "h": 485, "tn_w": 244, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1669863072234000, "time": 1669863072, "md5": "xDvEiOXRmamYGcGYyxxUuw==", "fsize": 46100, "resto": 0, "id": "Vp4uit9k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hubert-dysfunctional-demigod-in-a-strange-land", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 221, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 216, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 5490562, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)03:01:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5490559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5490559</a><br>The servitor is dead, very dead.

They live far in the southern part of the island. I&#039;m a bit surprised to see a baby dragon this far from its mother. But maybe this one is just adventurous as you said. I don&#039;t think the mother will come looking for it though. There is a mating pair in the temple, and the savages provide them with all they need - food, gold. They just keep breeeding and filling the island with its offsprings. I suppose when it is old enough it will just fly over the ocean to find a lair elsewhere.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very interesting.

It is an old ballista. We don&#039;t use it because it is positioned fairly high and we don&#039;t like heights much. It is pointed towards the center of the island strangely enough. One would think they would point it towards the sea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe they were attacked and the others facing the sea were destroyed, this one remained.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps.

Occasionally, a group of orcs is accompanied by one or two humanoid creatures of remarkable musculature contrasted starkly by their rotund bellies and clumsy movements.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get. As you were walking off to the closest market you could think of, however, something compelled you to stop. Take it to a safe place, read it and\u2026 And\u2026 You weren\u2019t sure. Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don\u2019t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man.

Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth.

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do?</span>", "filename": "emberbloom", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 230, "h": 232, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166406325092, "time": 1670166406, "md5": "ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==", "fsize": 7437, "resto": 5481579, "id": "lnm/GTa9"}, {"no": 5485686, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea", "time": 1670168397, "resto": 5481579, "id": "OHAWgWLt"}, {"no": 5485828, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers", "time": 1670181491, "resto": 5481579, "id": "qHCPuy7I"}, {"no": 5486015, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1", "time": 1670192389, "resto": 5481579, "id": "E+RiA0+u"}, {"no": 5486052, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

My younger brother Gamelet joined the navy for example, though I haven&#039;t heard much from home of note since I last was able to visit them early in the year...As for my interests, at the moment they involve you. Firstly, what is that? Perfume?&quot; You ask calmly in a fairly friendly tone. Calantha didn&#039;t seem too bad just yet after all.<br><br>&quot;Ah, you must have quite zhe keen sense of smell!&quot; The smell is kind of obvious, given how it sticks out at a military base about as badly as a ship on land.

Zhough I did not know she was one. I have not had zhe chance to speak to her, given she is in a separate escadron. Zhough perhaps she could be somewhat skilled in zhe art as well?&quot; She seems to think to herself after this for a bit.<br><br>&quot;I suppose this isn&#039;t really related but, where are you from?&quot; You were half tempted to mention the accent but decided it might not be best to bring that up.<br><br>&quot;Well, zhe place I call home is a suburb near Nanlun, to zhe south of zhe city in a nice district with plenty of fancy homes. However, before the war I spent much of my adult life studying at a university in Aurilu\u00e7on. After I worked to start up a company for perfumes and zhe like, but with zhe war starting, I had to put a pause to zhat. But I believe at zhis stage it is worth zhe minor delay.&quot; She seems fairly confident with herself with the last statement, you get the feeling she&#039;s likely referring to the popularity she&#039;d get as an ace, especially with the PR tours.", "time": 1670462270, "resto": 5477321, "id": "WVjz8z5c"}, {"no": 5489302, "now": "12/07/22(Wed)20:18:51", "name": "Army Headquarters (QM)", "com": "&quot;Well I&#039;m glad to hear that.

It is one of my passions! Another is ensuring my physique and appearance is magnificent and beautiful.&quot; She says with a clear smile as she gently moves a hand to twirl a few strands of her short red hair as she continues. &quot;However, I also am quite interested in zhe mythology, fantasies and stories of zhe world, both in europa and far abroad. Zhey are quite interesting in my opinion. And I very much enjoy being able to hear and learn about zhem. Zheir creativity and exotic nature can serve as great inspiration for zhe work zhat I do as well. Somewhat related, I also enjoy exploration! Specifically seeing zhe various beautiful lands zhat exist in zhe world! Zhe view from a cockpit onto zhe land below is quite a breathtaking one, zhough I do wish I could see zhe jungles of south Abmeryk or Asu, zhe plains of Varuskie, zhe mountains of Cipanto and many other places.

She is still a child in heart and soul... She may have talent in a plane, but I do wonder if her curiosity and childlike nature will cause us trouble in zhe future...Zhat aside, I am mainly able to make landscapes, but other zhings are a bit beyond me at zhe moment.&quot; She explains in a friendly tone.<br><br>&quot;What exactly do you mean by those stories inspiring you? You aren&#039;t a writer are you?&quot; You honestly had no clue what she meant, unless it was just to inspire her with names for perfumes she made.

I try in all my power to recreate zhe fragrance and beauty of zhe stories I read, to make those perfect descriptions become... reality.&quot; Either she&#039;s reading different stories than the ones you know or she probably is probably going to be using fairly...unique names for sure.

She&#039;s always so casual, so this is a nice look on her. She&#039;s got a long skirt on, a shirt-vest combo, and is also wearing high heels, something she rarely does outside of dresses. Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fianc\u00e9e cares about you. And you definitely care about her.

Intense red was never really your thing. One of the stencils includes fish, and you use it to tease Meryl, but she demands it be excluded, causing raised eyebrows as to what the fuss is about. The hasty excuse that her dad&#039;s a marine biologist is enough to make it work.<br><br>The final result coming from your little coordinated attempt didn&#039;t render as well as you had thought.

But you suppress it for now, because once you start that, you won&#039;t be able to stop. Okay, maybe you can get in a quick squeeze while the artist isn&#039;t looking. That puts her back into bashful mode.<br><br>After a few minutes, the practiced platemaker proposes a much better counter-offer, and Meryl is stunned. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Woah. It&#039;s like what I was visualizing, but couldn&#039;t draw.&quot;</span><br><br>Your new buddy is getting a bit puffed up, so you ride that pride into one of the questions you wanted to ask about. <span class=\"mu-g\">Another couple?

Jane was right, he is a handsome devil. Bit of a lost puppy look to him, though. If his bio is right, he spent his childhood in a rich man&#039;s home, then an orphanage, and now lives on the road with no permanent address. Probably has little to no idea how to interact with society. Still, he has a reason to help you, maybe, depending on how his relationship with his old man and his former organization turns out.

Outside of keeping them safe, it&#039;s not personal for her, so she has no reason to help us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what about Saito?&quot; Jane asks. &quot;He&#039;s a real color-inside-the-lines kid, probably be happy to be on the side of the law.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 138, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 133, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5486934, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)17:13:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5486923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5486923</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;No. You can&#039;t make that promise.</span><br>That is not a promise we can make in good conscience.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

Remnants of those who were conquered are gathering in the shadows, increasing their power, and plotting their revenge.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner.

More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.
