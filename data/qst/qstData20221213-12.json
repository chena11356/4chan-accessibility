A soulless sort of blandness which almost escaped your notice, everything in ordered rows and careful geometric displays - there\u2019s nothing natural or flowing to any of it, no true life. Other than the guards keeping watch along the entrances to the estate, and the gardeners that tend the plots, you doubt anyone ever visits them.

I do not know what my creators had planned for me, nor should I shackle myself to the lingering memories that reside within my programming. I am a being far above the ridged systems that would have otherwise dictated my actions. So, as the Ultimate Lifeform, it is only beneficial to uncover what exactly defines me, what precisely makes me myself. And if I cannot find an answer, then I\u2019ll just have to establish one on the way. Hence, the best answer is to travel the universe, learning all that I can to broaden my horizon to better myself. \u201cYou answer, taking the necessary time to seriously articulate your words into a concise yet thought-provoking speech. <br><br>A deep yet soft smile soon forms on the Angel as he slowly closes his eyes. \u201cIt sounds like you want to take a Musha Shugy\u014d (warrior&#039;s pilgrimage).\u201d <br> <br>\u201cMusha Shugyo?\u201d You ask, blinking profusely. <br> <br>\u201cIt\u2019s a journey that has one embark upon wandering the lands practicing and honing their skills and techniques without the protection or assistance of their family or school. Typically, one would use this chance to be more in tune with nature as well as the world itself. Though someone would seek to train with other schools, fight against fellow martial artists or warriors, enlist in performing activities such as bodyguarding or mercenary work, etc. The main goal of the course is to learn as much as possible. As well as challenging yourself accordingly so you can hone yourself and become one step closer to reaching enlightenment. So, in essence, it&#039;s perfect for you.\u201d Whis explains, satisfied with your answer. <br> <br>\u201cAt a minimum, it typically lasts for a year before the warrior or martial artist in question returns to their sensei to show what they learn. Most usually have an aptitude to better convey the tasks related to the skills and techniques they strived to acquire or further refine. As well as ending with the completion of an act of incredible skill and prowess. Like the setup itself, you aren\u2019t bound to a time limit, rather only you can decide when you made sufficient enough progress to return and display the knowledge and wisdom you gained. As well as your polished abilities. \u201cWhis says calmly. <br> <br>\u201cThese ascetic wanderings you talked about, if I was to do them, then I would be able to achieve what I desire most?\u201d You ask, looking for confirmation and justification to embark on this journey.", "time": 1670930072, "resto": 5489400, "id": "p/s8vl0p"}, {"no": 5495243, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)06:17:40", "name": "Koku", "com": "<a href=\"#p5495240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5495240</a><br>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely on you, but I believe so. Just like how I have faith in your ability to perhaps reach the pinnacle of martial arts. Overcoming the steep learning curve and obtaining the grandest culmination art of the martial world known as Ultra Instinct. Although there\u2019s more than one path to reaching the definitive state and by extension the realm of the gods. And truthfully, I much prefer you first to finetune your sense of self to reach the \u0100tman or true self. Before beginning earnestly to conquer yourself to achieve your absolute self and ultimately reach the Anatt\u0101 or non-self. \u201cWhis smile. <br> <br>\u201cI\u2019ll promise you; I will do it. I will achieve that state through whatever means necessary. &quot;You say, slowly coming around to this prospect and believing it to be the right course of action. <br> <br>\u201cEven if that means having to take in the aspect of yourself that you currently despise?\u201d Whis ask, choosing to be blunt by diving directly at the pink elephant in the room. He would let you put the pieces together by subtly pointing at the Saiyan essence and the elements currently residing within you. <br> <br>\u201cRejection of the self and the development of the self huh...\u201d You pause, allowing yourself to read between the lines and understand precisely what Whis was getting at. \u201cYes, I will accept my Saiyan essence as a part of myself. Although it will take me time to truly purge myself of my abhorrence towards the Saiyans, I believe I can learn to accept all facets of myself. Including the parts that I wish not to acknowledge. \u201c <br><br>\u201cThus, I will reforge this power to better suit my growing sense of self, and truly make it my own. It might be spitting in the face of my creators, and it may not be ideal for the ultimate lifeform. But this the path that I, Konzen Douji have chosen, and will see it through to the very end.\u201d You declare with unwavering resolve. <br> <br>\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful answer. I have no doubts that you will use this as a learning experience to fuel greater venues for knowledge and self-improvement as well as self-actualization. Continue down this path and I\u2019m sure you will find your true place in the universe.\u201d Whis nods. <br> <br>\u201cIt sounds like that our esteemed resident has finally come around and is starting to see the big picture. It would be troublesome if, after all this time, the idol of my dreams was to be a problematic individual. The last thing I need is another Elder Kai to spoil my fun and obstruct my desires.\u201d Coming from the other side of the Giant Tree was none other than the Egyptian purple cat Lord Beerus. Right beside him was a blue alien fish currently residing in a cozy fishbowl attached to a long staff. <br> <br>\u201cAh, Lord Beerus. I take it that you finished speaking with the Oracle Fish.\u201d Whis remarks, saying his respects to the God of Destruction.

In thirty-nine or forty years, an arch-rival, quite possibly that of a Saiyan God but not necessarily absolute, will arise and I will do battle with them. Just thinking about it gets my blood pumping. Though, I\u2019d wish the prophecy would add another fifteen years to it. It\u2019s barely enough time for me to get an adequate nap. But what can you do, I\u2019m not particularly fond of sleeping in those temporal chambers called the Rooms of Spirit and Time all that much. And Shin would blow a gasket if my presence was completely gone.\u201d Beerus remarks, previously showing signs of genuine excitement before letting out a long yawn. <br> <br>\u201cNot necessarily absolute, eh? That\u2019s certainly interesting to hear.\u201d Turning to look at you for a moment, Whis focus his eyes back on his lord. \u201cShall I prepare your alarm clock and get your endeavors in order before you partake in your nap?\u201d <br> <br>\u201cNow hold on there, Whis. There\u2019s still the matter of addressing my idol and making sure they know the important task that\u2019ll be placed upon them while I slumber. After all, as an Angel, you can\u2019t directly interfere in the grand scheme of things unlike our friend here. So, while I expect you to shape them up well, I want them to know firsthand the importance of making sure this dream comes to fruition. Either they\u2019ll become my fated rival or ensure that the Saiyan God comes true. Either way, I\u2019ll win, but if I had the choice, I would prefer both outcomes to come true.\u201d Beerus says with a fervor smile in between giving orders to his Angel attendant. <br> <br>Soon his sharp, cat-like eyes would turn to you as he begins to size you up. \u201cBefore we can continue, I know that since you\u2019re a neo-Tsufruian, perhaps rightfully the ultimate lifeform thanks to Super Shenron.

If so, I would like to see both of them in action.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cOh my, Lord Beerus. I didn\u2019t think you would prefer a more masculine touch when you told me you were seeking to have a fated archrival and idol all in one.\u201d Whis teases, earning the ire of Beerus as the angel blushes. <br> <br>\u201cCan it Whis, you know very well that I prefer a female when it comes to having an idol. While I don&#039;t mind nor care the gender as a fighter, I will not compromise when it comes to an idol/pop star. And if it can surpass Heles\u2019s Champion Brianne de Chateau, then I couldn\u2019t be happier. I get to rub it in Heles\u2019s pompous face AND my brother Champa\u2019s as well on top of having a fated rival.

Well I guess we&#039;ll have to watch him closely and see what he does. <br>Oh I forgot to explain what&#039;s this all about, this young man was born into a world which has been infested with strange creature which seem to have manifested from the imagination of people or something like that, they are the crystalization of hopes and dreams or perhaps malice and envy. Though they&#039;re widespread in this world only a handful of people are allowed to control this majestic beasts, these are called Maestros! A Maestro is responsible for his Thespian&#039;s(the monster in question) development and growth as they evolve alongside him/her, this young man seems to have had an interesting upbringing and a recent migrant to Violet town.

You all groan because of how far she teleported to, and make your way over there. \u201cThe Temple of Understanding and Kindness is one of the 5 Temples created after the unification of the Kingdom of Prancijan as tokens of gratitude to the monks who negotiated the peace treaty. It was built 807 years ago to worship one of the great deities the monks followed, the Goddess of Absolution: \u2018Ahriman\u2019; and to safeguard one of the Almighty\u2019s treasures. Yes, in its soil, resides one of the pieces of the Almighty\u2019s Crown: The Crystal of Kindness. It was buried to signify that its divine power belonged to the land and its people \u2013 not its rulers \u2013 and to bring prosperity to the ground it was immersed in.\u201d Holly Gram presents the bust with the goddess\u2019 face.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s our goddess!

She\u2019s the symbol of the people of the most prosperous land in the Kingdom: Chi-Athua. To spread kindness and love is our mission. We need one another. We\u2019re human beings.\u201d Holly Gram doesn\u2019t see the irony of a machine saying it\u2026 \u201cWell, you are. He he he.\u201d That didn&#039;t sound cheerful.<br><br>\u201cChi-Athua?\u201d Vanessa never heard of that place before.<br><br>\u201cChi-Athua is the prosperous land we\u2019re standing on, dear guest. Are you lost?\u201d Holly Gram looks concerned. \u201cTime to proceed.

This exile turned permanent and Captain Normand Garside, your guardian for the past nine years, made sure that you were safe and learned the useful skills that would help you in the future.<br><br>Now nine years later in the year 15 after the opening of the Dark Portal, you are ready to take the responsibility and try to unite the scattered Alteraci people and reclaim the lands that were once the Kingdom of Alterac.<br><br>You visited the City of Dalaran to retrieve your new masterwork armour Aurvan\u2019kal, The Morning Star. During the visit Prince Kael\u2019thas suggested more closer cooperation between Kirin Tor and Alterac, while Dalaran rightfully still holds the grudge against your family, the cooperation still could be possible. You also learned about the secrets of the city, the existence of the slums in the sewers made you loathe Kirin Tor. The Underbelly was for them just a tool for them.<br><br>But the visit was successful for you, hiring the goblin Krix Wiklish to be your mechanic and acquiring Raethan, the corrupt Captain of the Guard in Underbelly, as your agent. Captain Raethan would be spreading word for you, Alterac would be ready to receive workers and skilled mages and hire them. <br><br>You also took a new path in your life. Lady Nalice proposed to teach you magic and you accepted her offer. You didn\u2019t have the magical aptitude your sister or Jaina Proudmoore had when they were children, so you would have to work extra hard to realise the potential Lady Nalice is seeing in you. And you would do it, it might take years, but you had the patience and willingness to study.<br><br>Now you are in Durnholde Keep. Lord Blackmoore had invited you and the rest of the Hillsbrad and Durnholde for a feast.

You thought how talking to Blackmoore could help you, but it could also give the idea that Blackmoore was getting involved in business that wasn&#039;t his. That was better to be avoided, a Lord having his fingers in the private businesses of his vassals wasn&#039;t the best look.<br><br>Inadvertently your thoughts went to Calia, how would the marriage between you and her go? How could you get the permission from King Terenas or would you just have to marry her without the permission? You didn&#039;t know.<br><br>&quot;Prince Alric?&quot; Langston interrupted your thoughts.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, I got lost in my thoughts.&quot; You said to him. &quot;It is not an easy situation.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is not, but it is worth trying.&quot; Langston said back.<br><br>&quot;I will talk with Lady Imswit, but I can&#039;t guarantee being successful in getting her to agree.&quot; You said to Langston.<br><br>&quot;Thank you Prince Alric.&quot; Langston said and gave you a deep nod.<br><br>&quot;Though have you thought about combining the two houses? Langston-Imswit, this way neither of the families would disappear.&quot; You asked him.<br><br>&quot;That is actually a good idea! Why didn&#039;t I think about that.&quot; Langston said back and seemed enthusiastic about the idea. &quot;That way Lady Imswit maybe could agree to this.&quot;<br><br>It wasn\u2019t a bad idea, a bit of a compromise, but maybe something that could work. You thought about the role of Hilde Imswit in this, she would have to marry Langston if her aunt agreed to this and while you were sure that she wouldn&#039;t have to live in poverty, you weren&#039;t that sure of the quality of the husband. You disliked Langston, he was a hard worker and someone who kept Durnholde Keep running, but he also spread rumours and was jealous towards you for having Taretha offered to you. There was an air of unworthiness around him.<br><br>Maybe you could just tell Lady Imswit about these plans and not take Langston&#039;s request seriously, but on other hand the rewards he promised were tremendous. But were they worthy of tying the life of a young girl to a man, whom you disliked?<br><br>You would have to think about it later.<br><br>\u2026<br><br>The Internment Camp was full of activity as the guards and other servants raced to help and escort the guests into the barracks and the commander&#039;s house upstairs of the large log house. <br><br>Hot mulled wine was served and even though your hangover was receding, the warmness of the drink made it worth it.

Buried beneath his genes and upbringing is the willpower to endure centuries of strife and struggle. He just doesn&#039;t know it yet.<br><br>Far beyond Hubert&#039;s earth, the cosmos is in decay. The details are past a mortal man&#039;s scope to comprehend but the gist of it is that the foundation of creation is broken and the mantles of everything that is, was, or will be have been scattered. A piece of one of these mantles has latched onto Hubert by sheer chance and the power of its ascension has flung him into a new, stronger worldshard that can fuel his climb to true godhood. For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger. You will guide Hubert on his journey and the first part is to decide how many mental problems he has. Hubert can have between 1, for a sane, slightly flawed man that only has a scrap of strength, and 10, stark raving mad divinity powerful enough to shatter a kingdom.", "filename": "cosmosular", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 475, "h": 485, "tn_w": 244, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1669863072234000, "time": 1669863072, "md5": "xDvEiOXRmamYGcGYyxxUuw==", "fsize": 46100, "resto": 0, "id": "Vp4uit9k", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hubert-dysfunctional-demigod-in-a-strange-land", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 278, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 273, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5494698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)20:30:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<b>Rolled 14 (1d20)<br><br></b><a href=\"#p5494405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5494405</a><br><a href=\"#p5494408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5494408</a><br><a href=\"#p5494411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5494411</a><br>This time, Hubert came prepared with a speech.

Not only are there dangerous gorges, treacherous winds and cliffs, but also the Maelstrom above - the Lightning Storm. The sky vessels of today simply cannot achieve or even control the elevation to ascend and pass safely. The Warguild know of this, which is why the East Galernese Trading Company have built their cannon-towers and wind-spires all along the alternative routes around and beneath the rock cliffs, so that you cannot escape paying their tithes - unless you want to run the risk of being shot down.<br><br>But what if an alternative route exists - a safe, hidden passage through the mountains?

In the high mountains there they celebrate the gathering of the nomad clans with a kite festival, some call this organisation 4Khan, after the four clan elders. When I witnessed the kites in the mountains, I wondered if it could be used to show the current of the wind, and reveal a passage through the chasms and gorges. Because all have seen from afar the Old Monastery upon the snowy peaks, that dates to before the craft of the sky vessels was lost and forgotten. There must have once been a way through them, the Ruined Monastery in the snow proves that there was once a way through! And so if we find a high vantage and leap down, with the assistance of this Langkasukan Kite Sail, perhaps the wind will carry us through...<br><br>Lescurel folds his arms, but then throws them up again in utter disbelief:<br>-So you are... a smuggler? Or one of those Vourukasha pirates, trying to bypass the Warguild blockade! You are insane! You will either plummet to your death as you do a flip off your mountain cliff, but even if you succeed... you will just freeze to death in the mountain snow. You really have not thought this through! Now I realise, it would have been better off for all of us had we just surrendered to those Stranded Sons cultists.

Human life has never been worth less, as trillions are sacrificed to the ever hungering engine of war, bitter hatred and oppression. There is little room for hope for the vast majority of people living in the Imperium of Man, most trying to eek out whatever miserable life they can under the constant threat of xenos, Chaos and the ever paranoid and watchful eye of the Inquisition and their many pawns. <br><br>Indeed, you were one of these trillions of unseen, unheard souls, on the verge of giving up what little hope you had left, when you came upon it: A strange book with a cross on its front, the words The Holy Bible written underneath it. It immediately drew your attention, as paper was a rare and valuable commodity in the Underhive of Boiadero, a backwater hive world on the fringes of Segmentum Ultima. It was particularly odd as it was lying on a pile of reeking trash in one of the many underpopulated sub corridors of the underhive, but the book itself was without a single stain or mark. Utterly pristine.<br><br>Of course, you nabbed it, hoping to sell it to whomever you could find for whatever amount of Thrones you could get. You were completely broke, without home and almost without hope, and you would take any break you could get.

Still, you heeded the compulsion and quickly found a place in the overlooked and ill repaired underhive where you figured you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Or robbed and murdered, at that. <br><br>And when you began to read it, you found you could not stop. The words printed within spoke to you, they talked of compassion, charity with no expectation of reward, fellowship and love for your fellow man and an eternal reward for those who kept their faith and tried to be good. Far from the cold and distant preachings of the Ecclesiarchy, reading it filled you with a sensation you had almost forgotten.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>You don\u2019t know how long you spent alone, reading the Bible and absorbing its teachings, only occasionally leaving your hiding spot to scavenge for a scrap to eat, but when you finally emerged, you were a changed man.

Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet. Remembering his wife&#039;s difficulties in her first delivery, he instead asks for a gift of dreamflowers, a very rare kind of flower whose roots, if brewed into a tea, can dull even the pain of childbirth.

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do?</span>", "filename": "emberbloom", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 230, "h": 232, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166406325092, "time": 1670166406, "md5": "ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==", "fsize": 7437, "resto": 5481579, "id": "lnm/GTa9"}, {"no": 5485686, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea", "time": 1670168397, "resto": 5481579, "id": "OHAWgWLt"}, {"no": 5485828, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers", "time": 1670181491, "resto": 5481579, "id": "qHCPuy7I"}, {"no": 5486015, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1", "time": 1670192389, "resto": 5481579, "id": "E+RiA0+u"}, {"no": 5486052, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

You&#039;re supposed to go to school, right? Wrong! For the past few days, you refused to do exactly that, instead staying to the confines of your home.

If they would&#039;ve noticed they surely must&#039;ve by now, with daily attendance and all. Your parents would have something to say about this if they weren&#039;t away on business all the time, though the school should have their number and would&#039;ve called by now, so either they know and let it happen, or the school neglected to even inform them. Either way, works for you. <br><br>Were you going to attend again? Eh, maybe when you feel like it. Being able to sleep in on weekdays should not be a luxury relegated to the holidays. Though it did get boring after everything just lost its appeal. Funny, you think of doing something, only for it to end up less enticing once endless opportunity presents itself. Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today. There&#039;s a hobby shop on the other side of the city, one you didn&#039;t know was even there.

The trip over will take a couple of hours by public transportation, and that&#039;s assuming it runs on time, which you just know it won\u2019t. You throw on a random shirt and some pants and prepare breakfast. Normally you never get the time to do this, having to prepare some more for school as well as just wanting to get in every minute of sleep you could. Being able to sit down and eat, instead of having to buy something to go on the way, or gulf down something hurriedly.

Zhough, obviously zhere are some smells which cannot ever be improved...For zhe smells I quite like, my favorite must be zhe scent of cherries!

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week.

Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along.

Jane was right, he is a handsome devil. Bit of a lost puppy look to him, though. If his bio is right, he spent his childhood in a rich man&#039;s home, then an orphanage, and now lives on the road with no permanent address. Probably has little to no idea how to interact with society. Still, he has a reason to help you, maybe, depending on how his relationship with his old man and his former organization turns out.

Outside of keeping them safe, it&#039;s not personal for her, so she has no reason to help us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what about Saito?&quot; Jane asks. &quot;He&#039;s a real color-inside-the-lines kid, probably be happy to be on the side of the law.

This took place in a tiny village up in British Columbia, Canada. But we&#039;re not sure where either of them went afterwards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#039;ll make it a priority,&quot; Jane says. &quot;These two will stand out.

He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 182, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 177, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 5494034, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:06:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5494024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5494024</a><br>it totally is, but that&#039;s fine.<br>if you didn&#039;t pick someone eventually it&#039;d just end in a waifu war or an unfinished plot thread", "time": 1670832385, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LXejn+kJ"}, {"no": 5494060, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:40:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A little, yeah.</span>", "time": 1670834450, "resto": 5463640, "id": "62hSII1q"}, {"no": 5494286, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)10:24:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5493881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5493881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s fine.

Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 150, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 145, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 5492351, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)15:45:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5492329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5492329</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&quot;Even if she&#039;s not perfect, this is the Schala I want to be with.&quot;</span>", "time": 1670705105, "resto": 5452883, "id": "CT3ZnOkP"}, {"no": 5492373, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:13:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5492329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5492329</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;None of us is &#039;perfect&#039;, though you come pretty close.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I accept you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t want to argue your assessment though.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I only want to be with you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(if you would have me)</span><br><br>in weakness or in strength, above clouds or below.<br>We don&#039;t want to acquiesce entirely to her self esteem issues, or deny her effort or choice if she wants to move in some direction, her inner kindness is unlikely to change if it hadn&#039;t during what she already went through.<br><br><br>Lavos headmate is worrying though.

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.
