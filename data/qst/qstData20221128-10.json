Separated from the rest of your party, the two of you set off to rehydrate your shrink-dried worm Annie. Then you discover that the sacred waterfall has an 8-hour line.<br><br>You send most of Gil off to go stand in the line while you and the rest of Gil investigate the volunteer tents set up by the &quot;liaisons&quot; of the sea gods. To Gil&#039;s consternation, you can barely fight the compulsion to murder one of the liaisons, instead invoking the divine &#039;red stuff&#039; inside you to ultra-commune with him. You wind up underneath(?) the goo ocean, where you have a surprisingly civil and pleasant conversation with &quot;Us,&quot; a hivemind of several thousand people who drowned and were rendered into goo. Us tells you that the the festival is a comforting &quot;dream&quot; created from their collective memories, and that you&#039;re free to stay or go from it, provided you don&#039;t disturb anything. You awaken back inside the &quot;dream&quot; and find Gil missing.<br><br>As (most of) Gil, you&#039;re pissy about having to stand in line, and have gone off instead to get your divine blessing permanently extracted. You accidentally have a spiritual awakening instead.<br><br>As Madrigal, you are very wet and very bemused when Lester Six attempts to trick you into opening the mysteriously blocked STORAGE door. You work on learning how to work your goo body, which pleases Pat. She opens up about her situation-- she&#039;s under death threats from the inhuman(?) Management, who also kidnapped the real Lester. You&#039;re unsympathetic and blow up on her when she proposes experimenting on you to get the goo snake done faster. Pat gives you the cold shoulder the rest of the night, and you pass out on the couch.<br><br>Back as Charlotte, you find Gil, then find... Gil, who is acting all weird and uppity. He magycks you, causing you to cough up what looks awfully like a dead Richard-snake, then prompts you to admit to the whole ritual murder fiasco. He&#039;s confused about why you&#039;re so upset about it, Richard being Richard, but hugs you supportively when you start ugly crying. You calm down in time to spot a plume of smoke rising from elsewhere in the festival.<br><br>Your investigation of the smoke is stopped by some random guy. Pissed off by his audacity, you&#039;re overtaken by the red stuff and twist him into being your (and the Wyrm&#039;s) mindless servant. You don&#039;t snap out of it after, forcing Gil to tackle and magyck you. You commune with the &quot;dream&quot; and convince it the fire-- the *real* fire, almost certainly set by Lucky-- is totally normal and sensical. This works, and you&#039;re warped across the festival: you&#039;ve been arrested on suspect of starting the fire, and Lucky is your interrogator. You snap him out of it, then go find Arledge.

It was easy to forget that she was actually pretty strong physically, on top of everything else.<br><br>\u201cThe Master of the Servant up there: he calls himself Abraxas. He knows how to use telepathy and wanted to share information on the other Servants we\u2019ve encountered up to now, and I agreed. We can head back to Caster\u2019s hideout in a few minutes.\u201d You answer.<br><br>You noticed an anxious grimace flash onto on Avenger\u2019s face when you mentioned the other Master\u2019s use of telepathy, which she substantiated when she replied, \u201cGather information on other Servants, but make it quick and be careful. It\u2019s rare for even magi to be able to immediately form coherent telepathic connections with complete strangers.

Since it was my suggestion I should begin: one Servant we encountered was a Saber wielding two swords who was able to jump around surprisingly well by using a type of Mana Burst skill. We encountered him a few miles to the southeast of here this morning. We weren\u2019t able to provoke him into revealing his Noble Phantasms\u2019 names before he disengaged, but I do believe his shorter sword had mystic protections on it, making his Magic Resistance extremely high.\u201d </span><br><br>It sounds just like the Saber of Black that Rushorou was telling you about earlier. Extremely high magic Resistance though? That might be difficult for your Servant to fight; although shortly after you met her, she said that even a Servant with A-ranked would be within her ability to defeat. Who can say? You reply, <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cI see. I suppose we can trade one for one. There was an Assassin who made a hit and run attack with thrown daggers far south of here. I didn\u2019t really get a great look at him, but he had a skull-face and dark robes with a hood. The daggers looked inert as they impacted the ground, but then glowed red before exploding. Worth looking out for.\u201d </span><br><br>Abraxas answered, <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cIndeed. Now, a Servant to the west of here was called \u2018Kuro no Archer\u2019, though he didn\u2019t actually use a bow, but rather some kind of spiked wheel. My Servant called it an \u2018oversized chakram\u2019. His mental state also seemed more like what I would have expected from someone designated a Berserker. He was quite strong, my Rider had to fight him rather seriously to drive him off.\u201d </span><br><br>An Archer that doesn\u2019t use a bow? Who would have thought of something like that? On to the next Servant, you say <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cNot far from where the Assassin appeared, we encountered \u2018Kuro no Lancer\u2019, whose true name I\u2019m pretty sure is Sun Wukong. He used a quarterstaff to fight, was able to create copies of himself from his hairs that were nearly as strong as he was, though they were unarmed, and they were able to rapidly heal from injuries, so I suspect the same is true for him.\u201d </span><br><br><span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cHe\u2019s an exceedingly powerful hero from oriental mythology if I\u2019m not mistaken. I must commend you for pressuring him enough to reveal his power and decipher his true name.\u201d </span> The other Master said, so far unaware of your allies who contributed significantly to that effort, before continuing, <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cMy Servant also fought an Archer of Red across the river to the north of here. His power isn\u2019t remarkable, but he\u2019s proven difficult to pin down and eliminate in spite of that. He appears to use a small crossbow and mechanical traps, though they didn\u2019t amount to much against my Servant.\u201d </span>", "time": 1669594705, "resto": 5475120, "id": "0ATN5I0L", "trip": "!!A9p5Qjj4pzy"}, {"no": 5478443, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)19:20:51", "name": "Low Speed Anti-Divine QM", "com": "Knowing ahead of time that an enemy will rely on traps or ambushes could definitely prove beneficial, you reason, then say <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cFurther south we fought another fairly strong Servant designated Aka no Rider, an African who had an army at his command as well as armor that we believe is a divine artifact. We inflicted heavy casualties on his forces, but he might be able to replenish them over time. There was also an Archer who was assisting him, but we didn\u2019t get a good look at whoever it was, as we withdrew shortly after the Archer attacked.\u201d </span> You decide you may as well describe both of them at once since you didn\u2019t have much information to offer regarding the latter.<br><br><span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cVery good. The last I have to offer is further southeast of where we engaged the Saber, we heard some rather beautiful music playing. Since I enjoyed listening to it from a distance, I dissuaded my Servant from attacking them. If you would refrain from doing so as well, at least for tomorrow, I would appreciate it.\u201d </span> Abraxas said<br><br>It struck you as a bit odd that he would take liberties like that during a war, but you answer, <span class=\"mu-i\"> \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have more pressing matters to deal with tomorrow. I should also warn you that I encountered a suspicious man who claimed to be \u2018the overseer\u2019, accompanied by a Servant in black armor.

That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along.

No use beating around the bush.<br><br><span class=\"mu-g\">&quot;Mom, Meryl&#039;s not entirely human.&quot;</span> When you start explaining to Mom, she pays close attention. At first, you don&#039;t notice a change in expression. But over time, the mixture of Meryl&#039;s slowly growing panic and your own clenching fist tell you that this description isn&#039;t going as well as you thought it was. Mom&#039;s eyes narrow, her head tilts, and a wide, shallow smile spreads over her face. No teeth appear. She doesn&#039;t interrupt you, she doesn&#039;t say anything. Did she have that many wrinkles a moment ago?<br><br>You describe everything you know, from the gills to the claws to the eyes to how Mrs. Cier doesn&#039;t have proper hair on her head. The depths of the ocean. The visual experience involving Dagon. The explanations are so vivid she should be able to visualize everything you speak about as if she were there in person. In fact, Meryl&#039;s eyes even flash that crystalline form they do when you&#039;re alone with her mystic form. Mom saw that, right? She can see that, right? You&#039;re not going insane. <br><br>Meryl&#039;s true nature is a continuous fact to you, and you swam with her at depths that wouldn&#039;t be possible if you were lying. But you&#039;re feeling intense pressure to renounce everything you just said, to &#039;admit&#039; that it was all a delusion. Human beings are programmed at a physiological level to fit in: Infants denied comfort have a higher mortality rate, for instance. This is totally against that. American society may think the supernatural exists, but not something you can prove, and certainly not someone you can marry. Continuing to speak, even to one person, is like giving a speech to a murderous crowd. If Meryl weren&#039;t right here, you couldn&#039;t believe it yourself.<br><br>&quot;Alex.&quot; You&#039;re finally interrupted, the thought you had vanishing in the presence of an innocuous question. You wait for some sort of scathing commentary on how you&#039;ve been taken in by Meryl, but it doesn&#039;t come. Instead, she beams angelically. &quot;Do you mind taking my car to go on a grocery run? We&#039;re short on some staples, there&#039;s a note on the fridge.&quot;<br><br>You&#039;re stunned for a second, and Meryl is as well. <span class=\"mu-g\">Mom, what?</span><br><br>&quot;Just a short nip out for goods, because you two are here.&quot; She smiles, but it&#039;s a stock expression, not a genuine one. &quot;Please, Alex. Meryl and I need to have some girl talk time.&quot; This reminds you of Red Riding Hood again... and Roald Dahl.<br><br>Meryl thinks it over with an intense sweat, before saying, <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Alex, it&#039;s fine.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;No, it&#039;s not.&quot; Stay and demand a response.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mom&#039;s made up her mind.

He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai.

Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder.

She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Check the locks, shine a light into the corners and see if anything jumps out, stuff like that. As is you&#039;re in danger, but if you get jumped by something else in here there may not even be time to regret it. You only have one life, so better safe than sorry.<br><br>If anything is in here it heard you break the window open, so there&#039;s probably no need for stealth. You pull out your flashlight and shine it around the room. Besides the place generally being kind of cluttered, nothing stands out as particularly odd. A set of large cooking knives sits on the counter, of which you take one before hiding the rest in a cabinet. You think the golf club is probably a safer weapon given that you can use it from a range, but hey, it&#039;s better to have more options than not.<br><br>While you could feasibly see someone cramming themselves into one of the many counter cabinets or even the fridge if they emptied it, you don&#039;t have all the time in the world right now, so you forgo a more thorough examination of the room and go to the room to your right. A quick scan of it reveals that it&#039;s just a laundry room. You throw open the doors to the washer and dryer while you&#039;re there, but find nothing. In fact, the only thing of note in here is the startling amount of dirty clothes scattered about and the unpleasant smell they give off, driving you to quickly make your exit.<br><br>The door opposite of the laundry room, as you expected, leads to the garage. It&#039;s almost as cold as outside, and a faint smell of gasoline fills the air. An old, red convertible serves as a centerpiece. Shining your flashlight inside finds it empty. Your attention then turns to... everything else. A few half-finished carpentry projects are scattered about and several storage racks sit against the side of the garage, piled high with miscellany such as nails, wood, and what you think is a bow on a top shelf. It looks a little too high to reach, but maybe if you poked around for a second you could find a stepladder? Something to consider after you make sure the living room is clear, you suppose.<br><br>While you&#039;d like to know if the garage door still works without power you decide against it considering the attention it might draw from anything outside. From there, you head to the living room. As you shine your flashlight across the room you frown slightly, confused. Someone left an entire pair of clothes: shirt, jeans, underwear, and all, on the couch, partially covered up by a blanket. Maybe someone fell asleep down here watching TV and then undressed themselves and headed to their bedroom?

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

As the drone retreats away from the door back to the center of the hallway, you scrabble around for your spear, before remembering that it is still tied to your suit. Concerned about prematurely provoking the drone, you keep the spear close to the ground. But as you contemplate on whether or not you should risk creeping forward or not, it occurs to you that you might have better luck if you used brief window of opportunity that you get from feeding the drone the lines in Primitive to get the spear into position, and then try to get the drone to slam into the tip, instead of the other way around. At the very least, it has to be worth a shot, right? <br><br>&quot;Start of Line. Range of address, four cubits. Target of address, drone. Purpose of address, locomotion full stop and power down. Time of address, effective immediately and effective immediately. End of Line.&quot; <br><br>As soon as the drone stops shuffling, you squat down, and angle the spear up, so that it is pointing towards the \u2018fleshy\u2019 part of the bottom of the bale. You are just eyeballing it through the darkening tint of your auto-visor and the stark light of the drone\u2019s lamp, but you think that you got the spear tip just outside of the doorway. Recalling the wrapper that you threw, you make small, circular movements with the tip, hoping to bait the drone into an attack. Moments later, the drone snaps back into action and hurtles itself onto the point, adjusting its position incrementally as it accelerates. You stay stock still as the distance closes \u2013 waiting for the drone to hit the tip. And as soon as you feel the drone on the other end of the spear, you throw all of the force that you can muster into one monstrous thrust, again using the boosters on your suit to ram yourself forward while your boots remain magnetically anchored to the ground. <br><br>The result is beautiful. Short of somehow knocking the drone out, you don\u2019t imagine that it could have gone better. You feel \u2013 and see! \u2013 the razor wire parting, the bale giving way. Moving quickly, you press the spear to the right and then further up, with all of your might, hoping to get it securely stuck in there. As you do, you feel something give way, and you notice that one of the legs is now out of alignment. While all of this is happening, the drone is getting more and more desperate. Instead of slowing down and stopping, it is getting more and more violent, no doubt trying to destroy the interloper in its body. <br><br>You hold yourself steady for a moment, partially to catch your breath and organize your thoughts, and partially to make sure that the drone is not going to be able to pull itself off of the spear.", "filename": "Alignment", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 557, "h": 118, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 26, "tim": 1669608829652597, "time": 1669608829, "md5": "nwo4ipWqniOpf22QdK0DSg==", "fsize": 27031, "resto": 5444794, "id": "tclCgq9D"}, {"no": 5478675, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)23:16:51", "name": "TrashQM", "com": "Once you have recovered and satisfied yourself, you begin the process of pulling the drone into the door frame.

End of Line.&quot; <br><br>It seems however, that trick only works when the drone is not touching anything. You might have expected as much, but it was still worth trying. Still, with the drone on the other end of the spear, you are feeling pretty good about yourself \u2013 until you drag the drone into the open doorway. As soon as you have it where you want it, the drone changes its tactics again. It immediately stops all shuffling, instead it focuses exclusively on slamming itself back and forth in the doorway, doing everything it can to dislodge itself. Suddenly, you find yourself at an impasse. If you cut your boosters, and deactivate the magnets on your boots, then surely the drone is going to pull itself free from the spear and retreat back into the hallway. But you can\u2019t reach the ratcheting crank from here.<br> <br>As you watch, your stomach sinking into your boots, the pocket door begins to buckle under the onslaught, and finely shredded pieces of conduit worm \u2013 either loosened from where they were trapped in the bale or stirred up into the stripped down room \u2013 billow into the room. Alarmed, you disengage one of the boots, hoping that you are going to be able to walk yourself over to the crank, and fearing that doing so means that you are going to lose the drone. <br><br>The second the boot disengages, you are pushed <span class=\"mu-s\">back</span>. <br><br>Jesus Christ. The drone isn\u2019t attempting to get out \u2013 it is trying to get in. Teetering on the brink of panic, you do your best to keep walking towards the crank regardless, magnetizing and anchoring one boot at a time. But you are taking too long. By the time that you get halfway there, the drone has completely busted the door open and is pressing against you. Desperate, you decide to try to shift the thing towards the smaller hole you cut into this room instead, figuring that you might have better luck getting it stuck between two of the struts than you would getting it back in the doorway and the door closed again. <br><br>The drone is basically trying to rush you. Twice you try to shepherd the drone one step at a time \u2013 and you manage to make some progress, but the drone manages to flank you and before you know it, you are the one being walked into a corner.

Your last case as a private eye was just six months ago, assisting attorneys in the case of the murder of Lloyd Johnson at his own estate in Houston. It was routine. The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt.

The gangrenous tissue would require an extensive procedure (later on) to excise and then heal over time as it is a significant amount of area on her body.<br><br>Otherwise for a sudden &quot;peel&quot; of skin, it would really depend on the severity of the wound as to whether it could be mended. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would she have known Alys before all that?</span><br>They very could have known each other.

This thought that you already knew deep down spreads through the crowd and burrows into the minds of even her children, no matter how heretical they may think it is.<br><br>None of them has ever seen their mom struggle, let alone be hurt by someone. They thought they were invincible, their strength infallible. More than the legions of homies that your men have destroyed and more than all the bruises they received, this lone act managed to dampen their morale. Now there is room for doubt. And like a festering wound its taint spreads quickly. Now the Big Mom Pirates no longer have the certainty of victory.<br><br>And that&#039;s not all. The Silver Pirates may be tired. They may have given themselves a handicap by not using lethal attacks and they may be outnumbered. But now their fervor builds. Like sharks in the water they can smell the blood and know what it means. Murray roars to his fellows.<br>&quot;SILVERS! DRAG THEM TO THE NEW AGE!&quot;<br><br>After they let out a warcry the fighting breaks out again. The only two people who don&#039;t join them and coincidentally the only two people who do not react to this shift in the tide of battle are you and Mama. At first it seems like she hasn&#039;t even registered that she&#039;s been wounded. But she quickly disproves that by raising her palm and licking it clean without looking.<br>&quot;SLURP. I hate the taste of iron!&quot;<br>She grips Napoleon with both hands.<br>&quot;COGNAC!&quot;", "filename": "1636818951685", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1666450694118912, "time": 1666450694, "md5": "8qgxREGdFqaMMetGX1oRyw==", "fsize": 106601, "resto": 0, "id": "bzVdb5s4", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "west-blue-seadogs-quest-21", "trip": "!!Dfn1WI/0wvw", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 876, "images": 66, "omitted_posts": 871, "omitted_images": 65, "last_replies": [{"no": 5469454, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)05:59:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5469231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5469231</a><br>How would that get us Eliza back? <br>Same with the ideas of attacking outposts, bases and forts: How would any of that get us Eliza back?

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end.

The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs. The cloaked figure turns on its heel and enters into the swirling mass. <br><br>Bucklin inches forward as if he\u2019s going to give chase.<br><br>You---<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop him.

After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 496, "images": 106, "omitted_posts": 491, "omitted_images": 105, "last_replies": [{"no": 5474854, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:35:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s over</span>", "filename": "Untitled - 224", "ext": ".webm", "w": 760, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1669318514265163, "time": 1669318514, "md5": "UpQAR4RkpGq/6wkrHTpdIQ==", "fsize": 2829898, "resto": 5436238, "id": "aAWQK60n"}, {"no": 5474860, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:43:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamboozled again", "time": 1669319026, "resto": 5436238, "id": "GpbjxHLL"}, {"no": 5477719, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)01:18:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5436238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5436238</a><br>FUCK YES!!!

Thus, the craftsmen set about creating some sort of protection for the nascent Warrior-Performers, using a variety of materials from many different sources for these &quot;battle costumes&quot;, putting them into practice both on stage and in the wilderness against wild animals. Stone is declared too heavy, wood too brittle and cloth completely innefective.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently. As the ride nears the end, Cocoa speaks up again. \u201cHey\u2026 Peppa?\u201d<br><br>(cont.)", "filename": "e6829f83f276ecebfb259a3bbb0bef91c02f590d_hq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669026901119487, "time": 1669026901, "md5": "BQgdhF6DkDD9PpjP9TM4YQ==", "fsize": 72663, "resto": 5434173, "id": "dTPM+4xx", "trip": "!!cxhpY4QLASr"}, {"no": 5470811, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)05:36:27", "name": "Kato", "com": "<a href=\"#p5470809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470809</a><br>https://youtu.be/vtjxwhVXqbg<br><br>\u201cMm?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI love you.\u201d<br><br>You smile, letting out a relaxed and content sigh.

And I love being with you.\u201d She kisses your forehead gently. \u201cYou\u2019re my Peppa.\u201d<br><br>Your heart feels all aflutter. \u201c\u2026I love you too Cocoa.\u201d You sit up and hold her close as you kiss her back, on the lips this time. \u201cMy Cocoa.\u201d<br><br>The ride sadly comes to an end, but you\u2019ve got a smile on your face that hasn\u2019t faded yet. \u201cStill up for a look into the fortune teller?\u201d Cocoa asks you.<br><br>\u201cReady if you are.\u201d<br><br>The two of you reach the fortune teller\u2026 and get a bit of a surprise. Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa.

There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

It is risky, there are bloodthirsty monsters inside the ruins.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, we met a few.&quot;<br>&quot;Now excuse me, I have to go back to my tribe.&quot;<br>&quot;Should we kill him?&quot;, asks the bard.<br>&quot;It is just a hungry goblin.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me. I decided to help them as well.&quot;<br>&quot;They will just rob and rape people once their tribe is strong enough.&quot;<br>&quot;Rude!&quot;, says the goblin tending to the cauldrons.<br>&quot;Not all goblins are rapist and thieves.

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion.

To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle.

You manage to force yourself to stay until you hear her lock click shut and then continue sprinting down the hall, but the gangers are close enough behind you that you can hear them mouth-breathing as they do their best to keep up with your pace. Just as you make it to the stairwell, a stub sails through your greatcoat into the small part of your back thigh that your carapace does not obscure.

The carapace armor protects your body from the corners of the stairs as you roll down them, but without the lid of the box, you can hear the bullets and the badge clink down the stairs along with you. Your rolling vision makes it hard to determine how much longer you have to go, but when your arm lands right on the shiv stuck in your bicep, a white-hot jet of pain immediately dulls the pain from your leg, prompting you to simultaneously curse Celestine for failing to protect you and begging Her to promptly end your tumble. In the years-long seconds your fall takes, you also hear the wretched cheering of your pursuers, their voices fighting each other to claim ownership of the stub that sent you barreling down.<br><br>Just as quick as it started, it ends. You\u2019re on your back at the landing of the stairwell, halfway down to Level 15. Your arm is throbbing, you can feel your precious blood oozing out of your arm at a much faster rate, and the pain in your leg returns just fast enough to complement the absolute agony your arm is experiencing. Looking up the stairs, you see a few bullets that didn\u2019t make it down with you, a streak of blood that likely occurred when you fell on the shiv, and of course, the five men grinning down at you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Curl into a ball.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Scoot towards the second flight down.</span>", "time": 1669599870, "resto": 5424481, "id": "VCEHzSCU"}, {"no": 5478583, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)21:13:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5478549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5478549</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Curl into a ball</span><br>And hide the fact we&#039;re pulling out our own gat.
