He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 22, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 17, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5465277, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:32:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465266</a><br>yes", "time": 1668623567, "resto": 5463640, "id": "fbFmp0d0"}, {"no": 5465287, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:39:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465266</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes</span>", "time": 1668623968, "resto": 5463640, "id": "5WfQiUdU"}, {"no": 5465292, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:42:58", "name": "Abominable Intelligence", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465266</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NO</span><br>I don&#039;t care if its metagaming, but i want shiki and team 5 to fail so that we get a chance to get into the past and meet jiraya!", "time": 1668624178, "resto": 5463640, "id": "y/xNGhTG"}, {"no": 5465327, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:29:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465266</a><br>yes", "time": 1668626941, "resto": 5463640, "id": "PWy1ZvBr"}, {"no": 5465329, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:29:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465266</a><br>yeah sure<br><s>but i still hope we get to meet jiraiya</s>", "time": 1668626991, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LXejn+kJ"}], "last_modified": 1668626991}, {"no": 5463670, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)23:24:51", "name": "OP", "sub": "DC: Talon Quest", "com": "[Beware The Court of Owls, that watches all the time, ruling Gotham from a shadowed perch, behind granite and lime.

Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods. She just happened to like watching naked girls dancing in her temple. Go figure. But I&#039;m pretty sure people worshipped her as a goddess of knowledge, magic and fertility. She had a bunch of sons and daughters called collectively as the Phyraxians, they built a society powered by magic but one day their magic stopped working and their society collapsed. Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it. More than half of the gods are just evil monster gods, those tyrannical bastards let each other have some ridiculously overpowered monster god avatar that takes over entire kingdoms.

Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old\u2014mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some\u2014the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors\u2014spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some\u2014the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat\u2014regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill\u2026 Well, that remained to be seen.", "filename": "titlecard", "ext": ".png", "w": 2415, "h": 794, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1667183641201647, "time": 1667183641, "md5": "L4os8n7Hq2Vkwze5Lb0KEQ==", "fsize": 1336684, "resto": 0, "id": "CQjyTS+o", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 280, "images": 37, "omitted_posts": 275, "omitted_images": 37, "last_replies": [{"no": 5464749, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)01:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464735</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Request an audience with Prince Minothel of Tlintear, to confront him about his spy and his intentions</span><br><br>I did want to meet the guy at least once<br>Corandiir didn&#039;t go too hot but maybe he&#039;ll be different.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Display their condition\u2014their BLESSING\u2014proudly and openly, and take full credit</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Continue dance practice with Hamaraska\u2014and bring the Novice too, and the Throat-singer for musical accompaniment</span><br><br>not healthy to be in a stuffy lab all day<br>she&#039;ll turn into another Henzler at this rate<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seek a tailor to prepare you something less\u2026 MARTIAL\u2026 to wear to the ball, and maybe something for the Novice as well</span><br><br>maybe we could fit in time to say not cool bro to Azonia real quick, but sussing out drow isn&#039;t something I think we can do. sure didn&#039;t go well with the prince.", "time": 1668578634, "resto": 5448278, "id": "2UQsCnSt"}, {"no": 5464815, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)02:34:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464749</a><br>Was voting, but realized it was exact same; so +1", "time": 1668584048, "resto": 5448278, "id": "tV5YrKmF"}, {"no": 5464894, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)04:10:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464735</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leave these desperate Drow princelings be\u2014they cannot defeat you by even these means, try as they might</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pray to the Mother of Dragons to reverse this, and to take back her strange \u2018gift\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nothing\u2014you wish to get this event over with and return home</span><br><a href=\"#p5464733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464733</a><br>actual cancer", "time": 1668589854, "resto": 5448278, "id": "MH7zYiQB"}, {"no": 5464906, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)04:45:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464735</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Target the few Lesser Noble Houses that support the Sambrans with promises of wealth and EXPANSION.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition. It&#039;s absolutely normal. Anyone would be nervous. <span class=\"mu-s\">There is no reason ton panic.</span><br><br>You continue repeating this to yourself as your best friend, Jason, drives the van. A minute ago you felt somewhat disassociated, as if you were really just an observer, floating behind yourself and staring, but that&#039;s getting better now. The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things. What were you saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was asking what major you were planning on doing again. You were still undecided last month, right?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you still are. You have no idea what you want to do, just that you want a cushy white-collar job, and that you probably need a degree to do it.

You&#039;re too dumb for med school, but you figure you could still do plenty of good helping with the non-human things.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Computer Science.

You don&#039;t like that. Ultimately, even if you left the bathroom door unblocked, all that would leave for you to escape into is either the same hallway something is trying to get in from, or the room with all the crying. Neither of those sound like terribly good options as of now, so you&#039;ll just... seal both of them off. The window is always available if you truly need to make an exit.<br><br>With that decided you pile up a wide variety of boxes and furniture up against the doors in the aim of keeping everything else the fuck out of your room. During the process you hear some more knocking, and some more sobbing, but you ignore both in pursuit of constructing a giant wall of things. Doing so at any level of quietness takes quite some time but eventually you do finish. You owe much to the many boxes left in your room, and to the fact that your closet doors are the sliding kind that can be easily removed from the wall. In the construction process you did still make some noise, but, well, it&#039;s nothing that should&#039;ve traveled to the front door and whatever is in your uncle&#039;s bedroom is still just sobbing aimlessly. No harm, no foul?<br><br>As you sit down in your now rather barren room, sans massive pile of things, you have time to think and... well, not quite relax, but untense your nerves slightly. With a sigh you sit down in the corner of the room and reach into your backpack to let Madness and Folly out for a moment, whilst at the same time keeping a very close eye to make sure they don&#039;t treat your barricade as some sort of playset.<br><br>You glance at the device. 7:00:04 left. 3, 2, 1...<br><br>BANG BANG BANG. &quot;HOOoooOOONEEEEEY, I&#039;M HOOMEE&quot; in the same horrid imitation of a female voice as before.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today.

You obliged, the pay was far higher than what you were offering for solving petty cases, and you always had a penchant for action on top of investigation.<br><br>You studied, got tested, did a whole bunch of interviews with all sorts of national police types.

He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher.

Setting into motion the final stroke, to remove the drunkard head of Lycuarch the patriarch of the Loc&#039;ria house, a short sighted and blind man who considered Kynigos a close friend and indebted himself to him for saving his house from an outbreak of scurvy, you gave commands to the various virtuous sects within the city to at once act together, throw off their chains and kill the tyrants before them.<br><br>From the Beggar sect, who alone knew your identity as more than just a doddering old man even if fewer among them knew the whole truth, to the city guard and gladiators, to the wealthy merchants and even the scions of Lycuarch&#039;s own bloodline, as one, those who saw the filth around themselves marched, and overthrew the high riders of Loc&#039;ea.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 490, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 485, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463361, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Just wait till we get to page 10.<br>Also I hope this doesn&#039;t go the wait of that One Piece isekai quest i reagrds with &quot;the will to write&quot;, we already suffered enough.", "time": 1668462541, "resto": 5436238, "id": "NAMydAt2"}, {"no": 5463772, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Glad to see you haven\u2019t retired to your attack pod just yet.<br>It\u2019s fine to keep using this thread until page 9/10 if you want, there\u2019s plenty of time left before it falls off of the board.", "time": 1668494631, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5464248, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:38:18", "name": "KingQM", "com": "I&#039;ll wait til page 10 then, probably not that far away.<br><br>!!!

It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me.

I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course!

I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

There have been many experiments on what form of flight would be most effective and the champions that fight for policy have found &quot;Air Walking&quot; to be most effective. To best adapt to changing weather conditions the champion is able to alter the consistency of the air, allowing them to gain stable footing where there should be none. It can also be made incredibly elastic where if one were to fall either due to a crippling strike that momentarily broke concentration or be buffeted against strong winds they can adjust their speed and counter resistance. An amusing technique has also been found where one can allow themselves to sink in the air and then suddenly increasing the resistance to create a bounce effect that can conserve energy and make great leaps when traveling distances. While such a technique makes maneuverability more complex compared to natural and more conventional forms of magical flight.

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

You had fought past her retinue already, and finally, you found her, already dying from the many wounds you inflicted upon her. You decapitated her, and were then stopped by a dragon.<br>Not just A dragon, but something more akin to The dragon.

I had expected you to ask me to end your curse.\u201d<br>It leans in closer, still, and then it speaks as quietly as a creature of that size can manage.

After confronting a gang of lesser vampires on the hunt for prey in the railroad town of Farson, you were directed to the backwater mining town of Almy, which you found a practical ghost town. After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire. You were able to kill the strigoi, but it was hiding underground to conceal the fact it had bred an even rarer, deadlier type of vampire, a moroi. You were able to slay it, though Wiktoria was left exhausted. Now, you\u2019ve arrived in Montana, to deliver a report to Wiktoria\u2019s boss, the Vampire Prelate Cec\u00edlia. <br><br><span class=\"mu-s\">June 10th, 1884<br>Carpathia, Montana Territory</span><br><br>Sorry for the month-long wait for the Conclusion thread folks, been back to work and all that. <br><br>Previous Thread: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive/2022/5345941/", "filename": "DH OP", "ext": ".png", "w": 2708, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 138, "tim": 1665112917299315, "time": 1665112917, "md5": "9EcW4IXRUyja9O3BMFInBg==", "fsize": 6668274, "resto": 0, "id": "j2Di2wT6", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "damned-hunter-case-0-the-conclusion", "trip": "!!1MSx2/jclIz", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 17, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5436585, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)15:54:07", "name": "Wide Pride", "com": "\u201cSo, what now?

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them. And after so much events the sweet lady Takable was spending the evening with you. <br><br>But let us begin, as per tradition, by a small prologue about events that take place in other parts of the strange world that you call India.<br><br>PROLOGUE :<br><br>In the darkest tunnels of the terrible fortress that we already visited one can see a quite pitiful group. They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise.

He&#039;s only a little older than you but everybody treats him so much differently! It isn&#039;t fair. Father and mother have been gone since this morning as well, and it was left to the household servants to take care of you all day. They didn&#039;t explain anything, attempting to distract you with games and music but only succeeding in putting you more on edge. <br><br>Almost as soon as the servants put you to bed you snuck out of your room and back out into quiet halls of the mansion, tiptoeing along through the shadows until you caught sight of a group of adults entering your father\u2019s study\u2026<br><br>In the dim light you cannot make out who they are, but as the heavy double doors to the study close behind them you hurry over to try and listen in.

You hear heavy footsteps on the other side of the door, slowly growing louder as they approach.
