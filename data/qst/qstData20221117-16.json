In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely. That you are his unclaimed (and unknown) by-blow is only tangential. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you do deserve the honor of an audience with the viceroy?</span><br><br>1. Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system. Today, the trade network your built there is responsible for 12% of the Company&#039;s quarterly profits. <br>4.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 30, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 25, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5465753, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)22:41:52", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5465672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5465672</a><br>\u201cI hate carrying that thing, but Naori-dono insisted,\u201d Isoka-san replies. \u201cFor his eyes only, she said.

Aside from the ubermensch build being the Adam Kadmon brought, you were pretty capable as a person. Okay, you weren\u2019t some highly trained super soldier, but that didn\u2019t mean you were a slouch either. Having a police commissioner for a father meant you had to always be prepared. Otherwise, all those self-defense lessons and survival training would amount to nothing. <br><br>Now that\u2019s not to say you were rigorously trained or conditioned before acquiring superpowers. After all, Jump City wasn\u2019t crawling to the brim with criminal activity. It just helped to be prepared, hence why your father didn\u2019t religiously push you to take combat training seriously. Still, you took it to heart and did what was at least expected. Therefore, you were reasonably confident in your honed instincts and reflexes, doubly so while in your empowered state <br><br>So, with that, it boggles the mind that he snuck up on you without giving any tells or warning. Practically flat-footed with your line of interval exposed, your body naturally geared itself into fight or flight. Meanwhile, before your body could act, your mind immediately simulated the next move. It was simple, just a swift roundhouse kick to the side, knocking him down to the ground or the wall behind you. Worst case scenario you jump after him if he falls off the building, using one of your primary color choice powers to remedy the situation. <br><br>At the same time, you didn\u2019t pick up any bad intentions, much less any sign of bloodlust or fighting spirit coming from him. Either this masked boy was extremely good at concealing his emotions along with his presence, or he was generally being helpful while being straightforward. The fact he didn\u2019t take advantage of the slight pause in your movement made you think it was the latter. Again, you weren\u2019t any slouch, but if someone with ninja likes moves got close and personal, you were going to be in a world of trouble. <br><br>Finishing up before your body could fully act, you forcibly stop your sweeping roundhouse kick. Pulling it close as if you were mere moments from enacting your mental imagery from the simulation. Yet, this didn\u2019t deter the slender yet athletic boy wonder in the slightest. His gentle look was oozing with confidence and awareness. Just looking at his eyes through his black-and-white domino mask gave you the impression he was the real deal. A real, Bonafide super soldier. Or at least exceptionally trained. <br><br>&quot;You didn\u2019t flinch.\u201d You brusquely muttered, slowly pulling your leg back while keeping your distance. <br><br>Con", "time": 1668720154, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5466396, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:24:20", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466395</a><br>\u201cWell, it&#039;s something I was expecting, but I didn\u2019t sense any hostility coming from you. So, I had a hunch that you wouldn\u2019t go through with your attack, especially considering.\u201d As the black-haired boy smiled, he slowly gestured to you to look towards your left. Reminding you that currently both of you stand over a thousand feet above the pavement. Not helping was being so close if not directly standing on the rails. <br><br>Twitching your face into an awkward smile, mentally thanking your stars you didn\u2019t follow through, you hopped into the safe zone. \u201cMy apologies. Due to personal trauma and general experience, my body acts defensively before my mind has the chance to process the situation.\u201d <br> <br>Following you, the black-haired boy also jumped off the rail, keeping his hands folded in his arms. \u201cMakes sense. I could tell from the roundhouse you were going to give. Your appearance also gave it away. My name is Robin, and sorry for the startle.\u201d Keeping himself relaxed, Robin slowly but surely went to offer his hand for a handshake. <br> <br>Taking his hand for a shake, you merely smile back. \u201cLikewise. Though I bet you had gotten to check a lot of me before alerting me of your presence. Find anything you like~\u201d You tease, putting your left hand on your wide hips, thrusting it a tad for oomph. <br> <br>Pausing a bit from sudden surprise, Robin quickly clears his throat before letting your charm sway him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t stalking you out of looks. Or in general really. I only tailed you after noticing you before I left Gotham. Kind of hard to miss someone when you hear a reverbing echo after seeing them vanish.\u201d There was a hint of playful ribbing as he addressed the elephant in the room. <br><br>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d You paused. There was a feeling of mild disappointment, not at him not being a stalker mind you. Rather it was how he was able to see you despite your efforts. You need more practice at being meticulously covert. \u201cPray-tell, exactly why I was worthy of being pursued if it was not for my dashing good looks and statuesque physique? &quot;You spoke, keeping up a sultry manner and tone. <br><br>\u201cA brand-new person with superpowers just nonchalantly sightseeing in broad daylight. Kinda hard to not think you were up to something. Or have a loose definition of using your powers responsibly. \u201cRobin retorts. \u201cSo, curiosity is mainly my reason. What you do next may invoke more than that.\u201d <br><br>Thinking about it for a moment, you decide to stop playing the winsome coquette. Instead, going for a franker yet still dignified expression. \u201cTo cut to the chase, I\u2019m here for a special objective. Getting back a prized heirloom is my sole reason for being here. After that, I\u2019m returning to Jump City. So, you don\u2019t have to worry about me causing any trouble.\u201d <br><br>Con", "time": 1668720260, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5466398, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)16:25:23", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466396</a><br>\u201cAnd what exactly is that heirloom? I can\u2019t imagine it being something mundane like a brooch.\u201d Robin quipped. For the moment deciding to trust your words. You were very earnest and amicable, despite your playful flirting. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s called the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, it\u2019s a grimoire containing various secrets and extensive knowledge. To make a long story short, it\u2019s been in my family\u2019s possession for generations. Right up until I was essentially killed and pilfered by a goatee-wearing man in a black bodysuit. \u201cYou explain, slowly dawning upon yourself about your sudden death and how ludicrous it sounds. \u201cNaturally it didn\u2019t stick as I came back to life., but if you don\u2019t believe me then at least give me the courtesy of not getting ridiculed. I\u2019m sensitive about the whole endeavor.\u201d <br><br>Shaking his head to deter your assumptions, Robin focuses his sharp gaze on you. \u201cI\u2019m not going to brush it off or make fun of you. I\u2019ve seen my case of the supernatural and magical to not rule out such possibilities. My mentor even knows several people who specialize in that kind of stuff. One of them should still be in town. \u201cBefore he would say any further, Robin would curtly cut himself off before pointing to a door. <br><br>\u201cAnyway, like I said the observatory inside should help you. It has just about everything you\u2019ll need to help streamline your search. Just be careful when it&#039;s night. That\u2019s when the outlaws and criminals are the most active. And if you end up seeing someone with a bat cowl, tell them you know Robin and they should at least be willing to leave you alone or help you. Provided you don\u2019t antagonize them or give them a reason to be defensive.\u201d Robin explained. <br> <br>\u201cThanks, I appreciate it.\u201d You nod, showing a genuinely warm smile. It was quick as you caught Robin was about to reach from his yellow utility belt for a grappling hook and leave. \u201cW-Wait, hold on a second. I know you said you were leaving Gotham, but could you find it in your heart to help a newcomer like me with my mission?\u201d <br><br>Stopping himself from using his grappling hook, Robin turns to look back at you. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIf you help me, I\u2019ll treat you to a meal.\u201d Your smile widens as you pull out your bat burger bag and wave it gently as an incentive. <br> <br>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever received a collab through fast food bribery.\u201d Robin softly chuckled, putting his grappling hook away. \u201cWhy not. I could use one last hurrah before leaving my stomping grounds for a new location.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cGlad to have you aboard. If you stick with me, you\u2019ll have a more exciting and colorful experience back at Jump City. I promise.\u201d Giving the boy wonder a quick airborne kiss, for appreciation, you quickly walked over to the observatory.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered.

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 61, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 56, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 5462240, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)13:13:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Yes</span><br>pussies", "time": 1668363205, "resto": 5452883, "id": "cQT39Lvu"}, {"no": 5462720, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)21:23:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No</span><br>oh shit we have to tell schala about this", "time": 1668392608, "resto": 5452883, "id": "IwW+brIw"}, {"no": 5463734, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:53:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No</span><br><br>This wasn&#039;t all for naught, however, as we still discovered the source and extent of the damage.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

Thankful for the carpeted floor, you creep over to the window and begin fiddling with your key ring as quietly as possible. Unlike the door keys, the window ones all look pretty similar. One design for the first lock, a different for the second, all identical between the windows. It takes a total of eight tries with different keys for you to unlock both of the window&#039;s locks, the sounds of sobbing and the creature loudly lumbering around downstairs providing a nerve-wracking backdrop.<br><br>With the window unlocked, you slowly push it up and open. Cold, moist air finds its way in and you involuntarily shiver. It&#039;s the middle of August, but it seems like you could do with a sweatshirt. Putting the cold aside, you poke your head out the window. The sill outside the window is rather narrow, but you could probably fit your feet on it if you had to. From there you think you could reach the roof, although it&#039;d definitely take a lot out of you to climb up there, and wouldn&#039;t be perfectly quiet.<br><br>To the left and the right are the windows to your uncle&#039;s office and bedroom, respectively. The office window is too far to reach from where you are, but you think you might be able to step over to the other bedroom&#039;s windowsill, albeit it with some difficulty. It should still be locked from the inside though, so you&#039;d probably have to smash your way in. Even ignoring what might be inside the room, it doesn&#039;t sound like a great escape route.<br><br>Below is an overgrown hedge, which you imagine would both cushion your fall and scratch you up. Speaking of the fall the distance is a bit dicey, but not the end of the world. If you were prepared ahead of time you don&#039;t think it&#039;d kill you or anything, at least. Although you guess you might sprain and ankle, which, well... might be the same as a death sentence in your current situation. It would all depend on your luck, you guess.<br><br>With that in mind, you close the window, turn your attention back to the room, and think of how you could get down safely. It doesn&#039;t take long for you to think of the most cliched approach in the book: make a rope out of your bedsheets. Sure, you don&#039;t know if it actually works but... well, you&#039;ve seen it in movies before, and it makes sense, logically. If you tied up your sheets, your blanket, and maybe some clothes or the curtains into a rope, and then fix it against something in the room, then it would probably provide a much safer path down.", "filename": "window", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668712882445551, "time": 1668712882, "md5": "CGV4HBQ25yanKy+/PmMDuw==", "fsize": 8408, "resto": 5448110, "id": "Y5+q259n", "trip": "!!qLL4RjByPPt"}, {"no": 5466312, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:23:14", "name": "HalloQM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466310</a><br>That does beg the question though- what would you fix it against? Your bed is the only thing here you can imagine easily bearing your weight, but it&#039;s also the first thing you added to the barricade. You guess you could use it, but it&#039;d be pretty far away from the window- you&#039;d need a longer rope, likely including lower quality materials. You&#039;re pretty sure your blanket wouldn&#039;t rip if used, but you can&#039;t quite say the same for your old shirts and jeans...<br><br>Besides the bed, you could also try something like your nightstand or a closet door that could easily be removed from your barricade, but you&#039;re certain they&#039;d move around once you started descending.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

You remember nearly finishing the bottle of Jameson by yourself, and you remember taking the pills. You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave.

The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her? I gave you an entire thread to begin answering those questions and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of an answer. So I lost interest. The apprentice&#039;s quest to impress a dour paladin and become a master smith was interesting even outside the nonexistence of the waifu as an important character. The drunkard&#039;s quest to save the waifu from the law requires me to care for the waifu and I didn&#039;t. No more than I&#039;d care about a rare pet that&#039;s being hunted by poachers.", "time": 1668011769, "resto": 5439483, "id": "qNzXHep+"}], "last_modified": 1668011769}, {"no": 5439476, "now": "10/21/22(Fri)10:41:07", "name": "Otakun", "sub": "Another BS Isekai Quest", "com": "Welp, you\u2019re dead.

From the fog swept valley&#039;s of Shangrala, you now stand by the side of one of your warpswept and once lost brothers, Angron Thal&#039;kyr, the former gladiator slaved of the wicked house of the Thal&#039;kr, one of the lineages of the tyranical high riders who have long misruled and abused the fair sphere of Nuceria and her chained and brow beaten populace. As Angron began his war against tyranny, you sent your brother Feng, the first of your companions to join you in the struggle against those fools who believe they rode so high as to rule the heavens, to weaken the opposition by assassinating the general of the Thal&#039;kr armies sent against the last high rider army that marched from the city of Loc&#039;ea.<br><br>For, as blood was shed, you once more donned the wrinkled mask of kindly Kynigos, an ancient wandering sage and scholar, rarely merciful and caring Lanista and the confident and herald of the Loc&#039;ria family, having already woven a tale of treachery and betrayal to remove from the city and house alike the stain of tyranny and the sinful and cruel excesses of those forever lost to the lure of corruption and fleeting pleasures. Setting into motion the final stroke, to remove the drunkard head of Lycuarch the patriarch of the Loc&#039;ria house, a short sighted and blind man who considered Kynigos a close friend and indebted himself to him for saving his house from an outbreak of scurvy, you gave commands to the various virtuous sects within the city to at once act together, throw off their chains and kill the tyrants before them.<br><br>From the Beggar sect, who alone knew your identity as more than just a doddering old man even if fewer among them knew the whole truth, to the city guard and gladiators, to the wealthy merchants and even the scions of Lycuarch&#039;s own bloodline, as one, those who saw the filth around themselves marched, and overthrew the high riders of Loc&#039;ea. Allowing yourself to be taken to trial alongside the rest of the ruling class who were not part of the glorious half hour revolution, you watched as one by one, teary eyed and trembling, the tyrants were executed by axe, incineration or hanging, until at last Kynigos was judged<br><br>And found faultless, by the council made of the leaders of the revolution, the heirs of the judged and sentence and the influencial of the city, who had taken quite an interest in the lessons of the journey. Thus, the veil of bloodthirst was lifted from the eyes of the common man, and the mob of the city saw at last the beauty of life and the rewards of selfless living.<br><br>Though you&#039;d like nothing more to walk amongst the people of the city, and see how they enjoy their new found freedom, you cannot", "filename": "2nd Primarch", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2581, "h": 1629, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 157, "tim": 1666096021943777, "time": 1666096021, "md5": "iOy5Dw8hk3NAHARZF0IdLw==", "fsize": 1124655, "resto": 0, "id": "NAorCTUr", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-2nd-primarch-quest-21", "trip": "!!RS7NSuo3fkv", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 281, "images": 12, "omitted_posts": 276, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 5466255, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)13:09:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466055</a><br>Supported<br><br>It&#039;s time to bring our family into contact with one another", "time": 1668708555, "resto": 5437071, "id": "lo9mgbZ5"}, {"no": 5466277, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)13:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instruct the wisest and most trustworthy of Angron&#039;s soldiers in the use of the Archeotech that was captured, and inspect it yourself, to see if any of it can be used without soiling one&#039;s virtues and befouling their hands</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sensing a familiar presence, move to greet your beloved songbird, whose beauty surpass that of all the stars in the sky, and introduce Kanzeon to Angron.</span>", "time": 1668710846, "resto": 5437071, "id": "KbKxy46t"}, {"no": 5466300, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:08:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sensing a familiar presence, move to greet your beloved songbird, whose beauty surpass that of all the stars in the sky, and introduce Kanzeon to Angron.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Congratulate Angron for his victory and offer to spar with him, so you can truly measure the incredible prowess he displayed in the battle</span>", "time": 1668712119, "resto": 5437071, "id": "9XbjBAE8"}, {"no": 5466328, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)14:32:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Sensing a familiar presence, move to greet your beloved songbird, whose beauty surpass that of all the stars in the sky, and introduce Kanzeon to Angron.</span>", "time": 1668713556, "resto": 5437071, "id": "Q+qPqsZH"}, {"no": 5466338, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)15:01:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466047</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Congratulate Angron for his victory and offer to spar with him, so you can truly measure the incredible prowess he displayed in the battle</span><br>And afterwards<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sensing a familiar presence, move to greet your beloved songbird, whose beauty surpasses that of all the stars in the sky, and introduce Kanzeon to Angron.</span><br>Oh she&#039;s gonna be fucking PISSED.", "time": 1668715289, "resto": 5437071, "id": "f3bNIfXo"}], "last_modified": 1668715289}, {"no": 5439640, "now": "10/21/22(Fri)16:03:26", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Darkness", "com": "... darkness.<br>it has been five, long, long years.<br>in the beginning, we tried to ignore it. &quot;it&#039;s just night-time, nothing to worry about,&quot; we told ourselves.<br>then six am became seven. then eight. nine, ten, twelve. a day passed. no light.<br>two days. a week. a month. nothing. no stars, no sun, no moon. we were left with nothing. and so, we perservered and tried to live without it all. lot of good that did us.<br>as the months passed, we couldn&#039;t shake the feeling of hopelessness hanging over us, as if the world itself, and us with it, were slowly fading away into obscurity.<br>many took action. some left our homes to live underground. others lost all shreds of sanity and lashed out at anyone and everyone around themselves, like wild animals defending their territory.<br>but myself? well... i have hope. a feeling, in my gut, that all this can be fixed.<br><br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>--------------------<br>something tells me that the end is still farther than i think it is", "filename": "Ilustraci\u00f3n783", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1666382606911515, "time": 1666382606, "md5": "Q4b4gBTzbRbqK2tVDXv6QQ==", "fsize": 130346, "resto": 0, "id": "dTCjrd6m", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "darkness", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 2, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 5440373, "now": "10/22/22(Sat)10:32:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5439640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5439640</a><br>Cool drawing.

We are returning from space!<br><br>==Archive==<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/qstarchive.html?tags=KingQM<br><br>I\u2019ll be reposting the thread 4 summary for new anons and add to it for the stuff that happened in threads 4 and 5. <br><br>==Beginning of Summary of ALL of Vegeta Quest==<br>Vegeta, rightful holder of the title &quot;Prince of all Saiyans&quot; after the fall of his planet, has seen his life change in the past year. What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 490, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 485, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463361, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Just wait till we get to page 10.<br>Also I hope this doesn&#039;t go the wait of that One Piece isekai quest i reagrds with &quot;the will to write&quot;, we already suffered enough.", "time": 1668462541, "resto": 5436238, "id": "NAMydAt2"}, {"no": 5463772, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Glad to see you haven\u2019t retired to your attack pod just yet.<br>It\u2019s fine to keep using this thread until page 9/10 if you want, there\u2019s plenty of time left before it falls off of the board.", "time": 1668494631, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5464248, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:38:18", "name": "KingQM", "com": "I&#039;ll wait til page 10 then, probably not that far away.<br><br>!!! BLOGPOST WARNING !!! <br><br><a href=\"#p5463361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463361</a><br>Will to write is a tough bippy to handle when you&#039;re QMing. It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

Ignorant of the evil just beyond their lands, of the devil that feeds off of even their essence. Steel-Weaver may know, but that is not enough.

Their naturally creative nature quickly lead to the use of these complex runes in more abstract scenarios than just recording resources or history. Before long, tales long confined to spoken word were now passed onto tablets, histories were mythologized and many cultural values were literally set in stone. Of course, this was put to great use in the Riath&#039;s ritualistic plays, the scenarios within, the details of the costumes and locations, all growing increasingly more complicated as the ages passed, which would prove pivotal for their society soon after.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literature is developed.</span>", "time": 1668689123, "resto": 5436375, "id": "7k7eGedq"}, {"no": 5466054, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)07:46:32", "name": "Nil", "com": "<a href=\"#p5466052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5466052</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Action 2 Develop [MA] [DI]</span><br>&quot;He has returned!

Though a part of him is delighted at the course the wolf-men had taken in his absence, seeing it as an even better example of an evolving society, lacking his outside influence, he cannot ignore the reality that they are weak. They have survived this long only due to the lack of aggressive forces outside their control, and won&#039;t last long at all if forced to defend themselves. This has to change.<br><br>During a celebratory ritual portraying the Riath&#039;s creation, at the climax, whereupon the lead actor playing Nil&#039;s role gives his &#039;children&#039; some parting words of wisdom before releasing them into the world, the fog surrounding the stage suddenly pours into the man&#039;s mask, raising him into the air and choking him with vapour as it floods through his body until his every breath releases more of it, his limbs shifting between flesh and air as he floats just above the earth. The mask molds itself to his face, or perhaps the opposite, it&#039;s stylistic design growing to cover the rest of his body. At last, as he stares into the mystified crowd, his eyes like spotlights in the shade, Nil speaks.<br><br>The reasons for his absence, the existential threat faced by all living things and how to face it, the road the Riath must follow in the future, all subjects that are expanded on for countless hours. The entranced Riath, men and women, elderly and children alike, stand nearly hypnotized by their deity&#039;s direct interference, the fog surrounding them now roiling like the waves of the sea. It seems to go on forever, until suddenly, with but a promise of greater changes in the future, Nil makes his exit, and the light in the actor&#039;s eyes shuts off.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Oh, you\u2019re ready for all of them. Meanwhile, Lime and Monty have cleared a number of the challenges already. They got through the chainsaw maniac, the poltergeists, the apparently bottomless pit, the snake chamber, the taxman (which does get a slight spook out of them, but they manage to overcome it), the dollhouse of horror, and even the sandworm, and are just now getting through the mad scientist\u2019s lair. They just have to clear through the spider cave and\u2026 aaaaand Lime isn\u2019t taking the spider cave all that well. In fact, when they get to the giant spider at the end, she starts stepping back. Monty notices this, and takes her hand protectively. Then, as the giant spider crawls closer, several smaller ones start to crawl off of it. Lime yelps and jumps in his arms, and he heads to one of the exits with her, carrying her out of the haunted house.<br><br>\u201cOooh, that was a close one!\u201d Cocoa calls out. \u201cBut the good news is, the two of them are okay\u2026 and possibly a bit more than okay, by the look of things.\u201d<br><br>There\u2019s a brief moment where Monty, still carrying Lime, stops and smiles warmly at her. Lime smiles back, but the two then remember they\u2019re in public, and she quickly leaves his arms, the pair blushing brightly.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>So, they cleared eight obstacles, they get a total of eight points!<br><br>Videl and Shaprner are next, and while they get through the first few pretty well, you notice Sharpner\u2019s nerves starting to fray, even as Videl leads him by the hand through it. Their sixth challenge is\u2026 \u201cNo\u2026 NO! THE GAINS GOBLIN IS REAL!\u201d Sharpner shrieks. An uncannily buff little green monster, weilding two dumbells in its hands, lets out a shriek and starts to chase him. Videl is so baffled by what she\u2019s looking at that her hand lets Sharpner\u2019s go, and the young man bolts out of one of the exists. \u201cHE\u2019S GONNA TAKE MY PHYSIQUE!\u201d he yells out, running for a good few seconds before he realizes he\u2019s outside again.

They hold strong through four of them, but the fifth one ends up kinda\u2026 unexpected, if you were being honest, but a set of gnomes with several articles of very obviously stolen undergarments are where Latte draws the line, and she runs out of the haunted house shrieking.<br><br>Aaaand four points.<br><br>Izzy and Tapion manage things much better than the other two, getting seven of the attractions out of the way through some\u2026 creative uses of her Light-boosted Solar Flare. It doesn\u2019t damage anything, but it sure as heck keeps things from pestering her. On number eight though, they get into a brightly lit ancient hallway\u2026 one with an eerie silence to it. As they walk, Izzy starts to get uneasy, noticing SOMETHING moving around the quiet space, yet not making a sound as it does. When she tries her trick again though, she glimpses something\u2026 odd. Something that gets her running, but not away from it. Towards it. Which gets her running through one of the exits. When she realizes what she\u2019s done, her head hangs in defeat, Tapion walking to her and putting a hand on her shoulder comfortingly.<br><br>There\u2019s\u2026 an odd look on her face, one that gets you asking if there was something wrong. Izzy just vaguely replies she must have been seeing things. Well\u2026 okay. Seven points for them!<br><br>Sachie and Atole manage to get through six challenges, Sachie showing less fear than Atole does, but it\u2019s challenge seven that gets her. You have to admit, a room full of expired ramen is certainly a\u2026 unique fear, but it\u2019s one that gets her running in terror. She even ends up checking her backpack for some\u2026 spare instant ramen she had on her. She sighs in relief, but Atole\u2019s just left mostly confused.<br><br>Six points!<br><br>Sala and Zarid make it through five, before the illusion of a snake-spider hybrid monster manages to spook Sala enough that she ends up\u2026 attacking it in a fight-or-flight response. Thankfully it was just an illusion, but she DOES end up smashing through a wall in trying to get it. Which counts as a definite loss. Mom and Pantea end up patching up that wall.<br><br>Five points.<br><br>Angela and Penn get through four, only to be scared off with a mummy monster in the fifth room. Four points for them.<br><br>Hakka and Cheelai attempt to put on brave faces, looking to keep their lead going strong\u2026 but the two of them turn and run from a giant octopus-robot monster. That\u2019s only five points for Team Green.<br><br>Phanty and Gohan though? They make good on their promise.

When they come to the final room, Idasa notices it\u2019s exceptionally warm. \u201cIt is hot as hell in here\u2026\u201d he complains in a pant. The reason for that becomes clear quite quickly, for it looks like an actual hell, the illusion presenting it as such.

Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse.

His first few pledges as the supreme leader of Akkaria have left no doubt that his nationalistic and militaristic rhetorics will no doubt quake through Akkaria for millennium to come. This nationalistic outlook came from one major thing and that&#039;s the victory of the Punitive Orcish Operation, a war won overwhelmingly by the Viergipfel pact of Scion, Akkitaria, and Sarmatia. In the aftermath the united army of the three nations marched north through the colonial province of Western Azkan to put to a swift death the fennecs that have terrorized the sand gnomes for ages. <br><br>Even though the coalition suffered heavy losses, Scion and Sarmatia left with the queen and half of the survivors respectively. With Akkaria&#039;s prisoners of war, they decided to skin them and turn the excess in furs into military standard uniforms fit with the new Akkarian crest, designed by Kravek himself. (pic related) Each uniform would have one of these designs on the shoulders, back, and chest for anyone who saw them to know who they were.

You woke up in an empty house, your parents off on a business trip, a vacation, or a &quot;Business&quot; trip which left you basically all on your own. They left you a large enough fund to buy food and pay rent, but not much else beyond that. It had taken only once to learn that you needed to tightly budget, a lesson you learned at the cost of nearly going three weeks without food, but your parents never found out. You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets? You didn&#039;t have much of either to really think on, so you mostly enjoyed the feeling of non-existence as your waited for whatever neurons that were left firing to fizzle out and die.<br><br>&quot;Get up!

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

The place looks ransacked, with only the remains of a bed remaining here, and mattress with a deep, dark stain on it.<br>The fact the stain looks to be in the shape of a man is not something you\u2019re going to think about very hard. However, there is good news, of a sort. The wall is missing. Under almost any other circumstance, that\u2019d be a bad thing, but the design of this place means that, from here, you can access a rooftop. The shingles look dangerous to traverse, to be sure, but you can follow the walls for some time, and looking ahead, you even spot some planks that were put down to make access another rooftop easier. Said rooftop is completely blank, not really offering a way down, but there\u2019s more planks on the other side\u2026 permitting you to head into some kind of church.<br><br>You go along the rooftops, and looking down, you can see the source of the blue lights. Ghosts, seems like. Ghosts wearing peculiar clothes and armor of all sorts. You spot one of them walking around in a suit of armor very similar to yours, while another is walking around in a very risqu\u00e9 dress, showing off a whole lot of leg. Then, some others, wearing plain leather armors, and some of them even wearing\u2026 something akin to what the immortal creatures around here wear. Similar masks, with a very long coat at the back. <br>They patrol steadily through the streets, and you make it a point not to call attention to yourself up here.", "time": 1668706809, "resto": 5426219, "id": "Crsv6RkT", "trip": "!0H0qzjbv4."}, {"no": 5466236, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)12:41:20", "name": "Spinejuice", "com": "\u201cCome on.\u201d You tell your squires, as you walk along the rooftops and send them across the planks. With the age of the wood, however, you decide against even risking it, and elect to jump across. It\u2019s not much of a jump, mercifully, and your squires are there to pull you on the roof when one of the shingles lets loose. <br><br>The shingle flies down, and goes right through one of the ghosts below, which instantly makes them turn red and start firing bright red lines that just seem to slice right through the shingle, making it bounce as it falls apart\u2026 and then it\u2019s pieces.<br>The holograms stare at it a little longer, and then they just continue their patrol.<br><br>\u201cYeah\u2026 Don\u2019t mess with those.\u201d You say, before you move on into the church. There is a broken window you can clamber through, into a dusty and mercifully cloud-free space. Notably, you see several beds here, and some skeletons.<br>One fresh corpse of a dragonborn. From the looks of it, he bled out after taking a gut wound. You walk over to him, and you do note that he has an axe on him. A simple woodcutter\u2019s axe, not exactly balanced for combat, but it\u2019s better than nothing. <br><br>On a hunch, however, you start looking around the church for a little while, and you peek up when you hear a voice.<br>\u201cBloody tourists, even after all this time. Let\u2019s hope this one doesn\u2019t start yelling about wizards\u2026 Say! Partner! How about you go into the direction of my voice, hmm? I\u2019ve a proposition for you that I think you\u2019d rather like.\u201d <br>The voice is rich, though there is a faint rasp behind it. It sounds as though it\u2019s talking to a child, though, and you can feel the condescension from here. All the same\u2026<br><br>You follow the voice for a moment, and find a little metal box,with some kind of grill at the front. It fits easily in your hand. The voice is coming through it.<br>\u201cAre you\u2026 communicating through this thing?\u201d<br>\u201cYes. It\u2019s called a radio. Good job. The last idiot tried to shake it around to get me to talk, convinced I was in there\u2026 Listen. You still have a fine head on your shoulders, so that makes you eligible to help me. Do this for me\u2026 and I\u2019ll give you a cut of the spoils. You\u2019ve come here for riches, didn\u2019t you? Most of what\u2019s here is beyond your understanding, but I\u2019ve no doubt some of the tools here would be useful even to a lug like you. If you want to be rich, just head up the church, and ring the bell for me. That\u2019ll prove to me you can follow instructions.\u201d<br><br>\u2026Right.<br>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to do that?\u201d<br>\u201cWell\u2026 Then you\u2019re free to die on your own, clawing at the Madre\u2019s secrets, knowing you\u2019re the one that tossed it all away over a momentary bout of paranoia.\u201d<br>\u201cI just want to get out of here.\u201d You say, candidly. You don\u2019t expect charity, but\u2026<br>\u201cWell! Great! I\u2019m offering an escape, as well.

After confronting a gang of lesser vampires on the hunt for prey in the railroad town of Farson, you were directed to the backwater mining town of Almy, which you found a practical ghost town. After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire.

He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise. A little twirling move lets you evade his partner, who you would hazard a guess is his sister. Both are fast by any ordinary person\u2019s standards, and you can tell each attack carries a pretty good amount of force behind it, so that\u2019s not their problem.

You overheard your older brother say something about a collapse during a speech, but he refused to explain himself before leaving with some important military looking men. He&#039;s only a little older than you but everybody treats him so much differently! It isn&#039;t fair. Father and mother have been gone since this morning as well, and it was left to the household servants to take care of you all day. They didn&#039;t explain anything, attempting to distract you with games and music but only succeeding in putting you more on edge. <br><br>Almost as soon as the servants put you to bed you snuck out of your room and back out into quiet halls of the mansion, tiptoeing along through the shadows until you caught sight of a group of adults entering your father\u2019s study\u2026<br><br>In the dim light you cannot make out who they are, but as the heavy double doors to the study close behind them you hurry over to try and listen in. You press your ear against the cold wooden door, straining to hear the muffled voices on the other side. It is difficult to make anything out, occasional footsteps and what sounds like the clinking of glass, or perhaps metal, interspersed between quiet conversation. It goes on for awhile, but you can\u2019t hear much of it clearly until the very end.<br><br>\u201c...He\u2019s not going to recover\u2026\u201d A deep male voice states matter-of-factly, the rest of the room briefly falling silent.<br><br>\u201c...Are you sure there\u2019s nothing that can be done?\u201d A female voice questions uncertainly, a murmur of others joining her soon after.<br><br>\u201cI am certain. Now would be a good time to\u2026\u201d The deep voice continues speaking, but the rest of his sentence is too indistinct to make out. You hear heavy footsteps on the other side of the door, slowly growing louder as they approach. You have only a few moments to back away, and your small strides don\u2019t carry you far over the smooth marble floor before you slip, falling in a heap as the great carved wooden door swings wide and reveals an imposing but aged man\u2026<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Your father, Degwin Zabi.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Your father Zeon Zum Deikun\u2019s most trusted physician, Girard.</span>", "filename": "MSGQ #1", "ext": ".png", "w": 555, "h": 480, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 216, "tim": 1664052269286096, "time": 1664052269, "md5": "HLrR1GlUphGegoFV+n+H4A==", "fsize": 73273, "resto": 0, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "bumplimit": 1, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mobile-suit-gundam-quest", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 3322, "images": 135, "omitted_posts": 3317, "omitted_images": 134, "last_replies": [{"no": 5461622, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:34:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461596</a><br>I ain&#039;t never met a man who&#039;s name sounded like a flower, just sayin&#039;.", "time": 1668310440, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}, {"no": 5461641, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:49:41", "name": "Contolist", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461617</a><br>That&#039;s only when he&#039;s trying to hide. <br><br><a href=\"#p5461622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461622</a><br>Basil?", "time": 1668311381, "resto": 5414507, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr"}, {"no": 5461660, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)22:56:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461641</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basil</span><br>That&#039;s an herb, not a flower.", "time": 1668311777, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}, {"no": 5461677, "now": "11/12/22(Sat)23:12:21", "name": "Contolist", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461660</a><br>It flowers. <br><s>I know I&#039;m reaching a bit here.</s>", "filename": "Basil Flower", "ext": ".png", "w": 926, "h": 745, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1668312741108163, "time": 1668312741, "md5": "LNPaRLt4f7VSv4pNOfbVNQ==", "fsize": 1286194, "resto": 5414507, "id": "bMbi2kzw", "trip": "!!AVpo7Bz35Xr"}, {"no": 5461760, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)00:23:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5461677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5461677</a><br>Much like Humanity&#039;s destiny to grasp at the stars with our fingered nails, it is your destiny to reach.<br>Hope your classes are going well by the way, education being important and all that.", "time": 1668317033, "resto": 5414507, "id": "A6ZH2nkP"}], "last_modified": 1668317033}, {"no": 5415595, "now": "09/25/22(Sun)18:56:36", "name": "91m10", "sub": "Do Your Best Quest #135", "com": "You\u2019re not sure how you ended up here, you were supposed to be cuddling with the two wonderful tomatoes that you love.

A heretical cleric shouldn\u2019t be so powerful; teleportation is practically on the level of True Magic, and he\u2019s using it on hundreds of targets simultaneously.\u201d Truvietianne said in subdued awe and frustration.<br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the entirety of the situation.\u201d Her Servant reminded her, \u201cIt may be one of that Servant\u2019s abilities, or the world we\u2019re in could allow for that type of magic more readily than the real one. I\u2019d also wager that however he\u2019s getting it done, he can only use power like that if it\u2019s directly involved in making the Grail War as a whole run more smoothly.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019d be pleased if that were true. Interference from his end would be a real pain to deal with if he could use that kind of power at will.\u201d You say.<br><br>\u201cI imagine so, but as you know we have more pressing matters to attend to.\u201d Caster said as he pulled out his map and began studying it. You assumed he was probably communicating with his familiar, which he\u2019d been rather careful about keeping concealed; perhaps revealing it would give a substantial hint regarding his true name. \u201cThere are hundreds of ghoulish creatures wandering all over the city now, I\u2019ll try to pick out the humans from the recent arrivals and guide you to their locations. It may behoove us to split up again as before, and then meet here again after we\u2019ve retrieved a civilian. Miss Lancer has an ability that allowed us to quickly traverse the city: though not at the speed of teleportation it does the job well enough.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat will we do with the civilians once we recover them?

Alternatively we could all go together and avoid losing contact with anyone.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf we went together we\u2019d only be able to find one person at a time, though that may not be a problem. Have you located any survivors yet Caster?\u201d Yumigawa asked.<br><br>\u201cI do believe I\u2019ve found two. One near the corner where the Kita, Arakawa, and Bunkyo wards all intersect, and another in the Chuo ward, along the river near the northern end.\u201d He answered, showing everyone the map and pointing out the locations.<br><br>\u201cWe seem to have two Servants who can travel rapidly and take others with them.
