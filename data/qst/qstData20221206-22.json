Having saved the hidden village of Arcadia, you sat down with its chief, Anemone, who was half-Agarthan herself. There, she explained to you not just the true origin of the Agarthans, but of Fodlan as well. Claiming that the Agarthans were her sworn enemy, you entered an uneasy alliance with the woman, whom you had previously met as Alena.<br><br>Having received word that Professor Byleth was alive and now leading the Church of Seiros at Garreg Mach, Claude has sent you to accompany an Alliance diplomat to a clandestine meeting between the two.

So while she could turn a stone tablet into a gram of cheese, making a planet disappear or creating dragonballs is outside of her power. Also, you can&#039;t be cheeky with Imagine Dragon, it has no power over ANYTHING that is or was a living thing, including rogue proteins and DNA like viruses or dead schmucks. Since atoms are a part of both living and nonliving things, it could be reasonable to assume that Okira&#039;s power works down to the molecular level. Also, I personally believe that she isn&#039;t limited just by her own powerlevel, but by her sense of scale as well. It&#039;s called &quot;Imagine Dragon&quot; for a reason. If she thought of the strongest weapon that could &quot;cut through anything&quot;, she would be limited by her knowledge of what &quot;anything&quot; is. And if she and her stand were to say &quot;ONE COIN IS NOW 5 BILLION COINS&quot;, there would just be lots and lots of coins and not quite 5 billion, because it&#039;s a tall order for a toddler to fathom 5 billion of anything, and I don&#039;t think anyone here can imagine 5 billion coins either. And most damning is the fact that she doesn&#039;t quite understand the implications of some of her wishes since she&#039;s like, 4, I think. If she wished for a wooden house to be as big as a rocket, it would collapse in on itself because it can&#039;t support its own weight. If she wished for the gravity chamber to be stronger or have more gravity, she could accidentally make a black hole and kill everyone. If she wished that a baseball she threw traveled at the speed of light, the baseball would shred itself. And if that baseball was given immunity to air friction and miraculously didn&#039;t burn itself to pieces, it would decimate the unlucky city it collides with.<br><br>TL;DR: She isnt a wish dragon, geniuses.

For most protagonists this would be enough of an explanation but Hubert is not most. Hubert has problems, serious problems that will make being a demigod much harder. The complication is that these problems are mental and loosen the shackles on Hubert&#039;s soul, making his initial ascension much stronger.

I&#039;m not reading all this crap.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh look. In the end of these scrolls there are a few blank pages. Do you want them witch?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have them. Sadly there is no ink around, but you can always use blood I guess.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, this one is actually some kind of diary.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Read it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They left me here alone again. I don&#039;t mind being alone. I mind the implication that I am not more useful doing anything else other than gazing at the ocean. The motions are hypnotic. I light the beacon very rarely, only when someone comes with an order. I thought they would have me light it every night, but there is not enough fuel. I don&#039;t even know where this oil comes from. Sometimes the cold and the loneliness make me have impure thoughts. A few times now I have dreamed of a demon woman.

Unnar, however, is of a morose disposition and would much sooner prefer peace and quiet.

Each tribe has six resources: Population, Food, Water, Shelter, Materials and Goods. Population should be self-explanatory, it&#039;s the total number of people in your tribe (including children). Food, Materials and Goods are measured in qualities ranging from Exhausted to Abundant. These qualities represent a modifier to any roll involving their respective stat (ranging from -3 to +3). e.g holding a party/celebration would require a Food and Goods roll. Success in the roll means the resource remains unchanged in quality. Failure means either the action itself failed or the resources involved decreased in quality, or both, depending on the situation. All three have associated assets (e.g Fish, Stone, Tools) which provide narrative benefits (e.g you may trade assets). Water only has a binary quality, either you have access to it or you don&#039;t. Shelter describes all the housing in your tribe and the number of people housed by them. Here are your current stats:</span><br> - Population: 43<br> - Food: Sufficient (Fish, Forage, Meat)<br> - Water: Access provided by Lake<br> - Shelter (43/49): 2 Dwellings, 4 Huts, 5 Tents<br> - Materials: Surplus (Bone, Wood, Foilage, Clay)<br> - Goods: Abundant<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What will you do?</span>", "filename": "emberbloom", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 230, "h": 232, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670166406325092, "time": 1670166406, "md5": "ssXZ/maJKtYOYzFcv/QRyQ==", "fsize": 7437, "resto": 5481579, "id": "lnm/GTa9"}, {"no": 5485686, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)10:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Make the tea", "time": 1670168397, "resto": 5481579, "id": "OHAWgWLt"}, {"no": 5485828, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)14:18:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>give him the flowers", "time": 1670181491, "resto": 5481579, "id": "qHCPuy7I"}, {"no": 5486015, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485828</a><br>+1", "time": 1670192389, "resto": 5481579, "id": "E+RiA0+u"}, {"no": 5486052, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)17:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5485644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5485644</a><br>Could we send out the hunters for more If they return?

About the ancient war against the [Red]Demon Gods[Red], the very beings that now give magic to [Red]Mazeborn[Red] that try to explore the depths of [Red]Labyrinthos[Red], which resulted in the [Blue]Ancients[Blue] being locked away in this cursed place, even if this is the only existence you&#039;ve ever known.<br><br>Life continues, and it&#039;s not like [Red]Domdaniel[Red] is a particular bad place to live, as the [Blue]Ancients[Blue] have learned to prosper inside it&#039;s walls, but you&#039;ve always dreamed of something more like many others: Of exploring the neighbouring [Red]Rooms[Red], seeing lands so alien they could be confounded with other worlds, of defeating powerful enemies and becoming yourself a paragon of [Red]Power[Red]. You&#039;ve always wanted to be an adventurer. And for that single reason, you woke up this day. Just the day before, you graduated from high school, and now you&#039;re finally able to strut to the [Red]Crawler Base[Red] and start realizing your dreams. Your parents have tried dissuading you for some years now, but even confronted with the fear of death, madness or other horrible things, they soon understood that you couldn&#039;t be convinced otherwise in this matter.<br><br><span class=\"mu-s\">You look yourself in the mirror of your room smiling, congratulating yourself for surviving enough to finally see it through, the reflection in front of you showing..:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An Elf Mazeborn, with long pointed ears and a tall, sinous body, the aristocrats of this city, your inquisitive eyes glowing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Dwarf Mazeborn, short in stature but with a resilient body, your dextrous hands twitching with anticipation.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Pixie Mazeborn, one of the smallest but most agile races this dungeon has ever seen, wings flapping excitedly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Giant Mazeborn, growing a little more than twice an elf&#039;s height and with strenght to match, your muscles bulging.</span><br><br>[This is the time for you to create the Main Character.

Not being too much of an outside person, there wasn&#039;t anywhere you wanted to be either, at least until today.

Maybe something that takes advantage of our extant telepathic connections?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI see you\u2019ve already gotten rather chummy with this shady Master.\u201d She answered flatly, cutting right past your query. It seemed to you that she was emphasizing and quietly condemning what she considered insubordination on your part.<br><br>Defensively, you answer, \u201cNow look, he\u2019s been more cordial than anyone would have expected, hasn\u2019t attempted any underhanded tricks that I can see, and might even be qualified to help me recover my memory sometime later. As I recall, there\u2019s no rule that says the Masters need to be fierce enemies on a personal level for the Grail War to be completed. I get that his staying out of sight and using telepathy to communicate is worthy of concern on your part, but maybe you can compartmentalize our connection with some kind of item or potion.\u201d You decline to bring up creeping sense of uncertainty that flashed into your mind for the time being, as you worry that might jeopardize your relationship with your Servant. Maybe you can ask about \u2018Ur of the Chaldeans\u2019 at some point, though.<br><br>\u201cCompartmentalization? Alright, this should work.\u201d She said as two small blue crystals suddenly grew from the ground at her feet. As she reached down to pick them up, she also quietly muttered \u201cna\u00efve\u201d, and something to herself about how she \u2018should have expected\u2019 something or other.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019re those?

Once a person is attuned to one, he can send a request through it to the other crystal to telepathically contact the other person.\u201d Handing one to you, she continued, \u201cThat one\u2019s attuned to you, Master. I\u2019ll leave the other on the ground for the other Master to pick up after we\u2019ve left. I\u2019ve set them so that when a request to communicate is made, the crystal will gently vibrate and faintly glow, and the recipient may either answer or decline at his discretion. Your intuition should immediately tell you how to use it. Once he has this he won\u2019t have an excuse for employing direct telepathic contact again, but I\u2019m going to prepare a potion for you after we return that will block such attempts regardless, as a security precaution. The connections from our contact and through the crystals will be exempt, of course.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThat potion won\u2019t dull my senses, will it? He mentioned that the Master-Servant contract forced open telepathic faculties in people that otherwise couldn\u2019t use them, and if that\u2019s the case I thought I may be able to develop psychic abilities of some sort.\u201d You say, interested in what might be possible for you to learn.

The whole world went to shit and the fact that apes have started organizing hasn&#039;t made the situation any better. At first, it was glossed over as the deadliest plague in human history ravaged the world. But as the death toll rose and the ape Incidents went up it didn&#039;t take long for more than the tabloids to pick up the story. Whole settlements in Africa lucky enough to escape the Simian flu were found wiped out, and their people were brutally massacred or simply vanished. around the time Order began to break down and utilities became spotty was went shit hit the fan, the internet was aflame with videos of Apes attacking people in the streets, Apes, and soldiers fighting one another, the one that went viral, and truly began the panic, came out of Brussels. No one knows how the apes managed it, but during a live event in the European Parliament Apes with rifles stormed the building, massacring the gathered leaders within. one of the last humans in the room made his stand wielding the EU flagstaff as a makeshift spear. Warding off Apes as blood ran down his face, shouting at them commanding them to stay back. What happened next shook human civilization to its core. An Ape standing tall casually walked toward the man. The clumsy thrust the man offered was easily stopped by the Ape, ripping the flagstaff from his hands the man fell to the floor. Now on his belly looking up at the Ape holding the flagstaff of the tattered flag of the EU it spoke in a loud powerful voice &quot;No&quot; and then impaled the man. That clip sent the already faltering world into a death spiral Humanity already overwhelmed by the Simian Flu found itself having to divert resources to exterminating intelligent Apes.

Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing.

Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along. By being able to see her as she was, you made what the ritual was supposed to perform happen. Now, she refuses to return home, in case she can&#039;t return. She hasn&#039;t bothered you with more info yet.<br><br>The details are fuzzy, but her love is clear. You&#039;re not big on &#039;twu wuv&#039;, being a practical sort, but it&#039;s clear your fianc\u00e9e cares about you. And you definitely care about her.

If you &#039;give them up&#039;, then it&#039;s a little hard to see them at the wedding. And they owe it to your wife to treat her as part of your family. Dad is just gonna have to deal with it. And so is everyone else, because taking her on a tour of your hometown is both entertaining and will keep your leg from falling asleep.<br><br>She gives you a kiss before the two of you head back inside. As the sliding door closes, Alice stops to wave to you before heading out with her horde of well-dressed demons. &quot;Congrats!&quot;<br><br>Meryl is confused, but smiles. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Had a change of heart, huh?&quot;</span> she smiles. Having a vote of confidence from the sister-in-law is welcome, clearly.<br><br>&quot;Nope, I just heard the arguing.&quot; You almost stop her to explain, but she completes the thought with, &quot;If it&#039;s a girl, name her Alice!&quot; You have pretty good burst speed, but between not wanting to break the floor and being too shocked, the minx vanishes with a laugh.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;...At least it&#039;s easy to disprove,&quot;</span> she grumbles. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Anyway, bowling, right?&quot;</span> Or one of the shopping districts, or the theater, or the arcade, or your high school, or all of it, though the high school is probably closed.<br><br>Shopping district is easy, because there&#039;s a lot of access to everything else from there, and also because with a wedding on the horizon, stuff that&#039;s more durable and not for college-use is on the horizon. Moving some of the bigger stuff to Maine might be a bad idea, and not giving your friends anything to shop for might be a problem, but window shopping works.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;God yes,&quot;</span> Meryl nods. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Decoration is something my dad never did well. Inscrutable etchings from a long-dead Tuathde civilization, or maybe tide charts, pegged to the wall with thumbtacks. When I said shack, I meant shack. And all of the fish.

This makes them mindlessly obedient weapons who wont even hesitate to attack people. It also gives them &quot;Shadow moves&quot; which are moves with the shdaow type, so they hurt non shadow pokemon more then normal.<br><br>Team Cipher even made a legendary pokemon USING pure shadow hoohow, that was Shadow Lugia, very spooky. <br><br>Shadow pokemon can be cured through a combiantion of friendship and either science or magic. Used to be the power of celebi and time itself were needed, but science made the purity chamber.<br><br><br>THEN the Friendship Forward Coaltion, formed from a megacorp that created holes in the dimensional barrier to reach Pokemon from other dimensions, and a megacorp that awakened Eternatus, the fucking devil, in order to harness him and stop global warming. Both their leaders are in jail (By their own volation (Though one is also in the hospital)), and the companies swear they Arent Like That Anymore. They have bought up lots of land, created pokemon reserves and moved pokemon back into Orre.

She&#039;s fulfilling her promise to be an open book, even if she doesn&#039;t want to. &quot;D-Do you really have to know all about my peccadillos?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Those are the only things I know you for.&quot; You scratch the back of your head. This poor woman is flabbergasted. &quot;Vanessa, please, tell me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<span class=\"mu-i\">T-That shameful picture</span>...&quot; Vanessa raises both fists. &quot;Houda aided me in disposing of the original. But you know how well-connected Lady Ophelia was to my former colleagues. Even if there&#039;s merely a slight chance of her having a copy, I needed to verify it wasn&#039;t somewhere in this building. I only had the opportunity to check her office, and ended up empty-handed.&quot; Vanessa always has an ulterior motive for most of her incomprehensible actions. The kids saw her coming in through the window, looking into the fridge, and inspecting their mother&#039;s office. No wonder they think she&#039;s a burglar, even if she didn&#039;t actually steal anything \u2014 which isn&#039;t certain yet.<br><br>&quot;From my understanding, that weasel Liam was the one who took it, and I&#039;m pretty sure he wouldn&#039;t share that knowledge with anyone.&quot; You want to assure the lieutenant thaty there&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I recall that as well. But since I was required to be here, I thought a little rummaging was well worth the effort.&quot; Vanessa is being cautious. Which is a nice surprise.<br><br>&quot;Why did Mr. Auburn bring you along?&quot; Simple question, but you need to know.<br><br>&quot;To help with the kids!&quot; Vanessa is these kids&#039; nanny? Will they survive? &quot;Sadly, Agent Auburn was sent here on his lonesome to deal with this situation. But whenever someone is in need in Xumenlo, the policemen are here to lend a hand!&quot; That&#039;s code for &#039;there&#039;s nothing to do in a little town like this...&#039;, If you think about it, they&#039;re not *really* understaffed.<br><br>&quot;Okay, one more question, why is your butt so big?&quot; Every now and then you must ask these kinds of questions to know if they&#039;re aware of what they&#039;re carrying.<br><br>&quot;<span class=\"mu-i\">Oh dearie me...</span>&quot; Lt. van Zullekom&#039;s face activates her own crimzone.<br><br>&quot;Hmm?

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 138, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 133, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5487270, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)00:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5487267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5487267</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wanted to test Shiki&#039;s limits, to see where he&#039;d call it quits and why.

I might choose to look like a child, but I\u2019m far from actually being one.\u201d Child frown, folding her arms back. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t necessarily dislike this chaotic paradox of yours.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me.\u201d You retort. \u201cI\u2019m serious though. You\u2019re among one the few people who know of my real identity according to the stipulation of the wish I just pulled. And while you\u2019re not an enemy at the moment, it would be equally problematic if I let such a person go without ensuring you won\u2019t become a problem in the future.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cTrying to take away my advantage before I get the chance to use it. How astute and steely, there are the makings of a chaos lord in you yet. &quot;Child smiles, putting a hand on her hip while offering her other. \u201cFine, I suppose I have to accept your purposely since I\u2019ll still get a powerful familiar and ally either way. I\u2019ll do well to whip you into proper shape.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cTo be a balancer I have to have both qualities, something that you should try to be more honest with rather than repressing.\u201d You say, hitting at Child being influenced by the lord of order within her far more than she\u2019s willing to admit. Slowly reaching your hand out to meet hers to shake <br> <br><br>\u201cAre you sure you want to do something like this? Didn\u2019t you try to get this power precisely because you didn\u2019t want her to have full control over you? &quot;Robin spoke, putting a hand against your shoulder before drawing you close to chat privately. <br> <br>\u201cI did and that hasn\u2019t changed. But look at it from my perspective, I can\u2019t precisely abandon Child after hearing about what happened. A thirteen-year-old girl sacrificed herself to merge with this emotionless, demented archfiend. At best she\u2019s just Chaotic Neutral due to Amy\u2019s influence. At worst she made her turn from Chaotic Evil to Neutral Evil, perhaps lawful to an extent if we\u2019re lucky. But I want to bet there\u2019s inherent goodness in this amalgamation. She wants chaos, not destruction nor ruin or even pure evil, just chaos. She\u2019s a wildcard sure, but it&#039;s impossible to use that element of humanity to mitigate her chaotic impulses. &quot;You whispered. <br> <br>Con", "time": 1670361065, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5487863, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:40:57", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5487835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5487835</a><br>Turning to look at Child once more, your expression turned solemn as you think about the sacrifice of Amy and how effective it was in pacifying Child. You didn\u2019t want to think how worst things be if Child was truly back to their original self. \u201cPlus, I want to show her what it means to be human. Get her to at least experience the wonders of living and what makes life so precious and worth fighting for. Hopefully putting a pin on her plans at least long enough to consider the prospect of living a human\u2019s lifetime as an adequate investment to the question at hand.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cSo, by getting her to be lost in thought over this, you\u2019re hoping this be the trigger for her to be immersed in everything Earth has to offer. She\u2019ll chill out and reevaluate\u201d Robin mutters, giving himself time to digest all of this as he sees the big picture. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty incredible when it comes to handling kids, especially someone with as much power and authority as this one.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been babysitting my twin siblings since I was a kid. And before getting an actual job I used to run a babysitting gig. So, I say with confidence that I know how to handle children, superpowered ones included.\u201d You smile. <br> <br>\u201cI\u2019ll look to you if I ever need a den mother for a rowdy well-knit team of children.\u201d With that teasing remark, Robin removes his hand from your shoulders. I am letting you once again handle the situation with Child. <br> <br>Without saying another word, you quickly reached out to shake the fully adult Child\u2019s hand. Cementing the exchange between the two as an equal, mutual partnership between the dragon/knight and princess. Like with Gothika, a magical circle made up of countless arrays and ancient letters start to spread over your and Child\u2019s wrist. Binding the two in the ancient pact as you feel the sacred emanations spreading throughout your entire body. Just as quickly as it came, however, the blinding golden light quickly dissipated as did the branding on your arm. It was etched deep within your astral body, so it only needed to appear on your flesh when necessary. <br><br>With that taken care of, you let Child finish up doing what you enforced her to do. With a wave of her hand, she unleashed the crimson vortex she was building up during the conversation. Quickly enveloping the entire city, still frozen in time, with its torrential display of chaos. Like a vacuum cleaner, it sucks up all supernatural and magical elements brought upon by the influence of both Doctor Gotham and Barbatos. As well as taking up the evil influence and its corruption as well. She was as thorough as she was precise which was exceptional from the looks of it. <br><br>Con", "time": 1670362857, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5487865, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)16:45:46", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5487863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5487863</a><br>With how nonchalant Child looks throughout the endeavor, you get the feeling that she wasn\u2019t trying. She was doing the work swimmingly yes, but she was hardly exerting herself in cleaning up Gotham of its centuries-long issue. Making you question just how powerful she really was. Was this the standard with the Lords of Chaos or was she the exception as its vanguard and emissary? All the more you felt thankful you managed to smooth things out and reach this conclusion. While equipped for a bloodbath thanks to your endeavors, it was only meant as a last resort. So, you didn\u2019t want to tip Child\u2019s hand if you didn\u2019t have to. <br><br>Eventually, you would both see and feel the presence and its effects disappearing completely. Leaving Gotham as the still gothic and dark metropolis, but riding it off its never-ending cesspool of negativity and corruption. Like Child said, the city itself was rooted in crime, so it wasn\u2019t like this would fix everything and change the city overnight. At the very least, Gotham wouldn\u2019t be a lightning rod in terms of a magical hotbed for the supernatural and mystical side. Especially on the negative end, and honestly, that was good enough for you. <br><br>Now that the dead was done, you, Robin, and Child finally return on your trip to the Church. Time finally returned to normal after what probably felt like hours being frozen. Having been stopped at the tail end of the church, it only took a couple of minutes at best to reach the destination. With the moon now rising, you feel the light of Judah finally receding into your body. Although retaining the lioness appearance, you felt far from the all-encompassing embodiment of the Sun that you previously were. Yet this didn\u2019t deter you as you held another ally with you. The Gentle Darkness. <br> <br>Standing at the edge of the entrance to the church, you look defiant toward what\u2019s inside. Feeling the strong presence of the book within these hallowed grounds. There was no doubt that what you have been searching for at long last was within your grasp. Almost as if the universe was doing you a solid for what it put you through before this point. This was your first official battle against the supernatural. No pressure. <br> <br>Breaking the silence, Child abruptly took to sitting on one of the statues, having returned to her adolescent form. \u201cFor the record, I will not directly help you. I\u2019m already saddled enough as it is having to deal with the forces that you brought by making yourself successor to the Great Darkness. So, if you want my boom for being my anchor and Dark Knight, you\u2019re going to have to show me your stuff.\u201d <br><br>&quot;If Doctor Gotham or any outside forces try and interfere with your fight with the Ghost and the Vamp, then I will assist.

Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

Cloistered in their high-up communities as they are, there&#039;s not much hope of keeping track of them, but where most of the continent is indifferent to them Twaryians <span class=\"mu-i\">really</span> don&#039;t like them, so the chance of them being a threat is small.<br>The villages that are more accessible tend to understand the status quo and pay small recognition to the state. Most of the population on an individual basis consider the Mountainfolk better off left alone, and if encountered away from their homes (as plenty do leave the mountains), to avoid making any close associations, since though they are not nearly as belligerent as Twaryians they have a similar insistence on clinging to their peculiar beliefs and customs, and more pertinently, keeping secrets about both. They&#039;re not seen as completely untrustworthy like a Vyemani is, but somebody so insistent yet proud of secrets is at least a little bit shifty.<br><br>Suffice it to say, having a mosshead acquaintance is fine, but nobody respectable would ever marry a mountain man. Sometimes, though, a mountain person is hard to pick out if they <span class=\"mu-i\">don&#039;t</span> insist on maintaining their culture and religious practices. Twaryians are oddly capable of picking them out.<br><br>...For those unfamiliar, &quot;mosshead&quot; is a derogatory term for Mountainfolk, or as they call themselves, &quot;Nief&#039;yem.&quot; They&#039;re called such because of a genotype where a large portion of them (though far from all) have hair color that ranges from bright emerald to forest green- the more polite term, because of where they live. Anywhere where there&#039;s mountains, there&#039;s at least a few green hairs. They were one of the native peoples on the continent since before the arrival of the Nauk, but are very reclusive in most of Vinstraga, and don&#039;t speak much about themselves to outsiders. Occasionally the more adventurous or restless of them will come down from the mountains either by themselves or in bands, to be absorbed into the general population. A necessity at times, since Mountainfolk hardly limit the size of their families to the theoretical limitation of the resources of their homes.<br><br><a href=\"#p5480111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5480111</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how frequently do real-world semitic names come up in the new world, outside of mountainfolk?

It wouldn&#039;t be unusual for somebody of common birth to discover that somewhere in their family line, somebody chained themselves to a nice stranger with a curious lack of family history, or a rather strangely constructed one. Mountainfolk are just as pale as Nauk are, after all, so the earthier-tone haired ones wouldn&#039;t be squinted at.

But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher.

He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference. There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs. The cloaked figure turns on its heel and enters into the swirling mass. <br><br>Bucklin inches forward as if he\u2019s going to give chase.<br><br>You---<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop him. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the other side. It could very well be a death wish.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go with him.

You do have one more option though.<br><br>Closing your eyes again, you focus on your sixth sense, searching for any signs of dark matter.<br>You can&#039;t sense any wraiths nearby, but there is a feeling... something gigantic. All-encompassing, even. Looking out one of the portholes... yeah, it&#039;s the planet below you.<br><br>There is of course a slight sensation from your suit, and from Sanig&#039;s... and a strong sensation coming from the demon&#039;s core, still in it&#039;s sack with the other loot.<br><br>&quot;Come on, come on... she ate enough of them, surely...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you still trying that hoodoo shit?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#039;s not even remotely the right word for it, Sanig. And no, i&#039;m trying something else.&quot;<br><br>As you focus your senses more, you&#039;re able to sense just the slightest wraith-y signature somewhere on the ship. Far too faint to be an actual wraith, but definitely not background noise.<br>You jog over to the corner of the cargo bay and push one of the crates aside, revealing a metal grate that looks to have been dissolved by acid.<br><br>Shining your helmet light inside, you can just barely see Princess&#039; head as she lays there, hibernating inside a t-junction.<br><br>&quot;Found her.&quot; You announce.<br><br>&quot;What?

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.
