Although, your attention wasn\u2019t sharply focused on the supposed robin. So, you couldn\u2019t accurately deduce whether or not you were imagining things. Deciding that it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble, you merely brushed it aside and turned your attention back to the task at hand. You didn\u2019t want to take any side trips or indulge in going off on a detour. A month was already pushing your limits. <br> <br>At the same time, you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to immediately follow the presence you\u2019ve been sensing. Unlike Jump City, this was brand new territory for you, as well as you didn\u2019t have a single ally to back up. So, to jump right into where the grimoire blindly without taking the time to assess your surroundings was practically suicide. Especially when you recall all the stories that permeate the city of Gotham. All the more reason that you need to think smartly and act coolly in the face of adversity. <br><br>Thus, you decided the best course of action was to become aware of your surroundings and acquire information via reconnaissance. Preferably do it quickly and quietly, no different than any other wandering traveler. Wearing nothing but a black long-sleeved crop top, matching black choker, white miniskirt, black socks, and white running sneakers. You already hold that part down, despite the boldness of your attire as you keep your backpack lodged around your arms. <br><br>It would be much easier storing inside of you through the rainbow elixir though. Unfortunately, that would mean using up one of your three slots for the power of dimensional storage via Absorption (Gray). You couldn\u2019t afford to be wasteful or careless in what combo you would apply. Although you could swap out one color for another, it still took time and effort to cleanse you of a specific color without affecting the others. And even more, time applying a brand-new color without disruption. <br><br>Through your girdle, you can painlessly extract your divine blood and make the flasks necessary for your thirty-three colors. But again, acquiring the resources and applying them were two completely different challenges. Then there\u2019s the fact that while the Pleroma was infinite, that didn\u2019t mean your blood was as well. Sure, it recovered and replenished itself far faster than most living organisms, especially when consuming sustenance. You were still operating on a finite amount. <br><br>Reckless and/or excessive drain without rest would greatly weaken you. Both in your physical as well as mental constitution and prowess, including the effects of your power bestowing blood. While you never tried to reach that threshold of your upper limits. You held the strong distinction that death by blood loss was still within the realm of possibility for you. All the more important is that you choose carefully if not wisely whenever applying the three colors.", "filename": "image_2022-11-15_135529866", "ext": ".png", "w": 1152, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668538555918299, "time": 1668538555, "md5": "/adPjOdN+LOZ22mhxTePzw==", "fsize": 638620, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5464212, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)13:59:16", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5464208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5464208</a><br>The sole exception was \u201crainbow\u201d, but you didn\u2019t want to gamble on something you couldn\u2019t fully control or apply without the grimoire. After all, it was something that the Phantom Stranger told you, but only the bare minimum. It was another incentive to grab the grimoire back. Yet you carry the distinct suspicion it was also a warning. Like some sort of automatic defensive mechanism that would act on its own even without the grimoire. Only on a more volatile if not catastrophe-level if left unchecked. <br><br>Putting that aside you already begin taking steps to apply the three colors of choice. Gold, White, and Tan, with an emergency second set of Red, Indigo, and Silver for backup. The second set would only come into effect when the primary set was retired. This setup was a recently unlocked function provided by the Phantom Stranger, although you brute forced it into awakening from excessive testing. He merely stabilized it to make up for the early inclusion. After scolding you of course. <br><br>Hopefully, you wouldn\u2019t need such a setup since this should be an easy task. Slowly but steadily apply the colors over your body, practically resembling a graffiti tattoo over your porcelain skin. After putting the finish touches the colors quickly morphed before vanishing. In their places runic symbols once again start to form, originating from your back before spreading to your limbs and torso. Much like the paint they quickly disappeared as quickly as they appeared. Yet they still permeated around you, seen only by the supernatural or otherworldly. <br><br>\u201cAlright, now I\u2019m all set.\u201d You murmured to yourself, currently alone in a secluded alleyway.

The extraction process always seems to leave you feeling weary, but the rush you got from applying the colors always seems to be more than make up for it.

It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara.

So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai.

Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 1, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463647, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)22:57:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463642</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;He wins this round, at the cost of the war.

Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted.

Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (\u517d\u8bcf\u4e66\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8fbe-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u5f0f, Sh\u00f2uzh\u00e0osh\u016bw\u00e8ig\u0101od\u00e1-R\u00e9nl\u00e8ix\u00edngsh\u00ec.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself. Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder.

The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition. It&#039;s absolutely normal. Anyone would be nervous. <span class=\"mu-s\">There is no reason ton panic.</span><br><br>You continue repeating this to yourself as your best friend, Jason, drives the van. A minute ago you felt somewhat disassociated, as if you were really just an observer, floating behind yourself and staring, but that&#039;s getting better now. The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things. What were you saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was asking what major you were planning on doing again. You were still undecided last month, right?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you still are.

It is just a constant like death and taxes that you have been lucky enough to avoid up until now. But you have no choice but to confront it now.<br><br>The thought that hundreds, thousands, or possibly even millions before you could have gone through similar trials re-energizes you somehow. You are still terrified of course- it can be considered your good fortune that you emptied your bladder before bed- but you are also ready to face whatever this all is. You may not succeed, and you may go out being torn limb from limb shitting and screaming, but at the very least you will put your all into preventing said demise.<br><br>Newfound resolution does not quite translate to courage though. Or, if you were to put it in terms that left you with some modicum of pride, it does not translate to foolhardiness.

More, if possible. You return to your room, lock the door, make sure it&#039;s locked, and then begin building a barricade against the door as quietly as possible. Boxes, nightstand, et cetera, et cetera. As you&#039;re doing so, the problem of how to arrange the whole thing comes up. A blockade is helpful in preventing things from coming in but, obviously, it also prevents you from going out. Perhaps it&#039;s best to leave one door unblocked, just in case?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s less likely that something will try to get in via the bathroom door than the hallway door.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Cut through the walls of the hall and the rooms around them to bypass the blast door- and hope that the struts here are spaced further apart then they were by the intake to the desalinator - or find an alternate route through the hulk using the schematic. Which of these options is the best depends on which side of the door is the sealed off portion. If you are on the side that was sealed off by the ship&#039;s engineers in a failed attempt to contain the infestation, then whatever danger there is here, you have already passed it by, so there is no reason to worry about continuing on your intended path. Alternatively, it it is the other side of the door that was intended to be quarantined, then it is possible that there are things beyond the door that even still are dangerous, in which case, it makes the most sense to find an alternate route. <br><br>Of course, the issue is that you have no way of knowing for sure which side is which, so you cannot say for a certainty which decision is the right call to make. It would stand to reason that conduit worms would get bigger the closer you were to get to the power plant - which would point towards the other side of the door being the quarantined section ... except that this power plant only fed the afterburners, which weren&#039;t anywhere near here, and the desalinator, which was in the same bulkhead. Beyond that, there were no other connections - it was a completely isolated system. And regardless of proximity to the power plants, you have seen how conduit worms as far away as the aft cargo bay can grow to preposterous sizes. <br><br>Perhaps it would be worth investigating a bit, trying to look around to see if there are any clues as to which side was which?

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference.

Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.

We are returning from space!<br><br>==Archive==<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/qstarchive.html?tags=KingQM<br><br>I\u2019ll be reposting the thread 4 summary for new anons and add to it for the stuff that happened in threads 4 and 5. <br><br>==Beginning of Summary of ALL of Vegeta Quest==<br>Vegeta, rightful holder of the title &quot;Prince of all Saiyans&quot; after the fall of his planet, has seen his life change in the past year. What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 488, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 483, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463352, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:32:13", "name": "KingQM", "com": "It&#039;s not dead yet!

BLOGPOST WARNING !!! <br><br><a href=\"#p5463361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463361</a><br>Will to write is a tough bippy to handle when you&#039;re QMing. It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

The relationship between you and your mother\u2019s boyfriend is distant and mostly not existent. But is not confrontational by any means.

Your mom stays at home all day, she cleans cooks, and dose the normal roles of any housewife. But also has all the time in the world to pursue her hobbies. Which consist of, painting, playing guitar, and tons of other athletic hobbies. She spins way too much time at the gym, doing yoga and varies dance classes.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Mostly asking ya to do this as a precaution. Thanks Pantea.\u2019<br><br>Meanwhile, most of the teams have selected their fighters, and a lot of them have pretty decent picks. Pantea gives them a quick and basic tutorial as she moves around checking the other arcades, nominally prepping them for free play. And so, the various arcade consoles for the Battle Simulator light up\u2026<br><br>Lime and Monty manage things well, with their team of Acer and yourself being able to dish out some great damage against the green bug monsters they\u2019re set up against.

And\u2026 oooh, just 100 HP short! Well, they got 4 points.<br><br>Videl and Sharpner on the other hand end up selecting ones of Hercule and Goku, to your slight surprise. Ahh, trying the strategy Pantea showed \u2018em! Mr. Satan\u2019s cheering gives dad a boost in power, one that does massive damage\u2026 aaah, but Sharpner doesn\u2019t get the follow-up! 300 HP short of a knockout! 4 points again.<br><br>But Latte and Java definitely know what they\u2019re doing. They might not be martial artists themselves, but they can understand the game\u2019s rules very well.

So close! 250 HP left! But yet again, 4 points.<br><br>Sala and Zarid by all rights should be doing quite well, they end up picking Gohan and Pantea (not a surprise there), and launch an all out assault\u2026 but miss the timing on the attacks, getting good, but not great damage in, leaving a much larger chunk of HP than the others. 1500. So\u2026 3 points for them.<br><br>https://youtu.be/u7biRs8WvZY<br><br>In contrast, Penn is acing this game, Angela more just watching on as he has Yamcha and Tien smash through the foe and finish it off with a combo attack! \u201cWolf Fang Machinegun Fist!\u201d the pair of fighters shout from the arcade, sending the monster flying! KO! Full five, and bonus for them too!<br><br>Not to be outdone, Team Green ends up picking two green fighters themselves, Piccolo and\u2026 Piccolo.

Four points.<br><br>And finally, Ikose and Sibella get Lapis and Yamcha to show off some great teamwork, but the key to their success comes with the two ending up accidentally discovering that the two can fuse!

Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me.

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace.

After confronting a gang of lesser vampires on the hunt for prey in the railroad town of Farson, you were directed to the backwater mining town of Almy, which you found a practical ghost town. After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire. You were able to kill the strigoi, but it was hiding underground to conceal the fact it had bred an even rarer, deadlier type of vampire, a moroi. You were able to slay it, though Wiktoria was left exhausted. Now, you\u2019ve arrived in Montana, to deliver a report to Wiktoria\u2019s boss, the Vampire Prelate Cec\u00edlia. <br><br><span class=\"mu-s\">June 10th, 1884<br>Carpathia, Montana Territory</span><br><br>Sorry for the month-long wait for the Conclusion thread folks, been back to work and all that. <br><br>Previous Thread: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive/2022/5345941/", "filename": "DH OP", "ext": ".png", "w": 2708, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 138, "tim": 1665112917299315, "time": 1665112917, "md5": "9EcW4IXRUyja9O3BMFInBg==", "fsize": 6668274, "resto": 0, "id": "j2Di2wT6", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "damned-hunter-case-0-the-conclusion", "trip": "!!1MSx2/jclIz", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 17, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 12, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5436585, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)15:54:07", "name": "Wide Pride", "com": "\u201cSo, what now?

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them. And after so much events the sweet lady Takable was spending the evening with you. <br><br>But let us begin, as per tradition, by a small prologue about events that take place in other parts of the strange world that you call India.<br><br>PROLOGUE :<br><br>In the darkest tunnels of the terrible fortress that we already visited one can see a quite pitiful group. They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life. Sighting he agreed and began to tell.<br><br>-Do you want a tale about the Master ?<br><br>-Yes, yes tell us a tale about the Master !", "filename": "Local Lord Venn Diagram", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 627, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 223, "tim": 1664740339034480, "time": 1664740339, "md5": "OIW5QXjJ6iWK8hjl3b46RQ==", "fsize": 53045, "resto": 0, "id": "G4a+iYXH", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "local-lord-quest-v", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 417, "images": 49, "omitted_posts": 412, "omitted_images": 48, "last_replies": [{"no": 5464095, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)10:27:53", "name": "Local Lord", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463555</a><br><a href=\"#p5463742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463742</a><br><a href=\"#p5463837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463837</a><br><a href=\"#p5463869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463869</a><br><a href=\"#p5463911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463911</a><br><br>You decided to immediately call Ishaan Devi once you were in the village. You needed to see how the peasants repaired their homes and their barn before anything else. And how they coped with the lack of supplies. You rode in the village and ordered a guard to call him. All the peasants who were here looked at you, they seemed to be less ugly than those of your southern villages, probably the magical explosion had changed them the least, you saw children looking at you in awe and men discussing. It was the first time that you came here and everybody wanted to see their lord. Two quite pretty girls, one blonde and one brunette whispered while they saw you and smiled, you smiled them back and they reddened. You didn&#039;t want to say bad things about the dead but you were concious that if less experienced in matters of ruling you were more beautiful than the old lord Random. Finally the ancient who looked like a Saracen but wasn&#039;t one of them appeared and bowed very low.<br><br>-My lord, how may I be of use.<br><br>-Ishaan Devi, I have came here for multiple reasons. I want to see how you began to build back your houses after a week. And if the lack of provisions doesn&#039;t hurt you too much. Show me everything.<br><br>-Of course my lord, your generous offer of paying less taxes was very helpful but unfortunately we have not a lot of money left to buy grain for the winter. But we will manage, it will be hard but we shall manage.<br><br>He bowed but you continued, this time higher.<br><br>-I am concious of this, and to give money and work to some of you I shall recruit new men into my guard. Assemble all the young men who want to join the guard on the main square of the village I will see them after our tour.<br><br>There were cheers amongst the populace, some men wanted to avenge their village from the bandits and others wanted simply to work to give some very needed coin to their family. You could probably recruit quite a lot of soldiers here, of course you lacked money but you could always try to find a place for two or three soldiers.<br><br>Ishaan began to show you the village, trying to give you a big picture of what was what. He walked with a cane but quite quickly while you rode your horse, it was normal, peasants walked, noblemen rode.<br><br>-See my lord... Otherone is built around a small pond one of the rare ponds in these quite arid lands, there is more rain around here than in other lands and small streams give us the ability to farm crops. Not a lot of them but enough for my farm, the Pondich\u00e9ry farm and seven others to exist. But the majority of our people raise livestock, sheeps and pigs.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise.

He&#039;s only a little older than you but everybody treats him so much differently! It isn&#039;t fair. Father and mother have been gone since this morning as well, and it was left to the household servants to take care of you all day. They didn&#039;t explain anything, attempting to distract you with games and music but only succeeding in putting you more on edge. <br><br>Almost as soon as the servants put you to bed you snuck out of your room and back out into quiet halls of the mansion, tiptoeing along through the shadows until you caught sight of a group of adults entering your father\u2019s study\u2026<br><br>In the dim light you cannot make out who they are, but as the heavy double doors to the study close behind them you hurry over to try and listen in.

You hear heavy footsteps on the other side of the door, slowly growing louder as they approach.
