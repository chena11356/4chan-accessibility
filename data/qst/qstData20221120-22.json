Nobody else is speaking. The prisoners look devastated up close, their clothes torn. Even in this state it&#039;s easy to tell person&#039;s social status by glance. Most of these people pass as commoners in these parts, you guess from their slightly malnourished frame and hunched posture. Those people look like soldiers or guards, still marching in more organised formation than the rest, head taller than most of their captors.

Another isn&#039;t able to get out of the way in time, blocked in on both sides by other cars, coming straight down the lane at Wild Dog, who&#039;s picking himself up off his feet. &quot;Hell no, mothafucka!&quot; you hear him shout as he raises a fist, charging it up with a dense concentration of chi, and brings it down on the hood of the oncoming racecar. The blow levers the car into launching straight over his head, flipping end over end through the air until it lands with a crash of twisted metal.<br><br>Willing to take the risk to avoid missing the opportunity, you vault the barricade and follow him out onto the racetrack. The onlookers are going wild as you trade blows in the middle of the street, surrounded by racecars tearing past at blinding speeds. The red flags are waving, announcements are being shouted, the stewards are trying to stop the race, cars are swerving and braking to avoid you and the crashed wrecks, it&#039;s absolute chaos.<br><br>Finally, your moment comes when Wild Dog throws a jab then swings for a big punch. You have just enough time to thrust your hands forward and fire a jet of water into his chest. All it does is stop his attack and force him to stumble back a couple feet. But that&#039;s all you need to put him into the path of the oncoming car.<br><br>The impact sends him flying, right over the barricade on the opposite side you came in front.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely.

Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system.

I can only assume it&#039;s tied to a lion symbol correlating to you on a personal level. Quite possibly religious or family ties.\u201d Like that, Robin proves that his detective skills and general mental acuity are something you shouldn\u2019t take lightly.

Give me the strength to overcome any adversity or strife, while conquering the embodiment of my inner beast and not being a slave to the darker emotions inside me.\u201d You explained, trailing off a tad when it came to addressing the elephant in the room.

Part of me still feels bitter resentment for the man who took everything from me. It was only for a brief moment, but I felt immense rage welling up inside me. A vehement desire or passion that\u2019s deeply drenched with fury, almost threatening to swallow me whole despite its righteousness. At worst turning me into some sort of wraith embodying pure, unadulterated wrath. If those old people didn\u2019t show up when they did, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d <br><br>Before you could say anything further, Robin would put his hand against your shoulders.

Even as an eight-year-old child I knew wholeheartedly what revenge could do to a person. I wrestled with such feelings like they were a pack of wild animals. I wanted to catch the guys who caused my parents\u2019 deaths, bring them to justice, or even just get the chance to make them pay for what they did. They had no right to take them away from me, and for what? Just to fatten their pockets and other acts of selfishness. I will never forgive them, nor forget them for as long as I\u2019m still living.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI had my mentor keeping me from going down the line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed. But I won\u2019t say that for the next seven years I didn\u2019t struggle with those inner demons. So again, I know exactly what you\u2019re going through right now. I won\u2019t tell you that you should give it up or look to forgive him. You, more than anyone needs closure, something that genuinely can be found in catching the man yourself.

That is the name you wear with pride! As the wisest of all demonic beasts and greatest Wild Princess to grace the mortal realms with their presence in at least ten generations. In the palace of the failure of an emperor Long Tiantunri, you had done what no magical beast has done since the mere existence of beasts with intellect to match that of mankind was outlawed by the nine heaven&#039;s themselves, reaching the &quot;True&quot; awakening as detailed with the treasured relic left behind by the long dead Niu Bingwen, the divine manual, the Bestial Edict to Attain- Human Form (\u517d\u8bcf\u4e66\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8fbe-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u5f0f, Sh\u00f2uzh\u00e0osh\u016bw\u00e8ig\u0101od\u00e1-R\u00e9nl\u00e8ix\u00edngsh\u00ec.)<wbr>, by reaching a true and intimate understanding of human nature and wisdom and realizing you have held it in your paws for sometime, as well as in your own passionate imperial heart.<br><br>And if you were not in the den of a dog who needed culling and quick, you would have began the trial and faced the mandate of the heavens by attempting to undergo the tribulation traditionally faced by Awakened Beast such as yourself. Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head.

Before the Nauk the continent was naught but chaos, and the order of conquest united the stricken, barbaric land. A thousand years after the landings of Sversk the Conqueror, the last strained ties holding the Nauk Imperial together fell apart, but all would remember the Nauk Imperial being the beginning of history- and the inheritors of its glory, proud to call themselves the first of Vinstragan men.<br><br>The southern country of Vynmark claims a part of this lost glory, successors of the Nauk as both princes of the land, and lords of the sea, the latter which has made them exceptionally wealthy in recent times as the goods of the newly opened east flow around the isolationist Twaryi and through the greedy and unquestioning merchants of Vynmark\u2019s shores, overseen by the noble Landgrafs and their high courts. Confident atop their enormous wealth, and their subjects content to feed off the succulent scraps of luxury, Vynmark has found itself ill prepared for the rapid change of today\u2019s world\u2026<br><br>Our generation was meant to know nothing but peace.<br><br>Vynmark was safe, and prosperous.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition.

The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things. What were you saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was asking what major you were planning on doing again. You were still undecided last month, right?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you still are.

The longer what&#039;s outside takes to notice, the longer you have to make distance from the window. And given how wide open parts of the yard can be, unless you plan to just hide in the greenery you&#039;re going to want that extra time.<br><br>First, you tie your blanket around the nightstand, making a thick knot at the end opposite of its door. You plan to have the end with more wood face the window, while you weight the rest down with books and such and attempt to keep it in place with boxes. It&#039;s certainly not the most stable system you can think of, but, well, it&#039;s better than nothing. After securing the blanket you twist into the shape of the rope and then knot it to your spare blanket. Then you twist your spare blanket and tie it to your coat, which you twist and tie to several interconnected sweatshirts using each other for support. Now that rope itself is done.<br><br>Once the rope is done, you go over each knot, tugging slightly. Double checking, and then quickly triple-checking to make sure everything is in place. Given the sound of doors being thrown open and things occasionally being knocked over downstairs your time is certainly limited, but you need to make sure your rope won&#039;t just give out on you before anything else.<br><br>From there, you turn your attention to reinforcing your anchor. You quietly move over to the edge of the barricade and begin removing a few boxes from it- your books. A lot of people complain about print books being heavy and weighty nowadays, and talk about switching to a Kindle, but fuck you&#039;re glad you have them now. Your nightstand is essentially a piece of wood hollowed out to have a cabinet in it, and you&#039;ll need to fill that up if you&#039;re to have any hope of it staying in place.<br><br>You move the nightstand and books close to, but out of view of the window, and begin stuffing your metaphorical turkey. It is a monotonous but easy process, and you manage to finish it before too long. With that done, all you need to do is move the thing into place and shore it up with a few boxes around it. You will leave that for now you suppose.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

Both options ultimately put you out in the hallway with the drone.While it is true that you have the schematic to use as a map, and with your boosters, you are a lot faster than it, none of that constitutes a guarantee that you are going to make a clean break from this damned thing. What if you were following the schematic, but you ended up outside another sealed blast door, and the drone ended up cornering you? What if you managed to lose it this time, but on your way back through here with a full load of conduit you ran into it again? <br><br>The more you think about it, the more certain you are that there is nothing certain about running away from it. No, if you want to truly put this drone business past you - and you do - then the only way to do that is to bag and tag this drone. To that end, you are going to need someway to lead the drone into tighter quarters. You could use yourself as bait, or try finding more trash to throw around, but that feels ... well, it doesn&#039;t feel certain, that is for sure. And with something as unpredictable as a bespoke autonomous drone, you need to be certain. Now steel - or whatever the fuck these struts are made out of - that is certain. If you got this thing stuck on a spike, on a <span class=\"mu-i\">spear</span>, then it should be a relatively straightforward process to getting this thing stuck in a corner somewhere. <br><br>So as the drone closes the distance, instead of squeezing your way out, you turn your attention to the struts. You can tell just by looking at them that they are non-critical, and a bunch of them have holes through them where conduit was once run, which will make them even easier to work through. But one of them - coincidentally one of the struts by the hole you just cut out into the hallway - really catches your eye. Not only has it been rather crudely repaired, either they didn&#039;t bother fixing all of the damage, or this unlucky strut got beat to Hell and back on two different occasions. You should be able to breeze through this strut - well, relatively speaking, at least. As you bring your torch to bear, you consider using cutting flux here, but ultimately decide against it, as having a rough, splintered and all around irregular end should make the business of sticking this bumbling bale easier. You get to work on the bottom of the strut first, focusing pulling apart the shoddy repair-job. It is kind of funny, actually - if you had to guess, you would say that this strut was salvaged from another wreck.

The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt.

There&#039;s honestly no telling where players will take your quest, nor is it certain that they&#039;ll take the bait and follow what you&#039;ve got planned. Sometimes you get lucky, but more often than not you&#039;ll be surprised! Whether or not that&#039;s a pleasant surprise is up to you.<br><br>What I recommend is coming up with nodes--specific encounters or stopping points in advance. Maybe you tell the players that your city is controlled by four distinct gangs, each one more unique and fierce than the last. Maybe your character is given several lands to search: the seaside to the South, the desert to the North, or the bustling metropolis run solely on gambling to the West. By offering these options, you can get a grip on what you should prep for, and even if your players don&#039;t take the rope you expected, you can still plan for the future if they follow up later!<br><br>This works with characters and encounters too--if you plan, for example, a dramatic fight on a cliffside, you&#039;ll be ready if players venture near a cliff. Whether they&#039;re passing by with a merchant&#039;s caravan or there to slay a particularly-elusive beast for its lustrous scales doesn&#039;t really matter--the point is that you&#039;ve got a sick-ass cliff battle planned in advance!<br><br>In short, planning for specific updates is a good way to get burnt, especially if players pick something you aren&#039;t willing or ready to write. Again, there&#039;s a good chance that they might follow the pathways you&#039;ve laid down, but with quests being so heavily story-oriented there&#039;s a good chance that write-in or not your players will surprise you. The best bet is to be flexible, don&#039;t take no for an answer, and if you do prep in advance have a whole bunch of encounters and nodes available that you can plop into the story when needed.<br><br><a href=\"#p5470249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470249</a><br><a href=\"#p5470260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470260</a><br>+1 to what this anon said. Getting banned and/or losing players is far better than being strongarmed into writing stuff you aren&#039;t comfortable in doing.

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end.

The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers.

He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 490, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 485, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463361, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Just wait till we get to page 10.<br>Also I hope this doesn&#039;t go the wait of that One Piece isekai quest i reagrds with &quot;the will to write&quot;, we already suffered enough.", "time": 1668462541, "resto": 5436238, "id": "NAMydAt2"}, {"no": 5463772, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Glad to see you haven\u2019t retired to your attack pod just yet.<br>It\u2019s fine to keep using this thread until page 9/10 if you want, there\u2019s plenty of time left before it falls off of the board.", "time": 1668494631, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5464248, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:38:18", "name": "KingQM", "com": "I&#039;ll wait til page 10 then, probably not that far away.<br><br>!!!

It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

Because you&#039;ve had time to spend to yourself, you&#039;ve had plenty an evening among the people (high and lowborn alike) of song and dance and storytelling of the Old Kingdom and the desert homeland. Sharing the culture of those ancient humans and yourself, across time and distance with these humans now. Even aspects of the old faith, so that you can avoid confusion in the future and impart to people how they can best pay tribute to you if they absolutely must, although of course you&#039;d prefer if they kept their valuables to themselves!", "filename": "too much divine favor!", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 450, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1669000036476857, "time": 1669000036, "md5": "GtP0NnvkoHoiaQ1L6bbQ/Q==", "fsize": 869080, "resto": 5435965, "id": "8yvCpqJ8"}, {"no": 5470441, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)22:08:19", "name": "The Eye", "com": "This does cause some ire from the populace, although as usual it&#039;s mainly the nobles who continue to feel you are not behaving properly as a leader and certainly not as a goddess, potentially in opposition to their God. In some ways you win favor by your deeds yet in other ways you lose it by your actions. Darry at least can speak privately, that overall favor of you by the nobility is fairly low, and rather they favor it when you are simply gone and leadership is left among them to manage the town. Although this doesn&#039;t particularly bother you, in keeping to the old Menaji ways, you&#039;ve increasingly questioned the value the nobles bring to the table. You agreed to play their game and follow their rules when it suits you, but how simple it would be if they just... went away. No more nobles, no more trouble, just you and the love of your people.<br><br>Well one such cause of contention among the court, is the matter of family. They cannot seem to wrap their heads around the idea that, as a goddess, you aren&#039;t just going to up and die like some mortal ruler. You may not dwell in Bexley forever but as their leader, you very well could sit the throne with consistency till the world stopped turning and all passed into night. No, like they expect you to behave in some ways, so too do they expect a family rather than just a lone regent. Though you sense among them, much of the desire is their hope that a mortal partner would balance, temper your divinity. If not get you to behave better, then at least be a more reliable line of appeal to your heart. At the very least, a man wouldn&#039;t permit you to wander around in scanty revealing clothes that are most unbecoming of a royal lady!<br><br>Maybe they&#039;re not wrong to want this, and you suppose if you desire to unite the land then you probably won&#039;t be able to do it alone. Maybe you could, but how difficult that would be, when instead you could have an extended family to help you. Another sacrifice of yours for the sake of humanity, in the big picture, although love and family could never be called a sacrifice. Ah but once again you run up against difficulty with these people, in the way of social and cultural norms of these &quot;modern&quot; humans. If you had it your way, you might imagine that you could end up having a different family to each of the remaining towns; what better way to ensure their prosperity and survival than your own blood, for when you can&#039;t be everywhere at once? Or at the very least you feel you shouldn&#039;t be constrained to any one mortal, when your potential is so much more. But these nobles, and to an extent the populace wouldn&#039;t have it, as far as you can tell.

Even limiting yourself, surely there&#039;s plenty of decent candidates as you already know, but weighing merit by what they bring to the table... perhaps it has to be yet another sacrifice of yours for the sake of humanity? Unfortunate, that you can&#039;t just follow your heart... in this season spent working, there is a particular man you yourself have gained feelings for, rather than the other way around as usual.

All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Guess who will be the next priestess of this town?&quot;<br>&quot;Have you been accepted for Temple training?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but it is in a distant town. I could wait until the merchants show up and go with them there, but then again I would lose one year. I figured since the two of you are so eager to get killed by monsters, you could protect me on the way there. Not that I think there are many monsters to go around, but even a weak monster could kill me if I travel alone and it finds me asleep.&quot;<br>&quot;So you want us to watch your sleep as you travel?&quot;<br>&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>&quot;Hold on a second. This is mercenary work. We require pay.&quot;<br>Elise laughs.<br>&quot;I assumed you&#039;d ask something weird like that. Well, I&#039;ll give you food. I also asked the smith to make a couple swords for the two of you. Real swords.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, awesome! You think of everything Elise.&quot;<br>&quot;Someone has to do the thinking. Go take a bath you two, you are stinking.&quot;<br>&quot;Sure thing, mom.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll meet you at my place for lunch, but you have to be presentable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Last to the river is a bladderfish!&quot;<br><br>The two of you take a bath and go back home wear your good clothes.<br><br>&quot;Where are you going boys?&quot;, ask you mother.<br>&quot;Lunch at Elise&#039;s place.&quot;<br>&quot;She is such a nice girl. The two of you will end up marrying.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t think so, mom. She is training to be a priestess. Priestesses don&#039;t marry.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, have fun.&quot;<br><br>You head to Elise&#039;s home. It is a large stone house, much bigger than yours our your friend&#039;s house. You knock on the door. A middle aged man finely dressed and with a comically large mustache opens the door.<br><br>&quot;What business do you have at the Mayor&#039;s house?&quot;<br>&quot;Elise invited us for lunch.&quot;<br>&quot;Ah! Very well. I heard she has important work for the two of you.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, she wants us to escort her to where she will become a priestess.&quot;<br>&quot;Do you think yourselves prepared for such a task?&quot;<br>&quot;Indeed. We train for such an opportunity everyday.&quot;<br>&quot;It is great to be so confident. Come, enter. I&#039;ll show you to the dining room.&quot;<br><br>(1/3)", "filename": "seth", "ext": ".png", "w": 1500, "h": 2160, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1665758118183318, "time": 1665758118, "md5": "OcU2WRo6KVFdmrQ3Sa0WGw==", "fsize": 1826420, "resto": 0, "id": "BdPsEFfK", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hellforged-quest-1", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 50, "images": 8, "omitted_posts": 45, "omitted_images": 7, "last_replies": [{"no": 5437136, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)10:39:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437135</a><br><br>&quot;I don&#039;t remember the exact circumstances, but I died in this place sometime in the past. This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

It used to feed our whole tribe. Now we just come here now and then. It is risky, there are bloodthirsty monsters inside the ruins.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, we met a few.&quot;<br>&quot;Now excuse me, I have to go back to my tribe.&quot;<br>&quot;Should we kill him?&quot;, asks the bard.<br>&quot;It is just a hungry goblin. Let&#039;s go.&quot;<br><br>When the two of you finally find the witch, she has a tiny shack going and four clay cauldrons boiling.<br><br>&quot;What is up with this setup, hot boy?&quot;, asks Lily.<br>&quot;We found out these woods grow a rare herb.

He already knew a little of alchemy because he is a shaman apprentice. I figured I could use his help.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you working with goblins?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>&quot;They&#039;re monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;Don&#039;t be a bigot. They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night. They are vulnerable to the sun.&quot;<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1666139465, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437509, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437500</a><br><br>&quot;Vulnerable to the sun, huh? Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me. I decided to help them as well.&quot;<br>&quot;They will just rob and rape people once their tribe is strong enough.&quot;<br>&quot;Rude!&quot;, says the goblin tending to the cauldrons.<br>&quot;Not all goblins are rapist and thieves. Most of them are too scared of their own shadow to try doing anything like this.&quot;<br>&quot;Could you spare us some poultice as well? We got some nasty dog bites but don&#039;t wanna waste the potion on it.&quot;<br>&quot;Sure, but you will have to wait until the batch is done.&quot;<br><br>A goblin shows up with a basket full of herbs.<br>&quot;Great, great, another batch!

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

Immediately after, this laydot would be connected with Arlet Adlan&#039;s oldest, and with that the magic from it would be reaped in full to swiftly form what Arlet Adlan desired for quite some time. Liavi Elod. True Undead. Unlike the Kos, these were more than mere husks. They were properly broken from the cycle. Living, but dead. They retained their mind, their memories and self despite being dead. And unlike the Kos, they weren&#039;t mere puppets to the one who rose them. While certainly unsuitable to utilize on enemy soldiers, the Ulodrac&#039;s soldiers and civilians alike most certainly could make do with it. Especially as breaking free of the cycle was something quite key to them. While they worshiped a goddess of death and their consort of life, the latter gave them the blessing to break the cycle of the two and persist after death, one of the greatest gifts that Kantoraci gave to them, while Sawu gifted the blessings the Vinarila had. Still, this would in time give another blessing to the Arlet Adlan. The ability to preserve the best of the best. No longer would old masters die and their lessons forgotten. No longer would well trained soldiers slain in battle become mere Kos unable to wield their weapons with any elegance. With this, Arlet Adlan would become ascendant despite the many, many set backs imposed upon it by the powers that encroached it on almost all sides.<br><br>Yet, more would come in time.

You made yourself food, all the lights and electronics off so you could save just a little more on bills.<br><br>You went to school, leaving early in the morning so you could arrive first and not get hounded by any of your fellow students along the main road. You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself. Then you heard screeching tires, a deep thunderous horn, and then a brief fraction of a second of agony.<br><br>The release of oblivion didn&#039;t come soon enough. You wondered if everyone got a chance to think after they died, maybe to reflect on their life or go over their regrets?

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession brought you into conflict against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church, with you coming out on top each bout. After having served the nobles of the Faerghus Kingdom for several years, you then found yourself in the direct employment of Claude von Riegan, leader of the Leicester Alliance.<br><br>Receiving a promising lead on the \u201cSeven Sages of Agartha\u201d, you and the Blackwings agreed to aid Elias, a mysterious mage that was able to understand the language written in Echeverria\u2019s book. In exchange for a full translation, Elias wished for you to venture through the infamous Edmund Woods, a location reputed as being haunted, and aid his master against an attack from the Orthodox Church. With great difficulty and almost zero visibility, you and your best mercenaries ventured through the terrifying forest, when you were ambushed by Dolofonos, an assassin eerily similar to Kronya. Having been separated from the group, you were forced to duel the assassin. You came out on top, but not before he had already killed Elias.<br><br>With the fog in the woods dissipating, you were able to locate the rest of the Blackwings, where you found them already in combat with the Orthodox Church\u2019s military.<br><br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Three+Hous<wbr>es<br>Blackwings Company Info/Supports List: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1ESxa3V-d3Mb27ZG97cbRoVMeD6HHEI<wbr>ySF9nJqqd48dc/edit?usp=sharing<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blair Weaver</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Level 34 Seraph Knight (50/100)</span><br>HP: 53 (90%)<br>STR: 28 (40%)<br>MAG: 23 (50%)<br>DEX: 24 (45%)<br>SPD: 37 (65%)<br>LCK: 21 (30%)<br>DEF: 23 (50%)<br>RES: 20 (40%)<br>CHARM: 18 (45%)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personal Skill:</span><br>Fiery Blood+ (+4 Damage and +3 Speed when HP is not at Max)<br>Transmute: Up to 5x during a battle, you can make a physical attack deal magic damage<br>+2 STR<br>+5 HP<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Offensive Skills:</span><br>Lancefaire: (+5 DMG when attacking w/ Lance)<br>Black Tomefaire (+5 DMG w/ magic)<br>Darting Blow (+6 SPD when attacking)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Defensive Skills</span><br>Rally Spectrum+ (+5 to ally\u2019s stats)<br>Swordbreaker (+20 Hit and Avoid when facing Sword users)<br>Alert Stance+ (+40 Avoid when not engaged)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proficiencies:</span><br>Lance: A<br>Authority/Tactics: A<br>Reason: A<br>Flying: A<br>Axe: D<br>Sword: D-<br>Heavy Armor: D<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spells:</span><br>Fire (E Rank, +3 DMG, 10 Uses)<br>Thunder (D Rank, +5 DMG, +10% Crit, 5 Uses)<br>Aircalibur (C Rank, +3 DMG, 3x DMG against flyers, 5 Uses)<br>Fimbulvetr (B Rank, +12 DMG, +10% Crit, Area of Effect, 3 Uses)<br>Bolting (A Rank, (12 Damage, 15% Crit, Long Range Siege Magic. 2 Uses, Range: 20)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inventory: Silver Lance+, Axereaver, Magic Staff, Blessed Lance, Elixir(x3)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gold: 5650g</span>", "filename": "Three Houses Quest (2)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1902, "h": 1066, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1664851324615767, "time": 1664851324, "md5": "cq5RcU8cjy0M8Bh0wbAMmg==", "fsize": 403973, "resto": 0, "id": "C6fpd0tl", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fire-emblem-three-houses-quest-12", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 481, "images": 74, "omitted_posts": 476, "omitted_images": 74, "last_replies": [{"no": 5469840, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)13:49:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;A): Blair will scout ahead (DEX x 2: Roll between 1-68 for Success.)

After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire. You were able to kill the strigoi, but it was hiding underground to conceal the fact it had bred an even rarer, deadlier type of vampire, a moroi. You were able to slay it, though Wiktoria was left exhausted.

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them. And after so much events the sweet lady Takable was spending the evening with you. <br><br>But let us begin, as per tradition, by a small prologue about events that take place in other parts of the strange world that you call India.<br><br>PROLOGUE :<br><br>In the darkest tunnels of the terrible fortress that we already visited one can see a quite pitiful group. They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise. A little twirling move lets you evade his partner, who you would hazard a guess is his sister. Both are fast by any ordinary person\u2019s standards, and you can tell each attack carries a pretty good amount of force behind it, so that\u2019s not their problem.
