For the last several months, I have been running this project with individual players controlling their own civilizations on a randomly-generated fantasy world of my design. The game is played out in a series of ages, in which players experience random events, are given the choice to perform a number of actions of their desire, and progress along technological and magical trees. Much like in a Civilization-style game, once each player has finished their actions for an age, all players advance to the next era and the cycle continues.<br><br>I have decided to allow you, the anonymous players of /qst/, in on the project, now that we are about ten ages into the world&#039;s history.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 41, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 36, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5470046, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)16:53:19", "name": "Queen of Darts", "com": "<a href=\"#p5469150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5469150</a><br>\u2026 honestly, <span class=\"mu-i\">you</span> can do it at this point.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely. That you are his unclaimed (and unknown) by-blow is only tangential. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you do deserve the honor of an audience with the viceroy?</span><br><br>1. Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system. Today, the trade network your built there is responsible for 12% of the Company&#039;s quarterly profits. <br>4.

Serving as the bridge between the natural world and the otherworldly realms, you slowly come to understand your placement as time goes on. With the essence of Shekhina and Tiamat residing within you, effectively serving as a balancer, you have the makings of true duality your additional role as arbiter balancer &amp; warrior emissary of Order &amp; Chaos. Known simply as the &quot;Galactic Angel of Retribution&quot;.<br><br>Although far from truly inheriting the title, you adjust to the responsibilities entrusted to you as you\u2019re thrust into the metahuman lifestyle.

Besides, if the Phantom Stranger told you everything, then it wouldn\u2019t be a test now, would it?\u201d Robin chirped up, being the more reassuring one of the two. \u201cAt least now I know that we need to get some silver or cold iron if we\u2019re dealing with a ghost and potentially a vampire.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cYou got me there.\u201d You laughed, slowly returning to your more upbeat self. \u201cBy the way, how exactly did you come up with your hero&#039;s name? I\u2019ve only added it for about a month, and so far, I don\u2019t have a lick of sense guiding me to a concrete cape name. I mean I got some ideas like Pantheona, but I figured someone doing it for years like yourself could give me better insight on the matter.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cWell, I\u2019m flattered. &quot;Robin smiled. Slowly cocking an eyebrow at you once the name registered in his head. His mind was already beginning to break down its meanings. \u201cPantheona?\u201d <br> <br>\u201cYeah, the first half obviously comes from Pantheon. As well as serve as a call back to my supposed predecessor.\u201d You point out with an aura of confidence. <br> <br>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d Robin asks. <br> <br>\u201cIt comes from the word Leona.\u201d You reply. <br> <br>\u201cAh, the derivative word from the Latin word Leo. I can only assume it&#039;s tied to a lion symbol correlating to you on a personal level. Quite possibly religious or family ties.\u201d Like that, Robin proves that his detective skills and general mental acuity are something you shouldn\u2019t take lightly. Whoever taught him has to be at least world-class given the level of skill he just displayed. And you feel like he has yet to get serious, much less go all out. <br> <br>\u201cCorrect, the Lion of Judah. Call it intuition, or inner voice, but I felt like imbuing myself with the blessed animal might help me better channel my festering emotions. Give me the strength to overcome any adversity or strife, while conquering the embodiment of my inner beast and not being a slave to the darker emotions inside me.\u201d You explained, trailing off a tad when it came to addressing the elephant in the room.

Part of me still feels bitter resentment for the man who took everything from me. It was only for a brief moment, but I felt immense rage welling up inside me. A vehement desire or passion that\u2019s deeply drenched with fury, almost threatening to swallow me whole despite its righteousness. At worst turning me into some sort of wraith embodying pure, unadulterated wrath. If those old people didn\u2019t show up when they did, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d <br><br>Before you could say anything further, Robin would put his hand against your shoulders. Giving you a serious but reassuring expression before continuing to speak. \u201cBelieve me when I say that I know exactly what you\u2019re going through. Even as an eight-year-old child I knew wholeheartedly what revenge could do to a person. I wrestled with such feelings like they were a pack of wild animals. I wanted to catch the guys who caused my parents\u2019 deaths, bring them to justice, or even just get the chance to make them pay for what they did. They had no right to take them away from me, and for what? Just to fatten their pockets and other acts of selfishness. I will never forgive them, nor forget them for as long as I\u2019m still living.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI had my mentor keeping me from going down the line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed. But I won\u2019t say that for the next seven years I didn\u2019t struggle with those inner demons. So again, I know exactly what you\u2019re going through right now. I won\u2019t tell you that you should give it up or look to forgive him. You, more than anyone needs closure, something that genuinely can be found in catching the man yourself. Just don\u2019t let yourself lose to it and become its slave.

But it was currently locked up in a secure box, becoming sturdier and sounder thanks to Robin\u2019s comforting words. \u201cThanks, I really appreciate it.\u201d You smile, opening up your eyes as if dread was no longer present. <br><br>\u201cAnyway, it sounds like you already got a pretty good name,\u201d Robin remarks, bringing the conversation back to being lighthearted. <br> <br>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s also a bit meatier than I\u2019d like. Like, imagine trying to say it in the heat of battle or a call for help. I thought originally since it\u2019s just the real world plus an extra letter it wouldn\u2019t be bad. But the more I thought about it, the more I ended up feeling not too keen on it. And I can\u2019t keep going by what the public calls me. The name Heavenly Goddess just doesn\u2019t sit right for me. It\u2019d be better for a moniker than anything. &quot;You sigh, shaking your head as you take another deep breath. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just overthinking it.\u201d You exclaim with another exaggerated sigh. <br><br>\u201cWell, I chose the name Robin in remembrance of my origins, especially towards my mother and father. To honor and respect them while serving as a reminder of what I\u2019m fighting for. \u201cRobin paused, letting him reminisce about the good and bad. Coming to an impasse for himself as he thinks over a much bigger issue that was oddly similar to you picking your name. Eventually, he turned his attention to the present, focusing on helping you as he puts such thoughts on the back burner. &quot;The fact you\u2019re putting so much thought into your name only shows how committed you are to this line of work. So, how about Plethora for short, and when you feel comfortable with it, you boast the full name for your hero identity.\u201d <br> <br>\u201cYeah, yeah that sounds like a plan.\u201d You smiled widely, almost giddy as you could start to envision your identity more clearly and consolidate it firmly. <br><br>Con", "time": 1668997301, "resto": 5458625, "id": "KI2TAcHu"}, {"no": 5470396, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:34:47", "name": "The artist formally known as Maruta", "com": "<a href=\"#p5470368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470368</a><br>This might end up bleeding into late night or tomorrow due to RL interferences.

Attaining a human form of your own, so you could stand as equal of those demonic beasts that came before and renounce the claim that your existences was wrong or the result of demonic cultivation. Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

A chance encounter with Princess Schala on your twentieth birthday has lead you both to an adventure through time, to a ruined future where most life has been drained from the planet. You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head. Slowly, your face began approaching hers as you gently guided hers towards you in turn. She did not resist. No, when she understood your intention, she leaned forward, her cheeks flushed with red and her mouth half-open in welcome. Your lips touched once again. You savoured that familiar flavour of salt and iron and something more that was uniquely her.<br><br>And then all thought evaporated from your mind as you lost yourself in the sensation of kissing her.", "filename": "Frozen Moment 3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1808, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1667660188814399, "time": 1667660188, "md5": "LZeRntFUDni5HNAV6D2cvQ==", "fsize": 1902920, "resto": 0, "id": "nU5qiqmN", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "chrono-trigger-frozen-moment-3", "trip": "!!YEc5FNwshuU", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 71, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 66, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 5467937, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)00:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go ahead on your own, you&#039;ll see her there</span><br>Gotta go fast.", "time": 1668837091, "resto": 5452883, "id": "daE+cAXg"}, {"no": 5467938, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)00:52:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5462124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5462124</a><br>My old post", "time": 1668837153, "resto": 5452883, "id": "daE+cAXg"}, {"no": 5467940, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)00:54:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Call out to her, walk together to the others.</span>", "time": 1668837281, "resto": 5452883, "id": "IwW+brIw"}, {"no": 5467952, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)01:09:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Call out to her, walk together to the others.</span>", "time": 1668838145, "resto": 5452883, "id": "33Awd3sZ"}, {"no": 5468003, "now": "11/19/22(Sat)02:55:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5467786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5467786</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Call out to her, walk together to the others.</span>", "time": 1668844553, "resto": 5452883, "id": "h+vpVECp"}], "last_modified": 1668844553}, {"no": 5452534, "now": "11/04/22(Fri)21:48:25", "name": "BananasQM", "sub": "Supreme Space Monke Ruler Quest 7", "com": "You love the flowers.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever.

Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror.

You plan to have the end with more wood face the window, while you weight the rest down with books and such and attempt to keep it in place with boxes. It&#039;s certainly not the most stable system you can think of, but, well, it&#039;s better than nothing. After securing the blanket you twist into the shape of the rope and then knot it to your spare blanket. Then you twist your spare blanket and tie it to your coat, which you twist and tie to several interconnected sweatshirts using each other for support. Now that rope itself is done.<br><br>Once the rope is done, you go over each knot, tugging slightly. Double checking, and then quickly triple-checking to make sure everything is in place. Given the sound of doors being thrown open and things occasionally being knocked over downstairs your time is certainly limited, but you need to make sure your rope won&#039;t just give out on you before anything else.<br><br>From there, you turn your attention to reinforcing your anchor. You quietly move over to the edge of the barricade and begin removing a few boxes from it- your books. A lot of people complain about print books being heavy and weighty nowadays, and talk about switching to a Kindle, but fuck you&#039;re glad you have them now. Your nightstand is essentially a piece of wood hollowed out to have a cabinet in it, and you&#039;ll need to fill that up if you&#039;re to have any hope of it staying in place.<br><br>You move the nightstand and books close to, but out of view of the window, and begin stuffing your metaphorical turkey. It is a monotonous but easy process, and you manage to finish it before too long. With that done, all you need to do is move the thing into place and shore it up with a few boxes around it. You will leave that for now you suppose.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave.

They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell.

He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher.

Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things.

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die. It was the same with Raen<br><br>Not out of compassion, but out of necessity.<br><br>But this time, <span class=\"mu-i\">you failed</span>.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHm?\u201d The knight takes a step back.<br><br>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no saving those who are that far gone.\u201d The shrouded shadow speaks with indifference.

Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 490, "images": 105, "omitted_posts": 485, "omitted_images": 104, "last_replies": [{"no": 5463361, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)16:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Just wait till we get to page 10.<br>Also I hope this doesn&#039;t go the wait of that One Piece isekai quest i reagrds with &quot;the will to write&quot;, we already suffered enough.", "time": 1668462541, "resto": 5436238, "id": "NAMydAt2"}, {"no": 5463772, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)01:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5463352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463352</a><br>Glad to see you haven\u2019t retired to your attack pod just yet.<br>It\u2019s fine to keep using this thread until page 9/10 if you want, there\u2019s plenty of time left before it falls off of the board.", "time": 1668494631, "resto": 5436238, "id": "XnFhydEA"}, {"no": 5464248, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)14:38:18", "name": "KingQM", "com": "I&#039;ll wait til page 10 then, probably not that far away.<br><br>!!! BLOGPOST WARNING !!! <br><br><a href=\"#p5463361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5463361</a><br>Will to write is a tough bippy to handle when you&#039;re QMing. It&#039;s that moment where you&#039;re writing almost on standby mode and you start seeing everything you&#039;re writing down as complete trash that isn&#039;t entertaining even though it&#039;s likely the contrary. <br><br>For example: I started to feel these pirates are boring as fuck as I wrote them and I should&#039;ve done something more interesting cuz the players won&#039;t like it, yet I can see that there is a clear interest from the players just from the raw effort put into the write-ins (thanks boys btw) and I know that I have more stuff prepared for them that makes them a thing beyond being a run of the mill pirate gang to beat around and to give a reason for Vegeta to increase his PL.<br><br>I find that the best solution for these moments is to just pause for a while and focus on other stuff so you can eventually look at this shit with a broader mindset rather than focusing on the negatives. I should&#039;ve done that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 too but life got in the way and I said fuck it, gotta forget about this and focus on other stuff. Now that I&#039;m in a much more stable moment of my life I&#039;m finding it way easier to write and dedicate a proper amount of time to making a cool story about Vegeta along with anons in the internet.<br><br><br>I&#039;ll eventually make some google doc polls to see what anons are enjoying about the quest and where they wanna go from here. After years of playing tabletop with friends I&#039;ve seen that it&#039;s a very cool thing to do and can provide some measure of direction as to what to focus on and what to leave as secondary stuff. Generally I tried to gauge this interest through the quest itself, like the posts asking who do you wanna focus on during downtime, whether or not you wanna have a cool tournament VS the earthlings, etc. <br><br>Example: I&#039;ve noticed that most votes are driving the romantic stuff into the background (then again I enjoy writing Bulma and relationships in general so I do add a lot of that in without player input asking for it), thus I&#039;ve decided to make Vegeta behave in a way that shows his complete focus in his objectives and how he has no will to handle a relationship right now. I&#039;ve also noticed that there&#039;s a certain interest in Rasha and Olond beyond them being mere soldiers in the new Saiyan army, so I developed them a little more behind the scenes. <br><br>To put it in a poetic way I see QMing as a ship sailing the seas, the QM&#039;s the captain, your notes are your destination and the players are the wind, you gotta make sure the ship is sailing along with the wind even if that sometimes makes you drift away from the destination (or get a new destination entirely) but you also have to keep focus and always have a destination in mind as you make a path through the waves otherwise you&#039;re gonna wonder why you&#039;re even putting in the effort.<br><br>This is years of QMing and TTRPG speaking.<br><br>!!!

Perhaps some Filorva might have experienced similar, if they had got their filing-forms too close to new-built fires of too-great intensity during their initial trials?

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone. Opening the gate is a challenge. Just as Ruka probes the finer workings of the lock, she gets a surprise.<br> <br>Minako and Artemis sneak up on her. Ruka isn&#039;t sure just what Minako is up to but the girl offers to partner to get inside the supernaturally expanded obstacle park....<br><br>Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/CrescentADV<br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Crescent%2<wbr>0Adventures<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrescentDreamA1<wbr>", "filename": "Crescent Adventure", "ext": ".png", "w": 1067, "h": 823, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1665815406021982, "time": 1665815406, "md5": "2SOl3zEmrPxW4VRYQRecxw==", "fsize": 154805, "resto": 0, "id": "gnb3HIGX", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "crescent-adventure-14", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 133, "images": 31, "omitted_posts": 128, "omitted_images": 31, "last_replies": [{"no": 5456915, "now": "11/08/22(Tue)23:02:07", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456708</a><br>I&#039;ll try to post tomorrow.", "time": 1667966527, "resto": 5434284, "id": "gnb3HIGX"}, {"no": 5458166, "now": "11/10/22(Thu)00:02:37", "name": "Crescent", "com": "<a href=\"#p5456915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5456915</a><br>I arrived at my parents place.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently.

And I love being with you.\u201d She kisses your forehead gently. \u201cYou\u2019re my Peppa.\u201d<br><br>Your heart feels all aflutter. \u201c\u2026I love you too Cocoa.\u201d You sit up and hold her close as you kiss her back, on the lips this time. \u201cMy Cocoa.\u201d<br><br>The ride sadly comes to an end, but you\u2019ve got a smile on your face that hasn\u2019t faded yet. \u201cStill up for a look into the fortune teller?\u201d Cocoa asks you.<br><br>\u201cReady if you are.\u201d<br><br>The two of you reach the fortune teller\u2026 and get a bit of a surprise. Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa. And\u2026 dang it she looks taller too. \u201cI can see that you will follow your passion, and you will excel in it.\u201d<br><br>Her face lights up with excitement. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhile I insist my fortunes are accurate, it is up to you to make what you see a reality.\u201d Baba answers. \u201cAnd now\u2026\u201d The image in the crystal ball changes. There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins.

I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection.

Immediately after, this laydot would be connected with Arlet Adlan&#039;s oldest, and with that the magic from it would be reaped in full to swiftly form what Arlet Adlan desired for quite some time. Liavi Elod. True Undead. Unlike the Kos, these were more than mere husks. They were properly broken from the cycle. Living, but dead. They retained their mind, their memories and self despite being dead. And unlike the Kos, they weren&#039;t mere puppets to the one who rose them. While certainly unsuitable to utilize on enemy soldiers, the Ulodrac&#039;s soldiers and civilians alike most certainly could make do with it. Especially as breaking free of the cycle was something quite key to them. While they worshiped a goddess of death and their consort of life, the latter gave them the blessing to break the cycle of the two and persist after death, one of the greatest gifts that Kantoraci gave to them, while Sawu gifted the blessings the Vinarila had. Still, this would in time give another blessing to the Arlet Adlan. The ability to preserve the best of the best. No longer would old masters die and their lessons forgotten. No longer would well trained soldiers slain in battle become mere Kos unable to wield their weapons with any elegance. With this, Arlet Adlan would become ascendant despite the many, many set backs imposed upon it by the powers that encroached it on almost all sides.<br><br>Yet, more would come in time. The Vinarila population, while small, still grew with the growing population of the Ulodrac. And the most prominent among them would not accept the lack of lands and titles available to them. Soon, they would make their own one way or another...Soon...In the meantime however, a breakthrough would be made that would in time dramatically improve the supply of Ulodrac resources.

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days. Three younger brothers and a younger sister. All horribly spoiled and unprepared for the perils and dangers of the real world. Much like Leon himself. <br><br>This was supposed to be an era of peace. Leon himself had been trained in politics, negotiation, and statecraft.

The victory was rather hard-won, as you were forced to curse Snikt with the same curse as you to stop her from aging into dust, using the scroll Anna was intending to use, along with forcing Paracelsus to overdo it on the magic to keep her alive long enough.<br>The Grey Dragon, the Grey Knight that went ahead, was cursed like you, and then got obscene amounts of magic pumped into her, managed to fly you up along with Chad and William after Ogg started teleporting her way up the mountain. You had fought past her retinue already, and finally, you found her, already dying from the many wounds you inflicted upon her. You decapitated her, and were then stopped by a dragon.<br>Not just A dragon, but something more akin to The dragon.

I had expected you to ask me to end your curse.\u201d<br>It leans in closer, still, and then it speaks as quietly as a creature of that size can manage.

For a moment, you think she\u2019s had enough, but when she looks down at your dropped pistol, you give her a prod, the jolt causing her head to jerk up before slumping down.<br><br>\u201cGuess I should\u2019ve taken that bet, huh?\u201d<br><br>You turn off your shock maul with a wince and holster it, bending down to pick up your autopistol to do the same.

You\u2019ve been pretty squeamish about certain things these past few days, but a little foreign object lodged into your skin and muscle tissue isn\u2019t anything too concerning. Even as you feel your tendons flex against it when you move your arm, you\u2019re proud to say you\u2019ve grown out of wound-nausea before your baby teeth fell out. You leave it in, knowing that removing stuck blades from stab-wounds is a good way to pass out from blood loss.<br><br>\u201cShould be fine until we get to the HOJ clinic\u2026 Maybe there\u2019s a medicae somewhere closer, though.\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cYou want me to cuff her?\u201d</span><br><br>Groves points at the woman, who seems to be stirring.<br><br>You nod gratefully.

After confronting a gang of lesser vampires on the hunt for prey in the railroad town of Farson, you were directed to the backwater mining town of Almy, which you found a practical ghost town. After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire. You were able to kill the strigoi, but it was hiding underground to conceal the fact it had bred an even rarer, deadlier type of vampire, a moroi. You were able to slay it, though Wiktoria was left exhausted.

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them. And after so much events the sweet lady Takable was spending the evening with you. <br><br>But let us begin, as per tradition, by a small prologue about events that take place in other parts of the strange world that you call India.<br><br>PROLOGUE :<br><br>In the darkest tunnels of the terrible fortress that we already visited one can see a quite pitiful group. They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.

Two years from now in 1301 the brave frenchman will be named as the Pope&#039;s Legate and charged to bring peace to the good city of Florence where quarrels between black Guelphs (brave landowners of good families that supported the Holy See) and white Guelphs (trad*smen, burg*ers and other vile opportunists who supported the Holy See but feared that it would have too much power on their Rep*blic and wanted to even ally with the accursed Ghibellines) were disturbing the peace. <br>Before Valois entered the city with his army the sympathetic Corso Donati (leader of the Black Guelph party) explained him the situation and with good arguments about the necessity to protect our just and good feudal order against impious burghers and a small gift of 70 000 florins, convinced him to do nothing while Donati&#039;s men would take power by force and exile or kill all the white guelphs and ghibellines of the city. Good times. <br>But even in this situation Valois remained a true knight and since he had promised to keep the peace he put under his protection all the white guelphs leaders, in his home, while their supporters were killed in the streets. <br>Unfortunately Dante, who was sent to negotiate with the pope while his legate was in Florence learned about his exile at this moment and instead of praising the chivalry of the Count of Valois for his white Guelph friends and return there to be judged for felony and corruption, choose to flee. He would after this write so much evil words about the Capetian and Valois dynasties in his divine comedy that such a lover of Italy like Fran\u00e7ois Ier, who brought us Renaissance and Leonardo da Vinci, hearing what the poet wrote while the book was read to him (Hugues Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty, says there that he is the son of a parisian butcher), told the reader to stop since &quot;it was an evil book and we do not want to hear anymore of it&quot;.", "filename": "Severe Charles de Valois", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669022114612714, "time": 1669022114, "md5": "iYBXDFVVLgWd10Ob6DYSmA==", "fsize": 23090, "resto": 5422744, "id": "G4a+iYXH"}, {"no": 5470763, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)04:16:41", "name": "Local Lord", "com": "<a href=\"#p5470762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5470762</a><br><br>Then after this first autistic rant I will start a second one about silk. I really did not knew about this rule, I am unfortunately hardly a specialist in Islamic Law. Thank you for telling me about this. But it seemed strange to me since in Christian chronicles about the crusades or the reconquista they often tell that the Moors or Saracens are dressed in robes of fine silks and very well dyed fabrics. That impressed the Christians. I had to do some research (unfortunately not in a library but on the internet) and found this https://islamqa.info/en/answers/203<wbr>7/is-silk-haram-for-men and this haddith seems to confirm it &quot;Abdur Rahman bin &#039;Auf and Az-Zubair complained to the Prophet, i.e. about the lice (that caused itching) so he allowed them to wear silken clothes. I saw them wearing such clothes in a holy battle. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 170)&quot;. Since our guys are going to the battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar (and would probably have been killed by Mongols if they weren&#039;t transported to Bifuria) we can imagine that it is the military clothes of the Emir (I do not know if they are allowed to wear it while on campaign or only in battle, if not then we may tell that Charles is, as seen in this quest, an unreliable narrator.)<br><br>Whatever you made me learn something and do research and since Mudcore consists of a lot of autistic discussions about &quot;historical accuracy&quot; I have to give you something in thanks.

You saw some farmsteads where goat and sheep herders lived in the distance but according to the explanations of Oldfossil the centaur lived in the last one, that was still a more than a parisian lieue from here, it was the extreme limit of your jurisdiction, to the east and the north of him there were only lands owned by noone and populated by a small number of exiles and bandits. There cairns continued though but all of them had been plundered by adventurers a long time ago. A sad region indeed.

One of them has called you out to a complicated and dangerous situation in the Land of Rivers where a village seems to have suffered an outbreak of curse marks. Which on the face of it is ridiculous of course, being something that\u2019s never previously been communicable - a curse mark is a ninjutsu technique, not a disease that can spread or self-replicate.<br><br>Recognizing that naturally drew your curiosity and concern, since if it isn\u2019t truly a \u201ccurse mark\u201d that your son Shiki has been dealing with it begs the question \u201cwell what is it then\u201d - and that\u2019s a question that needs answering.<br><br>That\u2019s why you brought in Orochimaru-han, who also happens to be familiar with Jugo, a man related to the research which led to the curse marks applied to Sasuke-kun, Tayuya-kun, and others. Jugo also happens to be the reason Shiki and two teams from Konoha were sent to this village in the first place. While it made sense at the time to bring the infamous Sannin he\u2019s simply disappeared on you, leaving behind a small white snake which is now wrapped around your left wrist.<br><br>Now you have to chase down Orochimaru, who\u2019s only here because you brought him, to make sure he doesn\u2019t cause any problems.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d a voice wonders from out of the forest. You had sensed someone there but hadn\u2019t assigned any importance to it, until you catch a flash of green hair and grey skin. Stopping short means the attacker misses you, his massive right fist taking out the trunk of a nearby tree. \u201cA stray? What a nice opportunity to get in a little exercise!\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I had a good meal!\u201d a female voice joins in, and you dodge a straight, linear attack from a young woman with green hair and green skin. But instead of an oversized arm she has an almost shark-like head and backwards-raked horns at the crown of her skull. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help myself!\u201d<br><br>Well, at least they\u2019re both confident. You\u2019ll just have to see how well that works for them.<br><br>The first of the two swings his massive fist at you again, which you easily avoid with a simple application of trained footwork, fast, floating, and precise. A little twirling move lets you evade his partner, who you would hazard a guess is his sister. Both are fast by any ordinary person\u2019s standards, and you can tell each attack carries a pretty good amount of force behind it, so that\u2019s not their problem.
