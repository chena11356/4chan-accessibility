Still, a lovely instructor is speaking.<br><br><span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The inner cell mass undergoes changes to form three germ layers known as the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm,&quot;</span> Meryl declares, looking very professional and elegant. She&#039;s always so casual, so this is a nice look on her. She&#039;s got a long skirt on, a shirt-vest combo, and is also wearing high heels, something she rarely does outside of dresses. Last time she put some on she was complaining all night about her ankles- and leaning on you, which made it all even. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;The ectoderm becomes the skin and nervous system, the mesoderm becomes the muscles and other internal organs, and the endoderm becomes the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</span><br><br>Just like in university proper, you&#039;re taking notes, though you can&#039;t seem to read what you&#039;re writing. You listen carefully, but it all bleeds together, like some sort of fast-forwarded movie. Still, your serenity remains with you. Just looking at the aqua-eyed beauty is enough to keep you happy.<br><br>---<br><br>Meryl proposed to you only recently- Which would have been odd enough, as far as you were concerned, until she explained why: It was now or never, at least until you showed up.<br><br>She&#039;s got demi-human physiology, some kind of fish-woman, and her father is a magician. Yeah, unbelievable... but also true. She proved it, by swimming with you in the deep blue sea. Normally, Meryl appears completely normal (if extremely hot), a tall redhead bombshell with sea-green eyes. In secret, or in the deep ocean, her true visage includes claws, gills, and piscine eyes that could pass as gemstones. She still keeps her very nice human legs and curves, so there&#039;s no real loss.<br><br>Her mother, another human-Dagonian hybrid, intruded on your romantic week. Superficially, she&#039;s just a crazy lady perpetuating albino stereotypes. In reality, she&#039;s an almost alien woman who was somehow seduced by Meryl&#039;s insane marine biology professor wizard(?!?) father and was going to kill you if you turned Meryl down. Meryl, of course, was not interested in her parents&#039; shenanigans.<br><br>Meryl was expected to help connect humanity and her people, so they could be absorbed into human society safely. That would have normally meant a ritual followed by marrying you, but it seemed as though fate helped that along.

It&#039;s... There&#039;s something that makes you slow down. Some of these photos have been hanging here for longer than you&#039;ve been alive. A few are even older than your parents. The weight of ages threatens to crush you, but you move up the stairs, remembering that every individual along the way must have seen their life the same way you saw yours- just your own. Daryl has embraced your heritage in the traditional sense, but you&#039;ve done so in a different way. The Woodsmen will carry on with or without their Virginia residence- after all, there had to be other brothers in the past.<br><br>There&#039;s something else odd about some of the photos that strikes you. Looking at several, you try and put your finger on what it is. Trees are often in the background, but they&#039;ve never been anything but a comfort to you- the clan has a habit of reforesting. Taking a look at the oldest one there, you can&#039;t see anything other but a familiar-looking ancestor and the men who work beside him, alongside their tools and some felled logs, which are stacked as benches for the photo. But... There&#039;s an anxiety, something just outside the cropped image. You put the image of the loggers and Hans Woodsman away. You can make memories and photos of your own, with the woman you&#039;re neglecting to wake up.<br><br>Opening the door, you&#039;re reminded that this room used to be painted in accordance to a childhood love of the Grimm fairy tales. Now all of those have a modern housing sheen covering up the images beneath. But your Red Riding Hood is fast asleep. Well, she isn&#039;t really little, and she&#039;s not wearing a hood, and she&#039;s the one sleeping... and this metaphor is useless. You walk over in the dark, only the light bleeding through the blinds guiding you, and gently whisper to her. Meryl keeps snoring, and drooling a little bit. So you nudge her gently, and she still doesn&#039;t move. You try to work on slowly increasing the intensity, but what happens instead is her snoring louder. Is she playing at being asleep? Well, she can save that for when you&#039;re in Maine.<br><br>Pinching the bridge of her nose to cut off her snoring, she opens her eyes immediately, proving she was playing at it. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Awex.&quot;</span> <span class=\"mu-g\">Yes, beloved?</span> <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;Whe?&quot;</span> <span class=\"mu-g\">Food.</span> She groggily pulls your hand from her face and brings herself to sitting. <span class=\"mu-b\">&quot;You could have just said that, you know.&quot;</span> She&#039;s wearing the bra she was wearing when you got in, and it does a nice job of showing off her cleavage.

She wasn&#039;t here when Meryl was visiting during Christmas. She stayed with Grandpa at the cabin you&#039;re going to make your home... coming back to complain about how awful the whole experience was, without life&#039;s finer luxuries.

Mom lets it go because Alice provoked the exchange. It&#039;s funny at first, but then you realize that the joke is going to seem in awful taste when you have to tell Mom about Meryl&#039;s heritage. Alice narrows her eyes.<br><br>Thankfully, in the presence of Mom, the barb-trading is left to a minimum. Once she&#039;s gotten enough pancakes and eggs in her, Alice heads upstairs, where she&#039;s sure to spend an hour or so prepping her makeup so she can go to the mall and strut about. With a small posse of other girls her age and a few boys dumb or horny enough to circle them, she should be fine. She&#039;s &#039;the unattainable one&#039; in her clique, and acted as a consigliere for the local prom queen until they graduated.<br><br>The important part is that you don&#039;t need to see your trouble sibling for a bit. And Mom is here, preparing to griddle up more pancakes for Meryl, who is trying to come up with excuses to refuse. You rescue her from Death by Flapjacks by breaking the question of Meryl&#039;s heritage. Mom, you know when Meryl mentioned she had an albino mother?<br><br>Putting aside the homemade dry mix she uses for pancake batter, Mom gets serious and sits down. &quot;Yes.

Resources deposits discovered in unclaimed territory sparked border conflicts which escalated into the Satellite war. But just because the world ended didn\u2019t mean the war did.

This is one of the times in the last few months when you\u2019ve been sent on a mission without your two trusted teammates, Nagao Sumire and Izuno Wasabi - a mission to capture your former classmate, distant cousin, and son of the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Boruto.<br><br>He\u2019s crossed the border with the neighboring Land of Wind without permission in search of Uchiha Sasuke, hoping to study ninjutsu under his guidance. Your job is to stop him. It\u2019s entirely possible that being caught here could turn into an international incident, stirring up the opposition faction in the Land of Wind and causing a headache for the Kazekage, Gaara. So you\u2019ve decided to face down Boruto in order to wear him down before the next fight. So far that\u2019s worked well for you, as you managed to momentarily take the upper hand.<br><br>Boruto\u2019s next move is to loose a kunai he had hidden in his sleeve, which is aimed at your face - what he thinks happens as a result is that you break away and stop setting up your technique, but what he doesn\u2019t realize is that the genjutsu is already in place. He follows through and connects with your shadow clone\u2019s jaw using the hand your withdrawal freed up, which is fine. He served his purpose.<br><br>You\u2019re already weaving seals of your own now - what Boruto sees is the seals for Kakashi-sensei\u2019s Raiden, but what you actually use is the water clone technique, weaving the seals with your left hand and creating the clone from a ball of water flowing from your right hand.<br><br>\u201cRaiton: Raiden!\u201d<br><br>Boruto ducks and rolls away from a fake bolt of violet-colored lightning, creating a pair of shadow clones that cover for him by throwing explosive-tagged kunai. Your kunai, unsealed from your palm in response, meet with Boruto\u2019s and cause them to explode at a distance - and you have time to create two shadow clones of your own. \u201cMulti-shadow clone!\u201d<br><br>He can\u2019t see what you did. Your genjutsu prevents that entirely. But what he hears confirms that you\u2019ve created multiple shadow clones, so he doesn\u2019t question the three clones he sees coming at him. Nor does he see anything in the environment, like standing water or rainfall, that would hint that the clones are anything but what he thinks he sees.<br><br>The shadow clones trade, dispelling each other in a brief scuffle, and you swiftly follow behind the water clone weaving hand seals the whole way. When the clone takes Boruto\u2019s counterpunch in the chin there\u2019s a moment of shock on your cousin\u2019s face as he realizes that what he struck wasn\u2019t a shadow clone at all, and you place your palm against the clone\u2019s back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "ame_openingII", "ext": ".png", "w": 1061, "h": 705, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668484186677213, "time": 1668484186, "md5": "UE9sq66q3fKH8qwOPafYNA==", "fsize": 1153834, "resto": 0, "id": "yd1zDu14", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "shinobi-sidestory-quest-44", "trip": "!!mceqYMwptbm", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 84, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 79, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 5477699, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)00:31:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5477659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477659</a><br><a href=\"#p5477671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477671</a><br>I&#039;ll support it", "time": 1669527079, "resto": 5463640, "id": "LHU/KJPd"}, {"no": 5477729, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)01:32:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5477659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477659</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Pitch the kettle to your other clone, make a show of trying to hold the enemy off.</span>", "time": 1669530778, "resto": 5463640, "id": "04gS/ilr"}, {"no": 5477800, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)03:45:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5477659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477659</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pitch the kettle to your other clone, make a show of trying to hold the enemy off.</span>", "time": 1669538727, "resto": 5463640, "id": "Q6wRUTZU"}, {"no": 5477803, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)03:50:28", "name": "Abominable Intelligence", "com": "<a href=\"#p5477671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477671</a><br><a href=\"#p5477659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477659</a><br>Lets try it, supporting.", "time": 1669539028, "resto": 5463640, "id": "y/xNGhTG"}, {"no": 5478003, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)11:29:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5477671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477671</a><br><a href=\"#p5477659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5477659</a><br>This", "time": 1669566569, "resto": 5463640, "id": "rpMCBJIC"}], "last_modified": 1669566569}, {"no": 5462082, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)09:56:58", "name": "Schizo QM", "sub": "Future Blades - A Cyberpunk Story", "com": "During the end of 21st century, technological advancements has allowed for extensive modifications to the human body, becoming a cornerstone of medicine, warfare, and countless aspects of modern life.<br><br>The linchpin of biological augmentation is a substance called <span class=\"mu-s\">Nectar</span>, which helps chemical compounds to mesh with the body.

In the six years since you&#039;ve arrived, you have heard as many conflicting rumors about your own superior as you have about the exotic Porusians and their Emperor. Some claim Sir Weald is a genius of the old school, a spiritual descendant of the larger-than-life figures of the First Expansion. Not undeserved this title, given his ascension from mere Company clerk to the rank of viceroy virtually unassisted. Yet, from other corners, there are whispers of secret handshake agreements, money taken under the table, even the trade of thralls. His reclusive nature, alien habits, and predilection for Porusian art (among other things) has only deepened the mystery. <br><br>Among the other officers of the Company, you can count on one hand the number who have actually seen his face. There are even those who believe he does not exist, that he is merely a name in a register, a bureaucratic ghost. Yet, it is that same ghost who has summoned you today to appear before him. <br><br>You are not surprised. It was only a matter of time. Arthur Weald has been your role model since even before you joined the Company, since you were only 10 years old and read an account of his life in the Company newsletter and decided in that moment that you would follow in his footsteps--no, surpass his legacy entirely. That you are his unclaimed (and unknown) by-blow is only tangential. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you do deserve the honor of an audience with the viceroy?</span><br><br>1. Connections: Over the course of the last six years you&#039;ve ingratiated yourself to some of the most powerful men in the Territories. Admiral Basel himself knows your name.<br>2. Tactics: You proved yourself again and again in battles against pirates, Porusian rebels and even Catar Company fleets. <br>3. Mercantilism: Six years ago they gave you a small fleet of freighters and set you loose on the Yaugent system. Today, the trade network your built there is responsible for 12% of the Company&#039;s quarterly profits. <br>4.

What a horrible thing to say!&quot; You sigh. &quot;Well, I suppose you&#039;re right. The reports about him at least suggest he&#039;s possessed of reason, motivated by self-interest like the rest of us, and in some ways even generous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;To his men.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And to the poor. I daresay the Princess underestimates the extent to which the underclass are supported and secured by his influence.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, the pirate with a heart of gold. Yet I still can&#039;t help but wonder how the Princess will feel about all this, once she finds out.&quot;<br><br>Before you can respond, there&#039;s a knock at the door, followed by someone entering the room and kneeling before your divan.

Mr. Mittens also insisted on coming with you, &quot;for your protection&quot; (though you think he&#039;s just curious about Gammon, as the Princess), and is on his usual spot on your shoulder, licking his black paws. &quot;Shall I stay behind?&quot; he whispers in your ear, as you board the pirate ship. The suggestion is tempting but quickly proves to be impossible the moment you enter Gammon&#039;s office. He has a dog, a great black-furred beast with pale, reflective eyes that mirror the reflective round lenses of his master. It&#039;s lying on a large cushion when you enter, but perks its head up upon sighting (or smelling) Mr. Mittens, who hisses in response. Mr. Mittens has never liked dogs.<br><br>The office itself is surprisingly modern, as if it was ripped from the pages of a Tritonian furniture catalogue. The only oddities are the two artificial candles on the desk, real flames burning a secret scented oil, and the worn-down harmonica which Gammon wears around his neck. <br><br>&quot;James Chapham,&quot; says Gammon, completely ignoring the Princess. Gammon&#039;s thick accent is neither Porusian nor Tritonian, but something akin to Catari. &quot;Your reputation precedes you--and by this I mean I do not know anything at all about you. You are a very dangerous man, I think. Or you are completely harmless. I have not decided. Come in. Sit. You too Princess. Lebkuchen?&quot; He offers each of you a small flat cookie in the shape of a little man. When you refuse, he snaps off its legs and tosses them to his dog, who licks them up noisily. The Princess is stiff as a board beside you. You were sure the disguise was foolproof.<br><br>&quot;I believe my position requires me to be heard but not seen,&quot; you say, pulling a chair out for the Princess and standing behind her, now that the jig is up. &quot;Discretion is the better part of valor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then you are not completely harmless,&quot; he says.<br><br>&quot;Heaven forbid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have looked at your proposal.

It&#039;s strange. She&#039;s removed her veil, yet her unnatural beauty, which has had an effect on everyone who has interacted with her thus far (even yourself), irrespective of background, predilection, or even gender, seems to have no effect at all on Gammon. He barely even registers her, and speaks only to you, as though she were merely an appendage of yourself.<br><br>&quot;What would you do James Chapham, if you were me?

Then he brings the harmonica to his lips and plays a short riff. &quot;You are afraid. That is why.&quot;<br><br>Your hand, still on the Princess&#039;s shoulder, must give it another gentle squeeze to prevent another outburst. She clenches her fists.

Gammon is not motivated by self-interest, at least not alone, he has invested in an ideal. Such resolutions are to the death, and you fear, this time, it would not be his own. For once, your luck fails you. You have no response to Gammon&#039;s ultimatum. <br><br>But the Princess does. <br><br>&quot;Then take one of the warships for your own,&quot; she says.<br><br>This finally forces Gammon to turn his attention to her. He stares at her so long that you can feel her start to grow uncomfortable-- despite no doubt having grown used to such stares--though, in this one, there is no trace of the usual infatuation. In the end, however, he turns back to you. &quot;This is your opinion also?&quot;<br><br>But the Princess will not let you steal her thunder. &quot;He is merely an advisor. I, am a Princess.

Performing such an affront against the heavens, gods, and laws that hated you would be wholly irresistible to not do so immediately. However several unaccounted for circumstances, besides the fact Long Tiantunri dared to live in your world, prevented you from undertaking this vital test.<br><br>One, was that your loyal student in medicine and assistant in doctoring, Yuyi and Yongzheng were still in the palace, and the latter was determined to, despite his station as a zealous Buddhist monk, to take part in the exectution of the worthless monarch. Another was that there were many questions your natural feline curiosity demanded to be answered. Like, why did the former emperor&#039;s departed soul speak on your behalf, why was there a cult attacking the second imperial palace the same night as the three dian brother&#039;s attempted to take the emperor&#039;s fat head, aided of course by well crafted pills and spirit medicines made by your magnificent self.<br><br>But the most present obstacle preventing you from undergoing the tribulation of transformation, was the Ling Ogress herself!

You fought robots, kissed the girl - more than once - and met Chrono, Marle and Lucca, three fellow time travelers from a green and peaceful era long after your own. You learned that Schala was fated to die and your Kingdom destroyed in the same incident, an incident that nevertheless seems unrelated to the almost-dead world you found yourselves in. You were on your way to watch a &#039;video&#039; of Lavos, your God of Magic, supposedly bringing the world to an end, when you agreed to help the inhabitants of Arris Dome, the last survivors of mankind, with their various problems, the party split and you went with Schala who asked for your help to Enchant an item that would help these people grow their crops inside the Dome.<br><br>And so you found yourself alone with her in a locked room that no one else could enter. You were sitting side-by-side on the floor, holding her close with your arm around her shoulder. She proudly held in her hands the golden disk that she had just finished infusing with an emotion, the first step of enchanting an object. The emotion she had chosen was joy and in her own words the effect would be &#039;as strong as it can be&#039; because of your help. A help that consisted of... simply sitting next to her and holding her. Because you made her happy.<br><br>She had just asked if you wanted to stay for a while and talk about Enchanting now that she no longer needed your help. She was impossibly beautiful, looking at you with a tender expression that made your heart melt. You had already decided to answer her request in the only way that you could, but first... wordlessly, you turned your torso to better face her and put your other on the side of her head.

Mokh married his sister, Tary, and had a bunch of babies, all of them gods. These gods had the power of the elder gods because they were from a pure blood divine dynasty. But Mokh couldn&#039;t keep it in his pants and started haveing demigods all over the place. Many races, magical races, are descendants of a single Mokh offspring, and some sages collectively defined the magical races as Children of Mokh. Some other gods had their own magical offspring, but none as many as Mokh himself. His descendants are all manners of fairies and forest spirits, the elves, the fauns, the satyrs, the dryads, the nymphs and many more. Some of Mokh&#039;s children had more bestial tastes and became fathers of races like minotaurs, centaurs and dragons. The legend says all dragons are children of a salamander a god thought was good looking and fucked. The salamander was already a half god because some other god had fucked its parents. So the dragons became three quarters gods or something like that. The gods themselves have very weird appearances, and when they create halfgods the resulting being is equally unsettling. Their weird traits are them passed down the generations. The half half gods are usually more normal looking than the half gods, and the ones who are a quarter gods or even less look like anyone else, except everyone of their race finds there is something odd about them. Some of them have very unique powers, but not all of them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what is Phyrax goddess of?&quot;", "time": 1668025581, "resto": 5450791, "id": "BNEmL1fM", "trip": "!!QwBTV801Tcj"}, {"no": 5457687, "now": "11/09/22(Wed)15:27:23", "name": "Fireborn QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5457685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5457685</a><br><br><br>&quot;Dude, the gods can do anything, that is why they are gods.

She had a bunch of sons and daughters called collectively as the Phyraxians, they built a society powered by magic but one day their magic stopped working and their society collapsed. Pretty sad stuff. They have been wandering around the world and passing on over the generations artifacts of a bygone era. Most of them are magicians, because they have the blood of the gods.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what happened to the gods themselves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One day they got together and agreed not to walk the world of mortals anymore. Even to send an avatar, they must have over half the gods agree to it.

Even his charming half-breed knight was said to have such charm as to have courted a princess of House Yvonlace.<br><br>Rumour had it that he had conquered the greedy dwarves and stopped their damnable downward digging, humbling them and making them slaves of a new kobold kingdom in the Bloodrise mountain range.<br><br>They said that he was the heir of the Dragon Kings of old\u2014mighty tyrants who once ruled the earth in a time before even elven records.<br><br>They said that he served the Gods of Evil, and that those who joined him in their worship would be permitted to march in his dark legions, to retake the surface-world and slaughter the traitor-elves.<br><br>Some\u2014the impoverished and lowborn, the impatient and glory-hungry young warriors\u2014spoke of him with undisguised awe.<br>Some\u2014the nobles of Wevenore, the highborn mages, and especially those up-and-coming Princes Ascendant who saw his connections to House Yvonlace and the exiting Queen Myrymma as a threat\u2014regarded him with less enthusiasm.<br><br>When he emerged from the funerary caves at the head of a triumphant procession, holding aloft the head of the slain Ghoul Supreme and proclaiming the caverns below purged of ghouls and lost souls alike by grace of the God of Death, none could deny that his visitation was IMPORTANT.<br><br>Whether that was for good or for ill\u2026 Well, that remained to be seen.", "filename": "titlecard", "ext": ".png", "w": 2415, "h": 794, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1667183641201647, "time": 1667183641, "md5": "L4os8n7Hq2Vkwze5Lb0KEQ==", "fsize": 1336684, "resto": 0, "id": "CQjyTS+o", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dragonborn-antipaladin-quest-volume-6", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 430, "images": 55, "omitted_posts": 425, "omitted_images": 55, "last_replies": [{"no": 5477183, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)18:07:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5476306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5476306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cWevenore Evermore!\u201d</span>", "time": 1669504031, "resto": 5448278, "id": "PyM5D6tB"}, {"no": 5477596, "now": "11/26/22(Sat)23:03:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5476306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5476306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cWevenore Evermore!\u201d</span><br><br>I&#039;ll switch, don&#039;t fuck this up guys.

Almost always of fear. And then, occasionally, something bad would happen after one of them- a relative passing away, a bully punching you, or sometimes just a movie you&#039;d been looking forward to turning out to be shit. Up through Middle School you&#039;d wondered if this was a power of some sort- futuresight or the likes. <br><br>The actual explanation was much more mundane: a combination of generalized anxiety order and confirmation bias that only seemed to make it worse. If someone expected something bad to happen half the time, then oftentimes one would take any misfortune as proof that those expectations were true. Or so your aunt, a licensed therapist, said. Since then your &quot;feelings&quot; have calmed down a bit, partly because of the wonders of cognitive therapy, and partly because if you say that they haven&#039;t then your parents might consider putting you on medication which you know they can&#039;t afford.<br><br>Today, you&#039;re leaving to start college, and your feelings have been worse than ever. That&#039;s to be expected though. You&#039;ll be living on your own for the first time in 18 years in a town where you know absolutely no one, and you&#039;ll need to find some work quick that can cover your tuition. It&#039;s absolutely normal. Anyone would be nervous. <span class=\"mu-s\">There is no reason ton panic.</span><br><br>You continue repeating this to yourself as your best friend, Jason, drives the van. A minute ago you felt somewhat disassociated, as if you were really just an observer, floating behind yourself and staring, but that&#039;s getting better now. The heart beating a hole into your chest slows down a little. The ringing in your ears fades. The world feels real. It&#039;s going to be fine. Just as you&#039;re thinking that, Jason says something.<br><br>&quot;Mitch? You alright dude?&quot; &quot;H-huh?&quot; Only as you choke out a reply do you look at yourself in the car mirror. A pale face covered in sweat stares back, before letting out a slow, deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. Just overthinking things. What were you saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was asking what major you were planning on doing again. You were still undecided last month, right?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you still are.

You hopefully approach the back door to the house you&#039;re in front of, but it locked. ...Guess that leaves you one option.<br><br>Wind up, aim, swi- wait a minute, wait a minute, if you just swing and it works you&#039;re going to get fucking showered in glass, aren&#039;t you. Hell, depending on what the shrapnel hits that could get you before the monster does. Move to the side, move to the side, hesitantly hold the thing out and thrust.

A crack. THUNK. Many more. THUNK. And a hole forms, causing some glass to fall across the countertop on the other side of the window. From there your work gets a bit easier, albeit nervewrackingly time-consuming. Each thrust of the club makes an extra hole in the glass, which essentially just falls onto the countertop. Your vision constantly flashes between the window, to aim your thrusts and see if anyone or thing inside the house was alerted, and your fence, to see if the thing hunting you has started coming your way, but for the time being it seems nothing is happening on either front.<br><br>After a very nerve-wracking couple of minutes, you have a hole large enough for you to get through. With a sweep of your golf club along a couple edges of the windowpane you get rid of any sharp bits of glass along the edges that could dispossess you of your blood, and then consider your method of entry. Your first instinct would be to go in on your hands but, uh, the countertop is covered in glass and you aren&#039;t wearing gloves. Go in leg first and slide across the counter on your butt you guess? There&#039;s not enough space for you to go in standing and while you REALLY don&#039;t like the idea of getting glass in your ass it at least wouldn&#039;t be a crippling injury.<br><br>As a last precaution you sweep your golf club across the now exposed countertop a couple times, trying to move as much glass out of the way with the handle with possible, before making your way in.

And of course, it was during your only free period. <br><br>Though you had no good reason to, you had started to think that after being regimented for eight years without any issues, you weren\u2019t ever going to get an unscheduled attack. Supposedly, such a thing is possible. More than a few of your fellow lifers aboard the <span class=\"mu-i\">Commissioner</span> claimed to never have had one, including your neighbor, that dozen-lifer Ironbelly. <br><br>The scariest thing about it though, was how mild it started out, mild enough that you nearly convinced yourself that you weren\u2019t having an attack. Now, obviously, there was no way you were going to be completely certain. You don\u2019t rate a waking harness. But you would have at least thought that the onset of an attack would have been \u2026 well, less subtle than a slight unexplained ache in your left arm. After you noticed it on your way back to your cell, and you finally clued into what it might mean, you hesitated. Even though all of the peons here \u2013 except those in the Belly, of course \u2013 are entitled to medical attention, you know full well that those who go to a sickbay with nothing wrong with them quickly get a reputation as malingerers. And that is not a reputation anyone would want to cultivate. You won\u2019t make trustee, won\u2019t be respected in the blocks, and the medics are less likely take you seriously and deal with you promptly. <br><br>But in the end, you relented. You walked yourself over to the nearest medical station and got the attention of the man on duty, a no-nonsense looking trustee. Within twenty seconds, you were in a harness, and he was running tests. Within a minute, you had been diagnosed and you were convalescing on an incredibly uncomfortable built-in chair, with a good-sized dose of Ticker Tape dissolving under your tongue. After securing the rest of the Tape and then finishing whatever the Hell he was doing before you came in, the trustee comes back over to you, and checks the read out from the harness. <br><br>\u201cAlright, you are back within safe parameters.\u201d <br><br>He turns away from the handheld reporter, looking you over. Then he sets it down and takes the harness off of you, talking all the while. <br><br>\u201cOn dosing day, you need to make sure that whoever is doling out your Tape knows that you were prescribed a standard emergency dose today. I\u2019ll leave a note in your file, but odds are they won\u2019t bother reading it unless you tell them to.\u201d <br><br>As he winds the leads of the harness back up, he looks at you, and you get the sense that he is thinking of saying something else on the topic \u2026 but in the end he decides against it. He returns the harness to its drawer, then turns back to you. <br><br>\u201cIn consideration that this is your first unscheduled, and taking into account that you are seventeen, in excellent health, I am going to clear you for sorting duty on second shift today.

The suspect, Johnson\u2019s stablehand, swore he had nothing to do with it. Johnson told you he was telling the truth with his own mouth, which is a bit strange given that he was a dead man. But you saw him, heard him, believed him. It led you to the real perpetrator, his wife. All the evidence checked out, and they put her away, but to a certain group there was simply no doubt.

One important limitation to keep in mind with Elewyn&#039;s current strength of healing magic is that the recovering mana will take the path of least resistance as it mends living tissue and bone. This doesn&#039;t extend to tissue that is significantly necrotic. Thus, in this case of mending necrotic tissue, the nearby healthy tissue would pull away and seal itself off for the time being.

So he would be the senior general for anything concerning matter of defense in the area. Otherwise, it defaults to who&#039;s the most senior, as in, who had been a general the longest. Whilst this sounds effective and efficient, the local governors are not subordinated to the generals and may refuse orders, the generals themselves may begin to bicker and start to act on their own.

As the fog clears, you sort through your recent memories with the tentative dread of a man checking for bombs in his mailbox. You remember nearly finishing the bottle of Jameson by yourself, and you remember taking the pills. You remember jerking off to 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations, and with a jolt of horror you realize that it&#039;s all probably still filling your laptop screen. Deciding that you&#039;d better get up and check before your mom peeks in your room, you open your eyes-- only to discover that 3D animated Miraculous Ladybug futanari rape compilations are the least of your worries. <br><br>You find yourself surrounded by hundreds of people, most of them also appearing to be in various stages of waking up. The ones who have come to their senses are staring in the same direction as you, and at the same horrifying scene. Packed together without much room to move, you all occupy the enclosed back of some sort of cave. Looking across the cave, the dull earthen walls are lit with a reddish glow that implies that the mouth of the cave must be just out of sight around a corner. But before the turn, in the center of the cave, there is amassed a colossal pile of corpses.<br><br>Twisted bodies with agonized faces are stacked and woven together, secured and reinforced by sheets of flayed skin stretched to the point of tearing and knotted entrails tied together end-to-end. At the apex of this ghoulish mountain is a giant throne, clearly fashioned from the bones of many human beings. The sharp, black-tipped fingers of a clawlike hand drum idly on one of the skulls which form the ends of either armrest. The throne&#039;s occupant smiles.<br><br>&quot;Wakey wakey.&quot; <br><br>The voice that fills the cavern and shakes dust from the stalactites above you is best described as unholy. More than just disarmingly cold, it also seems to be several voices layered upon one another. <br><br>His horns, wide-set and yellowed at the ends, are about the length of your legs. They erupt from the being&#039;s head just above his temples, and curve back over his bald head. The only hair on his blood-red skin is a long black goatee with a golden band bunching it together over his bare chest. He wears no clothing, but he sits with one leg laid across the other, obscuring genitals from view. Bummer. You wanna see the devil&#039;s cock.<br><br>&quot;Do not despair, children. You are exactly where you belong.&quot; <br><br>At length, he explains the nine circles of hell. You learn that outside of this cave is Limbo, the first circle, designated for the unbaptized and virtuous nonbelievers. Spiraling down beneath that are the other 8 circles. <br><br>&quot;Uh... question?&quot; A voice suddenly interrupts his explanation of the ninth circle.

You just failed to make me, the player, see what you saw in them. <br><br>In Carinda&#039;s case, you showed THAT the MC found her appealing, but not really WHY he found her appealing. He knew almost nothing about her, they barely interacted in the entire quest and she did very little to show herself worthy of love. Therefore, his attraction to her came as little more than a childish crush to an authority figure, similar to a schoolboy crushing on his teacher. And correspondingly, there was no hint whatsoever of her returning that attraction at all. Their few interactions mostly showed her humouring the boy and trying not to crush his heart with the truth.<br><br>And in Cass&#039;s case, you failed in all of these things. Cute, alien waifu that needs to hide from the law is a fine concept. There have been more than one anime with that exact concept.

What was she as a character? What does she like, what does she dislike? What&#039;s her personality like? Why do YOU like her?

Your unfulfilled desires still gnawed at your soul, looking back upon your wasted life you remember being\u2026<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Salary Man: Another wage slave toiling away in the late stage capitalist hellhole that was modernity. Abused by your co-workers and exploited by your boss your spirit had been crushed by the twin forces of needing to pay the bills and your own lack of back bone. In the end you hadn\u2019t even committed suicide, you\u2019d just collapsed from exhaustion and fallen in front of the train as it entered the station.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Shut In: A round of bullying during middle school had left you emotionally scarred. If you\u2019d had decent parents and teachers maybe they could have nurtured you to move past this and become a better person. But your parents didn\u2019t know what the fuck they were doing and your teachers weren\u2019t paid enough to give a shit. You became fearful of life, taking refuge in the escapist fantasies of anime and videogames, which only made you more emotionally stunted, which made you an even bigger target for bullying. Eventually you just refused to leave the house. You managed to make it to age 20 before dying from a combination of sleep depravation and malnutrition. (72 hour gaming marathons combined with only subsisting on junk food is a heck of a combo)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A NEET: In better times you could have potentially become a normie. You made it through high school okay and went on to study a degree in liberal arts. This was your fatal mistake. You liked to think you had high minded philosophical reasons for going but really you were swayed by the high ratio of female to male students that course had. Unfortunately, almost all of the girls were some combination of ugly, angry, crazy or lesbian. You dropped out in disgust but not before being saddled with a crippling amount of debt. Condemned to an eternity in the part time gig economy, you met your end at the hands of truck-kun while valiantly trying to deliver a pizza to some chad\u2019s house party.</span>", "filename": "void", "ext": ".png", "w": 1109, "h": 842, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 189, "tim": 1666363267603124, "time": 1666363267, "md5": "SvZEpYrGCCJ76bQQrCJFjQ==", "fsize": 1231530, "resto": 0, "id": "c+RQU7+g", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "another-bs-isekai-quest", "trip": "!!La3WQH+W8cp", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 166, "images": 36, "omitted_posts": 161, "omitted_images": 36, "last_replies": [{"no": 5445251, "now": "10/27/22(Thu)23:05:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5445248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5445248</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cognis runs nifty non skirmish quests too</span><br>huh", "time": 1666926333, "resto": 5439476, "id": "nDZYpp2r"}, {"no": 5445254, "now": "10/27/22(Thu)23:10:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5445248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5445248</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cognis runs an isekai quest instead of more Skirmishes</span><br>What is this loopy-land that I have entered?

Why do they know Bucklin? Why does Bucklin know them? He\u2019s had a storied history, that much you already knew, but this seems like something too important to just ignore. <br><br>Your eyes dart from haggard Bucklin to the imposing knight. The way they blocked Bucklin\u2019s magic was not normal. It was something that could, in theory, be possible. Even from what little you knew of magic, this was a being -- a monster -- you didn\u2019t want to contend with. Given your paltry knowledge and hardly rudimentary fighting experience, it would surely be a death sentence.<br><br>You grit your teeth and grip your sword. Your eyes drift over toward the puddle of blood in the empty cell. <br><br>That nameless man only wanted one thing. To meet with his child. Even through his maddening growls, he begged to see him again. To others he seemed a beast, but to you, he was someone to help. Even now, you wanted to try. But, there was nothing left. You had hope that your magic could do something.<br><br>Maybe it was not an earnest wish? What did you have to gain from helping him? Satisfaction? Experimenting with your new magic?<br><br>No.<br><br>There was another motive.<br><br>You simply didn\u2019t want to watch someone die.

There\u2019s no remorse for the deed done.<br><br>\u201cHow can you just\u2026!\u201d You shake your head. Electricity sparks from your fingertips. <br><br>\u201cLorelai!\u201d Bucklin keeps his eyes on the knight and grasps your arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d You look to the side, but you don\u2019t see him. <br><br>\u201cDown here.\u201d Bucklin yanks on your wrist.<br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d You look down. Wait, when did you start floating? The floor slowly rises to meet your feet. \u201cWhen did I\u2026\u201d<br><br>Bucklin yanks you down, positioning himself in front of you. \u201cDon&#039;t let your guard down.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI-I should be telling you that.\u201d You stutter, nearly stumbling as you stand beside him.<br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer her question.\u201d Bucklin continues. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d<br><br>The knight stands silently before turning around.<br><br>\u201cHey, we\u2019re not done here!\u201d He grits his teeth as he steps forward.<br><br>A pool of shadow forms on the far wall next to the ascending stairs.

What looked like a simple mission to a low power level planet turned into a near-death situation and a complete disaster for Frieza&#039;s interests. After saving the life of his two servants, Raditz and Nappa, the trio set coordinates for Earth to hopefully meet Kakarot and heal their wounds with his help, exiling themselves from the Cold Empire.<br><br>They found that Kakarot had become &#039;humanized&#039;, unwilling to let go of his friends to join your ranks. Still, your weakened state did not leave you many options. In exchange for healing by the earthlings, you swore to not destroy or harm the population of the Earth and train with Kakarot for a full year.<br><br>After learning a variety of techniques from Kakarot and his reluctant comrades, Earth was invaded by the Crusher Corps, but through cunning and &#039;experimental&#039; tactics, Vegeta was able to defeat Turles and destroy his ship, unaware that within were the seeds of the mighty Tree of Life. Turles then joined the Saiyans on Earth.<br><br>Kakarot, angered by Vegeta&#039;s actions during the battle with Turles, asked to duel Vegeta. After a long fight, Vegeta smashed Kakarot&#039;s limbs and rendered him unable to move, not before an intervention by a particularly angry Gohan. Tensions are high as the fighting was bloody, but it proved that Kakarot and Raditz were capable of great feats when spurred by their compassion.<br><br>Afterwards, in exchange for saving Earth from Turles, the Brief family designed a powerful new armor for the Saiyans and were constructing a spaceship for Vegeta and his servants in order to find out if any other Saiyan remnants still fight around the galaxy. While she completed the ship, Vegeta went out to meet Kakarot and reconcile as best he could with the humans of Earth.", "filename": "VegetaScouter", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 150, "tim": 1666009131844636, "time": 1666009131, "md5": "ZsoQ425iyAHea2MrdzcG3Q==", "fsize": 109796, "resto": 0, "id": "BGfQ2JnE", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vegeta-quest-6", "trip": "!!YNEYFg2EhxJ", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 496, "images": 106, "omitted_posts": 491, "omitted_images": 105, "last_replies": [{"no": 5474854, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:35:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s over</span>", "filename": "Untitled - 224", "ext": ".webm", "w": 760, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1669318514265163, "time": 1669318514, "md5": "UpQAR4RkpGq/6wkrHTpdIQ==", "fsize": 2829898, "resto": 5436238, "id": "aAWQK60n"}, {"no": 5474860, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:43:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamboozled again", "time": 1669319026, "resto": 5436238, "id": "GpbjxHLL"}, {"no": 5477719, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)01:18:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5436238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5436238</a><br>FUCK YES!!!

Damn it all, how could this go so wrong so quickly? He had to find a way to solve this too now, before focusing on that abomination in the south. Already, he feels Steel-Weaver approaching, and together, they should be able to convince this warm presence to side with them and eliminate this overgrown fish. Seeing his fellow god appear on the horizon, he eagerly approaches, only for a single thought to overwhelm his mind as the bloodthirsty shark leaps from the ice onto the metal spider: Of course it wouldn&#039;t be that easy.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Action 1: Develop [MA] [DI]</span><br>Enraged by the attack on their deity and newly armed by both their own inventions and those of their neighbors, the ruling Playwright and fellow Actor-Priests whip the masses of the Riath into a warmongering frenzy, their craftsmen whittling branches into spears, bows and arrows more than ever as a primitive form of military command begins to appear; many of the more fit or zealous Actor-Priests and their apprentice Stagehands creating and performing an ever increasing amount of dramatic, battle filled plays that more closely resemble combat exercises than anything else, taking many notes from the methods of hunters against their prey and thus focusing on quick movement, ambushes and hit-and-run tactics. They may not be able to destroy a god, or whatever that creature with the huge maw is, but they shall defend themselves from any more mortal threat, including, potentially, it&#039;s own followers.<br><br>In the process of this training, however, many participants realize that they&#039;ve begun to share the senses of their fellow &#039;packmates&#039;, seeing and hearing things they could not possible have on their own. What&#039;s more, this seems to enhance their own perception, each small enhancement granted by a pack member combining to a rather substantial improvement in the end. This, in a way, is the ability&#039;s own limitation. Working wonders in small numbers, the minds of mortals can only handle so much sensation before they&#039;re overloaded and the hunters are rendered insensate. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pack Hunting is developed.

Thus, the craftsmen set about creating some sort of protection for the nascent Warrior-Performers, using a variety of materials from many different sources for these &quot;battle costumes&quot;, putting them into practice both on stage and in the wilderness against wild animals. Stone is declared too heavy, wood too brittle and cloth completely innefective. Before long, they resort to creating something entirely new to suit their demands, a tough but light and flexible material made of leftover animal skins then tanned and treated for additional protection. Thus, hide armour soon becomes the standard for the Riath.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hide Armor is developed.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Action 3: Share Technology [MI]</span><br>Of course, the Riath also involve the EBWOs in their exercises, their southern neighbors sharing a semblance of their eagerness for war and concern for their own god.

Things can go as that universe went or you can derail it with your actions or ignore it completely to just focus on the problems and issues that affect your character! <br><br>Previously, Ruka spent her last day at school before the holidays. It&#039;s clear that many students at the school are infected by a strange supernatural possession. They&#039;re all obsessed with a obstacle course competition at Heiwa no Mori. Her supernatural arsenal is far too small to deal with such overwhelming numbers of possessed victims.<br> <br>Even the genius Mizuno Ami was affected! She&#039;s out to eliminate rivals from the competition, Ruka dreads what else she&#039;ll pull. Mizuno&#039;s already submitted anonymous letters to teachers to get Ruka into trouble.<br> <br>The afternoon was spent at Crown Games, where Ruka learns Usagi will be joining the competition as Mizuno&#039;s partner. Aya is joining too, with Chiba Mamoru. Another odd thing Ruka witnesses is a detective attempting to question a man slumped over the Crown Games counter. No time to discover the reason though, she goes off to start questioning Kakutani about Sailors and the enemy. Seems the Dark Agency is gone, but that doesn&#039;t mean the true culprits have been defeated. All Ruka knows for sure is that their schtick is draining people of energy. <br> <br>Ruka also gets a lead in the mysterious &#039;Anonymous Reincarnation&#039;, who has written the overwrought SILVER KINGDOM stories. The author hides behind another crazy pseudonym &#039;Marina Karen Miliyah&#039;. Allegedly, there are even more pseudonyms after that one too. It&#039;s almost like a Matryoshka doll.<br> <br>Returning home, Ruka regales on the day&#039;s events to the penguin siblings. They&#039;re all stuck in the apartment until the FLOATING TEETH gets expelled from the Penguin Domain. The seals are still holding but they&#039;re visibly fading. Ruka will need to deal with the supernatural invader one day before they fail. The penguins are very cooperative with each other, they set up a watch over the portal. Azul is allowed to rest at Ruka&#039;s request to handle Sunday&#039;s competition.<br> <br>The night brings a Memory. A wrenching and nightmarish one which shakes Ruka and makes her cry. The end of a Kingdom. The morning was atrocious as Ruka headed to the competition with her possessed childhood friends. Masato is especially an ass under the influence of the BLACK HAND and abuses Luna.<br> <br>That prompts Ruka to ditch him and try to sneak in but the gates and fence are unnaturally freezing cold stone.

Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She leads you by hand towards the first suggestion, approaching the spooky-looking mansion together.<br><br>You and Cocoa make your way through, taking things slow. You do end up getting a little uneasy when you notice some silvery substances in one of the rooms, and Cocoa ends up hiding behind you when she hears the voices of her parents, but the two of you move past it. Mom and Jaki show up after the two of you exit, letting you know that while Neuros did end up escaping, he\u2019s definitely GONE gone now, and won\u2019t be returning any time soon.<br><br>You do wish to hear more, but let her know you\u2019ll catch up later. Next up, the Ferris Wheel. You and Cocoa sit together as it takes the two of you up high, slowly and at a calming pace. Cocoa places an arm around you, her head on your shoulder, when the two of you reach the highest point. From there, you can see everyone just\u2026 relaxing, having fun, playing games and going on rides together. Cheelai seems to be actually leading Izzy, Tapion, Minotia, and the Para Para bros. around as they explore the rest of Dream Land. Videl and Sharpner are eating ice cream together, and looks like Penn\u2019s getting some for Angela too, while Erasa spends time with Hado and Sala. Sachie and Zarid have gone into Laser Moon with Cocoa\u2019s friends, and you see Gohan, Pantea, Kokoro, and the Ghouls all in the arcade. Mom and dad are even having a little moment\u2026 right in the food court, as dad stuffs his face.<br><br>And finally you and Cocoa take one last ride on the Tunnel of Love. \u201cGot another few questions you wanna try for this one?\u201d you ask your girlfriend as the two of you make your way through.<br><br>\u201cMmm\u2026 nah.\u201d She holds you close, petting your hair gently. \u201cDon\u2019t think the tail trick\u2019ll work twice in the same day.\u201d Cocoa teases.<br><br>You blush and pout. \u201cHey!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAh, but it gets the same result just having you think about it, doesn\u2019t it?~\u201d Cocoa kisses you on the cheek.<br><br>\u201cL-look, just because I\u2019ve trained the weaknes out of it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prepared for a surprise like that\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br><br>\u201cSo you let your defenses down specifically for me?~\u201d Cocoa asks. You respond by just resting your head on her shoulder and sighing. She eases up on the teasing, simply holding you close to her gently.

And I love being with you.\u201d She kisses your forehead gently. \u201cYou\u2019re my Peppa.\u201d<br><br>Your heart feels all aflutter. \u201c\u2026I love you too Cocoa.\u201d You sit up and hold her close as you kiss her back, on the lips this time. \u201cMy Cocoa.\u201d<br><br>The ride sadly comes to an end, but you\u2019ve got a smile on your face that hasn\u2019t faded yet. \u201cStill up for a look into the fortune teller?\u201d Cocoa asks you.<br><br>\u201cReady if you are.\u201d<br><br>The two of you reach the fortune teller\u2026 and get a bit of a surprise. Baba\u2019s there, having just told the fortunes of Pantea and Videl. Videl looks rather pleased with herself, while Pantea seems more\u2026 lost in thought. She snaps out of it when you and Cocoa approach, though. \u201cOh, hey! Peppa, Cocoa, you two going to try a freebie from Baba too?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that!\u201d Baba protests. \u201cI have a reputation to uphold, you know!\u201d<br><br>\u201cThank you though, great auntie Baba.\u201d you tell her politely. \u201cMind giving one for Cocoa and I?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, I can generously offer my services here\u2026 the invitation did get me some good-tasting meals, and the Ghouls look rather pleased with themselves.\u201d she responds, calling the two of you forward. \u201cSo\u2026 I take it you both wish to look to your futures, yes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe would like that, yes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d Baba slowly waves her arms over her crystal ball, letting out a low hum as she focuses. \u201cHmm\u2026 yes, I see\u2026\u201d An image starts to form in it\u2026 you see a pink and white outfit, and\u2026 oh! Cocoa! An older Cocoa. And\u2026 dang it she looks taller too. \u201cI can see that you will follow your passion, and you will excel in it.\u201d<br><br>Her face lights up with excitement. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhile I insist my fortunes are accurate, it is up to you to make what you see a reality.\u201d Baba answers. \u201cAnd now\u2026\u201d The image in the crystal ball changes. There\u2019s\u2026 you. An older you, but not the counterpart you met. There\u2019s a brightness in your eyes, full of excitement and energy. And\u2026 they flash with a red, almost magenta color for a moment. The image then just kinda\u2026 cuts off, to Baba\u2019s slight confusion. \u201cHmm. It would appear your desire to get stronger will have results above and beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019re intrigued, but there\u2019s\u2026 something else you\u2019re kinda hoping for. \u201cThank you, Baba.

I figured since the two of you are so eager to get killed by monsters, you could protect me on the way there. Not that I think there are many monsters to go around, but even a weak monster could kill me if I travel alone and it finds me asleep.&quot;<br>&quot;So you want us to watch your sleep as you travel?&quot;<br>&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>&quot;Hold on a second. This is mercenary work. We require pay.&quot;<br>Elise laughs.<br>&quot;I assumed you&#039;d ask something weird like that. Well, I&#039;ll give you food.

This crystal captured my soul. When I die I get reborn near it. It was originally underground and the nightstalkers would just wait there to kill me again and again. But I managed to take it to this cellar.&quot;<br>&quot;How is this cellar better protected?&quot;<br>&quot;It isn&#039;t, but the nightstalkers mostly hunt underground. They send a few above ground now and then.&quot;<br>&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t know. I am always reborn as a little girl. I haven&#039;t survived very long. I think my best streak were... uh... three months I think. That was before the nightstalkers drove the goblins away from here.&quot;<br>&quot;Goblins?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, there were some goblins squatting around here. But the nightstalkers attacked them in large numbers and they fled. I got some tools and weapons from them after they were gone.&quot;, she says, motioning with her hand to show her collection. It is mostly junk, a whole bunch of rusted blades and tools. But you suppose it is better than nothing.<br>&quot;Can the nightstalkers be killed?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, they are not much stronger than a regular human. Except that they grow claws and big teeth. The two of you are bleeding, you should find somewhere safe to spend the night. The nightcrawlers will come after you.&quot;, she says, stashing her pole, snuffing the candle flame and heading outside.<br>&quot;What about you?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;ll go hide in the forest. The nightcrawlers don&#039;t leave the city limits. I feel suddenly sick if I travel too long away from the city, but the woods nearby are close enough. Honestly I&#039;m betting the nightstalkers will be busy enough chasing you tonight to bother with me. Please don&#039;t follow me.&quot;<br>You see as the little girl walks away.<br>&quot;Wait! Where is there an entrance to the underground?&quot;<br>&quot;It in under the fountain in the middle of town. But the nightstalkers will be waiting for you inside. There is always a patrol there.&quot;<br>&quot;Is that the only way in?&quot;<br>She gives you a mischievous smile.<br>&quot;No.&quot;<br>&quot;Where else can we find an entrance?&quot;<br>&quot;It is getting late, I can&#039;t show you. If you survive the night, look for me and I will show it to you.&quot;<br>&quot;Can&#039;t you at least describe it?&quot;<br>&quot;There are many, but they are mostly rat infested nightstalker feeding grounds. Most big homes have an entrance to the underground through the sewers. But the nightstalkers don&#039;t monitor them all, at least not all the time. It is a matter of luck whether you will find a safe passage or a horrible death. I don&#039;t feel like gambling tonight. I found some tasty berries and I am going to eat them and go back to sleep.

It is risky, there are bloodthirsty monsters inside the ruins.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, we met a few.&quot;<br>&quot;Now excuse me, I have to go back to my tribe.&quot;<br>&quot;Should we kill him?&quot;, asks the bard.<br>&quot;It is just a hungry goblin.

They are okay monsters.&quot;<br>&quot;So there is really a goblin tribe nearby.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, but they are constantly attacked by all sorts of other big monsters from the ruins. I heard the term &#039;nightstalker&#039;, but I&#039;m unclear on what it means.&quot;<br>&quot;Some monsters who huddle together during day time and roam at night.

Well, I have good news for you. There is a small white flower that grows in these woods that can be made into a potion that when splattered against a surface makes it glow like the sun for a minute. If you go gather enough of it, I&#039;ll make a batch for you.&quot;<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you send your goblins to gather it?&quot;<br>&quot;They are already gathering stuff for the poultice. Turns out their shaman can only heal one person per day, the hack. In a tribe of a thousand goblins who area always hunting and foraging lack of common medicine is the number one cause of death. With a few batches of this poultice, they can grow much faster.&quot;<br>&quot;Why are you helping a monster tribe grow?&quot;, you ask.<br>&quot;Well, they are helping me. I decided to help them as well.&quot;<br>&quot;They will just rob and rape people once their tribe is strong enough.&quot;<br>&quot;Rude!&quot;, says the goblin tending to the cauldrons.<br>&quot;Not all goblins are rapist and thieves.

Also this body has the vigor of youth.&quot;<br>&quot;That I can see.&quot;<br>&quot;When I was young I supplied an army with potions. I learned alchemy in the extinct royal academy.&quot;<br>&quot;Why is it extinct?&quot;<br>&quot;The capital was razed by the kingdom I was supplying with potions.&quot;<br>&quot;Woa, so it really made a difference.&quot;<br>&quot;Of course! You think I&#039;m some low grade amateur? I cook the good stuff.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m amazed.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, don&#039;t just sit around doing nothing, make yourselves useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... maybe later. We found a little girl in the ruins who claimed to reincarnate every time near a big crystal.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#039;s interesting. I heard about the reincarnation curse once. Every time you die you reincarnate a little younger than the previous time. It doesn&#039;t last forever. Eventually you stop reincarnating. Also your memory gets all messed up. Nasty curse. Some people use it to extend their lives. They can get almost immortal doing this. The problem is finding enough magical energy to power the automated ressurection. I suppose the crystal you saw is a cursed many crystal. Could be made in so many fun and interesting potions.&quot;<br>&quot;What would happen to the girl?&quot;<br>&quot;She? Well, if we dispelled the curse on the crystal, the next time she dies she would stay dead.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Return to the ruins at night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend the night and return to the ruins</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go steal the little girl&#039;s crystal </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write in</span>", "time": 1666139582, "resto": 5433694, "id": "BdPsEFfK"}, {"no": 5437521, "now": "10/18/22(Tue)20:39:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p5437509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5437509</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; Go look for the flower for the light potion</span>", "time": 1666139984, "resto": 5433694, "id": "U9dS2nYD"}], "last_modified": 1666139984}, {"no": 5436773, "now": "10/17/22(Mon)19:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Mohg quest", "com": "You are Mohg the Lord of Blood, you have a gay frenchman named V\u00e1rre who serves you and a bunch of followers consisting of edgelords with rapiers and fat grey aliens who are helping you to forge your dynasty that will take over the Lands Between.

We follow oaths bound by law before God, and keep true to the codes of chivalry and honor. In fact, I followed a vow of silence until recently, as part of a pledge for my order.&quot;<br>\u201cSilence?\u201d<br>\u201cYes, it is a trial that allows for self-reflection and discipline. It is not often taken up, but I wanted to show my fellow knights that no obstacle is too great if one puts their mind to it.\u201d<br>\u201cWoah, like not talking at all? Even one bit?\u201d<br>\u201cNot even one bit.\u201d<br>\u201cBut what if you need help?\u201d<br>\u201cIt is good when aid comes to thee, but as someone championing thy people, should never rely upon the hope of its arrival.\u201d<br><br>She looks down contemplatively as you continue.<br>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong!

They started to accept it as a fact of life before my liege asked me to accept a leadership position, where I had to cast it off.\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, makes sense. I don\u2019t think I could do that. Spells require spoken words.\u201d<br>\u201cI can see how that could be a deterrent.\u201d<br>Silence sets in, as she seems to be deep in thought. While you are used to the quiet, so you let her ponder. You\u2019ve seen young squires \u2013 though she is too old to be a squire \u2013 with similar problems before their first campaign. They sometimes need time and encouragement.<br><br>\u201cSo you are in a \u2018command position\u2019, like Headmistress Olivia?\u201d<br>\u201cSort of I suppose. I share the same rank with eleven others in our host, with many knights under my command.\u201d<br>\u201cAre they like you?\u201d<br>\u201cIn a manner of speaking? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, even knights. Though I suppose I have the advantage of experience.\u201d<br>\u201cI remember seeing Headmistress Olivia move around all the time, telling people what to do and often stopping them. When I was little, I used to think she just likes ordering people around.\u201d she chuckles \u201cIt took me embarrassingly long to realize she doesn\u2019t seem as happy about it.

You spent what time you had between classes either on the roof or in the library, and you managed to slide by without any of your bullies finding a chance to target you. Instead some other kid got to be the lucky one. You offered a silent prayer in apology as you slipped out of the school grounds.<br><br>All that had been left for you to do was head home, see how much you had saved up budget wise to see if maybe you could treat yourself.

The pathways outside the mansion were little more than streams of mud. A boy with a vacant stare looked down at the ground below from his room on the second floor. <br><br>Olaf, the once loyal butler of his family, was standing out in the rain, yanking at the reins of a horse pulling the Lionsong carriage which was loaded to the brim with valuables he and some of the maids had plundered from the mansion. The carriage was horribly stuck in the thick mud. Even with the help of the traitorous household guard, they couldn\u2019t seem to make the thing budge. The beginnings of a smile found their way onto the young man\u2019s face as he carefully placed his hand on the cheek where the butler had struck him \u2013 sending him to marble floors the maids hadn\u2019t bothered sweeping. <br><br>He hadn\u2019t been raised this way. To take joy in the suffering of others, but there was no father to preach to him. His father, a broad-shouldered man with a thick handlebar moustache, had taken the majority of the household guard and set off at the earliest mention of the horror happening within the capital. To do battle with the monsters rampaging in the streets. The rest of the royal family had been evacuated to the vacation home several dozen miles away from the capital. <br><br>Here they sat idle. Awaiting news of a glorious victory. News that never came. The uncertainty scratched away at the sanity of his mother, Mera. Her suffering further compounded by the fact that all responsibilities of the realm fell to her in the king\u2019s absence. <br><br>Despite living in the same house, her duties as queen regent meant that Leon saw her maybe once a week. Being the eldest at fifteen years of age, he understood the need, but it was hard to explain to his younger siblings, of which there were four, why their mother had not even greeted them in the past few days.

Mercenary captain. Dark Flier. Witch. Over the past five years, you\u2019ve been busy making a name for yourself as the leader of the Blackwings, a renowned mercenary company that has seen victory across several fronts of the ongoing Fodlan Unification War. Your newfound profession brought you into conflict against the Adrestian Empire, the Faerghus Dukedom, and the Fodlan Orthodox Church, with you coming out on top each bout. After having served the nobles of the Faerghus Kingdom for several years, you then found yourself in the direct employment of Claude von Riegan, leader of the Leicester Alliance.<br><br>Receiving a promising lead on the \u201cSeven Sages of Agartha\u201d, you and the Blackwings agreed to aid Elias, a mysterious mage that was able to understand the language written in Echeverria\u2019s book. In exchange for a full translation, Elias wished for you to venture through the infamous Edmund Woods, a location reputed as being haunted, and aid his master against an attack from the Orthodox Church. With great difficulty and almost zero visibility, you and your best mercenaries ventured through the terrifying forest, when you were ambushed by Dolofonos, an assassin eerily similar to Kronya. Having been separated from the group, you were forced to duel the assassin. You came out on top, but not before he had already killed Elias.<br><br>With the fog in the woods dissipating, you were able to locate the rest of the Blackwings, where you found them already in combat with the Orthodox Church\u2019s military.<br><br>Archive: https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.<wbr>com/qstarchive.html?tags=Three+Hous<wbr>es<br>Blackwings Company Info/Supports List: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1ESxa3V-d3Mb27ZG97cbRoVMeD6HHEI<wbr>ySF9nJqqd48dc/edit?usp=sharing<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blair Weaver</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Level 34 Seraph Knight (50/100)</span><br>HP: 53 (90%)<br>STR: 28 (40%)<br>MAG: 23 (50%)<br>DEX: 24 (45%)<br>SPD: 37 (65%)<br>LCK: 21 (30%)<br>DEF: 23 (50%)<br>RES: 20 (40%)<br>CHARM: 18 (45%)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personal Skill:</span><br>Fiery Blood+ (+4 Damage and +3 Speed when HP is not at Max)<br>Transmute: Up to 5x during a battle, you can make a physical attack deal magic damage<br>+2 STR<br>+5 HP<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Offensive Skills:</span><br>Lancefaire: (+5 DMG when attacking w/ Lance)<br>Black Tomefaire (+5 DMG w/ magic)<br>Darting Blow (+6 SPD when attacking)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Defensive Skills</span><br>Rally Spectrum+ (+5 to ally\u2019s stats)<br>Swordbreaker (+20 Hit and Avoid when facing Sword users)<br>Alert Stance+ (+40 Avoid when not engaged)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proficiencies:</span><br>Lance: A<br>Authority/Tactics: A<br>Reason: A<br>Flying: A<br>Axe: D<br>Sword: D-<br>Heavy Armor: D<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spells:</span><br>Fire (E Rank, +3 DMG, 10 Uses)<br>Thunder (D Rank, +5 DMG, +10% Crit, 5 Uses)<br>Aircalibur (C Rank, +3 DMG, 3x DMG against flyers, 5 Uses)<br>Fimbulvetr (B Rank, +12 DMG, +10% Crit, Area of Effect, 3 Uses)<br>Bolting (A Rank, (12 Damage, 15% Crit, Long Range Siege Magic. 2 Uses, Range: 20)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inventory: Silver Lance+, Axereaver, Magic Staff, Blessed Lance, Elixir(x3)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gold: 5650g</span>", "filename": "Three Houses Quest (2)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1902, "h": 1066, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1664851324615767, "time": 1664851324, "md5": "cq5RcU8cjy0M8Bh0wbAMmg==", "fsize": 403973, "resto": 0, "id": "C6fpd0tl", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fire-emblem-three-houses-quest-12", "custom_spoiler": 0, "replies": 494, "images": 77, "omitted_posts": 489, "omitted_images": 75, "last_replies": [{"no": 5472660, "now": "11/22/22(Tue)18:46:46", "name": "TreeHouses QM", "com": "<a href=\"#p5472654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;5472654</a><br>Bennett slams a fist on the table. \u201cDo you take me for a fool? We cannot afford to throw away experienced soldiers on a whim! The Sword of the Creator has reappeared in Garreg Mach! Even now, she rallies the Knights of Seiros to her. The grip that we hold over the faith in Fodlan is tenuous, and this woman, whom you assured me was dead, now threatens us all!

The Sword of the Creator will be ours. We\u2019ve suffered a minor setback, but you know better than anyone what we are capable of. After all, do you not owe your current position to our aid?\u201d<br><br>Bennett sat back into his chair, examining Montgomery, no, Odesse, as though looking at him for the first time. Though he knew it was a necessary step, he loathed having asked these Agarthans for their help with each passing day. Odesse might have been playing the part of doting servant, but Bennett knew when he was being looked down on. And he knew the man in front of him well enough to understand the underlying threat within his speech. If only he still had reliable servants like Fritz and Ivan at his side. But Ivan was now dead, likely a calculated move by this monster. And as for Fritz, he\u2019d been missing ever since Garreg Mach fell. He was nowhere to be found within the monastery\u2019s dungeon, likely having either escaped or been killed.<br><br>\u201cMy lord, please leave everything to me.\u201d Montgomery bows once more. \u201cMy associates are already making their move, and I assure you in just a short time, these problems will disappear overnight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cVery well.\u201d Bennet says. \u201cHandle it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThen by your leave.\u201d Montgomery exits the study, leaving Bennett alone to his thoughts.<br><br>\u201cAgarthans\u2026\u201d Bennett muttered alone. It wasn\u2019t just him that Odesse was looking down on. It was all of humanity. That they viewed themselves as superiors was a notion that caused the Patriarch no shortage of amusement. Would a superior people have been nearly wiped out by the Goddess? Would they spend their lives cowering underground, as far away from her light as possible? Would they carry out elaborate schemes and plots, unable to act out in the open, lest humanity rise up and destroy whatever remnants of their tattered empire remained? Would they be blind to their own machinations, unable to see when even one of their own was plotting to betray them?<br><br>The Patriarch exited his chair to look out his window, and gaze upon all that his \u201cpartnership\u201d had earned him. He looked forward to the day he crushed the Agarthans under his heel. Until then, he\u2019d play his part dutifully.

After finding some of the few remaining townsfolk, huddled and starving, you made your way into the town&#039;s formerly abandoned mines. There, you discovered that the vampire you were hunting was not a powerful nosferatu, but rather a strigoi, a far more dangerous type of vampire.

Last time you had, while still wounded, pushed back an attack from goat men and sorcerers consorting with the devil against your keep while your men investigated about an attack on your village of Otherone. Unfortunately the vile bard Beau and a ghibelline named Schamann who carried the spirit of Conradin von Hohenstaufen fled from your dungeons in the confusion of the attack you sent villagers to catch them.

They lived not in great caves warmed by lava or ancient halls built by duergar, no, they lived in the smallest and most disagreeable place that there was, a deep cave near a cliff, one of the roads to the Underworld. It was prone to catastrophes and sometimes entire families fell to the cliff during their sleep, it was awful but it was the only place where they were allowed to stay. Looking at the poor figures around a makeshift fire trying to warm themselves against the carven the leader of the group put tighter his rat&#039;s hide cape around himself and sighted. Every day since his birth had been as pitiful and if he was not throwing himself into the cliff it was purely by faith and remembrance, remembrance of a glorious past.<br><br>One of the goblin children who was sitting here near the fire with some adults asked him in a pleading tone.<br><br>-War chief Shitbag, war chief Shitbag please tell us a story. <br><br>Shitbag grimaced, he disliked this term, war chief, goblins never had war chiefs, they were lead by shamans who invoked visions of their ancestors and ruled them by this means, the simple fact that there was need of a war chief was a great humiliation for the Snaga tribe. He looked at the face of the goblin child with his meagre body, his skin of a colour between the green, the brown and the grey that was characteristic of the Snagas and his huge yellow cat like eyes and pointy teeth. The small goblin was soon joined by tens of others goblin kids. Shitbag liked kids, not in the sense that they were good when they were well cooked, eating the kids in time of famine always made him sad which was rare for a backstabbing goblin, no the old goblin liked them because they were naive, innocent and still full of hope that they would not be mistreated for all their life.
