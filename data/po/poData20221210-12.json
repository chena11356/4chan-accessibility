Lines on a crease pattern may be indicated by \u2018mountain\u2019 or \u2018valley\u2019 folds to show how the folds alternate. If you\u2019re particularly skilled at origami, they become useful instructions for building models.

If you do what you like, it will make you happy. If you are happy you are irresistible for women.<br><br>But maybe I got it wrong:<br>Is your question how Origami can hemo to get a girlfriend?

Maybe one of those people has a sister that is looking for a friend and the two if you meet.. who knows? <br><br>Or if this it too vague for you I will give you a step-by-step tutorial how to get a gf with Origami:<br><br>1) Train hard until you can fold a couple of nice things really really fast in a halfway decent quality. You don&#039;t want extremely difficult stuff from a technical point of view, but simple forms, flashy, impressive and beautiful.<br><br>2) Go outside, join parties or discos or other social events. Make a conversation with a nice woman. Tell her you need to go home now, but would like to see her again. Write down your number a give it to her. Give her a brief nod and walk away without further ado.<br><br>3) Wait for her call. If no call comes within the next 4 or five days, repeat step 2. When the call comes invite her to a coffee at a nice bar.<br><br>4) At the bar get into a conversation, ask and listen, don&#039;t talk about yourself too much. Look her deep in the eyes and smile. While doing so, casually play around with some paper or ask the waitress for a block and do something beautiful. Shrug off any compliments, pay up and take her on a walk in the park. <br><br>5) While walking, make something really cool and tell her it came to your mind just now and you have never done this before. Of course she will see through it, but she will like your joke. Make another one and ask her if she likes it. If she says &quot;wow, it&#039;s beautiful&quot; look her in the eye and say some cheesy line like &quot;yeah, I like beautiful things.&quot; And then slowly let your eyes wander between her eyes and her mouth.

On /po/ you can download a car, remember that.<br><br>I can understand your argument to an extent, but on the other hand, there are really obvious ways of safeguarding one&#039;s own finances as an artist in this craft.<br>Limited high-quality print runs provide fans a way to own physical copies of artwork which will retain their value; a coffee table book featuring designs, photos, and artist commentary is one such example of this practice.<br>An artist could also open up an online storefront specializing in supplies, kits, completed works, and/or commissioned works. In this way, a hobby can be a tax-deductible at worst, and a profit generator at best, with minimal costs involved and minimal need to worry about piracy. <br>Let&#039;s not forget the ever-reliable social media/Patreon combo either. Using free platforms to host content, while giving fans an easy way to provide financial support is a bullet-proof strategy when it comes to monetizing a hobby, and it&#039;s why pretty much every artist on the internet does it. In this specific case, it doesn&#039;t matter as much if the art gets shared around, it&#039;s free marketing as long as the artist puts their handle somewhere on the design.<br>People, especially artists and academics, forget that the internet&#039;s main purpose is to allow as many people to share as much information as possible. Failure to adapt to that as an artist is not the internet&#039;s fault. Much like how it would be absurd for an artist to blame his knife over a misplaced cut. Even in a perfect world, where people somehow managed to make papercraft piracy completely impossible, other people would simply make free versions of the design, or go the hand-drawn route (like I do).", "time": 1669718628, "resto": 574188}, {"no": 609198, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)07:07:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p609079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;609079</a><br>And then people wonder why everything is monetized to hell or has restrictive piracy protection.", "time": 1670069255, "resto": 574188}], "last_modified": 1670069255}, {"no": 608668, "now": "11/05/22(Sat)13:31:20", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Fujimoto&#039;s books", "com": "Recently it was the 100th anniversary of Shuzo Fujimoto&#039;s birthday.

Now it&#039;s just all toads, toads, toads, and even now Bobby for example just looks like any other bob-omb except for one tiny difference that&#039;s pretty missable.
