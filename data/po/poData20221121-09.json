For larger models you will need larger or thinner paper, possibly from online shops. Boxpleated models require thin paper, such as sketching paper.

Lines on a crease pattern may be indicated by \u2018mountain\u2019 or \u2018valley\u2019 folds to show how the folds alternate. If you\u2019re particularly skilled at origami, they become useful instructions for building models. A common base fold is usually discernable, all the intermediate details can be worked on from there.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://blog.giladnaor.com/2008/08/folding-from-crease-patterns.html\">https://blog.giladnaor.com/2008/08/<wbr>folding-from-crease-patterns.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.origamiaustria.at/articles.php?lang=2#a4\">http://www.origamiaustria.at/articl<wbr>es.php?lang=2#a4</a><br>", "filename": "origami faq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 762, "h": 762, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1546294889019, "time": 1546294889, "md5": "vKWr7+oITdUBu7bUaypuCw==", "fsize": 163110, "resto": 570368, "capcode": "mod"}], "last_modified": 1546294897}, {"no": 608834, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)08:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Christmas nativity scene", "com": "I would like to start preparing my Christmas nativity scene.<br>Could someone share this book?", "filename": "A-complete-Origami-Nativity", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 601, "h": 849, "tn_w": 176, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1668345103775121, "time": 1668345103, "md5": "GP0oM6KAmEtpQVBF9N0/aQ==", "fsize": 113393, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "christmas-nativity-scene", "replies": 15, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 10, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 608971, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)05:20:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p608965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;608965</a><br>You could have used common sense and created your own link instead of copy/pasting someone else&#039;s.", "time": 1669026008, "resto": 608834}, {"no": 608972, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)05:35:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p608970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;608970</a><br>As someone who doesn&#039;t share anymore this is one of the reasons.

Now it&#039;s just all toads, toads, toads, and even now Bobby for example just looks like any other bob-omb except for one tiny difference that&#039;s pretty missable.
