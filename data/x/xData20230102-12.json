Why did I write something like this?&quot;, and casually throw it away as I was completely devoid of emotions for the next few days.

If you pick &quot;bind to Spirit&quot; there&#039;s free shipping, too. This is great for the people who were asking earlier if anyone can do a summoning for them: they do summoning. There also is a BOGO going on where you can get a spell to go with your new spirit, too. The BoGo ends tonight at Midnight EST, but there will be other freebies listed Jan 1st. <br><br>Spirit suggestions beside the obvious: Nympho (basically a super horny spirit but NOT a succubus), past life lover, any god or goddess you feel connected to, or reverse adoption. <br><br>Spell suggestions: Whatever is in the BoGo (it&#039;s free!), anything that enhances third eye, anything that enhances the ability to perceive spirits, anything that enhances the ability to interact with spirits and general protection and cleaning spells.<br><br>General advice: Shoot for Neutral Arts until you know which way you personally lean. Don&#039;t bother with bridging if you are binding to spirit. Eterna is nice if you know you want to buy a lot of stuff, but if you only want one spirit then don&#039;t bother. <br><br>If you missed the sale, get on their mailing list to be notified of more sales and freebies. New freebies usually go live before noon EST, usually on Mondays. Watch your emails and the main site for discount codes for best prices.

I believe women are made to be more on the naive end of things, this is pretty evident because look at Eve and how easily influenced she was despite knowing God&#039;s direct command. Adam shoulda stuck close to his bitch... but really. We can be so impressionable, like that of a child. We soak and absorb reality like an autistic sponge creature, and the world manifests in such a chaotic manner within our minds. This is why it&#039;s imperative to teach women to value themselves and to grow inner strength and awareness, a shield to combat the inane and nefarious bullshit of this &#039;hellscape&#039;. They require strong father figure / male role model... they require a respect and love and connection of God. But you are right, this world is flipped upside down on truths and lies, though I wouldn&#039;t consider deceived women as being demons who WANT to be deceived. I consider many of them to be lost, victims of a modern age, likely lacking a stable foundation or good self esteem. I believe most hedonistic, unpleasant and misandry-tier women are deeply immersed in self hatred, confusion and pain. <br><br><a href=\"#p33738485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33738485</a><br>Women CAN definitely be immensely psychic and very rife with that potential but as others have responded to you... that&#039;s not necessarily meaning they know wtf they&#039;re doing.

It&#039;s hard to understand how you feel that every single woman is incapable of genuine kindness and morality. Plenty of women want a wholesome, safe and loving world where others can feel safe, especially children. The self interest of many women is directly tied to the interests of others because a good, compassion woman feels innately connected to others. A woman&#039;s life should NEVER be just about her. She wants a reality where humanity can be at peace and strive for beauty and civility. Isn&#039;t a man&#039;s goals and reason for doing what&#039;s right similar?

No one can deny the Japanese stand alone among their fellow Asians with their prodigious and unrivaled cultural output and novel creative expression. Suffering and trauma, in individuals, often result in greater wisdom and spiritual understanding. Everything in this reality is scalar and fractal. It would actually make sense that the Japanese egregore and the psychic impact it received from two nuclear detonations, created the perfect conditions for a kind of spiritual sensitivity that grants some Japanese individuals the ability to more readily receive information from the future.

Chumbley\u2019 to John Power on June 06/21 and asked him to comment on it, with a view to his being quoted in this blog-post. Here is his reply in full from June 07/21:<br><br>\u201cThe idea at one time was that he would be next in line as preceptor, as he did have obvious talents. However I never gave him full initiation or the cult mantra, so it was more of a \u2018probationer\u2019 initiation, so that I could see how he shaped up. Yet he went around telling the world and his uncle that he was something grand. Eventually he cut ties with me with a \u2018Kill the Guru\u2019 ritual [so hence the tradition] then started a pseudo tantrik micro group with Mike Staley of Kenneth Grant\u2019s Typhonian OTO, but soon fell out with him too after the usual ego-maniac attempt to take over. In all of this the only tantrik connection was bookish. He never did any work in the Uttara kaula tradition. Exaggerations and disinformation like this have since been quoted elsewhere and compounded errors. The example I gave you before from \u2018India and the Occult\u2019 by Gorden Dyurdjevic, where a ritual is quoted, he had adapted it from the Tibetan, Chod rite, so not even Indian. Even the quote you\u2019ve sent says that Ranchi is in Uttara Pradesh State, which it is not, but it is in Bihar State, a couple States further south. He had never been out of England, let alone to India, yet is in your quote claiming to be head of a lineage of one of the 5 great Tantrik traditions, when he doesn\u2019t even know where the guru lived who first passed the tradition to a westerner who passed the westernised form to me. The tradition continues in India with a native Indian and any use of the term Paramapraya [guru to the lineage] is again delusional self importance from Chumbley.&quot;", "time": 1672550233, "resto": 33731339}, {"no": 33736546, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:59:20", "name": "P.

I have a few beginner questions I hope you can provide perspective on:<br>1) Should we avoid being surprised when our manifestations become real? Being happy would be normal, but whenever I think about having my thoughts materialize, I always have this thought of being surprised and amazed that it worked, but doesn&#039;t that mean I&#039;m not fully believing in the law?<br>2) Are intrusive thoughts dangerous during manifestation? If I am deep in concentration and an unpleasant thought starts swirling around, is there a risk of contamination towards the manifestation? I would assume magic is dangerous to not handle properly.<br>3) If the true final stage of all this is to reach a point of totally creating your reality, then does that mean that most masters would not share their experiences? If we are supposed to get to a point of not caring what others think, then what are the motives behind sharing our stories? Perhaps this is just a difference of opinion, perhaps I just only find posting about stuff to be worth it to see other&#039;s reactions, and maybe other people just like putting their experiences into a shared pool with fellow manifestors?<br>4) Do you talk to anyone (outside of this board) about your rituals &amp; thinking?

Sometimes I feel like something bad happens outside of my control, but then I realize later it was for the best (this has happened numerous times in different contexts &amp; severity). If I force happenings through manifestations, do I run the risk of scorning this guiding hand?<br><br>- Do you ever worry your manifestations aren&#039;t the right thing and will produce bad outcomes, or is the whole idea that there are no bad outcomes because you can always manifest positive changes? Like, you may summon a monster, but you can just as easily summon a sword to slay it?<br><br>- It feels like a major underlying belief here is that YOU/WE/I are our own gods. If that&#039;s true, then it feels like we can create our own morals. Are there any universal ethics we should adhere to? If someone manifests great powers and begins harming others, isn&#039;t he &quot;allowed&quot; to? It&#039;s his world, no? Or is it more accurate to say we are as powerful as gods, but are not gods, and must adhere to certain godly guidelines? Is this my world where I can do whatever the fuck I want, or is this a sandbox where I can play &amp; have fun but shouldn&#039;t throw sand in other people&#039;s eyes less I get kicked out?

I kept running up the slide and kept falling and slipping (this is analogous to resistance or your limiting beliefs or present circumstance/condition reverting you back to a lower state). No matter how hard I tried I kept slipping and sliding back down but I saw that some of the other kids had done it and absolutely knew that I could as well so I kept trying. There was a point in time when I slipped, fell down violently and got friction burns that dissolve the first layer of flesh. Didn&#039;t matter, I KNEW I was going to get to the top. So I kept trying to run up that fucking slide every time my grandparents took me to that playground until one day I did it, just barely, and almost fell back but managed to hold on to the top of the jungle gym. I was elated and knew that I could repeat it after that without a single doubt in my mind.

People OBSESS like crazy about how the person looks, their physical attributes and neglect the former. You can describe the hot girl you want but you also have to make sure she fulfills the thoughts, feelings and emotions more.

It was a negative manifestation but I think it was a good lesson. I haven&#039;t ever gotten pulled over, let alone a ticket, in 13 years of driving. I guess was going 70 mph down a 55mph limit rural road which I drive on all the time. I never see cops there, didn&#039;t even realize I was speeding, it was pitch dark and the cop showed up out of nowhere, literally from behind a hill going my way. All this is to illustrate how unlikely this is. <br><br>Heading to the city, I could take the highway or the rural road. Google maps said there were multiple speed traps on the highway, and I usually prefer the quieter rural road anyway so I was gonna take that one. Then as I reached the fork in the road where I had to either pick the highway or the other road, I had these strong thoughts of wondering which direction I should pick. I had a feeling in my stomach which I traditionally associated with &#039;going with my gut&#039; telling me to go down the rural road, but also a conflicting feeling that was either in my chest or head telling me to take the highway. I remember specifically thinking that if I stayed calm and went with the stomach feeling, I would &#039;manifest&#039; the right road to take. <br><br>I guess the two lessons learned here is that the &#039;stomach&#039; feeling is the wrong feeling to follow, and that overthinking can fuck you up.

So, yes, it does align with the Old Testament stuff, and elaborated on it. For example, it&#039;s more clear if you study Kabbalah or read Neville that when God introduces himself as &quot;I AM&quot; to Moses, that the phrase is a spell you use, meaning that whenever you say &quot;I am/I&#039;m&quot;, even absent-mindedly, that you invoke God (saying &quot;I am happy&quot; would be blessing yourself, or &quot;I am sad&quot; is a curse upon yourself, hence in the 10 Commandments to &quot;not say the Lord&#039;s name in vain&quot; also means to be careful in how you use &quot;I am&quot;).<br><br>Now, thr New Testament stuff is where I would say to exercise caution. So, I don&#039;t disagree with Neville reading the Bible allegorically, but his stance of it ONLY being allegorical and not historical is where I think he threw the baby out with the bathwater. He never makes an argument for why he thinks it&#039;s not historical, just says that other people disproved Jesus&#039;s existence (which is false, since even atheist scholars acknowledge that there&#039;s a historical Jesus), and in Neville&#039;s latest works I&#039;m pretty sure he says something along the lines of seeing the face of the literal Jesus anyways.<br><br>So yeah, it aligns, just take it both figuratively and literally (like if you were an author and had a story about a boy and a sled, the sled would be a literal sled in the story, but have deeper meaning attached to the sled.

It&#039;s an investment an an astral scam. In other plains, creating these waves of emotion/feeling is a normal thing, and only seems different because you on Earth didn&#039;t experience it. I&#039;m fairly sure that once you&#039;re &quot;hooked&quot; by the light there&#039;s no escaping, except via NDE when they go &#039;this dude ain&#039;t dead yet, send him back&#039;. <br><br>Just to be clear, I&#039;m not saying anything more than the various sources I&#039;ve read.

I&#039;ll check those out too. I hadn&#039;t read through the thread yet when I made that comment. I took the NDE pill ~10 years ago after reading &quot;The Holographic University&quot; by Michael Talbot. So the only big question for me is if the experience is what it presents itself as, or is it some kind of deception or trap? I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;d be able to conclude either one with any degree of certainty though, so I&#039;m very curious what all the supporting evidence and logic is for the trap theory. I&#039;m also trying to keep my own biases in check as someone with trust issues and slightly anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic tendencies.<br><br>I&#039;m skeptical of anyone who asserts overly specific details like archons, greys, reptilians, loosh farming, ultra sci fi machines and what not for too many reasons to get into. However, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re wrong about the basic gist of things. I think most people just don&#039;t well enough understand the concept of symbolism within a holographic/fractal model of consciousness. What I mean is most people take what is experienced in altered states of mind far too literally.<br><br>What you experience when you astral project, remote view, dream, or have an NDE is almost never literally what is appears to be. Our basic 5 senses are stable and well developed. When we sense beyond that, our minds struggle to decode information into something coherent to present our awareness with, and we end up with highly subjective symbolism. This is why it&#039;s not always &quot;a light at the end of a tunnel&quot;, but often it&#039;ll be a bridge, a boat, or a trail through a forest even. It&#039;s your mind presenting an extremely in accurate and subjective approximation of reality to your awareness.<br><br>1/2 I guess", "time": 1672421250, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722852, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33721725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33721725</a><br>turns out your consciousness can do alot when it isn&#039;t bound to a body.", "time": 1672422234, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722886, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:47:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33722714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33722714</a><br>Because of this, it&#039;s also possible much of the &quot;trap&quot; theory is simply the result of subjective projections of common fears and uncertainties. Very understandable ones which I share. Who would ever choose to reincarnate in THIS timeline? Who would choose to be raped to death as a newborn? Is this much suffering really most ideal and efficient for learning and growth? What&#039;s the point, and how can we learn or progress, if we start with no memories each time? They&#039;re valid and important questions with no solid answers, and I think everyone promoting and drawn to the trap theory are likely motivated by similar questions. I know I am.<br><br>So I agree the more more common views on reincarnation simply don&#039;t add up. Though I think most of the more specific, literal, yet fantastical and sensationalist views which often read like sci-fi, while maybe not intentionally dishonest, definitely should not be taken too seriously or literally. Similar to montalk for those familiar. It&#039;s what happens when slightly dumb people are spiritually gifted. They perceive more then most, but aren&#039;t able to understand or process it effectively.<br><br>This is also why I&#039;m a bit skeptical about the &quot;net&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;. There very well may be a system in place serving similar functions, but I&#039;m suspicious of how accurate the net concept is. If one reads about said net, tends to be a slightly gullible person / open to suggestion (a trait universally required for one to be spiritually gifted) then what are they going to see when they astral project? Of course it&#039;ll be a net for them. <br><br>The astral is not the material, where we all more or less see the same apple, the same tree, the same Joe or Sue. You perceive things in highly subjective terms you can understand to some extent.

I&#039;ve had one experience that (for me personally) was complete confirmation that it really is possible for your consciousness to leave your body. The last time I tripped I tried meditating at the peak, and the trip instantly just &quot;turned off&quot;. The visuals, the trippy mindfuck headspace was gone, the body load, all of it stopped instantly. The only way that could happen to me is if my consciousness had separated from my physical, mushroom-addled brain and body. Instead of meditation enhancing the trip as one might expect, the psilocin seemed to help send me into a deeper state of meditation, and this completely overrode the trip. It&#039;s difficult to describe what the experience that replaced the trip felt like, but it was joyful yet very calm and peaceful, not ecstatic or overwhelming. It just felt like absolute stillness, and all my senses could perceive were a pale golden light and a steady drone. As soon as I willed myself back to reality, the trip instantly returned as if I had just returned to my body. <br><br>Weird shit, and I&#039;m hesitant to try and draw more conclusions about what I had experienced or attempt to explain it more. I want to go back though. It also reminds me of a story mentioned in the holographic universe book I mentioned in a previous post. Some Buddhist monk was given 900mcg of acid and all he had to say was &quot;this is nice, but meditation is better&quot;. Now I understand exactly what he meant. That&#039;s how he was able to basically just ignore 900mcg of LSD, that&#039;s why he claimed meditation is better. Deep meditation separates your consciousness from your body, or at least turns off your senses. Which is obvious in hindsight, this is why you&#039;re supposed to focus on a single subject to the exclusion of all else.

Because they only know the existence through craving and self desire which creates karma/kamma (&quot;actions&quot;) which creates new sense experience.<br><br>Actually there is another mode of reality whre you do not &quot;grasp&quot; after sense experience and try to mold and control it to be just the way you want it to be. but instead progressively let go more and more of your forcing things to be a certain way (craving). When you let go completely that is nibbana. It another way of seeing the world. Another mental posture. <br><br>These 2 modes of reality or mental posture are called samsara and nirvana.<br><br>I hope you can see now that nibbana has nothing to do with atheistic death or anesthesia or lack of experience. The mind goes nowhere. It is always there (citta). The only thing is that the citta learns to see the world in a different way. Instead of craving and getting, it just sees things as already perfect. It sees the inherent peacefulness in every experience. It comes from &quot;nothing&quot; and returns to &quot;nothing&quot;. It is silent and peaceful and mysterious. And full of love and compassion.<br><br>If you want to experience first hand this second &quot;letting go&quot; way of reality, then practice jhana. In jhana you progressively let go of gross and subtle levels of activity (craving / formation). For example when you sit down to meditate you are quieting the gross bodily activity. Then when you enter 1st jhana you are quieting the five hindrances. When you enter 2nd jhana there are no more thoughts. Etc etc. Until nibbana.<br><br>You see that letting go is actually beneficial and positive and not scary. It is a process of acclimatization. Like leaving the water in little steps.

Last night tho, idk why I Just said &quot;Fuck it, lets try again&quot; and after about an hour I got to the vibrational stage where everything was vibrating I managed to get out of my body, the weird thing was.. I was completely lucid. It was not that feeling you get in dreams where something feels off. I was overjoyed at the fact that I finally did it. I saw my body sleeping on my bed and the First thing I did was try to grow wings lmao. That didnt work. I tried walking through walls and they felt extremely solid/couldnt do it. I then went into the living room and saw my 2 cats playing on the carpet where they usually play. They both looked at me and hissed and ran away. They looked normal But they had a White smoky outline. I went to the front door of my apartment and I tried opening it. To my surprise it actually worked... This is where im torn about it being a lucid Dream or OBE, because the hallway geometry felt.. Wrong. It looked like it always does But the feeling I got from it was &quot;if I go there, im getting lost and not comming back&quot; closed the door and then I went back to my bed to Have another look at myself But I was sucked in my bed, things went dark and I woke up. When i woke up It was 01:37 at night and I was EXTREMELY HUNGRY. I dont eat at night, never did never Will. But this night I felt like I didnt eat for days.

Suppose he took of and quickly reached an altitude of 200 meters above the ground. Then he engaged autopilot and left the computer stabilize the plane at a vertical speed of exactly zero (meaning the plane should not be flying towards the ground or away from it). Then he left the autopilot on for like 10 hours and went to sleep. If the earth was a globe, when he woke up, he should see that the altitude of the plane was now orders of magnitude higher than 200 meters, even though the vertical speed had been zero all this time.

Well, the plane was flying in a straight line, but since the earth is a globe the trajectory of any straight line starting at any given point on the globe, eventually has to leave the atmosphere and pierce out into space and beyond).<br><br>Obviously this does not sound like reality, intercontinental flights do not have to make constant vertical axis tilt adjusments just to keep a steady altitude.<br><br>Conclusion?

Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

In his shell theorem he demonstrated that there\u2019s nothing to stop astronomic bodies from developing empty cavities. When the astronomer Edmond Halley suggested to Newton that our planet may be hollow, Newton didn\u2019t object. There was nothing in Newton\u2019s theory to counter Edmond Halley\u2019s suggestion.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now that we know that there most likely is a strong repelling force inside all astronomic bodies, there is even less reason to object to such a notion.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The enormous pressure that undoubtedly exists at the core of all astronomic bodies is no argument for a solid core. The pressure inside the walls of a tunnel doesn\u2019t make tunnels collapse. The same is true for any cavity inside our planet.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seismic evidence for a solid core is often used as an argument. However, reconciling seismic data with a solid core is difficult. Using a hollow Earth model is easier. Jan Lamprecht demonstrated this in his work on the subject.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even NASA appears to accept the possibility of hollow planets. According to their own measurements, Jupiter\u2019s core is less dense than its outer layers.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only serious objection to a hollow Earth model is the fact that gravity at the surface of our planet indicates that it must be made up of something extremely dense. The latest suggestion is a super-dense crystal at Earth\u2019s core. This material, which only exists in theory, and no-one has ever been able to produce in a laboratory, has all sorts of fantastic properties. This is all required in order to reconcile observed seismic and gravitational data with current theory.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, there\u2019s a simple way around this.

Public opinion can be manipulated, but in teaching the public how to ask for what it wants the manipulator is safeguarding the public against his own possible aggressiveness. The method of the experimental psychologist is not as effective in the study of public opinion in the broad sense as is that of introspective psychology. To create and to change public opinion it is necessary to understand human motives, to know what special interests are represented by a given population, and to realize the function and limitations of the physical organs of approach to the public, such as the radio, the platform, the movie, the letter, the newspaper, etc. If the general principles of swaying public opinion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific problem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitudes of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others. Group adherence is essential in changing the attitudes of the public. Authoritative and influential groups may become important channels of reaching the larger public. Ideas and situations must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span>", "time": 1672605878, "resto": 33734048}, {"no": 33740245, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)15:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33740220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33740220</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span><br><br>This is public:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The goal of the author in this chapter is to analyse through established psychological principles how torture-based mind control programming is installed and exerts continued control over victims.

Some of the creators of this media, like wachowski brothers, just seem very weird.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more. I thought I accepted myself now that I&#039;m finally at peace with my body, only to feel lost again as spiritual experiences confront me with all sorts of sides of myself that I don&#039;t know how to reconcile. I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore. And although I recall her offer to guide me, I&#039;m reluctant as I fear I&#039;ll be forced to face even more.<br><br>That&#039;s what I get for being dishonest with myself; for being so easily seduced as my contradictions are exposed.", "filename": "serge_and_leena_by_tokio_okt0w0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 533, "h": 710, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672561287536300, "time": 1672561287, "md5": "QBYx8/ImgV0F1BS1XLVKqg==", "fsize": 213325, "resto": 33725319, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33737152, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)03:29:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33725319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33725319</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sexuality is but one small part of who she is.</span><br>Why do people need to downplay sexuality?

Focusing on the breath or a candle are the 2 basic exercises people recommend, it teaches you to &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;observe&quot; which are different from &quot;thinking&quot;, it may take months to snap out of the &quot;thinking&quot; mode for just a second but that sole second is enough to show you that your thinking mind is not you nor your reality, it&#039;s like a radio which plays all the time and you were living with that radio open for most of your life.<br><br><a href=\"#p33699233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33699233</a><br>For me the &quot;observer&quot; focus/mode is when you are not a slave to your thoughts and you are calmer thus you don&#039;t get dragged away by them, while the &quot;focus&quot; focus is the ability to focus on one thing with all your might, I say that those 2 go hand-in-hand and maybe someone could say that they are the same thing: the ability to take a step back from everything, be calm and direct your focus/observing whatever you want.<br><br>Also during my sits I remember how to feel my feelings.

That&#039;s the &quot;focusing focus&quot; you talked about.<br><br>So it all comes down to having a calm mind, and sitting will do this anyway, sit in the dark with no sound or anything to bother you and the thoughts WILL stop, what really helps is if you also incorporate breathwork and physical exercise in your everyday life and if you reduce screen usage (which fills your mind with lots of information), these will help you reach the &quot;no-thought&quot; state faster.<br><br>I remember sitting down to do &quot;Focus on breath&quot; meditation and various memories and bad feelings popped up, I ignored them and returned to the breath, then thoughts like &quot;You are ignoring what&#039;s important!&quot; popped up and I became anxious that I was using meditation to run away from my problems but I knew that I wasn&#039;t really doing that and that was just my overthinking mind not wanting to stop. Most of our problems are just thoughts in our minds and are not real at all.<br><br>So just sit and focus on the breath or on the moment, or on your body, don&#039;t think too much about it, thoughts and words are not everything, feeling is also important, feeling this moment here now.", "time": 1672448245, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33728447, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:17:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33724099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33724099</a><br>What type of stuff do you usually see??

I think because they have similar roles in their respective pantheon and are more or less major deities in their pantheon that they could be the same.</span><br>I think that&#039;s partially true. I&#039;ve come to understand it that a lot of the entities we interact with when communing with a deity tend to be more like &#039;titles&#039;, for lack of a better terminology, than individuals. Most gods tend to embody fundamental concepts and are woven into an egregor of persona by the observations of man, but that&#039;s simply all that we&#039;re observing, not necessarily the totality of the the entity we&#039;re interacting with. So that&#039;s to say, these entities we commune with are made up of &#039;multiple&#039; deities from various mythologies /pantheons because the inherent nature of what we&#039;ve collectively deified is a specific facet of them. That said, I suspect there&#039;s an affinity you could try and quantify an entity with as &#039;more Zerus than Ares&#039; or perhaps &#039;definitively Odin&#039; if an entity primarily (but not entirely) embraces that aspect of themselves. When viewed in this light, it also helps reconcile a lot of the seemingly schizophrenic behavior they exhibit in mythologies because there&#039;s more than one entity embodying that aspect in the story and the nature of conflating the deified title with the essence of being tends to lead to the appearance of a somewhat schizophrenic-looking behavior pattern. I also suspect many of them feel very misunderstood by this &#039;typecasting&#039;, but that likely varies on an individual basis. As a disclaimer, this is my current working understanding after a lot of work with a lot of &#039;gods&#039; but ultimately still filtering through my body&#039;s perception so not everything may be perfect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33728021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33728021</a><br>Young brunette woman with blue eyes.

The roulette is arguably the easiest game to cheat using remote viewing. You just have to guess if the ball will go on red, black or green color. In my experience, in big casino roulette are always situated in the most noisy place, making it really difficult to concentrate. In las vegas there are always DJ playing near roulette game. also, the time to chose your color seems tailored to just not be enough to remote view. With enough training you can still get it to work. But there is the weird part. I personally can get consistently 8 good bet out of the 10 first before running out of stamina and going back to a 50% chance. But each time I start winning too much, the roulette &#039;cancel&#039; the game. It still spin, goes where I predicted but then it spin again and only the second spin count. And each time the second spin isn&#039;t my bet. I know I sound like a schizo addicted to gambling but if you tried it you&#039;ll get the same result as I do. Something really weird is going on.

Instead of a killing songbirds for their meager harvest of meat, it&#039;s a continuous harvest of golden eggs. Gold is normally pretty hard to find, but if you genetically engineered a golden goose and figured out how to breed them to not only be numerous, but lay larger golden eggs more frequently, that&#039;s closer to what it is. Golden geese require a special sauce though, one that can&#039;t be created, otherwise they&#039;re just animate earth golems walking around, eating and shitting everywhere, and sending profits into the red.<br><br>It requires capture of consciousness essence, or what we recognize as souls. The beings can&#039;t travel high enough to collect as much as they please, being of lower vibration. However, souls can travel very far, enough to be ensnared for harvest. Sometimes a few particles sink to the abyss. Once ensnared it&#039;s very difficult to seek release from those chains. The bodies are engineered to be harvested from. Those energy centers that keep us alive separate what is supposed to be a singular energy (oneness?). They&#039;re also very localized to specific locations with specific flow patterns for easier harvest.<br><br>Most exercises related to energy work involve restarting a flow to reunite separated energies into one component, and decondition compartmentalization. This destabilizes the body (kundalini?). Under unity, cultivate vitality to sustain OBE state, from physical reality to metaphysical reality, and remastery and rediscovery of higher existence.

Almost every longitudinal study that has followed schizophrenics and other people who have experienced psychosis for upwards of 20+ years have found that those who were able to get off and stay off of antipsychotic drugs had profoundly higher rates of functional recovery compared to the people who stayed on the drugs, which, despite immediate or short-term benefit, can result in more frequent relapses and more disability. The schizophrenics who didn&#039;t take meds even had better outcomes than the people with just bipolar or other &quot;milder&quot; disorders who stayed on antipsychotics. <br><br>Additionally, psychosis has usually been thought of as episodical, and there have been numerous projects and studies that have tried to track (or argue for) the benefit of &quot;letting the psychosis play its course&quot; as a strategy that can result in better outcomes compared to episodes that were crudely halted by the traumatic encounter of hospitalization and medication. And from the beginning of theorizing, going back to Freud&#039;s time, psychosis has long been understood as a process that arches towards a definite end that becomes a new normal for the subject, where what we take for visible symptoms are the mind&#039;s attempt at its own cure.

You will be persecuted, perhaps even tortured and killed and you must be willing to accept that. <br>Physically you must be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect you and your family and that may involve fighting, living off the land, or constantly being on the run.

It will get less uncomfortable as meeting goes on, but there will still be things both of you want to address but are too nervous/uncomfortable bring up. I suggest planning ahead on how to address any a problems that may be difficult to communicate and bring up in the moment. I think if you plan on how you will communicate things and how you will go about bringing them up beforehand, this meeting to have much better outcome. No matter how the reunion goes, some sort of closure and conclusion will be reached regarding you and Y&#039;s relationship and past. Try to relax and not overthink things in the moment and do your best to stay in the present while having the meeting, as well as being attentive to how Y is feeling. I think this meeting has a chance of going quite well if you can achieve that balanced of being relaxed/not overthinking yet still be strategic with your words and attentive at the same time. It&#039;s hard to achieve in nerve-racking reunions like this, but its definitely possible. I think the meeting could very well either strengthen or weaken the relationship depending on how smoothly the meeting goes, and luckily you both seem to want to put effort I making sure things go well, so I don&#039;t think you should worry too much, just think about my earlier suggestions. I hope this helps! I wish you luck on your meeting! <br><br>Thankyou for your reading btw!

The next two things happened in an order that I can&#039;t remember, though I suspect it was in this order.<br>1.

I laid in bed for a while, processing everything that happened, then suddenly felt pins and needles all over my body, and became paralyzed. I possibly could have fought it and broken the paralyzation, but I was too focused on the sounds of thunder and flashes of white light peaking in through my window and door way, all the while what sounded like a kid&#039;s voice repeated the words &quot;Hey, listen1&quot; three times (sounding vaguely like a certain fairy from the Legend of Zelda)<br>The light show was trying to unnerve me, as the light that was coming through my doorway was shaping itself in such a way as if my door was opening letting in even more light and an implied &quot;something else&quot; along with it. I was smart enough to figure out that was just a trick of the light though, and so I regained my ability to move. I wasn&#039;t scared, but a bit uneasy.<br>After all that I didn&#039;t go back to sleep and just thought about it all. Especially what the girl said.<br>&quot;You don&#039;t actually think that do you?&quot;<br>This could imply about 2.5 things.<br>1.) She was basically implying I wouldn&#039;t have asked that on my own and that my sister put me up to it.<br>2a.) The concept of time holds no meaning. The only reason we have time on planet earth is due to the rotational spin of the globe. 1 day is 24 hours and 1 year is 365 days through pure chance. How does one keep track of what year it is on another planet, much less in a dream world where time can behave differently and people can dream a year or even more in just the short timespan of a night.<br>2b.)

I repair certain machines for work, and often have to talk on the phone with a partner while I do it for help/advise. In this dream I was in a government propaganda center working on a machine there. I could not for the life of me understand what the fuck my partner on the phone was saying. I couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong with the machine either, and nothing was making sense. This was very disturbing to me as I do this job every day and I&#039;m usually very good at it. (I&#039;m a service technician and travel all over to many different types of facilities to fix these machines). After awhile of this I decided to call in sick for the rest of the day and left the propaganda center. When I got back to my house a man who was pale yellow and looked sick as fuck handed me a note with some sort of conspiracy on it. I don&#039;t remember what the note said. What I do remember is that he was shot by an unknown marksman right after that. I ducked down for cover but was shot as well and woke up.<br><br>My wife had a nightmare about being kidnapped and sold as a sex slave on the darknet that same night. A &quot;special forces&quot; style team broke into our house and kidnapped her. She was put into a shipping container type device with other women. The pretty ones were going to be sold as sex slaves, and the ugly ones were having their organs harvested.<br>My best friend texted me the following morning before I woke up. He has a paradontal cyst (look it up if you dont know what it is)<br>That night it was extremely inflamed and he was suffering. He had texted me several times during the night about this to my astonishment that morning waking up. I did not see these messages that night as I sleep with my phone on airplane mode. He was also suffering the whole night. This is very abnormal for him as it usually never bothers him to the point he can&#039;t sleep.<br>Don&#039;t know what the FUCK was going on in the spirit world that night bros", "time": 1672290119, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711266, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:26:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1672291608, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711401, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i fingered my ass while in a dream moments before i got actually lucid and it felt great.", "time": 1672293322, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711652, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:02:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707440</a><br>That&#039;s a nice point of view anon, I can see where you&#039;re coming from.

Make sure it&#039;s made out of a formula that works with your skin. I like Urban Decay Stay Naked for foundation. Learn color correcting for when you have break outs. Green over red, concealer, and powder followed by your foundation then powder and setting spray. Don&#039;t wear too much makeup though or else you&#039;ll look bad. Neutral colors are best for lips, eyes, and cheeks. Skip contouring unless you are good at it. Skip false lashes unless you&#039;re in full glam. Workout at least 3x a week, don&#039;t skimp out on either lifting or cardio, both are important. Make sure you stretch too. If you want gains, try slow cardio such as biking or stair stepping. For general weight loss take on a treadmill or elliptical. Don&#039;t fad diet, make lifestyle changes that you will actually stick to. Learn to dress for your body type and shape and make sure your clothes actually fit. Build a staple wardrobe and have accent pieces. Too many clashing patterns and colors will draw too much attention. For skincare, sometimes the harsher stuff makes your skin worse (i.e. tretinoin destroyed my skin.) I use Olay gentle cleanser and their classic moisturizer. If you have acne some 2.5% benzoyl peroxide is going to be your best friend. Apply that before your moisturizer at night.

Why am i a weirdo for pointing out that a lot of important people on history and in current times turn out to be high level freemasons. Freemasons seem to obsessed with hidden knowledge, so why do people attack the messenger rather than the freemasons themselves.

Why is this always the case?<br><br>People will attack every day religious people for being religious, but not people on positions of power who appear to be taking part in weird rituals.

Why attack regular people but not them. They have more influence over us, so if they believe in some weird occult beliefs, it affects us more than some guy down the street.<br><br>It&#039;s very odd that people are not capable of understanding and addressing this. Why do politicians, wealthy, famous, powerful people get a pass?<br><br>People will defend these individuals more than their conspiracy theorist uncle.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer\u2019s suicidal automatic machines. There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart. The man\u2019s crime is different from other crimes\u2014for it makes even crimes impossible.</span><br>~G. K.

The Vatican Library alone holds books that are priceless, many of which have never been publicly catalogued for security reasons (the Vatican has private, highly secure records of their assets such as these. The assets reported publicly are only a tiny fraction of this organization\u2019s true wealth which is greater than the finances of all the world\u2019s billionaires combined). Beneath the Vatican Library are secret vaults with treasures such as priceless art confiscated during the crusades and the World Wars (the Vatican shared the treasures confiscated from wealthy Jewish families with the Nazis, for instance). There are vaults dedicated to holding jewel-encrusted icons, gems, and priceless artifacts from the beginning of time, because the Vatican has a huge collector of ancient statuary and jewelry. Cups, jewels and golden idols from Mesopotamia and Babylon share space with treasures from the reigns of the Pharoahs (many of the earliest raids on the tombs of the pharaohs by Egyptians years before archeologists began exploration caused the empty tombs that were often found; these artifacts were often sold to wealthy Vatican representatives over the years who were highly interested in collecting them for spiritual as well as investment purposes). Wealth and treasures from every great civilization are stored in these secret, highly secure vaults that only the privileged few are allowed to know even exist, much less to enter. The physical wealth these represent could buy the world\u2019s greatest corporations several times over, but this is not where the day-to-day income comes into the Vatican. Instead, there are other, darker sources.

He got scared and left. If he would have told me that without me seeing it I would not have believed him.<br><br>Still, even after securing the sub floors, self leveling the floors, and installing new quiet hard flooring, we still here distinct sounds of someone walking around upstairs when literally no one is there.

Something that is different than what you normally feel. The numbness is practiced, and with intentional thought you can heal that pain, know it&#039;s origin, remove it from yourself. But it is not something that happens in immediacy. If you want to be a person, you need to go where people are. You need to learn how to become one of them; talk to them, understand them. Practice social nicety because it&#039;s what can get you to that place, where you can be a person. Kindness may seem to you like bullshit, but what it really is is just an unspoken respect that people have for one another. We all deal with the shitstains of life, but we have to work together to make the future better and ourselves better. If we stagnate we become nothing, but honestly it&#039;s more difficult to become nothing than to become something. Even when you are doing things that you normally do you are learning something, and if you&#039;re not you should respect yourself enough to appraoch challenges and seek them out. Find things that you can conquer and follow through. Become a person. It&#039;s as easy as just doing it, because it&#039;s what you already are.

The &quot;real&quot; reality and this one aren&#039;t that different. The major difference is that in the real reality we&#039;re in the far distant future. Don&#039;t ask me how far, I really don&#039;t know. I do know that earth isn&#039;t doing so well. We had a few different space colonies and even managed intergalactic space travel. The issue we started to run into is that we evolution began to rapidly change us outside of Earth. So when we would be in contact with each other we had become so alien it was hard to fathom. A lot of the mythical creatures you see are merely just future versions of ourselves. Greys, bigfoot, dogmen etc. Genetic manipulation became very prevalent for us. But pure humans, ones untampered, are extremely rare and considered precious. The reason is, we can easily adapt to new environments. But there are only a few of us left. There&#039;s a &quot;second earth&quot; which is basically very similar to our earth and solar system we established on the Perseus Arm. It&#039;s basically a 1:1 replica of early earth pre 22nd Century (you&#039;re not there sorry) sometimes they take a few of these poor bastards and establish them here.<br><br>So where are we? We&#039;re in basically what is a Dyson sphere. I can&#039;t speak for all of you, but you probably were greatly injured to the point no amount of cybernetics, DNA manipulation (ironically because of your pure DNA that&#039;s a blessing), and/or any other tech could give you a comfortable life. They throw you into the sim which is also beneficial to them. Why? Because we&#039;re basically what humanity has been trying to build forever. The synthesis between A.I. and humanity, a god built in our image that is benevolent toward itself. You live out your sim over and over, feeling powerless with little control, but your true power is something you&#039;re completely unaware of. In the grand scheme, we unconsciously make big human choices behind the scenes.

Would like to explore more on that.</span><br>Well I looked into a bit. There&#039;s this guy called Jason Slot who is big into mycology and fungal genomics. They compared genomes of mushrooms that produce psilocybin and looked at where they occured. Based on that, they made two conclusions.<br><br>1. The psilocybin in mushrooms came through a horizontal gene transfer. That means rather than inherited, as we do, the &quot;idea&quot; of producing psilocybin was communicated peer to peer.<br><br>2. Those magic mushrooms typically occur in places with high insect density. In these insects psilocybin seems to dampen hunger. So the theory is that they developed psilocybin to not get eaten. <br><br>I think all of this kind of ties into my idea.
