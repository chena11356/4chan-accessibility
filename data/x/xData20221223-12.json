Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers.

Two big things that stand out here are sexuality and temptation. Addiction can be a big thing with the devil as well, it can be easy to over indulge during a hardship like this. To focus on the sexuality and temptation, balance is key here as indicated by the strength. Moving on can be a big part of healing from this, this does involve sex and flings frequently. The temptation to form a new emotional relationship too quickly is something you need to remain strong and balanced in. As does sexuality, sleeping with others is a common way to move on, this is fine as long as you don&#039;t over do it. <br><br>The key of strength is balance and inner discipline.

Considering that it is clarifying and the primary reading revolves around balance so much I would suggest being mindful of balance here.

Where am I? etc) &amp; a couple of affirmations in the PRESENT tense as though I already have it &amp; work out the details over a few days. After I feel satisfied with the scrip &amp; affirmations I&#039;ll begin to repeat &amp; reaffirm my desire by reading &amp; writing the script &amp; affirmations over &amp; over again FEELING the FEELING of the wish fulfilled &amp; living FROM the end. I&#039;ll also record them in my own voice &amp; play them on repeat. Usually I&#039;ll also make songs in Garage Band by taking an ambient track &amp; just copy + pasting the voice recordings several times overlayed on the music. I&#039;ll listen the songs throughout the day when doing passive activities that make me want to zone out like when I get ready in the morning, when I make food, when I work out &amp; when I drive, etc. You get the idea. I also normally meditate daily &amp; once I have memorized the script &amp; affirmations along with their flow, cadence &amp; FEELING I will visualize them in my daily morning meditation &amp; just really vividly get into them. Usually 2 or 3 weeks go by &amp; then it will have become an imprinted memory meaning that I can recall the image &amp; feeling at any given moment throughout the day, doesn&#039;t matter what I&#039;m doing or in the middle of. This is when I know that I am on the right track &amp; that it is working. After a month goes by I simply re-read &amp; re-write &amp; visualize in a meditation session once every other day then I drop it.

You have to, judging by the placements for the event under consideration, isolate the particular matters you are concerned about from both the chart and the real life situation, and then apprehend the particular manifestation of that matter in this instance and identify the features unique to it. You must both draw a commonality between this instance and other instances of the exact same placement, as well as rationally distinguish this kind of situation from other placements concerning the same sort of matter.<br><br>In the distant past long before astrology was &quot;settled&quot;, the planets presumably had no names, or at the very least not descriptive ones that denoted any symbolism to use. They looked up at the cosmos and charted what they saw without any inkling of what it meant. At some point, some people noticed that certain things happened when certain cosmological objects were in particular spots in space. They investigated the link between human psychology and cosmological placements and eventually were able to associate aspects of human behavior with influences astrological bodies were apparently exerting.<br><br>They deduced that the body known as Mercury seemed to be affecting the particular ways people rationally think and communicate; and looking at the zodiac signs, the influence seemed to come out most emblematically in Gemini, who are known for thinking and speaking miles ahead of everyone else, and who seem to find their life&#039;s fulfillment in these activities.<br><br>The system established early on that every astrological body around Earth must have an influence upon the beings upon it. That only leaves the question of what each one does, ascertained through intense study: not of your textbooks, but of your case studies: astrology as a science is exegesis; it&#039;s not an &quot;art&quot; where meaning&#039;s created.", "time": 1671728415, "resto": 33663606}, {"no": 33664941, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:02:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33664922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33664922</a><br>he does get mad, but he calmed down with the years<br>his conversation style is pretty cold with &quot;serious&quot; irony as humor<br>not sure what you mean by sex pest", "time": 1671728531, "resto": 33663606}, {"no": 33664958, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:05:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33664941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33664941</a><br>jupiter in scorpio, so I came up in my head that maybe he might sex too much. but again this might come out more as a youth, but jupiter can give way to excess of many more variations for good or bad, usually with food if you google it so in reverse, he might be little on the fat side too. is there something he&#039;s really really really into? and if not, is there a certain food stuff he just has to have? obsessive thoughts?", "time": 1671728725, "resto": 33663606}, {"no": 33665008, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:18:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33663614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33663614</a><br>Mars in Capricorn is an exaltation, which is an enhancement of the power of the planet in that sign.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put.

It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions.

No one really knows exactly how and why it happens though.

You can have proper outlets for stress without jacking off. The key to any kind of success is finding a balance in life, but occasionally feeling sexual urges that for whatever reason feel impossible to dispell without some kind of action it&#039;s better to rub one out than end up frustrated and dysfunctional. If you end up back on porn and sucked into a cycle like that then you have a negative association problem as well as impulse control issues in that regard. It&#039;s said mindfulness meditation can help with that, the monkey mind as it were.<br><br><a href=\"#p33664404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33664404</a><br>The point was simply that anything you are able to derive true value from isn&#039;t a waste. If you can satisfy your appetites and vent stress and frustration otherwise then that&#039;s fine too, but feeling ashamed about masturbating is fucking retarded(see<a href=\"#p33661643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33661643</a>). That&#039;s just feeling bad because some one told YOU too since THEY said it&#039;s bad, so try to think for yourself. Every time a vegan tells me eating meat is bad, shameful, or immoral I buy a steak and enjoy it twice as much. There&#039;s not proof that a normal or moderate amount of masturbation is unhealthy or even totally lacking in benefits since it helps lower stress levels and engages the sympathetic nervous system. So if you can get to the feed, breed, and then rest and digest state of mind and body without masturbation then fine if a few minutes occasionally jerking off helps then that&#039;s fine too. Whatever helps and is effective for YOU is what works, but if you&#039;re doing something for reasons proven to be gobbeldygook then you ARE wasting time.

What you should take away is once again, the fact that we are PLANNING our lives and that synchronicities aren&#039;t random. Synchronicity happens when your spirit guide pretty much steps in and says &quot;No, go this way instead of going that way&quot; because this is the way you need to go to stay on track of fulfilling your purpose an the reason you were even born in this first place. Your guides stay near you to keep you on track that way we all don&#039;t end up as killers or as rich famous people like we&#039;d all naturally want to. Synchronicities aren&#039;t just random occurrences, there is ALWAYS someone on the other side pulling strings for you. You are NEVER alone in this life, your guide or guides know every last thought you have, everything you say, do, eat, touch, hear, see, smell. Your guides know everything. One day You will even be a guide but you haven&#039;t got there yet. What you should take away from something like this is that absolutely everything down to where a crumb lands on the floor is predestined and predetermined. Nothing happens by chance or coincidence. Everything happens exactly the ways its supposed to happen. So Franz Ferdinand being assassinated was supposed to happen in order for the natural chain events that transpired afterwords to transpire.

I would go days without eating, for fear that I would see him, staring around the corner while I made a sandwich.I stopped leaving my room. I became a recluse, only leaving my apartment to buy groceries. And then came the day that I saw him. Standing in the aisle at Walmart, examining the candy section. I was stunned. Floored, even. He turned to me, and opened his mouth. I don&#039;t remember what exactly happened. All I knew was that I couldn&#039;t let him deliver his mocking diatribe.I couldn&#039;t let him gnome me. Next thing I remember, I&#039;m standing in the cutlery aisle, soaked in blood. At my feet lies the corpse of the &quot;gnome&quot; - an innocent ten year old boy, clad in green.

When you get to the more occult gnostic teachings it is revealed that since the creator god is bad so is his whole creation, and the gnostic enlightment is the cultivation of sublime hatred against creator and creation and a burning desire to destroy it all and manifest the burning dark light of anti creation. Why do you think the early church fathers rebuked them. What rites did certain gnostic groups perform. How did they worship the snake in the garden of eden. If creation is bad then following commandments that preserve creation and life is also bad, and going against life and creation is good. this is where you get gnostic antinomianism and satanism, also the seed of Sabbatean Frankism and the idea that to save creation you must sin as much as possible and do horrible things because you are going against the demiurge by doing so. The truth of gnosticism lies in worshipping lucifer and joining him in a war against the whole of creation including your own soul&#039;s connection to it and others.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 crying about muh beautiful Sophia</span>", "filename": "1671735226113", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 528, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1671735283246390, "time": 1671735283, "md5": "KeHCSrknJTjd93JrKu8JTg==", "fsize": 210744, "resto": 33665430}, {"no": 33665506, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:54:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33665430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665430</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Demiurge to them is god of other religions</span><br>nope<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gnostics think the god of Christianity is demiurge</span><br>nope<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sophia says \u201cdemiurge bad\u201d</span><br>nope<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sophia worshipped by Gnostics (I think)</span><br>nope<br><br>get better material jew faggot", "time": 1671735298, "resto": 33665430}, {"no": 33665512, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:56:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33665505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665505</a><br>you have no idea what you are talking about", "time": 1671735370, "resto": 33665430}, {"no": 33665518, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:57:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33665430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665430</a><br>Gnosticism incorporates neoplatonism&#039;s conception of God.
