In my specific dream it was a man with purple hair shaped not unlike Spamton’s, and a yellow plaid jacket and green plaid pants. The tie was like blue or something, also plaid. He would approach AGGRESSIVELY trying to sell a product, and when we turned him down he pulled out a needle and started stabbing at each of us. And we ran.

Suffering approaches and reveals itself as the possibility of the denial of will; but the will rejects it, in that it destroys the body, the manifestation of itself, in order that it may remain unbroken. But if a human being was ever restrained from committing suicide by purely moral motives, the inmost meaning of this self-conquest was this: “I will not shun suffering, in order that it may help to put an end to the will to live, whose manifestation is so wretched, by so strengthening the knowledge of the real nature of the world which is already beginning to dawn upon me, that it may become the final quieter of my will, and may free me for ever.” (Schopenhauer)</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The will to life, then, consists of a never ending vacillation between anxiety and boredom.

Sex also offers escape. But all of these distractions are only temporary. Songs come to an end; we must eventually turn away from paintings; sexual acts can’t go on forever.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;You might think suicide would be an option, but surprisingly Schopenhauer councils against it, seeing suicide as “a form of aggression and quite specifically an assertion of self-will.” In suicide there is no escape from suffering, but the aggravation of it, as the suicide must anxiously will him or herself to commit the act in the first place.</span>', 'filename': '1592061217252', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 1280, 'h': 950, 'tn_w': 125, 'tn_h': 92, 'tim': 1670830977084168, 'time': 1670830977, 'md5': '0mUb5m/bDwAb1Y26CqE3Vw==', 'fsize': 352791, 'resto': 33588836}, {'no': 33589040, 'now': '12/12/22(Mon)02:43:59', 'name': 'Autolycus', 'com': '<span class=""quote"">&gt;The only real escape comes through turning against the will to life through asceticism.

When we come to realize that no-thing is ultimately real or important, then the chains that bind us are slackened and we find ourselves melting away into the buzzing backdrop that is the universe, feeling no separation, no distinction between ourselves and all the other manifestations that arise out of the noumena.

I literally feel like a ghost lately, people come to my house, thaye feel like hearing neighbours from other house, or hearing someone having a phone call while you are waking up, or hearing a TV without seeing it, and me this erratic waving of forced sympathy, and the inner schizo grudge, ego validation while they talk, handbook ghost behavior, remnants of energy that keeps stubbornly repeating, they are guests and me the territorial ghost that moves around the walls, looks around confused, but I feel like te invasor sometimes. Lately I feel nothing for people, they just exist on my head on all its natural and vibrant conscious, thats why the ghost analogy, I cant interact with them just perceive them.

However, ixiptla were usually selected from among captive warriors, and the chosen individual was bathed and ceremoniously cleansed for the role that he was to undertake.[29] For the next year he lived like a god, wearing expensive jewelry and having eight attendants.[30] The young man also was dressed in the likeness of the god and people on the streets would worship him as such when encountered.[29] &quot;For one year he lived a life of honor,&quot; the handsome young man &quot;worshipped literally as the embodiment of the deity&quot;.[30] During the last 20 days before being sacrificed, the ixiptla had their appearance transformed back to that of a warrior. &quot;He had been a warrior who was captured, and he ended his life as a warrior.&quot;', 'time': 1670803161, 'resto': 33585932}, {'no': 33586186, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)19:00:22', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33586178"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33586178</a><br>He would then be wed to four young women, also chosen in advance and isolated for a full year and treated as goddesses.

During the feast where he was worshipped as the deity he personified, he climbed the stairs to the top of the temple on his own where the priests seized him, a time in which he proceeded to symbolically crush &quot;one by one the clay flutes on which he had played in his brief moment of glory,&quot; and then was sacrificed, his body being eaten later.[30] The young man would approach this sacrifice willingly, as being sacrificed in this manner was a great honor. &quot;Sacrificial victims mounted the bloody steps of the pyramid with dignity and pride.[29] &quot;The sacrifice itself marked the end of the drought.[26] Immediately after he died a new victim for the next year&#039;s ceremony was chosen.
