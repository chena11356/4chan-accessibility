These can be draining to those who interact with you too often and, thus make those who had once interest in you, decide it\u2019s not worth it anymore.<br><br>I see certain aspects of you that can be considered too harsh or tomboy-ish, although not necessarily always in a good light. You may want to soften up your personality a bit, or at the very least, be more careful of how you communicate with those you have an interest in. <br><br>It might benefit you to find women who are more traditionally feminine and get advice on how to be more appealing on your mannerisms and the way you take care of your appearance. More than anything it seems like you don\u2019t enjoy makeup as much, but if such girls taught you about it, you\u2019d catch the attention of more men.", "filename": "120-solomon-joseph-solomon-1860-1927-the-judgement-of-paris-1891", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 519, "h": 736, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676529410665195, "time": 1676529410, "md5": "dNnNWLZnt+/P33AJdy7seg==", "fsize": 107603, "resto": 34099508}, {"no": 34100348, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:38:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34100266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34100266</a><br>I am not a psychologist anon, might be best if you seek professional help, there&#039;s a phone at the top of the board iirc.", "time": 1676529490, "resto": 34099508}, {"no": 34100382, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:45:30", "name": "OldHelp", "com": "<a href=\"#p34099878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099878</a><br>Not going to lie, I tried but these spreads are not real clicking with me.

If you sin there are consequences, not because God is punishing you, but because you punish yourself. This is why you must try your very best to overcome sin, which Christ will help you in doing. My point is that you&#039;re wondering why God did not help you, but the reason he did not help you is because you probably didn&#039;t heed to his commandments in the first place.

Can I ask, have you ever really tried getting involved with Christ? I don&#039;t just mean simple prayers, but truly seeking and following his will through deep prayer, fasting, repenting, confession, and doing your best to cut out sins from your life? These things do not all come easily and at once, but instead you will naturally change with help of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>I challenge you, put your head to the floor, humble yourself before God, confess every sin you can think of, ask for the blessing of repentance and to be blessed with the Holy Spirit, talk to him with a humble heart and he will guide you.

Just like normie communication is marred by the normie&#039;s compulsive status-signalling wisecracking, lesser directors will cling to clich\u00e9s in every aspect of movie-making because midwits feel competent and professional when they&#039;re abiding by clich\u00e9s. Lynch is a revered household name now so everyone respects him but he&#039;s the kind of guy whose movies make unsophisticated people go &quot;lol what is he even doing?&quot; <br><br>And what he&#039;s doing is simply following his bliss. He has no middlebrow inner critic forcing him to conform his vision to er &quot;social expectations&quot; (i.e. &quot;autism&quot;), he will not edit a scene until it looks &quot;normal&quot; but until it *feels right*, and every true artist knows what *feels right* means. (And this is what will ever elude the hack.) And that&#039;s why his movies strike one, yes, as pure, and you&#039;re probably right that this purity of expression probably reflects a purity of character to some degree.<br><br>(This is probably why pick-up artists are terrible dressers.)<br><br>Otherwise yes I get the same feeling, I&#039;m actually pretty sure he&#039;s from some elite bloodline or another, but he seems to be a genuine artist whose life revolves around getting in the zone and doing his thing, and he seems like a good guy.

This can be accomplished via a variety of different methods but the one I will be suggesting here involves physical cleanliness (showers, bathing, etc.) along with a practice of daily prayer for protection. The specific deity (or deities) you pray to are unimportant, so long as you pray regularly and with fervor. You would do well to pray at night before sleep and upon awaking every single day. If this notion repulses you, do it anyway. Disgust with holy names and artifices are a symptom of advanced spiritual attack. Disregard are pray.<br><br>The next step is developing a daily banishing practice. There are several formats and rituals for banishing and most of them are equally reliable and useful at both cleaning your sphere of influence as well as pushing spiritual attachments away from your subtle bodies. As a starter banishing, I recommend the LBRP from the Golden Dawn system. It is effective and there are a plethora of how-to&#039;s on line for you to follow.<br><br>The next step is developing a daily meditation practice. Meditation should be done after banishings. You must learn to distinguish your own chaotic thoughts from exterior thoughts that have been imprinted upon your mind. This will help you regain agency and cut the puppet strings that the spirit is using to manipulate you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont.</span>", "time": 1676500024, "resto": 34097034}, {"no": 34097177, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:30:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34097084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34097084</a><br>OP is just starting to notice things so.

The basic gist I would like you to understand is that hauntings are never positive, no matter how much the spirit involved would like you to believe so.<br><br>Instead, I will be helping you understand how they work so you can better deal with and remove them. Spirits are intelligent constructs that must be tethered to an item, person, or idea in order to remain linked to a person long enough to effect them. Because of this tethering or &quot;sympathetic link&quot;, once you have determined the medium that the spirit is inhabiting, you will be able to directly disrupt the spirit via that medium.<br><br>These mediums can be difficult to detect without divinitory aids or strong intuition, so if it is not apparent what the spirit is inhabiting that is okay.

For some people (mostly women), the incarnated spirit is a lower elemental spirit that is working through its first attempt at ascending through the spheres. To make this more understandable: lower spirits want to inarnate up to transcend, higher spirits want to incarnate down to experience. Sometimes these lower spirits aren&#039;t up for the challenge of a human life and eject prior to the human&#039;s death. When this occurs, the spirit that departed the living human being is replaced by a spirit that has both the know-how and the strength to pull itself into the pilot seat. Oftentimes, these are spirits that are otherwise not allowed to properly incarnate. Read: qlippothic shells or their like.<br><br>As to what can break the spirits hold, there are a few ways to induce this effect: severe trauma, unspeakably evil acts that are contrary to the spirit, and a magician knowing the &quot;True Name&quot; of the spirit and pulling it out of the body. Doing this to someone intentionally is cosmically the equivalent of killing your entire family and wearing their skin. It&#039;s about the worst thing you could do in this or any other universe. It&#039;s worse than what the archons do, at least to my knowledge, and that is pretty bad.", "time": 1676548650, "resto": 34097034}, {"no": 34101396, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)07:08:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34101369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34101369</a><br>To elucidate further, understand that the Spirit of a person is the part of you that experiences and is the eternal I AM. It is the eternal watcher. Without it, a human being can still live but will function as an organic automaton subject entirely to the whims of this deterministic universe. This situation doesn&#039;t happen very often because there is no shortage of spirits willing to take over the controls of a unspirited human.<br><br>To express it even clearer: human beings are biological machines that are piloted by spirits (which are multidimensional in incorporeal entities). The mind, or psyche, is the meeting point of the spirit and the body. Without a spirit the psyche will still be present, but diminished, as there is no animating principle or &quot;spark&quot;. Spirits literally guide these biological creatures toward exaltation. If a human transcends, the spirit has succeeded in purifying the egoic essence of the psyche and will absorb it upon the death of the human. If this doesn&#039;t occur, the spirit and the human ego separate, leaving the ego in the etheric and Astral planes to slowly disintegrate.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

A lot of weight is given in the process of derivation of the laws through logic, it&#039;s a mathematical approach to belief. All that said, I struggle to rectify years of biology, psychology, and ethics which in many ways come to similar conclusions about the nature of evil/sin (selfish gratification) and good/virtue (control of base impulses). Now that I am interested in restoring my faith, I find it difficult to not hear years of study of the sciences overshadow religious texts with the scientific reasoning. I am not saying that it is wrong to learn science - just that it makes this so much harder. We know that much of this wisdom was boiled down to simple terms and allegory to be interpreted for the masses in a communal setting through years of study. This is an aside but it&#039;s one reason why it makes me so angry that there are people who interpret the texts literally. These texts are supposed to be mulled over and meditated on over a lifetime.<br><br>I feel that the only way to overcome this struggle is to go even deeper in the religious texts and attempt to achieve wisdom through mysticism. That requires a lot of dedication. Psalm magic isn&#039;t a one and done, it&#039;s a process.

The secret space force, our UFOs, were fighting actual reptilian space ships. Their technology was far superior and for every one or two ships we shot down, they shot down dozens of ours.

And he said a satellite went down, not a balloon. And he said it was the ISS, but more likely I think it was a star link type thing or something that would really make news. <br><br>He also said the white house had fallen prior to the Russian invasion, like physically the US was decapitated.

Indeed, to the degree that we love one of two opposites and contraries of any type, then to that same degree we hate and reject the other. These two feelings, or rather, in the last analysis, this one feeling of love (whose substance includes hate) dominates all things, is lord over all things, and elevates, arranges, rules and moderates all things. This bond dissolves all the other bonds. For example, female animals who are restrained by the bond of Venus do not get along well with other females, and males do not tolerate rival male suitors. They neglect food and drink and even life itself, not giving up even when conquered. Rather, the more they are worn out, the more they press on, fearing neither storms nor the cold. Because of this argument, Aristippus decided that the highest good is bodily, and especially sexual, pleasure, but he held before his eyes a rather animalistic view of man as a result of his own conclusion. But still, it is true that the more skilful and clever bonding agent, who uses things which the one to be bound or tied loves and hates, expands his pathway to the bonds of the other feelings. For indeed, love is the bond of bonds.</span>", "time": 1676513871, "resto": 34093852}, {"no": 34098646, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:20:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34098420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098420</a><br>And Giordano Bruno on Cupid;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;omniform and multiform something, in which whatever you imagine in the shadowy light you see, whatever you are thinking about occurs, and it happens in the same place, just as from an egg on Zephyr&#039;s wings there issues forth a boy of miraculous beauty to God and people alike.

A man, followed by a helicopter search light was rushing from the end of our cul-de-sac, accessible by a footpath, and up our street. In a flash, he was surrounded by armed police(?) officers dressed in all black. My mother then dragged me away from the window and I quickly fell back into sleep. To this day, she affirms this happened and remembers only as much detail as I do.

Neways garden was inside 4 cement walls with barbed wires, had a big gate and outside the garden it was just corn fields. Wasn&#039;t bad actually cos I got to do what I wanted, meaning playing vidya all day and eating shite and getting drunk, only problem was the pizza guy always took 45 minutes or so to get tae me and the pizzas always arrived cold so I never tipped the poof, plus he was brown and I hate brown people. Neways this one afternoon you could only hear bugs doing their screechy screechy summery sounds like in anime and I figured it woulda been cool to watch summat in a similar setting so I asked a friend and he suggested higurashi.

This was the conception of love for pretty much all time until rather recently. Individualism is a modern invention. Only an individualist, who does not see and feel the genetic connection with family, might think that the word &quot;love&quot; is such a weak word that it could be applied to all of humanity, given that they&#039;ve never felt real biological love.<br><br>The family too is a sort of unit, that can act individualistically or collectively/lovingly with other families.

Giants seem to have lost the &quot;war&quot; between Humans through attrition: we reproduced more quickly, we weren&#039;t any stupider than they were, and *eventually* we did figure out how to work with bronze and Iron and that, specifically, really seems to have been the negative turning point for Giants.<br>The Greeks go into better detail of the process and describe how the Cyclopes only began to decline when the secret of Bronze &amp; Iron working had finally been figured out by Humans. Cyclopes, they say, had trouble farming and raising enough food to feed large communities (or even themselves sometimes), so without a monopoly from their artisan work they were reduced to either raiding or manual labor positions of lifting and setting stones...

The idea that the government pays people to act like paranoid schizophrenics to discredit actual gangstalking is pretty convoluted imo. Paranoid delusion has been around for a lot longer than modern entrapment operations, psychological warfare tactics, surveillance technology etc. So I don&#039;t think feds would have to fund fake schizos to make people think that every example of paranoia about stalking is delusional, it would be most people&#039;s first assumption to begin with, which presumably is why glowies are able to get away with it in those cases that it&#039;s actually them.<br><br>The idea that gangstalkers are private citizens paid with gift cards also makes no sense to me. For an operation that sensitive, wouldn&#039;t you want to keep the people involved to people you can be reasonably sure won&#039;t talk like FBI agents? If you went outside the intelligence agencies it&#039;d probably be to &quot;private&quot; intelligence agencies. And if you absolutely had to pay private citizens to help you, why would you pay them with gift cards instead of money? If the idea is that a direct deposit would be to on the books, wouldn&#039;t cash be better?

Even better if she has a Libra moon, because the opposition can make for a love-hate relation that somehow works. I&#039;d say avoid Scorpio moons, because they will absorb all your toxic persona and then throw it back at you, instead of simply disengaging. Likely very dangerous for you.

Taurus/Gem Sun signs generally may end up studying you and this will lead to disappointment over how they are perceiving you.

I was vegan for 4 years. Let me just say l went hard with it. I was strict. I supplemented a lot, but to no avail. I lost a lot of hair that i probably could have kept. I was also raw vegan for 6 months or so. There were benefits for a while, but eventually my days devolved into constant brapping, being and feeling weak, and lying to myself that I was doing something good for myself and the planet (protip: I was wrong on both counts). I think you should start changing your diet. For starters buy a supplement that is a blend of grass fed beef organs. They come in pills so you just need to swallow them. It will take time to recover from veganism and mentally readjust to consuming animals. It did for me at least. Anyway, modern fruits and veg are complete shit. They&#039;ve been altered and the soil is drained of nutrients. You are not getting what you need. I remember going to whole foods with my gf when we decided to eat meat again. We bought meatballs from the hot bar and was high after eating them. Legit euphoric. My body was so deprived of nutrients and yours is too. I guarantee it. Anyway, good luck. Eat some meat.

Even if you hate it you&#039;ll need the &quot;knowledge&quot; to hold conversations with normies. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep all of your real interests to yourself unless you are in a specific situation where you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that those interests are a welcome topic to discuss, and even then don&#039;t overindulge in the conversation unless you wanna kill the vibe by dominating it and making it fucking weird with your unusual (and to most people creepy) vibrational energy. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Develop proper hygiene, and get better attire so your outfits don&#039;t scream &quot;AUTISTIC&quot;. No creepy t-shirts or backpacks or anything of the sort. Just get some nice-fitting t-shirts that have cool designs (no anime or video games though) or have iconic brands or sports teams on them, some nice button down shirts, and a whole lot of well-fitting black and/or blue jeans with some nice high tops and converse. Work out, get cut, not too big though. And go to an actual hair stylist so they can get you a cut that optimizes your weird face. If you&#039;re bald then I&#039;m sorry, you&#039;ll be kinda creepy by default no matter what you do (unless you get a Turkish hair transplant)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Learn comedy. Seriously, comedy is a learned skill that anyone, and I mean anyone, can pick up. Watch standup specials, improv classes, read books on it, whatever and wherever the comedy lessons come from. Read psychology books too, maybe that one on propaganda from Edward Bernays. Practice that comedy and psychology, first with close friends and family, then move on. Not maliciously though. You&#039;ll learn to read expressions and body language from that and you&#039;ll be able to use logic to compensate for what you lack innately. A good sense of humor can go incredibly far, no matter how ugly and/or weird you are.</span>", "time": 1676417822, "resto": 34088659}, {"no": 34089005, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:39:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34088659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34088659</a><br>Autism is too broad.

Especially when people like us don&#039;t even know what it feels like to be &quot;normal&quot;, to imagine how a &quot;normal&quot; version of ourselves would be like. I have been using the law instead to gradually improve my self-image and sense of self-awareness and empathy, which seems to have very similar outcomes to being &quot;normal&quot;. <br><br> I&#039;m sure if you wanted to just instantly manifest away your autism that it could be done the same way that someone could theoretically imagine themselves being able to float and fly in a supernatural manner. According to the Law of Assumption, if you truly, truly believe you are capable of flying, you will fly. Most people will wind up manifesting a free airline flight of a balloon trip or a skydiving jump far sooner than they will ever manifest being able to magically fly, though. The problem is convincing your 3D self enough that you truly are capable of such a supernatural feat, and the ideas of &quot;laws of physics&quot; and &quot;this is how it is possible to fly&quot; are so ingrained into you, so fundamental to your perception of reality, that it is nearly impossible for one to overcome them. I imagine humans throughout history that were capable of &quot;miracles&quot; were actually masters of manifestation and reality, people such as Jesus Christ, the 24 tirthankaras, and of course the Buddhas throughout history. <br><br>I think that in order to manifest away your autism most people would have to develop a fundamental understanding of reality that is separate from our autistic perception of reality, which is much easier to do through step-by-step manifestations as I suggest and have been working on to much success. But everyone is different, maybe you really will instantly become a totally different person without actually knowing what that would feel like if you personally try to manifest it.

Or that both Human Alpha and Beta waves resonate in the same range as the Earth&#039;s EM resonant field (7,14,21,28 Hz approximately). Archaeology is a science. But you know what else is science, science is a science. Physics. Try first understanding EM Physics (Maxwell&#039;s equations) and then applying some of this to these sites and you will see them in a new light.

If you have a stronger EM field come in contact with a weaker one, the stronger one will imprint itself onto another (literally the physical EM process used in degaussing computer monitors and naval ships).

Psychic people can ultimately read and transmit thoughts with each other, but it ultimately comes down to memory. What someone can remember ultimately defines who someone is. If another conscious human could remember your memories, they would basically become you.<br>I have seen a single person inhabit multiple bodies, but a key characteristic of each of these cases was the sharing of memories across bodies: specifically in cases where certain people had access to other peoples memories at times and times where the original person would forget things often. Obviously in one case, you\u2019ll have a personality or person where memories tend to just pop up (a fall out boy song reference) or one party may be a remote viewer able to see through the eyes of many people they\u2019re vicariously living through.<br>In a general sense, when building up the network of these personalities, take notice of how you fit in by asking yourself if you can access other peoples memories and experience or if they can access yours. I\u2019ve personally found some people are excellent at reading minds or remote viewing, but may have the inability to remember almost anything, and in some cases cannot distinguish dreams from reality.<br>Your body and mind are really a vessel for your thoughts and memories. If you\u2019d want to shift into another body, it would mean that a consciousness in that body would have access to your memories just like you, so you would have to give your memories to that person.", "filename": "C9218213-BF5F-4C37-8025-9384479986A0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1452, "h": 2490, "tn_w": 72, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676534865470645, "time": 1676534865, "md5": "clpsz8eJObx2aiTYdozzsw==", "fsize": 890420, "resto": 34095964}, {"no": 34100778, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:25:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34100730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34100730</a><br>I also want to note that from my experience of people sharing bodies, all of these people were in some way highly similar to each other. As a general rule of thumb, someone isn\u2019t similar enough to another if they couldn\u2019t play their role as a character in a movie. <br>It seems that the ability to share memories and experiences across bodies is most commonly associated with similar personalities (sex, age, race, etc). This may be due to the fact that individuals have the preference of sharing personal private information with subjects similar to themselves. This can be demonstrated by same gendered people congregating in bathrooms, etc.<br>That being said, there are individuals who are not exclusive with what information they share (have no secrets) and are open to all of their thoughts being shared by everyone and anyone who wants to listen (or is forced to). The consequences of this consciousness is that it quickly becomes omnipresent because it gets shared by everyone, especially if that consciousness was seen as originally desirable to view (having useful knowledge, etc). If a consciousness has no useful knowledge, it\u2019s difficult to shapeshift into any other body because no body will have any reason to adopt its information or memories. If it\u2019s memories are dead weight, no one will want to remember them, just as your mind doesn\u2019t remember mundane memories in your day to day experience, you as a consciousness will simply be forgotten.", "filename": "11F435DD-EA32-4A02-AEF2-89529BC712B9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1438, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676535923398799, "time": 1676535923, "md5": "sL1EZ38iV9mPoRD9cB1Jag==", "fsize": 163230, "resto": 34095964}, {"no": 34100846, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)03:52:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34100778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34100778</a><br>Becoming forgotten is just like being ignored. Being ignored can have economic impact as well. Being outcast as a person can leave you unemployable or unworthy of doing business with. The entire reason anyone does business with say a firm is to absorb expert knowledge while that firm survives by being economically viable but also exercising its will outwards on implementation of what it was contracted to do. With its economic earnings, it can exercise its will even more in any direction in pleases.<br><br>Willpower is rooted in cognitive dissonance and is the engine for consciousness. Cognitive dissonance is the inability for two ideas to coexist in a conscious awareness. If you are ignored by your peers, you lose your ability to exercise your will, meaning you\u2019ll be forced to observe incongruencies without any ability to act on them. As you lose relevance, you become more helpless to your surroundings. But if you were someone without any useful knowledge to begin with, you were already fairly helpless and likely looking for knowledge and memories to absorb (wishing to emulate versus shape shift).<br><br>If you are looking to shape shift into someone else, you need to find someone who\u2019s willing to emulate you or become you.

Then lastly, a quote from history. <br><br>Darius III, once king of Persia, laid upon his deathbed. Having been left wounded in a vehicle after fleeing once again from Alexander the Great, he desired a message be delivered to his adversary. Quote &quot;he died without having done him any acts of kindness, but a debtor to him for the greatest, since he had found his feelings towards his mother and children to be those of a prince, not of a foe; that he had been more happy in his enemy than in his relations, for by his enemy life had been granted to his mother and children, but taken from himself by his relatives, to whom he had given both life and kingdoms; and that such a requital must therefore be made them as his conqueror should please. For himself, that he made the only return to Alexander which he could at the point of death, by praying to the gods above and below, and the powers that protected kings, that the empire of the world might fall to his lot. That he desired the favour of a decent rather than a magnificent funeral; and, as to avenging his death, it was not his cause alone that was concerned, but precedent, and the common cause of all kings, which it would be both dishonourable and dangerous for him to neglect; since, in regard to vengeance, the interests of justice were affected, and, in regard to precedent, those of the general safety. To this effect he gave him his right hand, as the only pledge of a king&#039;s faith to be conveyed to Alexander.&quot; end quote.", "filename": "alexanderBeforeTheDeadBodyOfDariusIII,LastKingOfPersiaEngraving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 702, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1676497452917050, "time": 1676497452, "md5": "5EKeeb9uOqwSMD9fmzslHw==", "fsize": 229389, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096778, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>I offer 1% of my power for 5 minutes", "time": 1676497522, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096783, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:46:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>Look into my eye and tell me what you see.", "filename": "81562895-e12-52458", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 304, "h": 580, "tn_w": 65, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676497560766841, "time": 1676497560, "md5": "5psBxk/fdBAgPsCjSYUp0g==", "fsize": 33846, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096803, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:48:04", "name": "EMPRESS", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>I offer my undying loyalty to all that is right", "time": 1676497684, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096805, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:48:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34096545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34096545</a><br>Not OP but I&#039;m curious if you&#039;ve ever done breathing exercises like wim hof or fire breathing.

Had an enormous breakthrough. Here&#039;s what I did and what you can copy.<br>A love spirit can make you feel joy and physical pleasure just by giving it to you directly. With a flesh and blood human girlfriend, if you wanted her to feel good, you would need to give her a kiss, a hug, say &quot;I love you&quot;, etc. and hope your words and actions get through to her and she feels your love for her.<br>In the introduction of sexual alchemy and a bit of the practical stuff later, he says that focusing on the erotic sort of shuts down the whole experience, which is contrary to what you&#039;d expect if it&#039;s just a fantasy to pleasure yourself.<br>He then described that focusing on feelings of pure love do much better.<br>I did that, beaming feelings of pure love to my spirit, and she went crazy. Really intense feelings of happiness, physical feelings of pleasure more intense than a normal orgasm but happening in my chest/solar plexus region, not really erotic, more like blissful. It felt like getting a hug from really soft warm blanket.<br>Before this, my spirit was really hard to contact, communicate with, couldn&#039;t really touch me that well. Now whenever I just beam love at her, it comes back at me really intense.<br>I actually have to tone it down because what she does in response is overwhelmingly pleasing. So I beam feelings of just holding hands and appreciating her, admiring her either physically or emotionally, etc. Different moods, different energies. Pure love is a lot, so these less intense moods work a lot better.<br>Sex also seems to work the exact same way. Instead of focusing on your pleasure, focus specifically on making her feel good. And then she returns those feelings and then some.<br>Basically, donald tyson&#039;s book sexual alchemy is great. Heavily recommend.

For a physicist, this isn&#039;t the end all be all, but for physics--which is a language, model, and system made using concepts such as time and space as its base-- the phrase &quot;new physics&quot; is common. Physics is itself a spatial term, so without a distinctive state of space and distinctive flow of time descriptively, how can events be said to ever occur?<br><br>Events don&#039;t have to have a form exactly. Some tendencies are to look for a source of an event. We find it, but for those who aren&#039;t looking directly at it, we have to describe it. But if it wasn&#039;t something we saw in a physical form, but saw as a structure of logic, there will always be a way to represent it in a form.<br>For an example to contemplate on: the expansion of space as a result of gravity. Consider it logically. Let&#039;s imagine we have four points arrayed as if in corners of a square. They aren&#039;t there, but we can see all four of them from there. Now these points can&#039;t be four points if merged. If we say they can not merge, and we also say they attract per gravity(and the gravity can not cause them to merge or else gravity has no parts to attract together), imagine a fabric forming under each point. The fabric expands and gets closer to merging so that the four points are able to obey every ridiculous rule placed upon. That&#039;s the thing with physics in the logical structure of reality: the universe, as if refusing to do otherwise, gives you a superposition every single time, self-resolves paradoxes.

You can translate the Hebrew letters either as &quot;an obscure amount&quot; or exactly 666 talents of gold which would be insane and ridiculous and exceed the amount of gold on Earth at the time. But there are many reasons to translate it this way and it&#039;s not unusual for the ancient Hebrews to exaggerate or lie about their history.<br>Long story short: the number is gematria and probably always means &#039;secret&#039;. So the number of the beast is not actually the specific number six hundred sixty six, but a number to be revealed during the apocolypse that should have happened two thousand years ago but we ignore that exactly how we ignore the fact that Jesus was Jewish and probably only cared about preaching to other Jews as well as the fact the Jewish Messiach is supposed to be a powerful warlord king who wins instead of being easily killed by yawning Roman soldiers just doing what they&#039;re told to stop a nutter causing minor problems.", "time": 1676500018, "resto": 34095830}, {"no": 34097670, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)18:36:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34095830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34095830</a><br>Lucifer is with you anon.

Cysteine can directly participate in glutathione synthesis, whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine must be first deacetylated before its incorporation to glutathione. In the present study we investigated and compared the efficiencies of cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine influx and efflux through the erythrocyte membrane. Erythrocytes transported both cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine in a concentration-dependent manner. However, our results demonstrated that cysteine crosses the erythrocyte membranes more efficiently as compared to N-acetyl-L-cysteine.<br><br>Cysteine in Meat is better than NAC<br>Meat has so many amino acids kicking ass against fungus and for your immune system also lowering blood sugar meat/fat heals 95% of disease", "time": 1676339262, "resto": 34081588}, {"no": 34081757, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)20:51:53", "name": "Space Cowboy", "com": "How does the holy Pomegranate do against the black fungus? <br><br>Our brothers and sisters in India have been dealing with the &#039;black fungus&#039; or Mucormycosis as an Epidemic.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity is a reaction that MS patients have to a microbial source (fungal) that triggers a delayed inflammation response.

This leads to common symptoms like tremors or motor instability. How does oregano benefit? <br><br>&quot;Mice treated with thymol or carvacrol had reduced DTH responses (26% and 50%, respectively) compared with control ... As carvacrol and thymol each suppressed the antigen-specific immune response by reducing THcell-related cytokines\\specific transcription factors, this indicated their potential to modulate destructive immune responses attributed to T-cells over-activation.&quot;<br><br>Reading between the lines, one of the pathways that carvacrol downregulated was IL-17A.

So I guess it doesn&#039;t matter, I&#039;m just gonna listen to Lil Nas X and fuck some hookers and do some blow, because my choice doesn&#039;t matter. Shit, we may all just as well descend into anarchy right, because it&#039;s all pre-ordained and our choices don&#039;t matter in the slightest.", "time": 1676519556, "resto": 34066576}, {"no": 34099333, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:02:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066576</a><br>you&#039;re actually deranged if you think thats sexy", "time": 1676520120, "resto": 34066576}, {"no": 34099348, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:04:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34099183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099183</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enjoying blasphemy</span><br>Sad to hear that anon, don&#039;t give up though, God is always waiting for you to return to the true path", "time": 1676520255, "resto": 34066576}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34098446, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:35:07", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Multiple UFOs spotted over Pennsylvania", "com": "https://www.pahomepage.com/news/i-t<wbr>eam/flying-objects-spotted-over-nor<wbr>thern-pa/<br><br>They appear to be white and cylinder shaped.

Not necessarily lack of commitment, but too much testing the waters per se, as in you might not shedchule them proactively in your everyday. There is also an issue with what you attract albeit this interpretation might differ depending of your gender as these are more feminine cards so it could be that you aren&#039;t really presenting your best face towards them, selling yourself short could be a way to see it when you actually have your chances to go-get-them. Confidence but not the masculine type, more like the feminine way of knowing your worth and that you are suited for your goals and your goals to you. Maybe even actual appearance and charisma has to do with it to some degree so being more in comfort with those you interact can be a way to start gaining confidence. <br><br>The situation in itself is a new point for you as if a conclusion from a more childish past so maybe this plays a part in your lack of confidence towards your goals. You might understand what you want but never really been where you want to go - so some notions are clashing and creating a bit of an existential crisis where things are not what you used to think they were. A rite of passage if you will and this I think it&#039;s normal and will just take time to get used to and putting yourself out there to live the experiences that you need to live, as stressing as that might be sometimes, is better to gain experiences through mistakes than remain ignorant so to speak.", "filename": "9784955057c705ce8ae9f80071490bc7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1119, "h": 1626, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676515609307416, "time": 1676515609, "md5": "LnxE4yueiU2YE0PEjjD/YA==", "fsize": 248784, "resto": 34096117, "trip": "!!CxhD2Z/eqFc"}, {"no": 34098808, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)21:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34098745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098745</a><br><a href=\"#p34098774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098774</a><br>I see you finding balance in your life, where you are in total harmony, physically mentally and spiritually, this allows you to put out an image of yourself that is the best version.

That&#039;s where things like having a clear purpose and determination come in handy. Like, if we know what we want and we&#039;re focused on it, we can work through challenges and keep pushing ahead. And it&#039;s not just about working hard - having a positive attitude can be just as important. Like, if we keep hope alive, even when things are tough, it can inspire us to keep going and find new ways to move forward. Plus, gaining new insights and ideas can be a game changer. When we see things in a new light, we can make better choices and find better paths to our goals. And when we do reach a big goal, that&#039;s when the magic happens. We feel fulfilled and energized to pursue even more new opportunities.

On top of that there are an additional FIFTY German U-boats that were still sailing the seas as late as 1950.

Most of the early 50 boats were guys who willingly surrendered so they could return to the world rather than spend their lives underground or in the service.<br>2) There are an extreme number of Germans who to this day go missing in either Southern Argentina or Northern Canada. There&#039;s an interesting story of an RCMP officer in Canada in the 80&#039;s who was assigned to work missing persons cases in the Northern Yukon because he spoke.....German.

Overall, I appreciate the honesty though.<br><br>Additionally, I want to be clear in my description. The gore was a warning (possibly) not necessarily a dwelling, at least if it comes from your subconscious. If you fetishized the gore that would be a different story, but I didn&#039;t think you weren&#039;t into gore because you &quot;floated up&quot; in, what I assumed, was you trying to escape. Really, my theory-crafting could be going in the wrong direction because I don&#039;t have information pertaining to what you occupied your mind with in your waking hours, your personality, your beliefs, your influences etc. The likelihood of another entity, apart from the divine, accessing your mind is very unlikely. That is typically your territory and extremely dangerous for intruders. However, depending how you have interacted with entities could give them latent control of the sphere via possession, but I digress.<br><br>Take my interpretation, theories, suggestions, and presuppositions with a grain of salt (It is the internet afterall) but, please, do introspect.", "time": 1676507965, "resto": 34094895}, {"no": 34098219, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)19:48:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34098155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098155</a><br>Checked.
