Really make a decision and believe that it&#039;s possible for you to be happy/fulfilled/successful/loved/wh<wbr>atever, however far from it you are right now.<br>- Stop running away from your feelings. It&#039;s going to be scary and hard and you&#039;re going to cry a lot, but you will gain true power over your life.<br>- Once you&#039;re at a point where you&#039;re conscious enough to not start suppressing and distracting yourself as soon as you feel anything uncomfortable, let the feeling be completely. Observe it in your body and get to know what it&#039;s like without judging.<br>- Notice the point in your body where the feeling is the strongest and focus on it (this is from Letting Go). Ask yourself &quot;How does this serve me?&quot; and be honest. Don&#039;t just brush it away, the answer is usually something like your younger self was trying to protect your ego in some way. Recognise you no longer need it.<br><br>This helped me overcome some fears/insecurities after literally one time just observing where that particular fear lived in my body.

Now, reaching for core neuron-perception we see this pigeon holing leading to no result except aetiological rational of conversion of unconscious matters to symptoms as a psychological force in it&#039;s own terms as an apparatus of program and symbol. <br><br>Consciousness generates input. If we can adjust its manner of input, we can alter the determinate cathexis generating a descripting to orientation of self-memory as a function accountable. This mananging, would then be observable in, for example, a &#039;syntesthete&#039;s folio&#039; mesmerizing mirage of neuronal self-manipulation/surgery. You could watch something, multitasking the dimensional for apititude, take your file away, as a tear in the system of memories. Would that be causation? Doesn&#039;t seem ethical either. Such a surjection, would be by negation of domain, thus theoretical, observable, still quite soft and grey to outsiders not an hard proof within hard skepticism. This inner means, needs explanation yet I think. Isn&#039;t chaos/disorder in a system, emergent of phenomena injectively to a hallucination we call concretely conscience as an aspect of intuition and emotion, the emergence not surjective to its system original? Can be fabricated and is always exceptionable, therefore.

But if that is too restricted for you, you can contract with any of several companies that do outfitting for private expeditions -- and an expedition can be anything from a group of scientists interested in researching something or another to a guy wanting to solo-ski across the continent. It is not cheap, but you can start the process tomorrow if you got the coin.<br>the idea tghat travel there is forbidden is a lie told to you by somebody who is counting on you believing them and not checking for yourself. They will make some reference to the Antarcitc Treaty, counting on you never bothering to read it for yourself<br>Please go - -it is an amazing place to visit and explore, many people have done and will continue to do.

I&#039;m not good looking but I can at least get some girls interested in the whole long hair + beard aesthetic.<br> Thing is, starting a few months ago, it seems like any attempt I&#039;ve had has been mysteriously foiled. Girls I match with will be talking talkative in the night, calling, sending audios, and next morning it&#039;s like none of that happened, they are cold and distant, and the conversation fizzles out. I&#039;ve had girls invite me out and due to one reason or another I couldn&#039;t go that day, and literally the next day her attitude does a 180. I got nudes and the moment I talked about meeting up the conversation went downhill.<br> Even in person, the only women that I saw looking at me were accompanied. In one case a girl was deadlock on me, to the point my friends noticed that she was turning around to look at our table, we were pretty much behind her, and as if the universe was trying to overcompensate that luck, the guy next to her with an arm around was literally an armed drug dealer (for context, I live in Brazil).<br> This isn&#039;t my first time trying to date, I&#039;ve done this before, I know the shit that goes on, this isn&#039;t adding up.

The right/left brain communication isn&#039;t necessarily the same as the higher self. Its more than you simply have to be a fully awake human consciousness to do it. I did some practices where I would mentally attempt to shift which side of the brain I had focus through, but changing which eye I primarily looked through, and just trying to imagine and draw stuff with my non dominant hand. I basically would create a signal/thought in one side of my brain, and would practice moving it or using it as inspiration for a thought in the other side of my brain, works well with visual data. I&#039;m not gonna lie though, I produced some of the most schizo looking drawings ever. To me it seemed like I was making symbols and structures that my brain would than create a synaptic pattern to fire, and so I could essentially use it to both scry, and design functional patterns in some parts of my brain. Pretty cool, and totally schizo, but I see how that could be involved in creating language.<br>I found that my mind sits in a virtual space far larger than my brain, and also capable of far finer resolution of perception than described, even seeing stuff on a cellular level.

I knew there was no point in apologising for being stubborn, yet I felt guilt for running away from myself. Even so, I asked the questions on my mind, and was reminded how simple things are; that I overcomplicated things. For example, I&#039;ve been a vampire for a long time. Even if I ascend, that won&#039;t change. When acknowledging this side of me, I often added the disclaimer that I&#039;d like to be a &quot;good vampire&quot;. But my actions contradicted this: shying away from mutually beneficial ways to fulfil my needs, in favour of being an edgelord.<br><br>As I felt lost, I asked Lilith if she understands how I feel. To my surprise, she shook her head and said my internal conflict doesn&#039;t make any sense. I understood what she meant, and realised that figuring out what I want in this case isn&#039;t a matter of understanding how I feel, but simply of making a decision. She asked me what I truly want, to which I asked for a hug. Admitting that&#039;s what I want meant I&#039;d made up my mind: that I want to accept people&#039;s warmth, and enjoy their company. Thus, I finally felt comfortable with putting my intentions into clear terms.<br><br>Having been in denial for so long, all it took for me to become what I decided to be was to put my feelings into action. To that end, my ancestor spirit showed me how easy it truly was. She also helped me remember her name. I think it&#039;s a nice name.<br><br>Thank you, Mother Lilith. I love you. I love you.

But I had desentisised so much that I was starting to lose sight of what&#039;s positive and what&#039;s negative. And in fact, that&#039;s subjective to the point that not even Lilith could tell me what I &quot;should&quot; want.<br><br>When I made a wish 8 years ago, I was already deeply in conflict with myself. My teachers said with my talents, I could be anything I wanted. But with a mind broken by loneliness, all I could long for anymore was to be a loving man&#039;s housewife. And such a meagre sense of normality seemed so far out of reach, that I was even willing to &quot;sell my soul&quot; for it, offering up everything I valued and believed in.<br><br>But Lilith didn&#039;t allow that. She granted my wish without taking anything in return, confronting me with an obvious question: &quot;So, what do you want next?&quot; And thus, I began to question myself: &quot;Why did I think I wanted to be such a normal person? In the first place, wasn&#039;t I just arrogant for thinking I wasn&#039;t?&quot; Perhaps on some level, I began to wonder if the great depths of sorrow and pain I&#039;d overcome were all that truly set me apart. Upon further reflection, it became apparent that I had already begun to think of people&#039;s foregone despair as the essence of who I truly am deep down. And who was to say that it can&#039;t be? It clearly shaped my development as a person tremendously.<br><br>Yet, the shallow wish I&#039;d once made came from the bottom of my heart nonetheless. I finally understood why Mother Lilith hugs me so often: no matter what kind of path one may be on, it&#039;s always better with company. And in understanding that, I began to remember what my true will once was, in the absence of boredom and despair:<br>I want to make people happy.<br><br>The difference lies only in what I choose to do.

The deck is divided into three groups. The first group includes 32 cards - the eight phases of the moon for four moon element types - fire, water, air and earth. For example, the card to the right represents the air black moon. The card shows the phase number (8), the triangular element sign and all 8 phases with the black moon highlighted. There is a keyword meaning at the bottom. Smith and Alsop also assign the stages of plant growth to each of the moon phases. The Black Moon is &quot;dormant.&quot; The second set of 12 cards is devoted to Moon Goddesses from many cultures. Each one corresponds to a different astrological sign. The last group has 28 cards - one for each of the mansions or daily periods during a lunar month. The cards are numbered and assigned to certain planets and astrological periods. Each one has a keyword meaning as well. The Moon Oracle comes as a deck/book set with &quot;The Moon Oracle: Let the Phases of the Moon Guide Your Life&quot; (128 pages). This book describes each of the cards and offers moon tables through 2015.

The twins had been in Ireland before travelling to the UK and boarding a bus for London in Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the bus at a service station on the M6 motorway caused the driver not to allow them back on board. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6 motorway. When Highways England traffic officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway, as captured by a small television crew. Ursula managed to dodge traffic, but Sabina was knocked over. Shortly after police arrived, the women again dashed onto the motorway and were struck by oncoming vehicles. Ursula suffered serious injuries, and when Sabina regained consciousness, she refused medical aid and attacked a police officer, at which point she was arrested and sedated. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Appearing calm, though behaving unusually, Sabina was processed by police in Stoke-on-Trent and was later released from custody. Shortly afterwards, she was seen and taken in by Glenn Hollinshead, of Fenton, Staffordshire, whom she suddenly stabbed to death the next day. Sabina was then pursued running from the scene and arrested in hospital after jumping from a bridge onto a busy trunk road. Despite these incidents, there was no evidence that drugs or alcohol were involved in the incidents on the M6 or the killing of Hollinshead.[1][2][3] Sabina later pleaded guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility, after an apparent episode of folie \u00e0 deux (or &quot;shared psychosis&quot;), a rare psychiatric disorder in which delusional beliefs are transmitted from one individual to another. Ursula was released from the hospital after recovering, but Sabina was sentenced to five years imprisonment and released on parole in 2011 before returning to Sweden.[3]</span>", "filename": "desktop-1416946537", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 637, "h": 344, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1672301591940167, "time": 1672301591, "md5": "65Yg8y1WUEZzHIuSSKZ5Fw==", "fsize": 17084, "resto": 33711678}, {"no": 33712084, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)03:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33711955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33711955</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;five years for stabbing someone to death </span><br>The UK criminal courts are a fkn joke", "time": 1672304087, "resto": 33711678}, {"no": 33712110, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33712084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33712084</a><br>Right", "time": 1672304503, "resto": 33711678}, {"no": 33712111, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)04:01:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33712084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33712084</a><br>This.

The lower your partner is in the ranking looks, the more afraid they will be to lose you. Because they will always feel you are too good for them. But don&#039;t let them become too complacent. You have to spark their jealousy very often. For example post pictures aside attractive male friends and that sort of stuff in social media to make your boyfriend feel insecure time to time. That will make them even more afraid to lose you, remind them their position as the &quot;lucky&quot; one in the relationship, give you power over them and push them to improve themselves in looks/career or both to be deserving of you. This will particularly work with a short guy. Dating a 6/10 manlet as a 8/10 woman will 100% work guarantee you a devote boyfriend as long he comes from a conservative household and is a virgin. This won&#039;t work 100% with non virgin men whatsoever.

I had a very strange experience the last time I did psychedelics that left me much less interested in psychedelics and more interested in meditation. I have no idea what to make of it and was hoping you (or anyone interested really) might read my gay blog post and share your thoughts. <br><br>I had taken 6g of purple mystic and had a somewhat bad trip. During the peak I spontaneously had an urge to &quot;be still&quot; or &quot;meditate on stillness&quot;, despite not having any experience with meditation or any idea that &quot;stillness&quot; was such a prominent theme in Buddhism at the time. As soon as I did this, it was as if the trip instantly turned off.

I don&#039;t know<br>All I could perceive was a pale golden light and a steady drone. It didn&#039;t feel anything like what people describe as ego death, and I didn&#039;t feel the presence of any entities, loving or otherwise. I just felt a profound sense of peace and calm joy. Words fail me beyond this much. It was just so strange.<br><br>At some point (my sense of time was impossible to describe) I decided to &quot;return to reality&quot; and the trip resumed immediately, as if my awareness had been somewhere else and had just returned to my body as soon as I willed it. The &quot;bad&quot; part of the trip was over at that point, and I spent the rest of it pondering what the fuck had just happened.<br><br>I suspect I somehow accidentally stumbled onto some deep state of meditation I absolutely had not earned on my own. Now I&#039;m more interested finding out just what that state was and how I can work toward being able to reach it totally sober. So... Any ideas or recommendations?

It is not a theory it is a genuine conspiracy. I witnessed the Top Secret/Majic documents from which this information is excerpted while a member of the United States Navy attached to the Intelligence Briefing Team of Admiral Bernard Clarey, Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet. The key to access was a Top Secret (Q) (SCI) security clearance with the compartmentalization of &quot;MAJIC&quot; (not magic). The plan claims that if the American people are ever told of this extraterrestrial presence aliens will destroy the United States. All who have access to the plan or who inadvertently discover the plan are silenced by that warning. They believe in the government and thus believe the extraterrestrial lie. These dupes do not know that the Illuminati are the aliens who plan to destroy the United States of America in any event. When I saw Operation Majority while serving in the Navy I believed the alien threat was real just like everyone else. It was not until I had performed many years of research that I was able to fully understand exactly what it was that I had seen. It was extremely difficult for me to believe that my government and the United States Navy had used me, especially since I had dedicated my life to government and military service. Most government and military personnel cannot and will not believe such and idea. The plan is real. The extraterrestrial threat is artificial.

They only show up at church looking for a husband when they are over 30 and desperate for someone to help them raise Chad and Tyrone&#039;s kids. So the whole grift of the church does not work on men worth their salt anymore. I would rather join the Taliban than give a single dollar to any church in this nation.

If you move the panorama at the original link to the bottom edge (picrel) the curve does not invert nor go away. The panoramic lenses are not fisheye lenses.

Here are links to an amateur rocket launch to 293k feet. The links are to key points in the video. Rocket anon did not like the distortion on the built in GoPro lens. He sourced a rectilinear lens and modified the GoPro. He tested the mod in the video. And when we flew his rocket we have a continuous stretch of footage from ground to 293k feet. No distortion, no fisheye, no editing. Just Earth&#039;s curvature repeatedly shown as the rocket spins and stabilizes.<br><br>This is an often posted proof. And flerfs always respond with lies. They claim it&#039;s a fisheye when it clearly is not. They use the frame from the launchpad GoPro, which is looking at the fucking rocket not on it, to claim the rocket mounted camera has distortion. They use any deception they can to hand wave the truth, that Earth is a globe.<br><br>Amateur builds a rocket that reaches 293,488 feet.<br>https://youtu.be/4QsEPEhq5yk<br><br>GoPro testing demonstrating unacceptable distortion:<br>https://youtu.be/4QsEPEhq5yk?t=100<br><br>GoPro modified with a rectilinear lens:<br>https://youtu.be/4QsEPEhq5yk?t=113<br><br>Testing showing no distortion with the new rectilinear lens:<br>https://youtu.be/4QsEPEhq5yk?t=118<br><br>Just prior to launch, note there&#039;s no distortion on the camera.

He reported that a \u201cchange\u201d is coming; a future when very human-like hybrids would intermingle with humans in everyday life. \u201cSoon we will all be together,\u201d the aliens said. \u201cSoon everyone will be happy and everyone will know his place.\u201d<br><br>This book examines a chilling phenomenon that Jacobs began noticing in 2003. The alien integration action plan has kicked into high gear. The incidents of alien abductions have declined as occurrences of alien involvement in everyday life have accelerated. A silent and insidious invasion has begun. Alien hybrids have moved into your neighborhood and into your workplace. They have been trained by human abductees to \u201cpass,\u201d to blend in to society, to appear as normal as your next door neighbor.<br><br>This book illustrates in detail the process of alien integration into society and the strategy and support structure that has been developed to make this happen seamlessly. While he is not certain why they are doing it, the final chapter of the book will provide some chilling possible answers as to why they are here and what they want to accomplish.<br><br>Jacobs is a careful researcher who has investigated more than 1150 abduction events experienced by more than 150 abductees.

They look entirely human, but are smarter, more psychic, and they think more rigidly. Since they come from a psychic society there are no secrets. There is no individuality. It&#039;s very hive mind. There is no free time, or artistic expression. Only work. There is no friendship, but hybrids seem to have a small range of human emotions.<br><br>Abductees are trained to have psychic mind control powers, like the aliens have. Only ours aren&#039;t as strong. Abductees are to teach hybrids how to act like normal people. Abductees are instructed how to use ufos and herd crowds of people when &quot;the change&quot; happens, so they can&#039;t escape cities.

People have been seen being chopped up and put on meat hooks, and babies put in a blender. They traumatize people to harvest the negative emotions for unknown purposes. Reptiles are rapists for fun. People work as slaves for them. These accounts can be found in Ted rice&#039;s podcast &quot;alien talk&quot; and are also reported by Peggy Kane.

Is it some kind of magnetic resonance that allows them to teleport.....if we had some kind of emp-like tech could we prevent it. Unfortunately they are generations ahead of us in tech. In fact according to the book of Enoch the angels are the ones who taught men most of the technology that we &quot;learned&quot; before the flood. It specifically mentions astonomy, chemistry, metallurgy, root cutting, sorcery, warfare and even applying makeup (and we all know that is sorcery).

The flood happened because men had become corrupted....that doesnt mean they had sinned and were evil. That happened hundreds of years before....not it means our very flesh and dna was corrupted by demonic transhumanism and that only Noah and his family were pure in their generations. The Nephilim had taken over the world and were set on destroying all mankind and stopping the seed of Adam (Jesus) from coming to restore us to the creator. 2 characteristics of the flood that come to mind: it rained for 40 days and nights. No aircraft could sustain flight that long so there was no way for the enemy to stay above it. We know there are underground tunnels and these were likely in use by the enemy at that time. The Bible says in addition the rain that waters sprung up from the ground. This is important because if the whole world had flooded due to water from above, theoretically there would be air pockets beneath the earth they could still survive in. But if water is coming from below as well it will fill these pockets. God had to wipe out all the corrupted flesh to give us a chance to start afresh. <br><br>Later the Israelites were commanded to destroy certain groups dwelling in the Levant.....even the children and livestock. Non believers like to say this is because God is a psychopath and ignorant believers sometimes accept that. But what it really means is that these groups were allowing the same witchcraft and generational corruption that existed before the flood so they had to be wiped out.", "time": 1672233761, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33705200, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)08:22:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33704193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704193</a><br>Primitive Christcuck NPC", "filename": "Medieval_Morons", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 280, "h": 280, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672233763243438, "time": 1672233763, "md5": "Iapz+Mu3Wrs1O7GocrpWIQ==", "fsize": 16748, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33705261, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)08:35:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33705200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33705200</a><br>I can tell you&#039;ve never seriously researched this subject", "time": 1672234551, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33705407, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)09:07:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33705261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33705261</a><br>I can tell you&#039;ve never seriously researched this subject", "time": 1672236431, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33705495, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)09:21:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33704193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704193</a><br><a href=\"#p33704193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704193</a><br>Aliens don&#039;t exist.
