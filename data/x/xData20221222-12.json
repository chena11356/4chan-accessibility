Not in terms of finding relationships for you, but in terms of giving you a straight answer.

In terms of personal development, it will mean that you&#039;ve finished an important step or phase. Now, what the hexagram warns is that while a new time of your life is here also will bring the new challenges that come along with it. It warns that while you&#039;ve finished one thing you can get complacent and be chill and all is good. NOPE! <br><br>So the hex... the good news is, you&#039;ll be over with something, but sitting on your laurels with be a dumb mistake<br><br>Line 1: you can probaly get what I&#039;m getting from deduction reading the text but yeah...

If a man&#039;s superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: &quot;Do not seek it. &quot; Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man&#039;s own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord. He need only be able to wait.</span><br><br>Line 3: I can interpret this as you being in this time in your personal development to clear out and chase down all the bad stuff in your life and within you.

Understand the doctrine and use it to answer your questions and make your personal choice deliberation easier.<br>I&#039;ve tried many denominations and found most truth in the Catholic church but it&#039;s riddled with bad history and modern problems so I left for a reason. You&#039;re going to have to do what makes most sense to you, or else you&#039;ll apostasize too.<br>I will seek God in solitude in as much hermitage as I can get, but never doubt the power of the dispensation of the gifts of God. The other anon is wise about this too so listen with wisdom.

Most of my family was Catholic and I&#039;ve been studying the older Christian mystics from the Dominican Order, and thrme saints. I&#039;m always nervous as to whether or not I&#039;m worshipping false deities though or if certain aspects of Christianity or Catholicism are veiled Paganism. I over think everything. I love God SO much that I think of Him constantly during most of my day. Even during sexual activity I think of Him and whether or not I&#039;m being good to Him... then I see the results in this world and discern my own feelings and soul and the impact of all my actions and thoughts. And I pray. And I feel loved still. It&#039;s all very fascinating and mysterious but also feels so simple... but reality and other people&#039;s perspectives make it all confusing.

We live in an Apollonian age of numbers, results, capital, etc. and it is killing the side of ourselves that believes in anything - this naturally leads to nihilism and bleakness. The same nihilism and bleakness that presides over the entirety of our culture today.

He believes in molecules, yet has he seen them for himself under a microscope? I say, &quot;NO&quot;. He was merely told this was the case from some book, or from some teacher.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect.

There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions.

When we observe the life and message of Jesus Christ, we can see the qualities of love, devotion, courage and surrender at the center of his teachings and example. The term \u2018Christ Consciousness,\u2019 refers to the embodiment of these qualities in our lives. It&#039;s about meeting the grit and grime of life through the heart of love, devotion, courage, and mystical surrender as Jesus did. Christ Consciousness is, therefore, another word or idea that points to the notion of spiritual integration; of learning to not only use the heart but also the mind. To embrace your flawed humanity and luminous divinity and of course, to recognize \u2018God\u2019 as both an immanent and transcendent force/source.

Sentient beings all have an agenda. Spirits are real. Figure out their agenda, and you understand them. Understand them and you can understand yourself, because they program you.

Otherwise the world will decide for you, and obviously what others choose for you is not in your own interest. Be patient and suspend your disbelief. Doubt is a part of rationality. It is how you learn to discern, but faith should be provable to yourself. Belief of the heart is more important than that of the mind. The heart dictates what happens in the spirit world.

Now I know science, logic, and common sense don&#039;t go over well here, but any waste of time is a waste of life. So if masturbation helps ease stress then it&#039;s good for your overall health. Normal masturbation has been shown in studies to not effect serum T levels at all UNLESS you&#039;re peeling the carrot repeatedly daily to the point of sexual exhaustion, and sex with a steady partner was shown to increase testosterone levels. It helps point to some of the reasons why when your in a relationship you seem more desirable even if they don&#039;t know you&#039;re not single. <br><br>This whole nofap bullshit is pushed by incels to convince themselves they&#039;re superior. It&#039;s like their levels of evolution and they firmly believe this disproven horse shit. That&#039;s why they end up so angsty and pissy they end up doing cowardly shit like shooting children in their school rooms. If you want to increase serum T levels try lifting weights(muscle produces testosterone) as it helps produce more hormones and causes endorphins to be released. Also, avoid low cholesterol diets since your body needs cholesterol(fatty acids) to make hormones and regulate systems.

Opposing medical advancement was also historically the church&#039;s agenda, so I despise such mentalities even when they come from occultists. Understanding the human body is key to prospering in this physical world, and a certain degree of freedom is needed to achieve that. My ideal is the application of scientific and spiritual progress to enhance people&#039;s lives, and the physical circumvention of gender dysphoria in those who can&#039;t realistically be more effectively treated in other ways also falls within that view.

I started memorizing places like O&#039; Reilly&#039;s, shit like that in case the timeline switched and I wouldn&#039;t have to second guess myself. One of the M.E I memorized was Cheverolet. At the time this happened it was spelled ChevErolet and I watched M.E. videos on how there was an extra E and the actual spelling was supposed to be Chevrolet. Ok so about a week.or so later I wake up and my heart is racing like I just did a line of coke and my ears were ringing. I felt disoriented as fuck. I knew intuitively that something had changed in my timeline. So I start looking at M.E. videos and everything is still the same. Then I see in my recommended videos and Ad for Chevrolet. The fucking E was missing. I throw some pants on and walk outside and look at my truck. I drive a Chevy and look at the badge everyday. So the spelling on my truck is Chevrolet. I&#039;m having a mild panic attack at this point so I go inside and find the specific M.E. Chevy video I was watching a week or so prior. The video is reversed. So now the video is saying that the extra E spelling of ChevErolet is the M.E.... it&#039;s showing all this &#039;residue&#039;...like the fucking video flip flopped on me..I had to take a long break from anything mE related after that because I legitimately almost lost it..", "time": 1671644608, "resto": 33653382}, {"no": 33657832, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)12:54:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33657793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33657793</a><br>Interesting.

They have a sense of self and a &quot;true&quot; form that reflects that. However, they make themselves look however you want. Some see this as a good thing. Others see it as a sign they have a vested interest in getting your guard down and/or making you like them. If that is a good thing or a massive warning sign is up to you. They also use sex/energy as food and possibly are being ordered to be with you by a succubus queen.<br><br>I lean towards warning sign, which is another reason I keep spirits other than succubus. Those can be just as loving (if what I see in thread is accuate) without the succubus specific drawbacks. Make sure you have a decent ward on yourself and your home, cleanse and purify yourself and your home at leasr twice a year, and cleanse and purify yourself before and after you do work. That should keep you squeaky clean and allow in only healthy spirits.

From there it spiraled into the realization that I was trapped in a momento / mental growth scenario, where I was supposed to learn a lesson. All religions were based on my surroundings and misinterpretations of my cell. So I reset, I\u2019m a blank slate, and I was put there to learn that rules exist for a reason and that morality is not subjective, and that things can be objectively bad or good. Then it turned into a commentary. I was watching me, and I was being criticized by a bunch of ricks ( I could not see them) and they were lamenting that I was not learning my lesson, and going along with my punishment, because I didn\u2019t want to be punished. I eventually capitulated, and went to talk to my father. My father was a puppet with ricks voice. The realization was everything had happened.

They would bend space in front of them, and essentially pull Point-B to them.

At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth &#039;as if they all burned&#039; and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows.</span>", "filename": "Himmelserscheinung_u\u0308ber_Nu\u0308rnberg_vom_14._April_1561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 900, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671603815103334, "time": 1671603815, "md5": "E0GC9TVYHfVn4FBzbTGSWg==", "fsize": 365205, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33654995, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcj<wbr>l3js0ldE", "time": 1671604121, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33655010, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:31:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://youtu.be/yUFYnVXbLoY", "time": 1671604318, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33656487, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:50:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.congress.gov/117/meetin<wbr>g/house/114761/documents/HHRG-117-I<wbr>G05-20220517-SD001.pdf", "time": 1671627044, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33657451, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:37:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "holy shit nice post <a href=\"#p33655010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33655010</a>", "time": 1671640657, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33658243, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)14:08:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1671649713, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33659867, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:25:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33656487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33656487</a><br>this is literally confirming everything in this video<a href=\"#p33655010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33655010</a>", "time": 1671665142, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33660057, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:59:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33659867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33659867</a><br>It may be making the same claim, but it doesn&#039;t have any evidence confirming anything.

I became a recluse, only leaving my apartment to buy groceries. And then came the day that I saw him. Standing in the aisle at Walmart, examining the candy section. I was stunned. Floored, even. He turned to me, and opened his mouth. I don&#039;t remember what exactly happened. All I knew was that I couldn&#039;t let him deliver his mocking diatribe.I couldn&#039;t let him gnome me.

You can do relaxation on your body first. Concentrate on your feet and tense your legs and then let them relax then move that tension/relaxation wave upwards toward your head relaxing your whole body completely. <br>Close your eyes and concentrate on your right hand. When you do this you should feel it tingle. Briefly concentrate on your whole body and it should tingle as well as this is your body sense. As thoughts come up just *watch* them somewhat dispassionately, and when you start to drift away from the concentration gently bring back your attention to your hand again. Don&#039;t judge or try to change anything, just observe your thoughts. As you watch them Things will slowly be resolved - it takes some time. When you get lost in thoughts, gently bring your attention back to your right hand again. The hardest part is dealing with the damn music! You&#039;ve memorized more than you know, and it all comes up to distract you. When you close your eyes it isn&#039;t completely dark; there are &quot;lights&quot; there. Bring your attention to them and concentrate on them. Sometimes concentrate on your right hand and forehead and &quot;see&quot; the hand in your mind moving to your forehead of what seems to be its own volition. Eventually, it should go there. It also helps reduce roof-brain chatter.

It sucks. You&#039;re in pain, and life isn&#039;t fair. But this selfish lashing out at others and at God shows your mindset is wrong. Once you really get beaten down properly and begin to comprehend empathy for others, you&#039;ll begin to realize the most profound truth of life is genuine selfless compassion. You don&#039;t do it for yourself. You do it for people around you so they can feel less suffering. You don&#039;t help a drunk woman from being raped at a party because you want to fuck her yourself, you do it because even a drunk sorority girl is still human and likely deserving of love and decency at a base level. Being empathetic and selfless can be draining, and can feel lonely at times brcause others aren&#039;t often as selfless. But that&#039;s what it means to really be selfless. If you want to be selfish, do it. Being a truly good and upstanding person requires you to be in tune with yourself and to make sure your base needs/health are fulfilled first.

First off let me say this, although I grew up christian also but am no longer a christian, I do still believe in the existence of Jesus and I don&#039;t feel people who still subscribe to religions are particularly wrong, I just do don&#039;t it anymore. I feel if you believe that Jesus died for you that&#039;s perfectly fine. You have the right to believe that and I respect your beliefs and I have the right to not believe it an I expect you to respect my beliefs. But the reason you feel conviction is simply because you&#039;re a christian. There&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with all the smut you saw, it&#039;s the world we live in. Everyone does some form of smutty shit. It&#039;s only wrong because you&#039;re told to think it&#039;s wrong. You see, the reason you have a life where you even are christian and watched such things is so you could learn how wrong what you were watching really is. If you&#039;d never been a christian, you&#039;d never really felt conviction for it &amp; would&#039;ve never learned the lesson. It&#039;s all a big lesson. You planned this life. You planned to be a christian, you planned to watch that stuff and you planned for it to happen the way it did so you would feel conviction for it an learn the lesson behind it. In all actuality, christianity isn&#039;t really real, it&#039;s completely fictional. That doesn&#039;t justify watching smut or the people making it but those people have life contracts where they make smut. That is there purpose, to learn the lessons that come with being a person who makes smut. Then they&#039;ll have a life where they learn a similar lesson as you. We&#039;re all just learning lessons, there&#039;s NEVER anything that you need to feel bad or guilty or conviction over. When you die you will judge yourself, no one else is going to judge you. You&#039;re human, you have sexual needs, there&#039;s nothing to feel disgusted about.", "time": 1671612817, "resto": 33649224}, {"no": 33655713, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)04:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33649224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33649224</a><br>I can relate to that OP, I managed to recover from it my self well mostly anyway I&#039;m just missing the key part that substitutes that self comfort and excitement but that will be fixed in the near future.<br><br>Since you mention spiritual agony please understand that sex is a part of life and it was a God given thing, meaning that you shouldn&#039;t feel bad about it but you should hate what brought you to that point.

Anyway the key here is that you must stop self pitying yourself too much, you&#039;re really missing the point and really I get that it feels like its hard to let go of that shame. But you must move on and become the person that you&#039;re meant to be, think about it if we were made in God&#039;s image do you really think we will be condemned by our past mistakes?
