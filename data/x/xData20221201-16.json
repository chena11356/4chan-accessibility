The internet -&gt; human mind interface.<br><br>https://www.frontiersin.org/article<wbr>s/10.3389/fnins.2019.00112/full<br><br>The Internet comprises a decentralized global system that serves humanity\u2019s collective effort to generate, process, and store data, most of which is handled by the rapidly expanding cloud. A stable, secure, real-time system may allow for interfacing the cloud with the human brain. One promising strategy for enabling such a system, denoted here as a \u201chuman brain/cloud interface\u201d (\u201cB/CI\u201d), would be based on technologies referred to here as \u201cneuralnanorobotics.\u201d Future neuralnanorobotics technologies are anticipated to facilitate accurate diagnoses and eventual cures for the \u223c400 conditions that affect the human brain. Neuralnanorobotics may also enable a B/CI with controlled connectivity between neural activity and external data storage and processing, via the direct monitoring of the brain\u2019s \u223c86 \u00d7 109 neurons and \u223c2 \u00d7 1014 synapses. Subsequent to navigating the human vasculature, three species of neuralnanorobots (endoneurobots, gliabots, and synaptobots) could traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain parenchyma, ingress into individual human brain cells, and autoposition themselves at the axon initial segments of neurons (endoneurobots), within glial cells (gliabots), and in intimate proximity to synapses (synaptobots). They would then wirelessly transmit up to \u223c6 \u00d7 1016 bits per second of synaptically processed and encoded human\u2013brain electrical information via auxiliary nanorobotic fiber optics (30 cm3) with the capacity to handle up to 1018 bits/sec and provide rapid data transfer to a cloud based supercomputer for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction.", "time": 1669930316, "resto": 33502070}, {"no": 33507138, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:32:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33502070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33502070</a><br>kneegrow its been fake for a decade.", "time": 1669930321, "resto": 33502070}, {"no": 33507151, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:33:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33503368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33503368</a><br>Kek, either that or rolling out project blue beam soon.", "time": 1669930419, "resto": 33502070}, {"no": 33507163, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:35:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33502070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33502070</a><br>op is wrestling with the failure to switch to some operating system other than windows... been a long time op... just as that picture hints at... just let the old and cancerous moldy go. you will become stronger for the effort.", "time": 1669930521, "resto": 33502070}], "last_modified": 1669930521}, {"no": 33491061, "now": "11/29/22(Tue)18:28:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/succgen/ Succubus general 350", "com": "Spirit Love General<br>Tree Fiddy Edition<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>Some have reported attracting the attention of these entities by simply reading about them.

At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth &#039;as if they all burned&#039; and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west.

If you pump air into a basketball with holes the ball will lose the air. Likewise our energy is being lost and drained by distractions, bad habits, addictions, uncontrolled emotions and mind.

One of the segments was about the backrooms, and I was excited that somebody was finally gonna explore the origin of the concept, unfortunately though, his focus was on the actual image attached to the most famous backrooms post. Regarding the backrooms themselves, he referred to the 2 threads made in 2019 and said they were the origin point. Which got me thinking, has anybody actually looked deeper into where this idea originates from? I scoured the internet, but the popularity of the backrooms makes finding anything meaningful difficult, and almost everybody refers to those 2 posts as the point where it all began.<br>But before we get carried away, let\u2019s define what it is we\u2019re looking for. \u2018The backrooms\u2019 does not cut it, as we\u2019re not looking for this specific creepypasta, but the origin of the concept itself. And here is how I define the concept:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A glitch in reality that causes you to end up in an empty world of never-ending liminal spaces.</span><br>This idea certainly goes back further than 2019, but so far, I\u2019ve been unable to find any theories/creepypastas which clearly outline it. There\u2019s stuff like Michigan Blue Hell, and liminal spaces themselves have been a thing for a while now, but the combination of glitching out of reality and an empty world of liminal spaces seems nowhere to be found.

One of these nights I had a very intense nightmare, the details are foggy all these years later, but after waking from the nightmare I found myself staring at the ceiling of a pitch black room not being able to draw in air again. I run to my parents room to wake them up and get help but the second I touch the doorknob I am able to breathe again, I still wake up my parents and tell them what happened and they suggest for me to sleep in their room tonight. So I slept on the floor beside them and directly past my feet was an opening in the wall that leads to the master bathroom. There is no door at this opening and I was just staring into the black nothingness of the bathroom. As I am staring I begin to see a pair of hands appear from the left side of the wall and start wrapping its fingers around the wall. As I continue to stare at it the face appeared and the upper body of it. Its body was more black than the darkness of the empty bathroom and its eyes were glowing blood red, it stared directly at me for about 5 seconds than slowly disappeared from where it came.

Always late at night of course, I used to dismiss them as hallucinations until an encounter I had in 2015. I pulled my car off to the side of a desolate slice of road because I needed to take a piss. It was real late, and it was around winter time and it was real cold out. I left my car&#039;s headlights on as I was watering the flowers, and I heard something scrap across the asphalt real softly behind me. I spun my head around, and for just a few seconds I saw something begin to take a step further into the headlights before quickly sliding back into the darkness. My heart skipped a few beats as I realized what the fuck I just saw, and I quickly zipped up my fly and got back into my car, probably breaking the speed limit as I got the fuck out of there.<br><br>A few months later, now in 2016, I had my second encounter. It was just a few hours before I got off duty, so I was taking it slow and relaxing with some KISS blasting on the car&#039;s stereo. Again it was real late, and I noticed I was low on gas. I stopped at a little pit stop gas station and began filling up my tank, and I saw someone standing on the other side of the road. Now there weren&#039;t many street lamps out in these parts, it was far too rural for the state to bother spending money for lights, but from the edge of the light from the gas station, I swear I could vaguely make out the shape of a man wearing a hat slowly encroaching on the edge of the light.

Like with most of my encounters it was during daytime and I was completely lucid.<br>I should mention that there had been a very dramatic episode in the house when I was younger culminating in a suicide, and that following it I had heard angry whispers, hisses, things moving, and even a scream from the location of the suicide.

As it crossed the threshold into my living room I could see its body disappearing as if crawling under an invisible table (I believe the different light in the room caused this). My eyes continued to trail along until I knew it would have to be right beside me. Then I saw a shadowy limb reach out and touch the side of my head, which left me light headed and so spooked I had to get out of the house. While at my wits end lying in bed the following night I had the bedside table shake like there was an earthquake under it. Every time I was about to fall asleep I had hypnagogic hallucinations of people talking and shouting.
