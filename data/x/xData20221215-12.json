In the culmination of the incident where I devoured everything I deemed negative within him (after which he broke down as he realised how delusional he&#039;d been), it was as though leaving my vessel: my physical body lost consciousness, and I was an enormous chaotic black blob with hints of red, seeping into every crevice of his soul, swallowing his negative energy, upon which it was immediately made unrecognisable by the unrelenting cataclysm within me, simply becoming a part of it.

I realised that the aforementioned blob is just the aura (almost completely opaque), and deep within it is what resembles a person.

From there i went back to the set of my previous dream but this time there was a &quot;friend&quot; with me we were just chatting about stuff and life , and the the situation turned sexual. And it wasnt a normal wet dream , it was a very intense sexual feelling i never experienced in a dream before. I wished to wake up but before losing the dream state i heared that same voice saying &quot;it is not that simple, do you wish to give up on your desire&quot;. I expressed that no , i do not want to give up on it. At which point the voice said &quot;say yes&quot;. Which i did. It said &quot;good&quot;. And i woke up .

In the end, we agreed that I wasn&#039;t comfortable with it and couldn&#039;t provide them a permanent relationship as I would still like one with a real woman, and they went away without issue. Cue a few weeks ago and they pop back into my head while trying to sleep and essentially ask if I&#039;m down for some no-attachment fondling and talking. After that night, they&#039;re off again. Cue last night, when there&#039;s a thread in /r9k/ about the youngest age robots would be willing to sleep with. 16 is a common answer (legal is probably why) and I respond much the same. I talk to young women (16-24 is most common) all day, every day, and it&#039;s a ton of fun, but also not likely to go anywhere. They do flirt often and I have been asked out by young girls before, but of course I always decline because despite being legal, dating 16 year old girls is generally frowned upon and for good reason. Kinda like that ideal you look towards but never actually want or expect to get. Then going to bed last night, guess who shows up again. She makes it clear that she knows my desires and being a succubus, there is no taboo to her. Tells me she just wants me to be happy and sexually fulfilled, even if that means she&#039;s inevitably out of the picture.

Plan basically boils down to spending time finding a suitable long-term partner, but just for fun, in the mean-time, she&#039;s going to setup trysts with multiple younger girls. Her exact words (+ or - a few here or there) were: &quot;You can&#039;t hide from me. I know how much you like those little girls. I want you and them to explore each other mutually, and I&#039;ll make sure anyone that might take issue, is also persuaded. I can setup a mother-daughter play-time with you if you like. We&#039;re going to have a lot of fun.&quot; From what I understand, no isn&#039;t an option. Even if I don&#039;t go for it, she&#039;s going to persuade these girls anyway. It&#039;s just my decision on how far to take it. When prodded on why such interest in me, it essentially boiled down to (paraphrased): &quot;I like and take interest in you, because you didn&#039;t turn into a love-bitten fool just because I pleasured you. You are still a person outside me and still seek interest in women. Love is not a meaningful word to me the same way it is to you, but I certainly like you in ways I don&#039;t like others. This is my gift because I can.&quot; Personally, I think I&#039;m crazy as a bed-bug, but this shit feels real as hell and I&#039;ve never had any previous signs of mental illness. If I&#039;m to accept her word for it, this is no-strings attached, simply because she can. Although she has hinted that it&#039;s also partly because she likes the idea and concept of what she&#039;s doing from a sexual perspective. What say anons? Am I fucked? Will I fuck?

She wasn&#039;t upset, she just reiterated that I shouldn&#039;t underestimate what she was capable of, and anything she would provide would be without worry of consequences or she wouldn&#039;t be willing to provide it. Still, ultimately it&#039;s my final decision if I turn them down or accept them, but she&#039;s going to send them anyway. I feel gross about it, but there&#039;s something very tempting about a 16-18 year old girl.

For C I&#039;d feel like I&#039;m screwing over both parties. I&#039;d rather just wait for them to find the right opportunity to manifest in a physical form.

I can not tell you how to find it for yourself, but perhaps my story will inspire you to be the very best you, that love cannot help but find you. <br><br>I did not find healthy, good, real love until i was 36 years old. I had a chain of sad failed relationships with women who drew me with many charms. Some were very sexy, some were cool dude bro chicks, several were incredibly smart. The last one was incredibly smart. Her father had raped her for 26 years. She was a broken woman and i loved her more than i have words to describe. And she loved me too. It was so real, but so doomed from day one. Three years into our relationship, she asked for &quot;space&quot; and promised me we weren&#039;t breaking up. <br>She hanged herself 45 days later. Ruined my life. I lost my job, i hurt myself at a skate park, i lost my apartment, and my love died. <br>I moved back in with family in my 30s. I didn&#039;t work for 2 years. I just sat here on 4chan talking shit and trying to be good to others when i can. I played vidya, i stopped self caring, i just smoked a lot of weed ar grandma&#039;s house and gave up. <br><br>Throughout the past 5 years, a girl i knew in middle school started sending me facebook messages. One day about two months ago, she tells me she wants a child. She wants to move home 3000 miles and be with me. <br>Red flags galore. <br><br>She was a whore for 15 years. A stripper too. Smoked crack, did ice, all that crazy shit. <br><br>I said fuck it. Truth is, i was planning to just go die alone in the woods like the animal i had become. She packed her life into four suitcases and moved into my grandma&#039;s with me. No joke. <br><br>We&#039;re now deeply in love. It&#039;s actually beautiful how perfectly our broken lives fit together and found home. We&#039;re getting our own place this next month. <br><br>Love finds you when you are ready, Anon.

Then it should surely be a goal to pursue. I agree with those that said don&#039;t go looking for it. Be open to it and it will find you. And it shouldn&#039;t be one&#039;s only goal in life. Even if, there&#039;s a lot of inner work and self-love that needs to be focused on in order to allow that true love to flourish and grow. <br><br>- True love doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s going to be any less painful. It&#039;s going to cause you to face your inner shadows and trauma conditioning. And that doesn&#039;t feel pleasant. It&#039;s going to make you aware of faults/triggers/bad habits that you wouldn&#039;t likely normally run into if not seeking an honest connection. And as far as I can tell, there&#039;s no end to it. It likely gets easier with both parties working through it together. But that also brings with it the awkward and uncomfortable feelings of being vulnerable, direct, and non-confrontational. <br><br>- Don&#039;t be afraid to show love. Not just with someone you consider your true love but with people you love in general.

I used to be part of a group of &quot;friends&quot; that talked at eachother&#039;s backs all the time and had constant infighting. Since I essentially left that group my mental wellbeing has drastically improved. This is, funnily, around the time I learned about the one who would become my SP.<br>That said, EYPO. I won&#039;t say you divided them but they did in your inner world, so they could just as well be reunited.<br><br>But I think this is just like one of those &quot;Manifest my ex back&quot; stories. Can you do it? Absolutely, I managed to do so. My ex went from saying they weren&#039;t attracted to me and blocking me, to contacting me out of the blue, apologizing, complimenting my looks and inviting me over. But in the meanwhile I&#039;ve become a completely different person and started to manifest the new SP. So I just politely friendzoned my ex. The manifestation gurus would say I &quot;revised&quot; them. Did I? Well, I simply lived in the assumption the ex was in a bad place in their life and were lying to themselves- when they apologized they essentially did repeat the first half of that.<br><br>So it&#039;s the same with your friends, any relationship can of course be an SP. You can manifest them back, but if you haven&#039;t worked on yourself and your assumptions you&#039;ll also manifest back their past infighting and grudges.<br>Or you can manifest new friends without all the baggage. A lot of people here will say not to manifest a *specific* SP (SSP?) period, but I agree with NevilleGoddess who in a video neatly differentiates between old SSPs (ex BFs/GFs, ex friends, etc) and whole new SSPs. She recommends against the former (she tried to do so herself, only to stop wanting her ex-BF back) but says nothing against the latter. But you are God and ultimately you decide what&#039;s best for you. Paraphrasing NGoddess once more, don&#039;t seek guidance from others because you already have all answers within you.

The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context. More personally the Emperor can signify a time of stability and order in a person&#039;s life, hopefully opening up creative energy. He also can indicate a specific person who holds great power, either objective or emotional, over the subject. This is very often the father, but it can also be a husband or lover, especially for those people who treat their lovers as substitute fathers to whom they surrender control of their lives. I have seen readings so dominated by the Emperor that all of life&#039;s possibilities become stunted and unfulfilled. As a card of personal qualities, the Emperor can indicate the ability to defend one&#039;s territory, to create firm boundaries and vigorously maintain them. He symbolizes a rationalist approach to issues, one that values analysis and measurement over emotion and intuition.</span>", "time": 1671106783, "resto": 33610987, "trip": "!!Hjzu3y3qQf8"}, {"no": 33611497, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)07:24:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33611482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33611482</a><br>in this case: life&#039;s possibilities became stunted and unfulfilled, due analysis and measurement over emotion and intuition.", "time": 1671107058, "resto": 33610987}, {"no": 33611512, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)07:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33611476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33611476</a><br>I wouldn\u2019t describe it as fear, the seance I did with a close friend group (who I still am close with) told us our friend, who was sleeping in the next room at the time, would take his life in the near future.

There is an attractor in consciousness that absorbs all information and saves it forever. A good way to think of it is a coin funnel where a coin goes around several times before reaching the center of gravity at the bottom. Just as a black hole collapses under the weight of its own mass and becomes a supermassive black hole, human consciousness is continually collapsing and expanding. In the case of civilizations, they either undergo radical transformation (Roman Republic into Roman Empire) or collapse entirely.

It\u2019s not atheism but state religion that kills the spirit of the people. The state is propagandized as being for everyone but everyone subconsciously understands that ultimately only a few people at the top benefit from the state\u2019s existence and this becomes more clear as the state\u2019s lifespan wears on. Most modern states have existed with one face or another for several centuries, although millennium states are still rare. They all collapse eventually and then a spiritual revival takes place. But currently the state religion is being amplified with some message changes. Academia has identified how to fine tune the message to increase the state\u2019s power and hold on the people. They did not make it so interpersonal harmony and welfare actually are promoted because the Iron Rule can not cut through those spiritual properties and is best when in service to oppression. Originally other religions could coexist and Christianity was enmeshed in the state religion but now God is being removed from the secularist doctrine. Opposing faiths are actively being persecuted under the guise of separation of church and state. This monopoly of spiritual authority is transmitted through ordinary social structures to make normies complicit and quiet. It still frustrates them because they know they can\u2019t oppose the state which is why atheism is on the rise. It\u2019s framed as a rejection of religion and thus a rejection of the state but the leadership is counting on it leading to a death of their opposition, the 2nd Estate. The 4th estate is rising as a replacement but it is too ferrous and self-centered to do much except be an imitation of the state. At best it will be a crude reflection and thus enlighten the people as to the our own abusive relationship with the state. Ultimately, this centralization of spiritual authority means that when it loses its appeal the entire fabric of society crumbles with no alternative pillars.", "time": 1671087254, "resto": 33610065}, {"no": 33610483, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)01:57:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33610065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33610065</a><br>If you met me, unless you actually got to know me you would think the same.

The problem is who or what can you trust after crossing over? How real is it exactly, and how much of it is influenced by or purely a projection of our own psyche? All of our accumulated karma/consequences: trauma, subconscious beliefs, fears, desires, etc. I&#039;m certain these will be factors, but I&#039;m not certain of any specifics. I can only ever be certain of vague and fuzzy concepts, but never specifics, and that&#039;s what I find so frustrating. So for now, the most reasonable approach to me seems to be a shotgun approach. Get very familiar and comfortable with as many altered states of consciousness as possible. Seek inner peace, seek to conquer fear, let go of regrets, and prepare your inner ghost puncher for battle just in case. It&#039;s mostly just intuition, but I get the feeling the afterlife will be somewhat similar to tryptamine class psychedelics or lucid dreaming. It might seem completely out of your control, but at the same time it might be possible to at least steer and influence the experience to some degree if you have the right stuff. I don&#039;t know.

They give you a glimpse of what is possible, but they can&#039;t manifest said possibilities into your reality. Marijuana also just makes me paranoid and gives me bad anxiety. Psychedelics almost never did until my last trip on mushrooms. The strain was purple mystic and think this was significant because they didn&#039;t feel euphoric at all like every other strain I&#039;ve had, but extremely sedating and made my eyelids feel too heavy to keep open. <br><br>I was experienced enough that I was able to simply ride it out and not let it freak me out too much or overwhelm me, but it genuinely felt &quot;evil&quot;, like something was fucking with me. Before that my visuals were always very natural and abstract. Just swirls, distortions, everything moved and breathed and swayed, everything was more colorful, etc. But this time my visuals took on distinct forms of things I found unsettling or unpleasant any time I closed my eyes. Mostly tentacle and centipede like visuals. Everything was dark and grotesque. Occasionally the visuals would peel back like a curtain, revealing some sort demonic, smiling, taunting, laughing, predatory, black and white, jester-like faces that felt simultaneously like they were approaching me while I was being pulled toward them.<br><br>Still not sure what the fuck that was about. I had this sinking sense of dread as I kept my eyes closed for too long and the spooky shit manifested more strongly and got closer, like it &quot;wanted in&quot;, and if I had &quot;let it in&quot; I might end up possessed or permanently traumatized in some way. Maybe I already was, because I haven&#039;t touched mushrooms since and have only done light threshold doses of LSD since. LSD has always been much more gentle and predictable for me.

I did so while zoning out on my palm, and the world instantly disappeared. The trip turned off. I suddenly felt sober, like I no longer had a body and no longer existed in physical space.<br><br>All I could perceive was a pale golden light and a steady drone, and I felt very peaceful and full of joy. It felt like I was outside of time and space but I still had a very fuzzy sense of time, as it only felt like I was &quot;there&quot; for about 30 seconds, but I felt like &quot;there&quot; was &quot;here&quot;, &quot;everywhere&quot;, and &quot;nowhere, simultaneously. I felt like I somehow was the light and the sound that I perceived. I had the sense that if I had stayed in that state that I&#039;d have been able to safely visit any time or place from that state, but I was too excited to stay still and try. After I snapped back, I instantly was tripping again, but weaker, the bad trip vibes were gone, and I felt fine. Just extremely confused about what just happened and a bit excited. Ever since then my focus shifted from psychedelics to meditation. I&#039;d like to trip again with a plan to specifically meditate next time and see if I can reproduce it, after getting a bit better at and more familiar with meditation. The most I can do now is get my monkey brain to fuck off for a couple minutes max, but before that experience I had absolutely no experience with meditation, so maybe that&#039;s more than enough with the aid of psychedelics next time.

With that being said I think he is genuine in his motives and his work, even if he can be a kind of goofy fox news boomer conservative. I don\u2019t believe this was his strongest movie, and I think he would have to 2x the length and budget to really get the point across. I felt if he focused on purely wyoming cases and left out the Elk abduction, the BC case, and the Arizona case he could have made a stronger point. I know he was trying to drive home the German abductee case, but he could have just listed raw data of German missing people. <br><br>I think the films structure was off, he needed to set the ground work with missing persons cases, then explain to the viewer the interdimensional hypothesis (vallee), and then execute on the pattern of the cluster map, elk, germans, etc. I was disappointed he didn\u2019t show the cluster map with the aquifer in one scene. <br><br>With all that being said, he had some beautiful shots on location, and considering he funds most of this himself it\u2019s better than 95% of paranormal so documentaries.

The busdriver actually screamed wtf and simply opened the doors because everyone was panicking. Quickly discharged and went to the next pub I could find to pour me something to drink.

I don&#039;t care if this steps on any toes, it&#039;s a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn&#039;t Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a &quot;front&quot; for their activities.&quot; Svali <br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/welcome/child-page/<br><br>\u201c...and as you join Freemasonry, initially they&#039;ll tell you that their G, the G in the square and compass, means God. But then as you go up through the levels, they&#039;ll tell you, &#039;Oh, this stands for Gnosis, knowledge.&#039; But then when you get higher up it stands for the Generative principle, which means, buggering little boys. And I&#039;m not saying that on my own authority. I spoke with the highest ranking Freemason to defect to Christianity, Jim Shaw, he was a 33rd degree Freemason, and I had a number of conversations over the phone with him about Freemasonry.

The foulness of the slaves is a direct result<br>of the atrocious baseness of the despot. A miasma exhales from these crouching<br>consciences that reflect the master; the public authorities are unclean, hearts are<br>collapsed, consciences shrunken, souls puny.

Less glory is more liberty. When the drum is silent, reason<br>sometimes speaks.<br><br>Tyrants use the force of the people to chain and subjugate--that is, enyoke the people.<br>Then they plough with them as men do with oxen yoked.

Between the fire of the blood in our hearts against the ice of cold reason. The World Ice Theory speaks to those humans to whom the christian guilt idea aswell the idea of pure expedience is alien. This breed of men opposes nature with strenght, never avoids it neither through the forced shame of asceticism and humility nor through soley sensual gratifications of the moment. It posesses all the superiority of the nordic character. It looks with fresh, lively and couragous eyes into the heart forbidding experiences of a dramatic nature. Hidden behind this taciturn and unbending features there is a secret existence of true human. A wonderful toughness of healthy life resistance. A true kindness and always faithful comradeship of strong-willed men. They are polar people who feel comfortable under the ancient nordic law of fate. Bold, not tired. Intact, never chatty. Resoloute and wise. Self-assuard and audacious characters who are facing the dangers and tests of sacrifice. Upright, insurred dramatic beings who&#039;s heart is adventourus and steel.

This is obviously a position that sounds insane at first, as it sounded to me only two years ago, but that&#039;s the position I&#039;ve come to, and I think anyone who actually looks into this and is capable of questioning things can see the same.<br><br>You claim you had multiple shifting symptoms for example. Well the official position on covid is that it can seemingly cause practically any condition - but most generally it was thought to be defined by flu-like symptoms, literally all the symptoms point by point that you get with flu. In Wuhan the original panic started because they claimed there was &quot;atypical pneumonia&quot;, pneumonia being often a flu symptom or associated with flu... but since the original outbreak, the wider epidemiology shifted the definition so that there isn&#039;t really anything &#039;atypical&#039; about the pneumonia of those who experience covid.<br><br>You didn&#039;t catch a virus because viruses don&#039;t exist and aren&#039;t contagious. Now what actually causes your illness I don&#039;t know. In my own case I had a &#039;flu&#039; in Feb of 2020, and then the next illness I had was a short flu in 2022, with my new perspective I came to the conclusion that the probably triggering factor was a sudden drop in temperature (literally the entire state ran out of tissues over this week) during an antarctic blast (Australia), and the fact that i&#039;d experienced sleeping under a &#039;drafty&#039; window. This is just speculation though, I don&#039;t definitively know what actually causes &#039;flu&#039; now that I don&#039;t believe in viruses.", "time": 1671103348, "resto": 33597584}, {"no": 33611341, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:28:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33611293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33611293</a><br>I would add that the tests are essentially meaningless. In the first year of the &quot;pandemic&quot;, I talked to various nurses online, specifically went out of my way to track down real life nurses or care workers and ask them their experiences, and even at that point most would point out that the tests didn&#039;t help with anything, were unreliable, you&#039;d test someone and get a positive, then have to test three more times and basically go on the &#039;average&#039; of having multiple repeated positives. But what actually triggers those positives is highly questionable. People are more likely to TAKE the tests when they&#039;re ill or suspect they might be ill, so if illness and heightened production of mucous somehow contribute to a higher chance of a positive test, maybe it is detecting some sort of illness, but I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s this &quot;novel&quot; &quot;virus&quot; CoV-Sars2.<br><br>Many in the alternative health field seem to think skin rashes can be related to &#039;expelling toxins&#039;, or some sort of bodily cleansing process. Could be like that? Not sure. As I mentioned having flu in Feb of 2020, I later come to the conclusion that this was more likely caused by me having spend the previous two weeks cleaning up in my garage where there was lots of dirt and mould, and where I was using some strong chemical sprays without properly ventillating the place. I didn&#039;t think of this at the time because I jumped immediately to the conclusion that I had a &quot;virus&quot; (though I don&#039;t read the news, so didn&#039;t think of covid at the time). I think this is another case of selective perception, selective memory, and the bias of interpretation excluding possibly REAL causes of illness. I had probably inhaled a lot of shit during that cleanup week, and then I was probably producing more mucous or something like that to encapsulate and expel that material from my body, and I experienced that as &quot;flu&quot; symptoms.

As his popularity grew, it was understood that Anu and Marduk could utilize Jesus to strengthen Anu\u2019s hold on human culture, and reposition himself as a loving God\u2014the father of great entities like Jesus. Avatars were generally considered an annoyance by Anu. Usually they were killed or locked up to wither and die. Stories would be created to either cement them to Anu\u2019s glorification, or they would be vilified and deemed to be of Satan. There was no middle ground with Avatars.

At least, that&#039;s a symptom of what I can do. By focusing in an area on the back of my neck, I can send a chill down my spine. Scientists cannot explain this, but they only see the symptom: goosebumps on command. I can focus this sensation, energy even, to different parts of my body. I can use it to accelerate my own healing, especially if the injury is fresh. Many of the times, if I get hurt, I forget in the heat of the moment and adrenaline. When I immediately focus this energy, the damage heals 2-4X quicker than it normally should. The longer between the tissue damage and my energy flow, the less effective it is. I have been able to successfully transfer this to other people. They do not feel the chill as I do, the pins and needles traveling down my body and into theirs, but I do. People with mild injuries (Rolled/sprained ankle, jammed finger, head blow, etc) have commented that after I lay hands on them and perform, the pain fades quickly and the injury leaves little mark. I rarely do this however, as they think me crazy and refuse, or their pathways are so incredibly blocked it does not complete a circuit. I can run out of this energy, but it also heavily depends on my mood and feeling. When I am angry or stressed and I try, it simply bounces back up towards my head as what I assume are my chakras become blocked. If I am in sleep paralysis or astrally projecting, I can do the same thing, but it feels more euphoric even. I have been focusing on directing this energy outside of my body, as it is much easier to practice while in a lucid dream or sleep paralysis. Air seems to be a terrible conductor for this, but other objects with significant sentimental meaning or certain crystal lattice structures are able to conduct this well. I can transfer it from the base of my neck, to one arm and hand, through said mediums, and into my other hand and back up to my neck.

Hades is \u201cSheol\u201d in Hebrew. Adamites have an eternal spirit so when they die, their bodies decay but their spirits abide in Hades/Sheol awaiting Christ\u2019s second coming. Peter explained that Hades is where Christ visited the \u201cspirits in prison\u201d during the three days between His death and resurrection when He preached the gospel \u201calso to them that are dead.\u201d<br>Here we see that an Adamite can turn to Christ after death, which is entirely opposite to the teachings of most modern churches. Christ states in Revelation that He will \u201cdestroy Hades and Death,\u201d and all Adamite spirits will be released and return to Him in heaven. There will no longer be death for Adamites. It\u2019s as simple and cut and dry as that.<br>There is no \u201chell.\u201d<br><br>So where do the other two terms fit into this? Gehenna is a compound Hebrew word. It refers to the \u201cvalley of Hinnom,\u201d the wicked place where in Jeremiah\u2019s time the Israelites sacrificed their children as burnt offerings to Baal.<br>When Christ used the word Gehenna, He was referring allegorically to the fiery trials in this life. This includes the chastisement Yahweh visits on the Israelites when they stray. As in the literal Gehenna, one\u2019s body may be allegorically burned during these fiery trials.<br>One\u2019s body may be punished or even destroyed in this life.

Their fate is then outlined: \u201cThese [goat nations] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous [sheep nations] into eternal life.\u201d Here \u201ceternal punishment\u201d should be translated as \u201clake of fire.\u201d This means they cease to exist completely and forever.<br><br>Churches teach that you could spend eternity in hell if you don\u2019t obey your priest and attend church.

Since Adamites have eternal life, Yahweh has good reason for punishing and chastising them in this life.

In the same way for example, people who are satanic (i.e. oppressive tyrannical etc...) And use others and then pitch them away like garbage will themselves be cast into the garbage heap and used up. There was a story some years ago of a garbage heap in India. They don&#039;t have good trash services like many well to do western nations. Anyways there was a tsunami, when it came out struck the garbage heap.

Ruler of the ascendant is mercury. Saturn is in fall in aries in the 7th while opposing the ascendant ruler. With moon in leo and sun in virgo you might be a very extroverted person, maybe you have lots of friends. Jupiter seems like a problem area, it&#039;s in fall in capricorn and cap&#039;s ruler is also in fall.<br><br>You have a *lot* of interesting aspect patterns. T-square between sat, jup, merc, with the jupiter midpoint opposed 10th house. Grand Trine with sat, plut, mars/venus. Mystic Rectangle between merc, ur, sat, mars/venus. All these patterns are interconnected so they may be difficult to tell them apart. Your chart is extremely harmonious. I see this as your T-square is a very difficult life pattern that motivates you to push for success in the public/career/10th house. You might find comfort and harmony with your Grand Trine. The rectangle might help you alleviate the challenge of the T-square. Jupiter is only present in these patterns as a point of tension.<br><br>Pluto seems to &quot;grab&quot; everything in the chart, seems like a very large influence and it likely colors the other energies and patterns. Pluto is about control and transformation. This makes me think you are assertive, but not in a bad way since it&#039;s in harmony with the whole chart. <br><br>My overall take is that you are extroverted and like people, even being the center of attention. You have problems with anything jupiterian: growth, luck, successes, higher knowledge, etc. You might have a bad marriage because of afflicted saturn in the 7th house. You have a lot of &quot;pluto energy&quot;, perhaps you are in control of things or maybe you are a transformative person to those around you. You are overall an internally integrated person due to the harmonies of the chart.

The spiritual world works through both good and bad qualities and attributes. Someone&#039;s destiny can end up with a negative outcome such as suicide, but end up as a net positive for their next lifetime.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling. If I make it through it&#039;ll be amusing to end up on the equator I suppose.

It is possible to imagine universes in which the equations are slightly different - where a constant is 6.6744 x 10^11 instead of 6.6743 x 10^11, for example. Yet, when one starts examining the repercussions of these changes, one finds again and again that virtually any other set of constants and equations produces worlds that are simply unable to host intelligent life. Everything collapses into a black hole, or stars never shine, or everything collapses into radioactive dust.

To seek religious bliss is to likewise seek a respite from suffering. Would God have made man know suffering so deeply if it was to be so easily cast aside, and so tangential to the nature of the soul that it would be severed like that? If the soul is truly infinite, and everything experienced by the soul is contained within like planets in a galaxy and galaxies within a universe, how can suffering that was experienced be removed from infinity? you cannot drain the ocean to remove the sand...", "time": 1670883095, "resto": 33585604}, {"no": 33593159, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)17:19:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33585604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33585604</a><br>Wisdom without action or the ability to act will make you suffer, but wisdom with the means to use it will allow you to improve either your life or the lives of those around you.<br><br>In his life, Buddha came from more wealth and therefore had more means to act, in this case acting to reject his wealth.

Heavy jupiter theme in this chart: lots of planets in jupiter&#039;s sign sag but even mars, ruler of the ascendant, is in jupiter&#039;s sign of pisces. Jupiter trines both the ascendant and ascendant ruler. Moon and jupiter swap sign rulerships, meaning there is more harmony there than is seen by the aspects of the chart. Extremely heavy jupiter influence. That jupiter is in the 8th house which is tricky to interpret so I&#039;ll just give some key words: death, sex, rebirth, inheritance, secrets, other people&#039;s things, occultism, transformation. Using whole signs instead of Placidus it would be in the 9th house of higher education and focus. Anything involving this jupiter will have a massive effect so look out for planets transiting over it.<br><br>Your moon is in a T-square with mars and saturn, bringing stress and pain to emotional life, the mind, memories, and such. The T-square brings tension which is released opposite the midpoint, in this case the 10th house.

Jupiter is looking good as well in it&#039;s own sign somewhat near the moon in the 7th house of relationships. These mercury and jupiter placements are good for finances and love. Venus is in cancer, sign of the moon, and the moon being with Jupiter looks good for this venus. Can&#039;t see too many problems except for this Saturn-Mars thing, and Saturn in the 10th might not be so great for career, but yet again it&#039;s in Jupiter&#039;s sign and Mars is in Mercury&#039;s sign so maybe it all evens out.

Yes, amino acids are everywhere in the universe, and RNA is nothing more than a chain of these amino acids which pair up with other acids to replicate itself, however the process of replication required the machinery of proteins to work effectively. We are kind of left with a chicken and egg paradox, how could RNA replicate itself without the necessary proteins to assemble and unbind RNA. We know that cells produce the proteins necessary for this process, however in a world without proteins producing more of themselves RNA cannot reproduce, and without RNA the proteins have no way of storing information so that they can reproduce. We are missing this big link in exactly how we went from RNA randomly forming and it actually achieving self replication, and the big mystery is proteins.

My roommate had left for a week and when I was alone in the flat a gnome was visiting me. The creepy fucker would keep peeking at me from behind a corner and I would just ignore him cause I thought it was just my imagination fucking with me or something. 3 nights ago I woke up in the middle of the night and saw him right next to a book shelf in my room. The mother fucker was just staring me down and I made eye contact. After a minute he ran under my bed and seemed to have vanished by the time I jumped out of bed to investigate. But he had to be something physical because when he ran from my bookshelf under my bed he disrupted the bookshelf to the point that some of my books had fell over and one even fell from the shelf. I don&#039;t think the book that fell off the shelf really matters but in case it has importance of any sort it was a pocket version of the Quran.<br>The gnome itself was approximately 2 feet 4 inches tall and his red hat probably added another 4 inches and I know this because the bookcase he stood next to is 3 feet tall and his figure, hat included, was shorter than the bookshelf but almost as tall as the bookshelf. He had pale white skin of a pinkish complexion, small button looking nose, a white beard and blue eyes. He was wearing brown boots, pointy red Phrygian cap with a blue and white ribbon, denim-looking overalls and a long sleeve blue and white striped telnyashka-looking shirt.<br>Now I&#039;m still a little suspicious that this was even a gnome because the height of it was a little taller than what I had imagined a gnome to be but I cannot just let this experience stay in my head.

Live by their own standard. But in another sense, that&#039;s the kind of idol worship that always fucks them over. Again, the missing context here that most people today are missing was how the temples supported the economy.<br>Plus, outside of bible stories, when have the jews &quot;needed&quot; to be distinguished? Right? They&#039;re usually driven out because they refused to assimilate, or accused of subversive conspiracies. <br><br>The promise - the point - of God&#039;s covenant was to do away with that system centered on a geographical locations. Jesus in the New Testament, would talk to people (See: Woman at the Well) how some day people would be free to worship anywhere. They wouldn&#039;t suffer in some pyramid scheme. A kind of globalization - but again, there was no separation of church and state back then. Inheriting the Earth. More context to keep in mind. <br>Not long after Jesus died, the Romans destroyed THE temple. The religious bureaucracy, for a lack of a better term, had essentially tied it&#039;s own hands.

There were those who knew how to heal, but there were also those who could use such power to harm others if they wanted to defend themselves. Why would such a knowledge be given to everyone? Most people would use it to become rich/get hoes.<br><br>2. He followed Essene Judaism. Most followers of Judaism belong to Rabbinical Judaism, which is the descendant of the Judaism which was practiced by the Pharisees. He tried to make other sects (Pharisees, Sicariots, etc.) convert to Essene Judaism. Of course people didn&#039;t like it that much, but he didn&#039;t give up nonetheless and did succeed in coverting some.<br>But then again, there were several messiah claimants and according to some it is possible that there&#039;s much more than just a single messiah and there are several of them, BUT they will not redeem the world. Instead, they will give people the knowledge through which they can redeem themselves (most people won&#039;t choose that though). Or maybe there are no messiahs, and you have to become your own messiah, but can&#039;t be that for anyone else but yourself.", "time": 1670961674, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33599774, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33596720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33596720</a><br>1. nonsense from autistic people seeking to turn the spirit into a line<br>2. because they knew he was a fraud and the SLAVE system in his name didn&#039;t apply to them if they CHOSE", "time": 1670961677, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33599806, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:06:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33599749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33599749</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can you explain more</span><br>the servant songs in the book of isaiah make reference to a &#039;suffering servant&#039; that puts his faith in the lord and is thus rewarded and delivered from that suffering. the book was written during a time of great political tumult for the israelites because they were at war with the assyrians and the priestly caste was desperately searching for ways to placate their followers (a move away from animal sacrifice can be seen here, as this was placing an emphasis on material wealth being the path to salvation, something that clearly wasn&#039;t working).<br><br>i type all of this because the servant songs are the basis for the messianic eschatology that would go on to characterize the christian worldview. at the time, messiah specifically referred to a king or High Priest important to the Jewish people within the PRESENT tense, traditionally anointed with holy oil. this term was universally applied to Cyrus the Great, who decreed that the Jewish people could return from exile in Babylon some time prior. this is to say that messiah had no prophetic connotations, it could be applied to anyone that did a service to the Jewish peoples, it was only during Christ&#039;s lifetime that it took on the &#039;savior&#039; meaning, as the aforementioned political discontent was reaching new heights with the fall of the second temple in roman judea; this makes it out that Christ was not in fact the culmination of centuries worth of Jewish prophecy and scholarly debate, but instead a fairly expected claimant to a religious position of power in the heat of a very fast-moving sectarian movement spurred on by material conditions.", "time": 1670961977, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33599820, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33599773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33599773</a><br>Not bad.<br><br><a href=\"#p33599774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33599774</a><br>I&#039;ve heard Christians are slave like.

That&#039;s because most people can&#039;t understand Onan&#039;s sin.<br>There&#039;s this thing called a levirate marriage, where if a Jew died without a child, his brother was allowed to have a child from the widow and said child would be considered the descendant of the deceased one, rather than the descendant of his biological father (the brother). Now there&#039;s this part that say that the spilling of the seed is not permitted. Why is it not? You see, there was this guy called Onan who was in a levirate marriage and it allowed him to have sex with his deceased brother&#039;s wife until she got pregnant. But every single time he pulled out just so that he could always fuck someone if were he to become horny. Also, he pulled out for another reason. So that he would not have to give what he inverited from his deceased brother to the child. This way he could have two things: sex with a woman who didn&#039;t even like him whenever he wanted and a lot of fortune that he otherwise he would have needed to share with a child and its mother.<br><br>Onan&#039;s sin was that he pulled out so that according to the law a woman would need to become his bitch and he would inherit a lot of money, which this way he did. That&#039;s why the spilling of seed is forbidden. On another note, even Maimonides allowes one to relief their sexual desires, but masturbating without being horny first is a sin. So being a coomer and looking at porn is a sin, but jerking off just because one can&#039;t think about anything else but sex is okay.

I believe that Judaism as a religion is cool as fuck but most Jews belong to Rabbinical Judaism which I do hate a lot. Most of the rabbis and baal shem tovs (healers and such) would stab their community in the back if given enough in exchange for that. There was this guy who was a baal shem ra (master of the bad name). It was believed that a bad spirit got attached to him and he tried to exorcise it, but the spirit told him that, &quot;rabbi, there&#039;s no need to be afraid of me, truth comes through my wicked hands&quot;. and things like that. This guy, the baal shem ra, believed the same, that most rabbis and most baal shem tovs are frauds and if given enough money, they would harm the people who follow them.<br>I also tend to dislike the ultra-orthodox because they are quite the opposite of what a Jew should do in this life. They tend to think lowly of non-Jews and shit on converts. I mean, Moses was a convert too and so was the most known rabbi, Akiva and so was Onkelos, whose Targum (Torah translated into another language) is still studied today. So yeah, I tend to dislike those who follow their rabbis blindly and do hate those rabbis who only bring their followers down rather than lifting them up, but think of Non-rabbinical Judaism as a cool thing. Not that I don&#039;t study the writings of rabbis, but don&#039;t follow them blindly.<br><br>Cont.", "time": 1670970257, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33600693, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:25:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33600687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33600687</a><br>There were two monks washing their cloths in a river.

He&#039;s a real scholar, not a youtube schizo. The tl;dr is that the Jews of the 1st century expected a Messiah to kick the Romans out of the holy land and rebuild Jerusalem. The world would repent of their pagan beliefs, everyone would convert to monotheism, there would be world peace. Jesus, in his lifetime, accomplished absolutely none of this. Early Christians failed to find a significant audience with the Jews and began to preach to Romans. Over the years Christian sects popped up and each had their own twist on the story. Jesus went from a prophet to a demi-god to the literal son of god. <br><br>By the time you get to the 3rd century Judaism had moved on from expecting the messiah any time soon and Christianity had redefined the messiah from a prophet into god. It&#039;s why rejection of the law of Moses is baked into Christianity; they spent centuries removing as much Judaism as possible because their audience didn&#039;t give a shit about Judaism beyond historical curiosity. Constantine needed a tidy religion to unite the people and Romans were no strangers to going with the flow when it came to religion.

I started reading Carl Jung&#039;s &#039;The Undiscovered Self&#039; and just after the first 3 chapters something unlocked in my mind. It might&#039;ve been more than just the book that did it, but my way of thinking had become different. I began questioning a lot of things in my life and came up with theories that I had thankfully written down. I also began noticing symmetries in life and at that same time a certain James Webb telescope photo was posted online that just pushed me further into it. The galaxies were somewhat lined up in symmetrical patterns! *photo attached* <br>As of now, my mind isn&#039;t where it was then. I&#039;ve gone back to a somewhat normal thinking style while still attaining that knowledge. I had given up weed almost a month ago and as it was leaving my system I feel that sort of curious thinking style dissipate with it. Health wise its for the best, but perhaps I can return there with a sober mind. I just need to work towards that again. <br>In that short time though, I discovered important things about myself and realized which aspects belonged to my shadow self. With that particular knowledge I&#039;ve gained much more self control (which was my main goal). But aside from that, I&#039;ve developed theories about the power of perception, emotional energy, the importance of mental association, and personal truths. Most importantly out of all of this though, I&#039;ve begun to reconnect myself with God.<br>[ANYWAY] with all that said, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that each one of us has a personal truth that isn&#039;t true for anyone else. Each and every one of our individual lives are unique no matter how basic they may seem, and with that uniqueness is an equally unique truth. What is true to you isn&#039;t exactly true for somebody else even though there are similarities.

So if you&#039;re dreaming of being big and strong, great, you will reach it one day, but first you need to break your dream down into smaller parts. Is there a gym nearby? Can you afford the gym? Do you need to get a job to afford the gym? Do you need a higher paying job so you can work less hours and make time for the gym? Etc etc. Whatever the problem is, you can fix it. Break it down, come up with a plan, and try. That right there is 100% mind/will power.

I have extensive backcountry exposure, even did a stint as a big game guide in a remote backcountry camp. On this day we enjoyed the fishing and settled in for the night.<br><br>I pulled out my pan and stoked up a nice fire. It was clear and cool as the sun faded into the western slopes. We cooked up some fresh rainbows with garlic and butter and filled our stomachs. I leaned back against the cooler after pulling out a refreshing beverage. The boy was soon asleep by the fire as it had been a busy day. I sipped my beer and watched the moon light bouncing off the little waves in the lake. There was still a light glow on the western horizon where the sun had gone down and I could see the outline of the mountain peaks towering over the little lake. I slowly faded off to sleep with the sound of the lake waves gently lapping on the rocks.<br><br>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, the lantern was out too. The moon was gone and it was pitch black. Something was wrong. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. I was paralyzed. I could hear my heart thumping as I strained to hear something in the bush, all was quiet. I had a horrible uneasy feeling. I gathered myself together and started kicking around the fire, a small flame came alive and I quickly threw on some wood. In the firelight I could see that the boy had awoke and was shocked to see his wide open eyes staring at me. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing, go climb in the tent.&quot; I lied. He crawled into the tent but even in the light of fire I couldn&#039;t shake my wariness.

I finally instructed the boy to wake up and go get in the truck. I packed up all of camp and drove around to the other side of the lake and slept with him in the truck. At dawn I got up and looked across the lake where we were camped earlier, and another uneasy feeling came over me. I decided it was time to go home.

It&#039;s honestly true. Any of us at ANY TIME can reach out and pray to Him, in all our authentic flaws will be evident to Him. Our genuine call will be heard and He will know your intent beyond all awareness. He is always patiently waiting. I&#039;ve known this but often doubted it... so much of this world has caused me to question the truth of God&#039;s love and power, of his glorious grace and forgiveness. Christ is as harsh as He is benevolent I&#039;ve learned... surrendering unto Him opens the pathway to a connection that will ignite all the lies in a blaze, like an unveiling, and truths will start to wash over you. It&#039;s amazing that all these years He was beside me always willing to guide me, offering me the lessons I needed... He is near us all. It just takes that one time to surrender it all... all that you think you are, all which you thought you knew. Like removing all attachments, all data, all identity, all power and asking Him &quot;please Lord of Lords, help me understand.. help me to know you. I want to forever be with you my God, help guide me.&quot; And if you are genuine and have faith, it will manifest. You will feel His presence, it will be with you constantly. Without the presence of man&#039;s influences, without all the data and rituals and dogmas... He will give you answers. And you WILL notice the world and people around you will challenge it. Satan and many doubts. Tricks and lies and ego will challenge. Your own mind will challenge the skeptic your own faith. <br><br>Be strong. The forging will be grown by Christ, God needed your willful choice to love and seek Him, then He will be with you, fill the hollowness of your soul. Nothing in the world can take that away from the children of God. So be humbled and honor it.

underground shit, like the young junkie in First Transmission (1982) who cuts his dick off in some seedy hotel room<br><br>anyway, in True Gore there&#039;s this supposedly leaked animal experiment footage of live pigs being blowtorched until their skin is literally turned into broken squares of bacon. the sad part is that they&#039;re still alive. you can see a scientist feeding one of the blowtorched pigs water after the experiment. always wanted to know what the fuck reason for doing that was or the origin of that video. anybody know WTF i&#039;m talking about please let me know. i&#039;m not into zoosadism or any of that vile shit, but just curious about that particular experiment. i&#039;ve only seen that pig blowtorch footage twice and never once on the internet (well,

In the past they were called shamans, priests, oracles, mediums, etc. Today? What happens if you tell people you see or hear things others don&#039;t? Everyone calls this schizophrenia and immediately starts treating them like a problem. They get gaslit, belittled, abused, bullied, generally treated like shit by everyone. So they quickly learn there&#039;s no one they can trust. They become paranoid, depressed, sad, angry, rejected. Their emotions become clouded with negativity. What happens when the veil is lifted, but while in intensely negative emotional states? It&#039;s similar to the turn a dream or psychedelic trip takes while in negative states. The things they see and hear become much darker. Instead of perceiving the presence of positive or even just neutral forces, they can only perceive negative ones. &quot;Demons&quot;. <br><br>Schizophrenics are literally just naturally spiritually gifted people who became possessed by demons/negative energy/entities due to abuse.

In fact, it&#039;s kind of a red herring to say &#039;without chemicals&#039; insomuch as it suggests that with chemicals people can perceive &#039;beyond the veil&#039; in the same way as those who are naturally gifted in this regard. Firstly, one is at the mercy of &#039;the chemicals&#039; and secondly, &#039;chemicals&#039; are not enhancing the mind so much as impeding certain mental functions that often get in the way of subtle perceptions. But any &#039;chemical&#039; can only do a partial job. There&#039;s a reason why so many traditions emphasize stillness, meditation, a quieting or focusing of the mind, or entering into a state of unknowing (or confusion) in order to access the &#039;ethereal&#039; realms.
