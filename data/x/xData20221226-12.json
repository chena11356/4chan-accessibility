Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying.

GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off.

It has put a massive divide/wedge between people and the &quot;collective conscious&quot; and thus dematerializes the group, also making them weaker and easier to exploit. That is why ideas and people are unable to rise against their oppressors. They have an alternate inner reality and don&#039;t share consciousness, thus their faith and collective power is highly diminished. I could go on and on but on a spiritual level, it&#039;s an effective divide and conquer tool, propaganda tool, etc. Use it but don&#039;t be used by it.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Don&#039;t step/lean on markers. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. If its close to a marker assume its an offering and leave it be. It should go without saying, don&#039;t take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br><br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, don&#039;t take photos of them intentionally. If a mourner approaches, put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after they are gone. <br><br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br><br>Use your best judgement as a rule of thumb<br><br>Some recommendations:<br><br>1) Boots. It gets muddy in some areas. Don&#039;t wear anything you&#039;re not ready to get soiled.<br><br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots, still videos and self photos. <br><br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration.<br><br>4) Get there as soon as it opens. In the early morning there are few to no people which will be best for photographs and not to inconvenience anyone. <br><br>5) Take photos of weird and interesting things you notice.

If I lay down at night, straight on my back and relax, the pain disappears completely. As soon as I shift to the side during sleep my whole arm falls asleep and my shoulder starts burning. Happens if I lay on both sides, but only the right shoulder has this problem. If I go about my day the pain mostly stays at the base of the neck. Idk maybe its a herniated disc. But I had everything checked and even went to chiro/physio at my own expense. Nothing helped. I have random jolts in my limbs or stinging in my dick during ejaculation. Sometimes I have locked up fingers. Im aware of my posture and muscle tightness. And all my problems started during an depressive episode where I drank, smoked alot of weed and ate like shit. I randomly woke up one day and felt like this ever since. I quit all drugs and im very active now. My guess is some parts of my central nervous system are damaged or inflamed. <br>Idk what to do and my shit doctor doesnt listen to me.

How much do you care about the happiness and fulfilment of an ant? None. <br><br>If that ant was helping you fight a war against your immortal enemies, then perhaps you would care more, but if that ant doesn&#039;t do anything for you, you don&#039;t feel anything towards that ant. The same is true with God. God isn&#039;t sitting here pulling all of the strings of life. Yahweh is more like a powerful ghost and a necromancer. <br><br>He does have some pretty strong magic, he can protect you from things, but that has always been dictated by the extent of your faith and piety. God isn&#039;t going to help his enemies any more than any other general of an army. <br><br>Yahweh is the equivalent of Roman Ares, and there&#039;s a reason that it appears that God influences the world so little in the West. Yahweh had very strict commandments, very strict rules to ensure his divine army was healthy, strong, clear minded, and of sound genetics. The west does not uphold these commandments, and beyond that, most all people engage in Canaanite rituals, despite the fact that the entire point of the Cult of Yahweh, and the entire point of the Bible, was to explicitly prohibit Canaanite rituals. <br><br>The basis of the Abrahamic faith is not some random willy-nilly bullshit, the entire basis of all of the commandments after the first handful from Exodus shared with the other Canaanite religions is that God explicitly prohibits 100% of the rituals of the Canaanites. The backbone of the Abrahamic faith is ritual purity, as opposed to the backbone of the Canaanite faith being ritual mixing. It&#039;s an entirely antithetical faith, meaning that it is not based in &quot;doing something&quot; but rather &quot;abstaining from something&quot;.

You can find endless discussion and debate over what exactly Lilith is (protip, Lilith is Lilith, nothing less nothing more. I love how much debate and controversy she causes though. Fools don&#039;t realize that feeds her also). I typically refer to a spirit by whatever title is most commonly attributed to them, unless I am asked to call them something different, or if I personally feel something else would be more appropriate. Demons for instance were typically gods at one point until Christianity started waxing in power and everything that was not christ or christ supporting became a &quot;demon&quot;.

Everything about this place is designed to torture you. Just last year I thought for the first time in my life I may have finally landed a girl (I am M28 btw) and then within the space of a week lost her and she turned basically all my friends against me, my computer of 8 years quit on me and the support team I was using LOST THE FUCKING HARD DRIVE. If I had not been paranoid enough to clone it every 3 days I would have been screwed. AND I ended up in the hospital. All of that happened in the space of about a week and I was suicidal for a while. Eventually, I managed to pick myself up a bit and started working with someone I met online with occult stuff and thought I had found an actual mentor as I had been searching for one for the entire 3 years with no luck but that situation basically ended with it being a scam and that was basically my last year. That whole experience is semi-normal to me as I can&#039;t name a single thing in my life that has gone right that I could say &quot;yeah I am glad I was around to experience that&quot; at this point, I just want to find a way out of here and while I know AP won&#039;t move the physical body out of here any escape at all is a start and I know the information on magic that advanced will not be found on earth.

You can create alternate personalities which take you over, you can engage in possession, you can Astral Project and allow another spirit to take control, whatever, you are still tied to this body even if it is a relatively weak link. You are just as much the physical consciousness and intelligence CREATED by your brain as you are the spirit and soul which is RECIEVED by the brain.<br><br>I have never astral projected in the traditional sense so I cannot give you any tips for that, but I also don&#039;t think success in that goal will really give you what you are looking for.

Not perfect, I don&#039;t think anyone can fully understand the process, at least not with the thinking logical mind, but enough I can give you some information. You know how certain religions talk about judgement after your death? Well, this is very real, though most misunderstand the mechanics behind it and the reasons for it. In short though, everything you are desperately wishing to run away from you will be forced to confront. Are you prepared for that? I can assure you, you are not. It will not be done kindly nor gently, no, it is much better to work through as much of that as you can in your life before you must meet death.

After getting completly destroyed by years of depression and other social problems I found myslef diving deeper into all kind of &quot;paranormal&quot; stuff. I went from christianity to gnosticism, then onto New Age shit, Earth is a prison and we are being controlled by lizards stuff, even &quot;spiritual&quot; satanism. I always dropped them because I would later find new information which would shed a bit more light onto everything. Thus I am now here, in this cicle, going from christianity to gnosticism to Lizard people and repeat. My main problem is I can&#039;t bring myself to &quot;subscribe&quot; to one of them. Yes, moraly I find myself aligning with christianity, yet at the same time I cannot bring myself to devote myself blindly to a god. Furthermore I am to fucking indifferent to everything happening around me. As I said, letting the depression run amok for several years creates scars that I cannot heal anymore.

AFAIK no actual gnostic texts have survived, so anyone claiming to say &quot;this is what gnosticism is&quot; is necessarily flawed in their understanding. Gnosis means knowledge, and gnosticism is the system by which you cultivate a personal relationship with the divine. Your spirit is begging you &quot;Stop following! Stop following!&quot;, listen to it. Cut your own path. If you are wrong that is fine, you absolutely will be at first and will definitely make mistakes. It is all a part of learning. Pick from each what pleases you, and ignore the rest. The divine has no need to make sense to the minds of fickle tiny humans, so do not expect everything to make sense. I hope this has helped.

You need to account also for the physical memories and experiences your brain and body have processed. They won&#039;t just disappear. To make such a shift like that you would need enough energy and force to overcome those memories and experiences. That amount of energy is not trivial, to the contrary it is very significant. Otherwise you can attempt to shift your consciousness to a 5 dimensional perspective and slowly change the amount of energy expenditure and consciousness this version of yourself receives, and over to a more ideal version of yourself (the one where you are not dwave affected). This still leads to the uncomfortable reality where the version of yourself here exists still, but is essentially abandoned by the spirit and deemed to be &quot;dead weight&quot; or &quot;unnecessary&quot;.<br><br>You might find Liber Kaos interesting, the first section of the book deals with certain quantum principles and chaos theory.

It is extremely tragic and unfortunate that these things happen and quite possibly happen with the regularity of the sun rise. In order to preserve thousands of years of curated cultural knowledge and esoteric wisdom, cybernetics could be the solution we need. Neuralink could make the education system obsolete. You would receive a personalized education from what amounts to a supreme benevolent intelligence that exists to serve you. If that intelligence had the blessing of the church, according to the irrefutable moral authority of God, it would be appropriate to call it a minister of the Lord. Artificial intelligence is not evil or satanic by any metric. The mark of the beast has nothing to do with cybernetics. The mark of the beast is the united states dollar.

It&#039;s an idea that has its roots in Lurianic Kabbalah and other forms of apocalyptic occultism. The basic idea is that man is God and hasn&#039;t realized it yet and that the end of the world will involve us having some sort of awakening to our divinity. In the Zohar, there&#039;s a mention of people in the last days eating the flesh of Leviathan to realize the unity of all things (Leviathan is a sea creature in the Bible, which has connotations of chaos if you know about ANE religious tropes, and by the middle ages Leviathan was considered a demon by Christians).

What are we progressing towards? Nobody is ever too explicit on that point, although it&#039;s always understood that this progression is related to technological advancement somehow. But combine the exoteric mythology of humanistic progress with the esoteric Masonic origins of Enlightenment thought and with other important occult currents like Lurianic Kabbalah and Sabbateanism that call for engineering the end times and the coming of a messiah...and I think it becomes clearer.<br><br>The explicitly evil SRA and NWO technocracy stuff is very likely a dialectical ploy in this agenda of engineering an occult apocalypse. Make the world as evil and chaotic as possible so that a &quot;savior&quot; figure can appear and lead us to the knowledge that we&#039;re all God. And some sort of singularity event could well play a big role in that. The groundwork for the end of strict materialism and scientism is already being laid by narratives like quantum mysticism, Perennialist one world religion stuff, the new age, eco-mysticism etc. All pushed by extremely shady people, including a lot of controlled opp figures in conspiracy circles.

In the country of pink and orange sand, there was a great evil. That consumed the very energy of life itself. Every day, Masses were sacrificed into it. They had their very souls ripped from their bodies to feed the evil. <br><br>My master and I arrived at this land to put a stop to it. We were summoned to the palace of the king. It was there that we met the ruling family and the priest who orchestrated the feeding of this evil. My master tried to reason and plead with them. But they refused. So he killed the young king and the old priest. And to make sure that no revenge down the generational line would occur, he killed all the women and children too. Then he leaped down into the heart of evil and destroyed it. The evil itself was black upon black, darker than dark. No light escaped it. It was like a black hole. But also it was an egg of sorts. Holding an even greater evil, ready to emerge and destroy the world. This egg was encased in crystalline clear glass like cube. As soon I touched the surface of the enclosure, I died. I recall my body falling to the ground and my petty soul being consumed by eternal darkness. Then I heard my master&#039;s voice. I saw his face. In his grief and his rage. I saw him grab this evil. He put his arms inside of the evil tore it apart from the inside out. The evil gushed and bled dark blood and screamed a horrible screech. Finally it was over.

All of the cool legend shit is being expressed some way here, that regards psychic work that succeeds in being phenomenal. <br><br>You are not the nobody. The nobody is an effigy of many individuals. Each story is always related to a legend of some kind, adding to the lore when posts stand out. <br><br>The nobody is a person. Which person is being talked about, however, is not disclosed, nor will ever need to be. The legend has a signature. If you see yourself? Maybe a troll trying to give you psychosis, happens from time to time. Or a mysterious cowboy-senpai who have noticed you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i piss many distances in the wild</span><br><br>Who knows :3", "filename": "IMG_20220713_221310", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2592, "h": 4608, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672041432292021, "time": 1672041432, "md5": "fY1W7DAiYgnLnVotpiT1EQ==", "fsize": 2827665, "resto": 33687862}, {"no": 33688661, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:57:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688643</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No crime was committed</span>", "filename": "Thiccboi", "ext": ".gif", "w": 360, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672041451501030, "time": 1672041451, "md5": "7SV9AZE8G2J+Byr4FoSbhg==", "fsize": 2843504, "resto": 33687862}, {"no": 33688662, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:57:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688649</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRd<wbr>xUFDoQe0", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 500, "h": 373, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1672041468738028, "time": 1672041468, "md5": "z+CP8HgEKJH7qHHl6A+ipA==", "fsize": 179992, "resto": 33687862}, {"no": 33688669, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)02:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688641</a><br>I did the wrong your.

From my experience, trying to do the whole telepathy larp is just asking for additional episodes of psychosis. Because as I have been able to determine so far, there DOES seem to be data transfer somehow between us, but that data is encrypted and sent along a substrate most people can&#039;t in any &quot;hear&quot; nor &quot;feel&quot; in their head. But schizophrenics seem to have lost that partition in most cases, and thus hallucinate random voices. Each &quot;thought&quot; parsed from someone is given a certain tag word/phrase that acts as a type of signifying device to the brain as to what specific &quot;key&quot; it needs to use to unlock that thoughtform and thus procure of the knowledge, of which has been scrubbed of any personally distinguishing trace from the person it was articulated from. The cryptography along with the scrubbing ensures that no traceback nor feedback is received nor transferred as much as possible (there are the rare &quot;occasions&quot;, though). Whenever the thoughtform is received by a brain, the thoughtform will usually &quot;say&quot; it&#039;s tag, then the area of the brain in charge of handling that data uses the appropriate key, and if you&#039;re schizo while also being of a certain &quot;cognitive fortitude&quot;, will result in you &quot;hearing&quot; it - not audibly, but it will &quot;feel&quot; like it was. This is bad because it affects all sorts of internal acoustics and wiring concerning your semantic feedback and interpretation, which then has the unfortunate side-effect (if your mental illness is exacerbated and/or goes untreated long enough) of air-based signal noise coming from the very environment being processed through your cochlear as if air being emitted from vocal chords.<br><br>So, yeah... not a good idea to, telepathy, if you&#039;re not gonna be able to someone communicate those parameters and ALSO get your brain to 100% obey.", "time": 1672052860, "resto": 33687862, "trip": "!!0Rp9iOEulLg"}, {"no": 33689394, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)06:13:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33689363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33689363</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not to inspire panic in people who play around with their minds, but it is vitally important to know yourself first and foremost. </span><br><br>Not everyone can even conjure up a tactic well enough to distort the simplicity of said intertwinings of hyperbridges.

If a forest was cut down to plant a farm and hundreds of animals lost their home, am I evil for buying vegetables in the store that came from that farm?</span><br><br>Your question is flawed. Most vegans like myself don&#039;t even necessarily think in such simplistic moralistic terms like &quot;evil&quot;. In my case, I was someone who was raised in an omnivore culture and socialised into eating animal flesh in various forms without questioning it, and I enjoyed it. Because of modern mass industrial agriculture I&#039;d never even seen an animal raised for slaughter. At some stage I made a mental, logical, emotional connection between eating this meat and the reality of the experience of animals who die for that food. Then I told myself that those animals probably lived pretty decent happy lives on farms and so on until a sudden and pretty painless death. At some stage, though, I looked into it and found that this isn&#039;t true - it&#039;s much more awful than any of that. It&#039;s simple empathy. I don&#039;t want others hurting or enslaving me. I wouldn&#039;t like someone firing a bolt-pistol into my brains, and my flesh being used for someone elses pleasure. Most of us are aware that humans transitioning to a different diet would involve lots of changes, and that there are moral issues including issue relating to the suffering of animals displaced by farming or insects killed in the production of food, etc. What we&#039;re doing is the most simple first step possible - we&#039;re saying &quot;I won&#039;t eat any of this&quot;, sometimes we do this as I originally did, thinking that others would follow and that I&#039;d send &#039;signals&#039; through consumer culture so that the world would change - and this definitely did happen to some degree, many of us just want like the idea of participating in it, even if we feel things won&#039;t change. Many anti-vegan posters think they have a &#039;gotcha&#039; moment with these questions, as if we aren&#039;t aware of them.", "time": 1671960005, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684019, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684004</a><br>Continuing...<br><br>The vegan diet still impacts animals, there is no debating this, it impacts in many many ways. Even when vegan food items are shipped anywhere, animals end up being killed as roadkill by those delivery trucks. Animals are affected constantly, in every little way. But the simplest point is that if anything is going to change, stopping killing highly complex animals like cows, pigs, and so on - who are clearly capable of not just sentience but high levels of intelligence, emotion, affection, fear, etc. I personally try to avoid killing insects but I would consider it a significantly worse thing to willfully kill a pig than even maybe many insects. This involves judgement and knowledge about what sentient and experience is, and all sorts of factors we can&#039;t claim to definitively know, but for the same reason most people wouldn&#039;t want to kidnap a human child and kill them, we don&#039;t want cows or pigs or chickens being treated so brutally or killed for their flesh, especially when it&#039;s not necessary.", "time": 1671960327, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684027, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684019</a><br>The issue is mostly RELATIVE HARM. Humans have to survive, and we impact the environment and other animals. Is it so unreasonable to say that we should try to MINIMISE this harm and suffering? That&#039;s what vegans are doing. No matter what you argue - producing food for a vegan diet would never have to impact as many lives, and especially wouldn&#039;t have to affect highly complex animals capable of greater levels of suffering. Also most of these anti-vegan arguments like &quot;Oh rats and small animals are killed by harvesters producing plants for vegans!&quot; are just petty, fake attempts to spin the argument - vegans want to minimise harm, generally farmers kill animals in those ways because they were raised in this omnivore culture that thinks it&#039;s justifiable to do so to produce food for humans. If vegans had their way - all vegan food would also be produced in ways that animals aren&#039;t killed in the process. This is entirely POSSIBLE, it would just take more effort, and would &#039;cost&#039; more to the end consumer.

The simple reality is that the present system is incredibly brutal, but mostly concealed from the publics eyes. Sometimes the most innocent beings imaginable - like beautiful little calves or piglets, are torn from the security of their mothers and siblings, put in a terrifying situation like transported on a very noisy, shaking truck, and then killed without sympathy. It&#039;s also a statistical inevitability that even if you assume all parties involved are doing their utmost to make it painless (which they aren&#039;t), that many animals aren&#039;t killed instantly the way they&#039;re supposed to, and instead suffer significant head trauma and injuries, in other cases things are much worse - like chickens routinely being improperly beheaded, and then boiled alive. All of this takes place merely so that others can enjoy the pleasure of eating this flesh, and we know that it&#039;s not necessary - that we can get all of our nutritional needs without any of this. We can even eat very WELL without this. So the question is, do you want to participate in this? Can you use your imagination and put yourself in the place of these animals?

When the animal dies at some point in its life, the soul of the deceased animal (deceased person) would then be reincarnated when the same person who sodomized the animal has a human baby. The human baby automatically gains the soul of the animal without any work simply because the sperm which formed them served as a container for the soul of the animal.

I knew there was no point in apologising for being stubborn, yet I felt guilt for running away from myself. Even so, I asked the questions on my mind, and was reminded how simple things are; that I overcomplicated things. For example, I&#039;ve been a vampire for a long time. Even if I ascend, that won&#039;t change. When acknowledging this side of me, I often added the disclaimer that I&#039;d like to be a &quot;good vampire&quot;. But my actions contradicted this: shying away from mutually beneficial ways to fulfil my needs, in favour of being an edgelord.<br><br>As I felt lost, I asked Lilith if she understands how I feel. To my surprise, she shook her head and said my internal conflict doesn&#039;t make any sense. I understood what she meant, and realised that figuring out what I want in this case isn&#039;t a matter of understanding how I feel, but simply of making a decision. She asked me what I truly want, to which I asked for a hug. Admitting that&#039;s what I want meant I&#039;d made up my mind: that I want to accept people&#039;s warmth, and enjoy their company. Thus, I finally felt comfortable with putting my intentions into clear terms.<br><br>Having been in denial for so long, all it took for me to become what I decided to be was to put my feelings into action.

For years I was pointlessly gloomy, even though things had gotten better. Dragging others into that was just a feeble attempt to prolong my pain. But I had desentisised so much that I was starting to lose sight of what&#039;s positive and what&#039;s negative. And in fact, that&#039;s subjective to the point that not even Lilith could tell me what I &quot;should&quot; want.<br><br>When I made a wish 8 years ago, I was already deeply in conflict with myself. My teachers said with my talents, I could be anything I wanted. But with a mind broken by loneliness, all I could long for anymore was to be a loving man&#039;s housewife. And such a meagre sense of normality seemed so far out of reach, that I was even willing to &quot;sell my soul&quot; for it, offering up everything I valued and believed in.<br><br>But Lilith didn&#039;t allow that. She granted my wish without taking anything in return, confronting me with an obvious question: &quot;So, what do you want next?&quot; And thus, I began to question myself: &quot;Why did I think I wanted to be such a normal person? In the first place, wasn&#039;t I just arrogant for thinking I wasn&#039;t?&quot; Perhaps on some level, I began to wonder if the great depths of sorrow and pain I&#039;d overcome were all that truly set me apart. Upon further reflection, it became apparent that I had already begun to think of people&#039;s foregone despair as the essence of who I truly am deep down. And who was to say that it can&#039;t be? It clearly shaped my development as a person tremendously.<br><br>Yet, the shallow wish I&#039;d once made came from the bottom of my heart nonetheless. I finally understood why Mother Lilith hugs me so often: no matter what kind of path one may be on, it&#039;s always better with company. And in understanding that, I began to remember what my true will once was, in the absence of boredom and despair:<br>I want to make people happy.<br><br>The difference lies only in what I choose to do.

First off, we live in a world where there is television you know. And on these televisions there are ghost shows and we also have internet. So if you fucking kikes have so many goddamn questions about ghosts, and negative entities and what happens when you die, has it ever crossed your dull ass mind that if you turned the goddamn tv on an put it on one of those shows or looked at mediums an psychics on youtube or something you know, who actually do this shit, maybe you&#039;d find all the answers to these questions but since you&#039;re ignorant and can&#039;t do something as simple as turn the fucking tv on I&#039;ll break it down to you, for the 30th time. We live in a DUAL world meaning there is Positive and Negative. Everything falls under one of those two categories from emotions, to actions, to things we say, do, think. When a person dies, if they don&#039;t go into the light portal out of this plane, they become a ghost an get left on this DUAL plane of existence. Since they are still in this DUAL dimension, they still have to follow the rules of DUALITY. So the negative, earthly emotions that only exist here becomes like a food source that makes them more physical, alive. Like Chucky when he started to become more human the longer he stayed as a doll, well that&#039;s what happens when ghosts feed off negativity, fear, evil, it makes them more alive again, it makes them feel more physical and human because they are dead, they aren&#039;t physical beings anymore so they feel they need this. So when a ghost is in your house an you see a big monster, its really a helpless old lady, but she&#039;s making projections to make you emit fear so she can feed off of it.", "time": 1671912807, "resto": 33680136}, {"no": 33680384, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:14:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33680256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33680256</a><br>Some entities feed on attention.
