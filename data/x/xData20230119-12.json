The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE)", "filename": "Aryanz", "ext": ".png",

These ancient civilizations and their ability to work with hard rocks like granite has always interested me, and it&#039;s clear that archeologists are either not being honest or not bothering to check in with geologists and mechanics. That being said, I think I have figured out how they did this and I actually think it was more of a chemistry feat than a mechanical one (though obviously some sort of drill was involved, I just don&#039;t think it had to have been particularly complex).<br>I think that both they and at least the civilization before the Incas managed to make a fairly concentrated hydrofluoric acid. There are plants this can be sourced from and it&#039;s possible to store it in glass without significant corrosion to the container. The hydrofluoric acid would have been able to soften the rock, and applications of wax around areas they did not want to be softened would have allowed for some extreme precision. This could have also allowed for very nice polishing depending on how they used it and with what tools. This would unsurprisingly not leave behind much evidence, as it wouldn&#039;t last long the moment its container cracked or leaked, and finding glass in full pieces is extremely rare due to its fragility.<br>The only question for the Egyptians would be what plants they sourced this from, and the process they used to concentrate it. I can say for certain that in South America e.g., Peru, plants that can be used to source hydrofluoric acid are available. It would be a matter of investigative experimentation to figure out how they concentrated this and applied it, but considering the complex methods we know that all cultures have managed to use plant materials, it&#039;s safe to assume they figured that out. <br>I&#039;ll try to find some pictures of the quarry evidence I&#039;m talking about, where you can clearly see that hard rock was somehow &quot;scooped&quot; away from desired pieces as if it had been softened into more of a clay or mud for extraction.", "time": 1674123092, "resto": 33868339}, {"no": 33879446, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)05:25:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33879398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33879398</a><br>Adding in, they could have also done this without significant damage to tools despite its corrosive nature, because they probably would have had to let whatever solution they had sit on the exposed area for some time for it to work (its likely this was more of a pulpy puree rather than a pure liquid, as this would have been easier to work with, and would make more sense starting from plants). It probably wasn&#039;t as corrosive as concentrated hydrofluoric acid like what we have today, but basic refining could have gotten a plant-based solution to something potent enough to corrode rock like granite if they applied it multiple times and let it sit for let&#039;s say, 20 mins to 1hr each application. <br>From there, they could work quickly enough to not significantly damage stone tools, at least enough to get a project done. To be fair, if they had this method and were using stone tools (or at least stone for where the tool made contact), making new tools probably wasn&#039;t too much of an issue. <br>I&#039;m not sure about metals like bronze since my run-ins with hydrofluoric acid in the lab were usually me wiping a spill with a towel by instinct and watching my towel disappear kek.

You cannot &quot;reverse&quot; it since it is literally gene therapy. Keep in mind that because the vaccine is experimental, so are the proposed solutions for it - that also means the effects they mitigate are only the ones that we know about so far.<br>1) All of the below should be done as soon after exposure as possible. The longer you wait, the less effective they are.<br>2) Aspirin. First 7 days, 160-240mg twice per day. After first 7 days, 80-160mg twice per day. Morning and night - keeping your blood thinner is important in the prevention of clotting causing stroke or severe loss of circulation. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH ACETAMINOPHEN OR IBUPROFEN.<br>3) Ivermectin. If you source from veterinary products (e.g. horse paste), you use the dose measurement it comes according to your weight as closely as possible. Put a small amount on your lips and wait for 1 hr to ensure you have no adverse reactions to the flavorings or preservatives in it. <br>Take 1 dose per day for 3 days. Repeat monthly for 3-6 months. You should also take 1 dose per day for 3-5 days should you get sick with COVID, vaxxed or not.<br>3) Vitamins C, D, K and Zinc. Really you can just take a daily vitamin but pay attention to the amounts because you&#039;ll want at least 120%. Note: If you are a woman and the vax hasn&#039;t rendered you infertile, you should NOT take vitamin C in high amounts while pregnant or trying to become pregnant.<br>4) Pumpkin seed oil. Promotes better circulation and heart health. Take daily and consider it part of your daily vit regimen.<br>5) Garlic, ginger and thyme. Concentrated tablets or oils daily. Helps prevent and treat respiratory illnesses (which you are now more susceptible to) and promotes better circulation.<br>6) Avoid long periods of sitting down and high-intensity exercise. Circulation is a major concern for you now.

Should be done as soon as possible, but at any point is better than never. Water, tea, and coffee are OK, you just need to kickstart the autophagy process that will destroy the spike proteins in your body. 3 days minimum, but 4 to 7 is ideal (the first 3 days are the only ones that suck anyways).<br>8) Sunlight and/or infrared light. The most recent research is showing that exposure to sunlight and IR are surprisingly effective against COVID; this includes the spike proteins from the vaccine. This is not purely because of vitamin D, but it helps with that too.

But for what it&#039;s worth, I got mine on Amazon for like $12 and that was several doses (horse version; most reliable). Developing countries will sell often tablets OTC at the pharmacy, but you can almost always find it OTC and cheaply for livestock. The only thing you need to be concerned about when you go that route for any medications is paying attention to dose per kg for humans, which can differ from the dose recommendation for the animal. But in the case of ivermectin, it&#039;s not an issue. Also just checking to be sure that whatever flavorings and whatnot they use isn&#039;t something you&#039;ll react to, hence the lip test.

Generally speaking, unfortunately yes. I&#039;m sorry that happened to you. However, that&#039;s not to say it&#039;s all a loss. For one, there were major issues with consistent production and proper refrigeration of the vaccines. I.e. what people actually got varied a lot from person to person. You should check your batch out at howbadismybatch for the former. For the latter, if you haven&#039;t experienced major issues thus far (you&#039;re not dead so that&#039;s good) it&#039;s possible yours wasn&#039;t properly refrigerated, which would have severely impacted the &quot;effectiveness,&quot; i.e. lowered your risk quite a lot. For some people, it made their vaxxes completely moot. So don&#039;t give up all hope. The main frustration is not being able to know anything for certain, but there&#039;s always something you can do about it.<br>In addition to circulatory issues and immune system suppression, you&#039;ll want to pay attention to any neurological problems.

My mom grew up in beijing during the 60s -70s and when I was little she told me about the huge underground city which served as a nuclear shelter for all 6 million of Beijing&#039;s population at the time. The tunnels where built by ordinary people by the order of Mao, almost every house had a trapdoor that led to a tunnel to a bombshelter. All these tunnels and shelters where connected to each other, my mom told me that when she was a child she used to play in the tunnels due to them being cool under summer, and warm during winter. One could travel across the city through these tunnels, and the subway was connected to them, which was supposed to ferry people into the huge bombshelters in the mountains to the west of Beijing, there are still to this day a couple of secret subway stations on the western end of line 1 of the metro. Whole factories where moved underground and a fun fact is that Mao himself was embalmed deep down in the tunnels under Beijing. Now basically all of the underground city has been abandoned, exept for some parts that are used as cheap illegal living spaces for immigrant workers, and illegal operations such as drug labs and organ harvesting facilities. The city&#039;s underground is so hollowed out that they have trouble building certain subway lines.", "filename": "a0ccc9d07f3785848b_13658712_c07e205ef2_z", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 293, "h": 390, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674072393206777, "time": 1674072393, "md5": "dSwW0O0MmgVp7evzSzkLYA==", "fsize": 23045, "resto": 33872111}, {"no": 33874624, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:07:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33872111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33872111</a><br>it&#039;s not found footage<br>some chinky boy released it for his media grift<br><br>there is only one original &quot;found footage&quot; that started an entire blair witch genre of shit<br>and that&#039;s The Gable Film", "time": 1674072430, "resto": 33872111}, {"no": 33874656, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:10:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33872111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33872111</a><br>Fuck now what we prepare our asses for another chinese disease.", "time": 1674072654, "resto": 33872111}, {"no": 33874661, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:11:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33874619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33874619</a><br>that&#039;s nice<br>I&#039;d like to visit when china opens the fuck up for tourists", "time": 1674072701, "resto": 33872111}, {"no": 33874664, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33874617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33874617</a><br>Coming from the elite, this sounds plausible.

My mom grew up in beijing during the 60s -70s and when I was little she told me about the huge underground city which served as a nuclear shelter for all 6 million of Beijing&#039;s population at the time. The tunnels where built by ordinary people by the order of Mao, almost every house had a trapdoor that led to a tunnel to a bombshelter. All these tunnels and shelters where connected to each other, my mom told me that when she was a child she used to play in the tunnels due to them being cool under summer, and warm during winter. One could travel across the city through these tunnels, and the subway was connected to them, which was supposed to ferry people into the huge bombshelters in the mountains to the west of Beijing, there are still to this day a couple of secret subway stations on the western end of line 1 of the metro. Whole factories where moved underground and a fun fact is that Mao himself was embalmed deep down in the tunnels under Beijing. Now basically all of the underground city has been abandoned, exept for some parts that are used as cheap illegal living spaces for immigrant workers, and illegal operations such as drug labs and organ harvesting facilities. The city&#039;s underground is so hollowed out that they have trouble building certain subway lines.", "time": 1674076867, "resto": 33872111}, {"no": 33875278, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)16:23:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33874337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33874337</a><br>This.

It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying.

GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS.

So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

That&#039;s something to put in your journal</span><br>Unfortunately I was in a rush this morning and didn&#039;t have time to write it down, but you do bring up some interesting points. To be perfectly honest, I didn&#039;t actually masturbate in the dream, but came just by watching them as I felt their sexual energy. I was just worried I might sound like a weirdo if I put it that way, so as I was in a hurry (and felt self-conscious of my ability to climax without stimulation), I tried to phrase it in a more relatable manner.<br><br>Later, I was wondering if it was indicative of me wanting to do anything in particular sexually, and I thought &quot;Nah, I&#039;m happy just doing the usual stuff with my fianc\u00e9.&quot; Then I thought, what if these two had invited me to join them in the dream? I felt self-conscious again as I&#039;m unsure how I would&#039;ve responded in such a case, and I thought:&quot;I don&#039;t want to sound like some pervert who secretly wants to have a threesome.&quot; I&#039;m probably sounding like one right now, but my fianc\u00e9 deserves better than that, and I don&#039;t want to taint the bond I have with him in any way (such as by involving a third person). So even if hypothetically I&#039;d find the thought arousing if I dared to entertain it, that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s really something I&#039;d actually enjoy irl. Recently, I&#039;m learning that some things are only enjoyable as a fantasy, and that maybe that&#039;s okay? But I&#039;m still struggling with the &quot;maybe that&#039;s okay&quot; part. Allowing myself to enjoy fantasies is always something I struggled with, even in a non-sexual context such as video games, where I find myself trying to justify the choices I take in a game and getting upset if I do anything that doesn&#039;t suit me.

He was always whistling and sighing, and had annoying widget notifications on his phone which he refused to silence. I told him I was taking a break from the business and couldn&#039;t see him again.<br><br>Well, I then met a new client who looked 30 years younger, and he looked just like the annoying client.

When my grandmother died my mom and aunt were teenagers so my aunt became kind of a lost person. She eventually got sort of into religion as a comfort thing. Fast forward to her mid 20s she met some dude who was also semi religious and into all sorts of shit. He ended up drugging her a few times and I guess they would trip out and it might have fucked her up a bit. After that relationship she started looking into weird groups online and got into them pretty heavily. One was like a sci-fi religious based group? Like looking st stuff as if the bible and what not was from aliens instead of humans. Another group was like a doomsday group. Well eventually she found a perfect mix of all these things in this little fringe group online. She ended up buying many plane tickets to travel out to their &#039;leaders&#039; house. He claimed no one was the leader but clearly he was the one kind of running the group of like 20 people. She tried to convert my mom and dad many times and all growing up my mom tried to keep her in her life but also wanted to shield us from the crazy side. One time when we were in a road trip she broke into our house and replaced my dad&#039;s family bible, with this weird manuscript they had. Another time she showed up to a bbq with two other women from the cult and they kept writing notes down in little flip journals the entire time. One of the ladies gave me a hug and held me for a solid 30 seconds until someone was like uh okay that&#039;s enough come on knock it off. 1/?", "filename": "output (10)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674094889415463, "time": 1674094889, "md5": "kuFTCIIYawpOcUaGMuOWiw==", "fsize": 149722, "resto": 33877133}, {"no": 33877264, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:32:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33877210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33877210</a><br>Another time she ended up getting into a pretty bad car accident which resulted in her car flipping over.

So growing up it was always just a thing of oh there&#039;s Terry she&#039;s kinda strange, but my mom tried her hardest to not let me know about the cult stuff. My mom and aunts brother, my uncle, wanted to be supportive of her so he decided to go with her to one of these meetings and this is what he told us when he got back. My uncle is a pretty cool guy and open to any experiences. When he got to the house he said it looked normal until you went inside. Walls were painted black or dark red with little white splatters all over like someone flicked it from a few feet away. All the members had to dress the same in dark clothing and new members had to wear white. So they gave him white sweat clothes and shoes. They sat him down in a dark room lit by candles and played all sort of ambient weird remixed sounds. The leader guy read from his manuscript, all sorts of shit like rip off cthulhu stuff mixed with sci-fi movies, aliens, christianity, judaism, and talked about some end of the world even. My uncle sat there uncomfortable for two whole hours until randomly after he read a certain part all the members started to scream hysterically.

My uncle was completely freaked out but trying to not show it in case these people would harm him. After that they didn&#039;t give him his clothing or luggage back but kicked him out. He eventually got his wallet and keys back and immediately flew back him. My aunt swears it was innocent and to see if he was an evil spirit or some kind of creature trying to infiltrate their circle. My uncle laughs about it now but back when it happened he was super freaked out. My aunt gave his address to the leader who sent women there trying to seduce him to come back or at least stay apart of the group and try to bring new people and what not.

I guess she was just known as a crazy person at her work so she didn&#039;t have any friends outside the cult other than her neighbor who said they would interact every so often and that she seemed off but he wanted to be nice.

Consequently, advanced alien civilizations may have incentives to avoid space colonization to avoid taking up too much \u201ccalculating space\u201d and forcing a simulation shutdown.

Therefore bodies which are assumed in this way cannot either beget or bear.[7]<br><br>Because of this inability to create or nurture life, the method of the creation of a cambion is necessarily protracted. A succubus will have sexual relations with a human male and so acquire a sample of his sperm. This she will then pass on to an incubus, who then corrupts and strengthens the seed. The incubus will, in his turn, transfer this sperm to a human female and thus impregnate her.<br><br> Yet it may be said that these devils assume a body not in order that they may bestow life upon it, but that they may by the means of this body preserve human semen, and pass the semen on to another body.[7]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dont tell the succugen fags</span>", "filename": "4c45073c03181ae61a927d9267d1517d1bd14fcfr1-361-454v2_00", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 361, "h": 454, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674115299025930, "time": 1674115299, "md5": "XXbf+0wrApogFj/8NUSFTA==", "fsize": 31797, "resto": 33878933}, {"no": 33879056, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)03:18:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33878933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33878933</a><br>hreys are demons, vtubers are succubus", "time": 1674116307, "resto": 33878933}, {"no": 33879949, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)07:44:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33879007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33879007</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;life formally proceeds only from soul</span><br>So every living organism has a soul, according to them?

Glutathione depletion is a common attack vector, especially with Ochratoxin, and NAC becomes a protective shield against our DNA damage. It reduces it so much at that dosage that the body goes into surplus and begins repairing things. NAC actually repairs the guanine then protects it, so that it can repair longterm damage.

O2 + Hydrocarbon = H2O + CO2 + energy. Some magical traditions believe breath is related to fire. And of course, fire needs air to live too, so this is not too far fetched.<br><br>The hindus recognize that life is connected to breath. If you stop breathing, you die. If you&#039;re alive, you must be breathing. Even plants follow this rule, though they inhale CO2 and exhale O2 in a sort of marvelous reversal. That might explain sacred trees, secret groves, nature worship, etc. They are the necessary flip side of animal (and human) life. Your breath shows a window into your emotional state. A sudden gasp (stress), fast breathing (excitement), slow breathing (relaxion), etc. If you understand this, you can alter your breathing make the connection go the other way. These are breathing exercises.<br><br>Anyway, air and earth are present in almost every religion that has gods. As the story usually goes, air + earth create the first man or first god. These concepts are usually named the sky father (or heavenly father) and earth mother (or mother earth). In the old testament, this process is used to create adam rather directly. Clay + breath = adam, the first man. In the new testament, this is where jesus comes from, but more symbolically. The one above all (sky father) + mary (the earthly mother) = jesus. But these stories are everywhere. In any case, women create by having children. Men don&#039;t have children, so they create using ideas.<br><br>So what does air signify?

Religious visions usually involve deep trance (extremely deep), sleep deprivation, extreme fasting, high amounts/long lasting pain. Drugs are just drugs, but be careful because you want to be prepared before you take them. They work regardless of how religious/enlightened you are, so do some meditation/prayer and get some idea of what you&#039;re trying to learn (otherwise they can become just something you saw with no real meaning). NDE are obviously a risky choice.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

And in fact most of them can\u2019t. A lot of utopias sweep the hard problems under the rug, or would fall apart in ten minutes if actually implemented.<br><br>But let me suggest a couple of \u201cutopias\u201d that don\u2019t have this problem.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where instead of the government paying lots of corporate welfare, the government doesn\u2019t pay lots of corporate welfare.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where every country\u2019s military is 50% smaller than it is today, and the savings go into infrastructure spending.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where all hospitals use the same electronic medical record system, or at least medical record systems that can talk to each other, so that doctors can look up what the doctor you saw last week in a different hospital decided instead of running all the same tests over again for $5000.<br><br>I don\u2019t think there are too many people who oppose any of these utopias. If they\u2019re not happening, it\u2019s not because people don\u2019t support them. It certainly isn\u2019t because nobody\u2019s thought of them, since I just thought of them right now and I don\u2019t expect my \u201cdiscovery\u201d to be hailed as particularly novel or change the world.<br><br>Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason our current system isn\u2019t a utopia is that it wasn\u2019t designed by humans. Just as you can look at an arid terrain and determine what shape a river will one day take by assuming water will obey gravity, so you can look at a civilization and determine what shape its institutions will one day take by assuming people will obey incentives.<br>\u201c", "time": 1674130654, "resto": 33874853}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33877151, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:09:30", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "The dark side of YouTube", "com": "Post the weirdest thing you&#039;ve found on Youtube, anon.<br>This one is a video from a pretty deep rabbit hole about a Venezuelan girl with rich parents and possible schizophrenia who claims to be into some MKULTRA type of shit involving, among other things, Justin Bieber being the main bitch to a multimillionaire pedophile who wants to kill. her and everything around her.<br>https://youtu.be/CE0Qdd3QyS0", "filename": "Screenshot_2023-01-18-22-02-29-368_com.android.chrome", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 2400, "tn_w": 112, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674094170142498, "time": 1674094170, "md5": "EGxU9LxkWDtH/PUoJTP7jw==", "fsize": 402309, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-dark-side-of-youtube", "replies": 21, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 33877383, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:50:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS RABBITHOLE LMAOO, AND WTF IS BURDITT", "time": 1674096622, "resto": 33877151}, {"no": 33877384, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:50:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33877151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33877151</a><br>Sounds like typical schizo shit", "time": 1674096625, "resto": 33877151}, {"no": 33877430, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)21:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish dead rabbit radio or someone similar would go on rumble or something to have a nice multimedia record of pretty much every paranormal, schizo, alien and conspiracy thing that we&#039;ve brought up on this website.

There&#039;s also a neat backstory to it that I find pretty compelling.<br>You&#039;ve probably heard the Basques come up more than once with Atlantis. One lesser-known way they do is directly from the account of a Spanish explorer (I think it was Magellan, but I&#039;d need to recheck). He was in the Atlantic in a completely new unexplored area and was quite proud of being the first there - until he saw a ton of Basque fishermen around.

That&#039;s the reason it had so much fish.<br>The Basques and Irish Celts have an interesting genealogical connection and both have a backstory of coming by sea from a collapsed civilization - and both are known to be expert seamen. <br>This is also interesting because it would mean that hypothetically, some of them could have gone the other direction and ended up in North America. It&#039;s closer, but to be fair, ocean currents and winds would have actually favored them going toward Europe so it would make sense why so many ended up not going that direction.<br>The area from that explorer&#039;s account with the Basques is highlighted in pic and is the furthest north to the left.

The weird part of this whole ordeal was that I kept seeing the same number (33) &amp; I googled it and it said something about ascended masters etc. Also during this time I had a dream of a baphomet. Fast fast forward into the future &amp; I let go of all that stuff realizing it was the devil trying to fool me, but what I want to point out now in the future is that even now when I pray to the Lord and get real dedicated I start seeing 33 again. Someone told me before it was like the devil trying to mock Jesus Christ when I was all into the new age stuff. Why do I see the same thing but reversed when I become very close to God? Here&#039;s an example. I have a playlist full of gospel music &amp; EXACTLY when the artist says Jehova, Adonai, I turn around to look at a car and the lice se plate is 333, and these things don&#039;t happen just once. It happens multiple times. What is this phenomenon.. am I crazy? Because sometimes I legit feel autistic for what I see. Is it my brain just making patterns?

One of the women in my family constantly screamed at everything that scared here, I told her to be quiet multiple times so the monster doesn&#039;t find us. After the 3rd time I gave up trying to tell her to be quiet and ran to hide behind a different rock. The monster then came out running behind a little girl, who seemed to think it was a game, they came running to the rock I was behind and I started running around the rock to avoid being seen. After running about 2 times around the rock I fell on the ground out of exhaustion, the girl then ran past me, but I didn&#039;t see the monster following her, after a second or two the monster came around the corner.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end. Sometimes we just get too self conscious about it (which is what the mindfulness industry seems to profit off of).", "time": 1673854756, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33854306, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841531</a><br>Exactly.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

One important thing for me was realizing that much of what we want in meditation are the results. But you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; results, instead you do things which bring results.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

I tried it once but the pump was sending in a fine mist of pump oil and I couldn&#039;t stand it. Our solution was to take one of those snorkel tubes and stuff it full of rags to filter out the oil. The spot we chose to test it out was a decent size pond that connected up to the drainage system of a newly constructed shopping center/strip mall type place. My friend goes in with the new filter and he is going right towards the large black plastic corrugated drainage tube. all of a sudden, the tubing jerks and a whole bunch of bubbles blast out of the water. the line, still belching air, was separated from the snorkel and my friend was gone. He had gotten sucked into the drainage tube sideways and was blocking the flow like a log jam. Some how he got loose but when he did he got sucked down the drainage tube out to where it opens up into a ditch by the street. Miraculously, he was able to hold his breath and come out alive at the other end. From Our perspective, he had just disappeared and he didn&#039;t come back up. We went in looking around the edge of the pond trying to find him, hoping that he was just playing a joke and that he had swam away unseen somehow. It didn&#039;t make sense but we where so desperate and scared we couldn&#039;t understand at the time. Minutes since he disappeared, two police came and hollered at us, and when we looked over, our friend was with them. He was wearing his shirt tied up around his waste, tied up like a loincloth, with a decent gash across his chest from where he was pressed up against the pipe. Later, he recalled that his pants had been torn off, and he was gasping for air, half naked, in a huge rocky ditch where the police happened to see him as they where driving by. Nothing can describe the terror I felt when I realized that he wasn&#039;t going to come back up.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project.

The orgies never end there anon. So unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die, and have as much of whatever kind of sex you want forever. As one NDEr said, if people knew how awesome heaven is there would be mass suicide all over the world immediately.<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

Most people\u2019s sexuality is driven by lust for things on the material plane and therefore hinder this. You have three options. You can either seek an alternative path to comprehension of spiritual reality (Crowley seems like a good modern example of someone who tried to do this). Or you can go the traditional route and renounce your physical desires. Or you can decide that you\u2019re quite happy with your sexual desires on the material plane, and that you don\u2019t mind not pursuing ascension on the spiritual plane in this lifetime. I\u2019m of the belief that that last option is not a bad one for most people, as long as they still follow objective morality. Not everyone needs to or can become a holy man or a wizard.

wills it. so god can also change our reality on us, and he will do this to us when we die. at that time, to make us complete, god will reveal every thing. the bible describes this with a few famous quotes &quot;all will be revealed&quot; and &quot;the truth with set you free&quot;. he is the great redeemer. what we experience as pain and suffering is actually a distance between our hearts(souls) and the truths of our infinity context. think of an infinity context like a cell that is well regulated, but when it is filled with junk it becomes deformed and unregulated. an unregulated cell is basically filled up with a lot of truths and falsehoods they are unaware of or are deceived into believing are opposite. this is the process of entropy. when u die god clears the entropy, a physically impossible process within the universe&#039;s physical laws. he does this by revealing every truth of your past and of your essence.<br><br>all pain is coming from deception, and that can be self deception or external deception. when god gives truth behind pain, he is giving a universally acceptable meaning for the pain. these are answers to questions we do not have answers for on earth - why
