No I don&#039;t know much about it, I get channelled some info from guides, I get downloaded visions and messages from higher self...and I got some basic remote viewing abilities.

It&#039;s not so much about rules but how the energy connects. A divine being is partly connected to universal consciousness/god through their higher chakras and higher self, so their decisions are aligned, the term co-creator is about right - you can do stuff but only if it aligns with universal will. Other beings function based on vampirism, so they cut off from their higher self/god and do what they want, but they are dependant on loosh energy of others. They also don&#039;t realize their connected to a hierarchy of dark beings more powerful than them.<br><br>So ultimately, we have less free will, and more of our thoughts/feelings and wishes actually flow down from higher angels and higher demons into us, which we believe is our own free will. The only law I can think of for divine intergration is respecting the free will of other souls, that is, not trying to control or manipulate them without their consent. That&#039;s it.<br><br>3.

It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions.

No one really knows exactly how and why it happens though. I think Buddhists call it the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot;, or &quot;falling into the pit of the void&quot;, and ideally you just keep meditating and come out the other side feeling more enlightened than ever. I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t always go so well though.

I asked Cassiel to prove it was really him with some knowledge I could verify that I would not otherwise know. He did not really prove anything to me.

Yesterday I began reading more about energy too in a way very much like I read from Castaneda.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Dont step/lean on markers. If you see knocked over offerings, try and pick it up and place it upright, whenever not too much of an inconvenience. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. it should go without saying, dont take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br><br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, dont take photos of them intentionally. If someone approaches put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after theyre gone. <br><br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br><br>Some reccomendations:<br><br>1) Boots. It gets muddy in some areas. Dont wear anything youre not ready to get soiled.<br><br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots and selfies. <br><br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration.<br><br>4) Get these as soon as it opens.

But as years passed and shit happened, i realize that idea is a utopia, a childish dream. Doesnt matter how, but eventually, a differents ways of life will clash each other, because is a lie that &quot;whatever you do in your room affect only you&quot;, eventually, it will go out intimacy sphere and start to collision with other ways of life in the public. Is a lie that some groups onlly want &quot;living peacefully&quot; or &quot;having the same rights&quot;, eventually, they will start to claiming privileges as rights, and shaming those who negates those privileges, is human nature to ever want more. The simpler example i can give, is two neighbours, one want to live peacefully, almost in complete silence, but the other, wants a full party style life. Eventually, they will crash, they will fight, because the way of living of one, is contrary to the other, and even if they agreed to reduce their living expectations to satisfy each other, some day, for some reason, they will fight again, and the only solution will be that someone moves out, or the other to change.

Magic, generally speaking, still does not recognize the ego-inflationary aspect of its own system - which is why there are so many casualties. If it would incorporate Reichian therapy into itself and make it a part of Magic, then it would have some kind of objective system to correct its ways and prevent its students from fouling up their own nests. Mere education in the phenomenon is no answer to this problem. Frater Achad, theoretically, was educated in the notion of \u201cdestroying the ego\u201d by crossing the Abyss, so-called, but it did not save him from inflationary activities of the ego such as asserting the equivalence of his own grade of Neophyte (1)=[10] with the supernal grade of Ipsissimus (10)=[1]. This is asinine from the ordinary point of view and doesn\u2019t make sense. It only becomes intelligible from the viewpoint that the very process of Magic puffs up the ego.

The eight is number of ambition and manifesting, having big dreams and wanting to bring them to world. The eight is ruled by Saturn. You&#039;ll face a lot of obstacles but you should have the fortitude to overcome them if you have courage. Eights can also be very materialistic, it would be wise to guard yourself from baser instincts like greed. <br><br>the personality number is how people perceive you. The personality number 3 is the number ruled by Jupiter. It&#039;s seen as the optimist number, the person who usually sees the positive in life. They&#039;re usually very keen on their appearance and appear very attractive to the opposite sex and can be quite the charmer. There are pitfalls of the three though. The three has the tendency of being carefree, not taking life seriously and potentially letting opportunity fly by. However, with your soul urge of 8, the number of determination and ambition, it probably shouldn&#039;t be an issue. The personality three would also help to iron out some of the harsher and aggressive aspects of your soul urge. <br><br>The expression number is the numeric value of your entire name and in a very basic sense, describes what sort of talents you have, how you would express them and what sort of short comings you need to be on the lookout for. The number 11, is considered a master number which is amplifies the root value of the number. In this case, the 11 will be more sensitive but more intuitive than a standard 2.

It can completely throw off your chart. But you do have a 16/7 lifepath. That&#039;s tough. The purpose of the 16 when presented in our charts is to remove old remnants of our past selves, so we can achieve a greater level of consciousness. This typically has to do with one&#039;s ego. It&#039;s believed that you may have used your overinflated ego from previous lives to cause harm and now you must remove ego through humility and loss.

The placement of these karmic debts are more strongly felt when they&#039;re placed in different areas of your chart, unfortunately the lifepath is consider the most dominate number in our charts.

But Gobekli Tepe is the rare example where academia has actually been pretty receptive. It\u2019s not suppressed at all (I was taught several lectures about it in my first year alone) and people have been pretty open to debating what the discovery means for our preconceived notion that urbanism was a result of agriculture. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so frustrating when people accuse academics of trying to suppress it, or use it as proof of a continent spanning ancient civilisation (all current proof points to it being a settlement used by local semi-nomadic peoples only).<br><br>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?<wbr>hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=gobekli+tepe&amp;o<wbr>q=Gobekli+", "time": 1671524955, "resto": 33635580}, {"no": 33648093, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:14:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33647927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33647927</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schmidt</span><br>Ok that will work, thanks.

Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism. It was a popular belief system in ancient India.<br><br>One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.<br><br>In 8th century CE Jaina literature, Saddarsanasamuccaya by Haribhadra, Lokayata is stated to be the Hindu school where there is &quot;no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.&quot;<br><br>Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.<br><br>Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena.

There used to be a lot more interest in investigating these matters. Scientists today tend to investigate the kind of subject for which you can easily get funding, they are establishment whores and care little for actual truth. There have been rigorous scientific studies where phenomena like telepathy and telekinesis are proven true (I&#039;m talking p value &gt; 0.05), but these studies like so many facts today get solemnly buried and are never officially acknowledged. Try getting the study published in a respected scientific periodical and the peer-review bureaucracy will veto it. Try writing about it on Wikipedia and there&#039;s an army of apparatchiks ever ready to revert your edits and reprimand you on the Talk tab for being a snake oil salesman crook fraud peddling unsubstantiated claims and pseudoscience. <br><br>Everything that falls under the umbrella of &quot;science&quot; is subject to a materialist agenda, whether we&#039;re talking didactic textbooks, Discovery Channel documentaries, university curricula, scientific periodicals. There is a rule that the paranormal/spiritual/supernatural must never be acknowledged, even when there happens to be evidence for it. The big trick is how *respectability* is allocated when the subject is covered. In every TV report about exorcist priests, for instance, they will first interview the priest, who will tell the reporter that spirits exist and so forth, and then they will interview some anthropologist, sociologist or psychologist duly accredited by a respectable university who will proceed to say, in so much academese-ridden bilge, that it&#039;s all fake. <br><br>These specialists will never explain how it is that sometimes the possessed will fluently speak Latin or Greek even when they don&#039;t know a lick of these languages, and other paranormal phenomena that often accompany exorcism sessions.", "time": 1671474358, "resto": 33636172}, {"no": 33642430, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:27:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33640831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33640831</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aware and conscious individuals are allowed into Switzerland</span><br>I lived in Geneva for a year and it sucked bad.", "time": 1671474423, "resto": 33636172}, {"no": 33642548, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "2/2<br><br>The reason Daniel Dennett is still talking about Uri Geller decades later, ever with a tone of superlative scorn, is that Geller&#039;s psychic abilities were threatening the narrative.

Are any people here into philosophy besides the weird schizoconspiracy shit? I had some mystical insights reading philosophy myself.<br><br>At the start of philosophy was Plato, who believed in two realsm. There is the everyday realm, of bodies and objects which whither away, and then there is the timeless realm of the Ideas, which the trained philosopher can percieve with his mind&#039;s eye; one can compare this to a third eye of some sorts.<br><br>Deleuze believed philosophers created concepts out of the plane of immanence; a sort of undivided &quot;field&quot; of energies, forces, flows, without humans, without subjects, without consciousness. Life, death, and all dualities and dialectical relationships are non-existent on this plane.<br><br>Then Schopenhauer. He literally believed that the reality of individual objects in time and space; what he called &quot;the world as representation&quot;; is an illusion; all that exists is the fundamental unity of the Will. You are Will, I am Will, there are no humans, there aren&#039;t even beings. This is simply the veil of the Will covering your eyes.<br><br>Then Derrida, who believed that language is a completely empty system; that the idea of another person having written this message is an illusion stemming from a belief in &quot;logocentrism&quot;.<br><br>Berkeley thought all of reality is subjective idas; the only thing binding it together is the universal observer: God.<br><br>So, anyone into philosophy?

The first reference to it appears in the 2nd century Christian pseudipigraphical work called the Testament of Solomon where the Archangel Michael gives the ring to Solomon and he used it to force demons to build the first Temple. But the 1st century Jewish historian Josephus mentions similar ring amulets that Jewish magicians used to control demons. The Talmud also make references to a magic ring Solomon used to control certain demons like Asmodeus and Lilith. The overall design of the ring however comes from later Islamic mystics, who adopted the legend of the seal of Solomon and represented it as a hexagram to control genies. The Jews adopted this design into their understanding of the seal via the Kabbalists who began to make heavy use of it in their theurgy. By contrast in the Christian west the seal came to be represented by the pentagram being interpreted Christologically as repressnting the wounds of Chist but it has subsequently become associated with modern withcraft and neo-paganism which lead to its disavowal by modern Christianity.", "time": 1671496616, "resto": 33644522}, {"no": 33645208, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:40:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33645183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33645183</a><br>Nice infopost.", "time": 1671496840, "resto": 33644522}, {"no": 33645230, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33644522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33644522</a><br>a magical symbol that possesses the ability to transform (You) into picrel", "filename": "En_UyElXMAQA6Gj", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671497034038907, "time": 1671497034, "md5": "tHxqfUsK0Bl/WIYUQABKYg==", "fsize": 23999, "resto": 33644522}, {"no": 33645270, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:48:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33644522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33644522</a><br>3 circles can form 2 equilateral triangles, did this in a different thread", "filename": "triangle6", "ext": ".png", "w": 935, "h": 864, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1671497314283711, "time": 1671497314, "md5": "7IWYamK7uAcDX+ZufaQagg==", "fsize": 121509, "resto": 33644522}, {"no": 33645274, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:49:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33645183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33645183</a><br>LMFAO!

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling. If I make it through it&#039;ll be amusing to end up on the equator I suppose. I&#039;ve got a 7 week old child now, so there&#039;s no choice but to try and make it through.<br><br>I&#039;m glad you took the time to post this.

The flows of this metal in and out of the core, and around it (through convective processes), generates a magnetic field.<br><br>(2) The Coriolis effect and the combined magnetic and electrical generation of these processes keep the movement (very) roughly circular around the axis of rotation. If it was driven solely by convection and the Coriolis effect it would remain very stable for a long time, but the effect of powerful local magnetic fields and electric currents is able to disrupt this circular flow. If this flow is disrupted in one place, it is likely to disrupt in other places, leading to a complete destabilization of flow around the core-mantle boundary. Thus, the field collapses (no more circular flow). However, convection means the process starts up again, possibly in a different direction, possibly in the same direction.<br>(3) There&#039;s plenty of geological evidence to show that pole reversals can occur very quickly, and that on average they take 100-150 years to complete.

First, it takes a weaker and weaker flare to produce a Carrington type event due to weaker shielding.

We are currently passing through the galactic midplane (an electromagnetic plane created by the supermassive star/black hole cluster at the center of the galaxy) which carries a substantial load of interstellar dust. This dust is not conjecture, it is here, and astronomists have been reporting it for about a year now. <br><br>The sun is essentially a large nuclear fire. What happens what you throw a bunch of very cold, flammable dust on a fire? I&#039;ve had bonfires at -40, and I&#039;ll tell you: first the fire dampens, then the fire gets much bigger than before and very quickly. The same would occur if you were to bombard the sun with a high amount of cosmic dust - the outer shell would cool, the sun would dim, and then the built up energy in the interior would catch up, the shell would warm up enough, and a &quot;small&quot; explosion would occur in which the outer shell of the sun is cast off. <br><br>There are two things to note here:<br>First, we have observed that the two nearest stellar neighbors to pass through the midplane ahead of us flared. They didn&#039;t flare bright enough to call it a super nova, but they flared too much to write it off as a random event or error. They flared in sequence, relative to the time they entered the galactic midplane.<br><br>Second: If the outer shell of the sun were to cool, the sun would dim. It may dim so much that the sun itself would turn dark red, possibly even black, dark enough that you could look directly at the sun. Instead of the normal luminescent star you would see a dark circle halo&#039;d by the dust particles and field interaction lines created by the powerful electromagnetic interactions of the sun.<br><br>In short, the Black Sun is most likely an ancient symbol from the last time this happened.", "time": 1671137327, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614388</a><br>Nahhhh.

There is not much error in when this happens - we&#039;re doing it right now.<br><br>As for the crustal displacement theory: the crust is essentially held in place on the mantle by a combination of friction with the partially solid upper mantle and weak electric forces. Solar energy input through the solar-terrestrial magnetic electric circuit can heat up the upper mantle and disrupt these forces, causing the crust to locally displace (pretty much every earthquake over 6.0 is associated with space weather energy inputs). A large enough solar energy input (from a micronova, perhaps) theoretically can liquefy the entire upper mantle and cause the entire crust to detach. Then what happens?

Richard Tomlinson told me quite extensively about his dream of an &#039;ideal all-male society&#039;. However, his Master was Prince Philip and the Royal Family, so one can say that this particular &#039;dream&#039; originated in this sickest of all families. The incredibly sick and hetero-hostile Sat B&#039;hai Illuminati cult and the Royal Family have already started to create prototypes within the current UK population. Tomlinson was of the opinion that eventually the Illuminati cult would create a society of men who had wombs, to run their ideal &#039;Lord of the Flies&#039; warrior cult society of the Templars. Women would have already been eliminated. They didn&#039;t have the technology to actually create female human eggs from scratch (they had tried but failed), but could easily clone the large banks of female eggs at their disposal - therefore, this wasn&#039;t a problem. They now had enough eggs and enough technology to keep on cloning these eggs, to be then transplanted to the male womb. For some reason, the Illuminati scientists had found that it was far better for the child to grow in a manufactured male womb than from a test-tube basis, and they had managed to genetically engineer men with these wombs but not vaginas...hence the need for Caesarians. What is worse, is that Tomlinson then admitted that his own erstwhile son - Orlando Bloom - actually has one of these wombs - one of the earliest prototypes that was successful - whether the guy knows it &#039;consciously&#039; or not - I am sure that this is true. Tomlinson was matter-of-fact about it all - only a matter of time before they would take over.

One of two things will happen in the next hundred years: a great undoing and reset where humanity cycles back to agrarianism and we try again to reach collective nirvana, or, they continue on with the machine God and create soulless gene-edited humans who serve a &quot;human&quot;-designing algorithm who ultimately do away with real humans.", "time": 1671315554, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33628596, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)17:21:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33628583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33628583</a><br>Now you&#039;ve lost me.

I don&#039;t think I even yelled at a local in anger in my dream. I do remember carrying guns in my dream, but never using them. Everything was sort of 1920s/1930s technology like Model T/Model A style cars, old style phones, radios, etc. I was just there to help build stuff. What&#039;s weird is I don&#039;t know how I died, the dream just kinda zoomed out after a while after showing me my wife and kids and me living happily ever after with them. Did I die in one of the wars or conflicts? Old age? Disease? I didn&#039;t see myself past my mid-40s or early 50s in the dream.<br><br>One IRL weird thing that happened right after this dream and being recovered enough to go out was a Vietnamese man in his 80s or 90s at a restaurant started speaking French to me, and swore I must be French.
