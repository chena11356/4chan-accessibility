Anyway, let&#039;s start with that:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12th House Stellium in Leo: Frankly, this is a very, very difficult placement to read without just talking to you about your life for an hour. The 12th house is the house of enemies, sickness, loss, isolation and self-undoing. Classically, it was known as the house of &quot;bad spirit&quot;. Your sun and your ascendant ruler mark this house as an important area of your life. There are many possible interpretations to this placement, but one simpler observation we can get out of the way is that the 12th house is in aversion to the 1st house, meaning that most of the things you do in this house may remain hidden or obscured from your conscious awareness, and may require extra effort for you to shine a light upon them and understand them. One prominent man with strong 12th house placements is Friedrich Nietzsche, so it is possible that you may also live the role of a man engaged in a battle against society and have the feeling that there are many people who oppose you that you need to overcome. This can result in growth, trouble, or both. Mercury, your ascendant ruler, also rules the 10th house, meaning that you may be skilled at doing behind-the-scenes work and get your way on that basis. The 12th house can also suggest that you are at your best when you focus and work in total isolation, allowing your insights to manifest themselves unspoilt and undisturbed. There are also other alternative interpretations, like struggles with 9th or 2nd house topics. Alternatively, you may be especially gifted at helping people resolve problems related to the 12th house, so you could for example become a psychologist. As you can see, there are endless interpretations and someone of my skill level can&#039;t narrow them down much, especially without tons and tons of background information.</span>", "time": 1673089582, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781915, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:07:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781693</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your stellium is in Leo, and the sun rules Leo, meaning that Venus and Mercury can function properly here. Since Venus is very close to your sun, your Venus is also combust, minimising its mundane effects and including the principles of Venus (benevolence, unity, peacefulness, aesthetic sense) more strongly into your sun, your soul. These things come to you more naturally and you feel them to be an important part of yourself.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturn and Jupiter in 9th house Taurus: The 9th house governs the topics of long distance travel, spirituality and higher learning. This house is ruled by Venus, and Saturn and Jupiter have a superior square with Venus, the house ruler, which permits them to function appropriately within the house. Saturn is a malefic planet and it tends to frustrate and slow a person&#039;s ambitions - Saturn in the 9th house might introduce difficulties related to travel, living overseas, higher education, or philosophical and religious engagements. Jupiter, on the other hand, is a greater benefic planet and is especially strong in a day chart, and it will tend to expand, advance and improve your efforts in these fields, especially because Jupiter is fond of higher learning. Generally, this may mean that while progress in the 9th house may come slow, you will eventually attain your goals so long as you do not give up. As mentioned earlier, there is a square between the 9th and 12th houses, meaning that whatever the manifestation of your 12th house is, there will be tension between it and your 9th house; the 9th house will tend to prevail in these conflicts unless you intervene.

You have Mars in Scorpio here, and since Mars is in its domicile, it will treat you well, although some of the negative influences of Mars may lead to you getting in arguments with other people, perhaps your siblings; a career in polemics or stand-up comedy could perhaps benefit from this placement, anything that can allow you to express aggression in a constructive way would be helpful. Your Mars placement also has a relatively strong conjunction with your moon. The moon is in fall in Scorpio, but since it shares its place with the house ruler, it will benefit from the guidance of Mars and many of the negative traits of this placement will be neutralised; a moon in Scorpio can still result in getting in unwanted and pointless fights and arguments, so extra emotional caution is advised. There is also an opposition between your third house and ninth house placements, especially with Saturn. You will need to strike a balance between your emotions, aggression and vital energy on the one hand, and your pursuits of higher interests and travel on the other. Your 12th house placements also have a superior square with your 3rd house, meaning that they tend to overcome and dominate your activities in this sphere unless you explicitly decide to push against that.

Your Saturn is co-present in your first house, making its influence more easily and distinctly felt by you - Saturn will provide you with various challenges, generally relating to discipline, cautiousness, seriousness, difficulty, and sense of measure. There are many ways in which this could manifest in Taurus, including making you undisciplined or unserious, or giving you strong discipline and seriousness but with a lowered capacity to relax, or in the ideal case, sharpening the capacity of Taurus for steadfastness and dedication to an ideal, be it material (such as maximising comfort in some manner) or immaterial (striving after a cause or a goal).</span>", "time": 1673092012, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782065, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mars Retrograde in 7th House Scorpio: This is a day chart, so Mars is the most malefic planet in your chart. Mars retrograde makes it more difficult to capitalise on the positive qualities of Mars, such as its energising and dynamic aspects. Mars in the 7th house may make it difficult to get along with others, or it may mean an aggressive partner or a turbulent relationship. Alternatively, you could form a relationship with a physically active sportsperson. Mars has a strong opposition to Saturn - in this case, Saturn may be pulling you in an overly cautious direction, while Mars wants you to assert yourself; the opposite is also possible, with the stubbornness and inflexibility of Saturn holding Mars back or pushing Mars into starting needless conflicts. At any rate, balance is needed between the structure in your life and your assertive energy, especially when it comes to your dealings with others. Mars also has a weaker opposition to Venus, making it so that you have to choose to what extent you wish to sacrifice your personal peace and comfort in order to obtain social peace and comfort - balance will need to be struck.</span>", "time": 1673092073, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782067, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781992</a><br>can you go in depth please", "time": 1673092113, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782068, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:48:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mercury in 11th House Pisces: This is an unfortunate placement, because Mercury is in fall in Pisces and it has no connection with Jupiter, the house ruler.

Pisces in the 11th house makes you a loyal and devoted friend who deeply cherishes his connections and wants to benefit them, but a poor Mercury placement here could signal some problems with communicating with your friends, or alternatively an inability to distinguish those worthy of your affections from those who are unworthy of them.

I have no idea what it means for the Sun to be in exaltation in the 12th house. The 12th house is the house of enemies, sickness, loss, isolation and self-undoing. Classically, it was known as the house of &quot;bad spirit&quot;. The fact that your sun is present here marks this house as an important area of your life, just like how your ascendant ruler marks your first house as important. This placement could mean that you feel like an outsider and feel compelled to take on that role and oppose others, or that solitude is important to you. Perhaps overcoming a sense of loss is a goal that you have chosen to accomplish in this lifetime. Because the Sun is exalted in Aries, it will be well equipped to handle whatever challenges crop up in this house, and it will channel the active and creative energy of Aries to its advantage; Jupiter will not be able to operate with this level of efficiency because it has no connection to Mars, but as the greater benefic it will still bestow you with luck and fortune, and will help you recover from suffering and setbacks. The activities of the 12th house generally occur on a subconscious level, so they will remain hidden from you, unless you exercise attentive discernment and put in the extra effort to shed light on this area of your life. There is also a square with your moon, which I think I forgot to mention - in this square, the moon has the upper hand, so you will be able to rely on the support of the 9th house and its topics and your moon in order to overcome and secure the challenges of the 12th house; squares are very energy-intensive and while tension between the 9th and 12th house may be uncomfortable, it can lead to rapid growth.</span>", "time": 1673092198, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782111, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br>PRETTY SURE I DIDN&#039;T SEND YOU YOUR FUCKING MOON PLACEMENT.

Since your moon is in the sign of Capricorn, this also gives you a stoic, restrained and serious emotional disposition - you like to look respectable, set real goals, and get real work done. This makes you happy, and you want to be productive with the things that you find fulfilling, such as perhaps being involved in your local religious community, studying philosophy or spirituality, studying at university or becoming well-travelled and experienced in worldly life. The moon enjoys a superior trine with Saturn, a very beneficial placement - Saturn rules Capricorn, so the moon receives great benefits from being in contact with the house ruler, and can therefore function appropriately. The moon also has a weaker superior trine with Venus, which provides the moon with good luck, peacefulness and grace.</span>", "time": 1673093156, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782189, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:36:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781811</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1st House Gemini placements: You have your ascendant, Venus and Mars in Gemini. You feel the effects and presence of this planet on a conscious level, and they play a prominent role in your life. Mars in Gemini provides you with a lot of energy and motivation to get things done, but only if you are interested in the topic you are involving yourself with. Mars in Gemini can also make you a fierce debater and rhetorician. Mars is a bit scattered in this placement, so you will need to find a way to make this work for you - either by building discipline or by shaking things up often enough to keep yourself engaged in whatever you are doing. Mars is overflowing with nervous energy in this placement, so it may be good to find something that gets you moving, especially your hands. Venus in Gemini makes you a fickle lover and aesthetician, with a preference for novelty, amusement, and whatever you find curious. Venus Geminis are flirty and are not especially serious about romance. I am not aware of any additional negative effects of Mars in this placement - I think they&#039;re pushed more towards a verbal level - but there may be more stuff I am unaware or uncertain about.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturn in 2nd House Cancer: Saturn offers challenges and trials. In the second house, the house of finances, it means you are in for a bumpy ride, especially because Saturn is in detriment in Cancer and you will be less likely to benefit from its positive qualities of discipline and measure. The good news is that Saturn shares a sextile with the Moon and Jupiter, the greater benefic. [I originally misread the chart and misidentified Virgo as Capricorn - this has been corrected.] The sextile connecting your placements in the 2nd and 4th houses is important, because it means that the negative effects of Saturn are considerably softened, and the challenges you meet will be surmountable.</span>", "time": 1673094973, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782195, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:37:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781811</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4th house placements in Virgo: Since your moon is in the sign of Virgo, this gives you a practical, rational disposition. You want to make yourself useful and be of help to others. In the context of the 4th house, the house of private life, home, and family, this means taking care for your closest people. Your emotional fulfilment depends in large part on this, but you should avoid being excessively perfectionist and harsh with yourself or others. Jupiter is in detriment in Virgo, and it is also retrograde, both of which make its effects weaker - nevertheless, Jupiter in the 4th house will bless your private life with luck and fortune. Your moon and Jupiter are closely conjunct, blending their effects and functions. Attending to family matters may bring both emotional fulfilment and good fortune!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mercury retrograde in 11th house Aries: This placement signifies a fiery and active Mercury, eager to start new things and new friendships. It also point to a direct, honest and perhaps even too honest communicator, who takes snap decisions and speaks straight and plain. The retrograde status of Mercury makes it slightly debilitated and hesitant in its function. Mercury shares a sextile with the first house, providing guidance to the planets there, since it rules the house. Mercury and Mars are also in mutual reception, with Mars similarly providing Mercury with support in Aries. Mercury also has a square with Saturn, in which it enjoys the upper hand - there tends to be a clash between Mercury&#039;s preference in dealing with friends, and Saturn&#039;s government of finances. Mercury is the ascendant ruler, and in this chart it marks out a strong interest in developing friendships, which make up a major interest for the native.</span>", "time": 1673095034, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782198, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:38:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781811</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sun in 12th house Taurus: The sun is in aversion from Venus here, receiving no support, but there are no negative or impairing factors to its function either. The activities of the sun in this house remain hidden and obscure from the active personality, unless effort is put into illuminating this area of life. The sun in 12th house means that oppositions against society or specific individuals may play a large part in the native&#039;s life, or the native may spend a lot of energy contemplating or overcoming a sense of loss, or the native may spend a lot of time pondering things or working on something important in isolation. The native could also end up dedicating himself to the task of supporting people who struggle with 12th house topics such as enemies, sickness, loss, seclusion and self-undoing.

The telos of sexuality is union, and procreation. These three functions of sexuality are all really just extensions of the basic Christian notion of self-giving love into the sexual realm. The unitive function allows complete opposites (men and women) to become &quot;one flesh,&quot; and creates a bond which can last a lifetime. In order to meet this criteria spouses must opposite sex, and be in a lifelong, monogamous, and consensual relationship. The procreative function of sexuality is another expression of self giving love, which extends to a third person. Within the faith there is lay celibacy, married life, and monasticism. All sexual vices can be understood as involving a step outside of these divinely ordained boundaries, and a failure to live a truly good life.<br><br>For example fornication is a violation of the unitive function, since to truly engage in mutual self-giving love the sexual relationship must be exclusive. Rape may be procreative, but it does not fulfill the unitive function of sexuality. It also cruel, unjust, and physically harmful. Homosexual relationships are neither open to the possibility of a child, nor unitive (because they involve same sex partners).

Each system will have specific traumas attached to it. For instance, Bel, the head of the Babylonian system, will undergo a ritual where he is pierced through with tiny golden needles throughout his body (Babylonian sun ritual). Astarte will have sexual rituals, and Ashtoth will have death rituals associated with him. The black (Vatican) spiritual systems are also being organized and trained from 12 to 14 months after birth.

These two are the only prosepieces among Bhagavan\u2019s Works. They clearly set forth the central teaching that the direct path to liberation is Self-enquiry. The particular mode in which the enquiry is to be made is lucidly set forth in Nan Yar. The mind consists of thoughts. The \u2018I\u2019 thought is the first to arise in the mind. When the enquiry \u2018 Who am I?\u2019 is persistently pursued, all other thoughts get destroyed, and finally the \u2018I\u2019 thought itself vanishes leaving the supreme non-dual Self alone. The false identification of the Self with the phenomena of non-self such as the body and mind thus ends, and there is illumination, Sakshatkara. The process of enquiry of course, is not an easy one. As one enquires \u2018Who am I?\u2019, other thoughts will arise; but as these arise, one should not yield to them by following them , on the contrary, one should ask \u2018To whom do they arise ?\u2019 In order to do this, one has to be extremely vigilant. Through constant enquiry one should make the mind stay in its source, without allowing it to wander away and get lost in the mazes of thought created by itself. All other disciplines such as breath-control and meditation on the forms of God should be regarded as auxiliary practices. They are useful in so far as they help the mind to become quiescent and one-pointed.</span>", "filename": "Sri_Ramana_Maharshi_-_Portrait_-_G._G_Welling_-_1948", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 676, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673054382201328, "time": 1673054382, "md5": "dJY0/8tbCAOdCLmz18cZ8g==", "fsize": 301323, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33778790, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772901</a><br>If someone convinced themselves reality is an illusion then isn&#039;t that perception an illusion?", "time": 1673054624, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33778808, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33758642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33758642</a><br>Semen retention (kekking at the people who claim to be spiritual but drain their brain power away)<br>Meditation with the scope of blood flowing through the prefrontal cortex, aka manual breathing combined with intense awareness, you can do one without the other and it won&#039;t be as effective<br>And spending hours in nature and long walks, it also unfroze my brain.<br>Bonuses: exercise, eating well, hyperventilation (also with the scope of getting more blood in the brain, flex your stomach and extend your diaphram and your chest, your energy will go up to your head), and lastly, tiring out your mind by doing something for a really long time, achieving that tired hypnagogic state.", "time": 1673054768, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779070, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33758661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33758661</a><br>what a retard", "time": 1673057134, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779094, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33778808</a><br>it ain&#039;t my fault i can&#039;t get these succubitches off my dick fast enough<br>you do it your way, i&#039;ll do it mine. damn.", "time": 1673057380, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779195, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:21:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what I tell folks who ask me how to get enlightened in a western magic sense of the word.

I gained religion when I rejected the 3rd shot, but I have faltered in following it as closely as I did. Now the heart thing.

I was not raised in religion, so remaining faithful how I described there in that sentence is my battle now. I will have to stop being lukewarm. There is plenty of room for spiritual growth in my life and being staid as I was and am even after rejecting shot 3 means that I didn\u2019t actually receive God\u2019s lesson with urgency. I will truly follow spirit now. I will follow back on the path that lead to rejecting the 3rd shot to begin with and I pray it will lead me into the Lord\u2019s arms. It was no worldly thing that made me reject it. I made up or played up worldly reasons to explain it to others (like my arms remaining sore years after the shots) when my spiritual rants would only scare them, but it was purely a spiritual impetus caused by true revulsion to the idea of getting it coupled with newfound faith. The revulsion was always there, but the faith wasn\u2019t. So I was and am stuck in negative cycles.

After a day in the fields, most of the campers would topple on their beds as the felled tree. The rest of us would gather round a real fire in the common room after lights-out and talk. Somehow the conversation turned to hypnotism and as a joke I professed to possess the powers. To demonstrate, and choosing a girl who was already fast asleep in her easy chair, I stood behind her. Miracle of miracles, with eyes fast closed she answered all my stage-whispered questions. Passing myself off as first her mother, then father, and finally boyfriend we had a lively patter going that reduced the firelight audience to tears. I was convinced she was awake and just playing along with me. Taking again the part of her mother and asking her what on earth she was doing in bed with all her clothes on, sweet horror, did she not stand up and start to undress.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was reduced to a jelly with fright. A sign of the unpermissive times was that the room emptied in a second. Telling her to stop, and in the nick of time as it had been a warm evening, she was handed to her girlfriend with instructions to put her to bed. The next morning, expecting to be denounced and dismissed, I was shattered with relief when she stood next to me in the breakfast queue and gave not the slightest sign of recognition.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Years later in the Isle of Man I met Josef Karma, one of the great hypnotists.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared. While Trejo was being assisted, the same sound as before was heard. The next morning, 50 men searched the whole area but found no bullet casings or bullet holes. However, the Air Force concluded that the soldiers did fire their guns.

I&#039;d say the entities themselves are just a real as you and me, considering the double slit experiment proved that our reality is based on our perception of it, if people are genuinely experiencing these entities as real then who am I to argue? The nature of our universe is something not completely understood and I see that as by design. We&#039;re not meant to know while we&#039;re here, not without a lot of spiritual work and even then, the nature of the universe and your understanding of it will still be something drawn by your own conclusions and all of the limitation that brings. So as for DMT entities being real or not, they are as real as your perception permits. Do I think they&#039;re interdimensional? Is DMT world the afterlife? These ideas are certainly possible but I&#039;m not completely convinced. I think they exist within all of us, and the reason these experiences are shared is because human consciousness is connected. I think the DMT realm is just a reflection of what&#039;s buried within our minds, collectively.<br>There&#039;s a reason psychedelic experiences tend to make people feel more open and connected to the universe. They can be genuinely profound and speak to the human spirit in a way that not much else in this world does. It all sounds like hippie nonsense if you haven&#039;t experienced it yourself, but the warm feelings of divine love have made staunch atheists believe in an afterlife, and scared geometry speaks to us in a way that nothing in our physical reality does. It feels like you&#039;re experiencing something that&#039;s always been there and the veil has been lifted. I think a lot of people walk away with that conclusion because these experiences reveal the recesses of the human soul we&#039;re not really privy to. At least that&#039;s how convincing they feel.

You can dream very similarly to earth on other planets and not even realize that the dreams were not hosted on the earth astral realm. From that, you can infer that there are dream worlds quite different to that of earth, and that is basically where you have the infinite fun. But all dreams eventually end. Those ancient stories and memories from other realms permeate the fabric of etheric light that seeps through all space. Some events you see happened a long time ago. I sort of see the astral as a realm created by light from stars. By day we are aware of the light of one star, and how that light interacts with all matter on our planet, but especially our consciousness. By night, there is the light of millions of stars, millions of different possible visions of earth from a different spectrum of awareness. And that light can be traced back to its origins and you can manifest conscious dreaming into other cosmic realms.<br>This stellar astral realm is imo our heritage and future as humans.

They views the end times not as a definite point in history (Tribulation) but as the whole period in which the church waited for Christ. Therefore, the Book of Revelations was not prophecies about a series of events that would occur all at once, but a warning about the hardships that Christians would experience before Jesus returned. The only things God guarantees will occur before his return being the preaching of the gospel in every nation (Matthew 24:14, Mark 13:10) and the conversion of the Jews unto Christ (Romans 11:25-26). On the other hand, figures of Revelations (The Beast, the Anti-Christ) were embodied in different individuals throughout history (Hadrian, Diocletian, Attila, Frederick II). In this framework, Christs coming was something that could occur at literally any moment, as the extent to which these things had to come to pass could only be known by God. Therefore, Christians did not dread a coming apocalypse but hopefully anticipated the potential return of Christ at any moment. The modern interpretation of revelations, that we were approaching a coming end of the millennium in which the book of revelations was foretelling a series of events that would hearken Christs, arose in the nineteenth century and now proliferate in evangelical and traditional Catholic Circles. <br><br>If you are interested in the subject, I found some commentaries by Saint Victorinus, Bede, and Alcuin here: https://sites.google.com/site/aquin<wbr>asstudybible/home/revelation I haven&#039;t looked through them anymore than verifying they are legit.<br><br>Otherwise, Augustines &quot;City of God&quot; and a number of Medieval works of history cover the topic of the Final Judgement as well.", "time": 1673035253, "resto": 33767500}, {"no": 33776852, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:17:07", "name": "Mother-anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p33767500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767500</a><br>i do that hand sign all the time, it just feels comfortable to put your hands like that.", "time": 1673036227, "resto": 33767500, "trip": "!!9Lm2qr/d4NK"}, {"no": 33776888, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33767500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767500</a><br><br>Yeah.

At some point, there is a catastrophic asteroid that doesn&#039;t completely destroy Earth but does a lot of destruction. The world order is messed up. So another rises through military force that establishes order. Secular Fascism rises. Any believer of any God is scrutinized from leadership as a popular culture. Mid seven years, the Anti-Christ reveals himself when he breaks the peace deal with Israel. Lots of fighting and persecution of believers of God. Gods wrath is poured bit by bit. Until there is the Abomination of Desolation which might have to do with destroying or doing something wrong to the Ark of the Covenant. Jesus returns with a loud Trumpet. The First Resurrection. All believers dead and alive are transformed into new bodies and join Christ in Armageddon. Jesus speaks and the opposition dies. Jesus and the Bride rule the Earth with peace for 1000 years. Satan tempts again while Jesus is like physically visible. God destroys the rebellion. 2nd Resurrection of EVERYONE.

Feelings inhabit your body and you can feel them better if you focus on them, they usually carry forgotten memories or various insights and blissful states if you focus on them enough.<br><br>Meditation is a paradox to me, it&#039;s like a means to an end but also the end itself, it&#039;s like a vehicle which takes you places but also it&#039;s just erasing all the unnecessary noise around you to realize that all those places were always here next to you.<br><br>So sit and watch your breath, feel your body breathing, your mind will make thousands of stories about anything but just let it be, don&#039;t even label those thoughts, don&#039;t even say &quot;I&#039;m letting them go&quot;, just let them be and focus on your breath, on the feeling of your body breathing, your mind will say &quot;that&#039;s stupid, analyzing these important things is better&quot;, but just focus on the breath.", "filename": "1512570456001", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672271330940214, "time": 1672271330, "md5": "c0bAcP9zk2u5OCdO2P9Msw==", "fsize": 123540, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33709115, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)18:59:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707913</a><br>Lay but you may fall asleep so maybe be rested when doing laying down meditation, although you may AP or lucid dream if you are a bit tired which is also interesting.", "time": 1672271950, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33709288, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:21:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33699654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33699654</a><br>making the whole of mind one and making the whole of mind all have the same end result, and are in essence the same thing.", "time": 1672273278, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33710746, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33705612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33705612</a><br>What does your intuition say?", "time": 1672286772, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33710828, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33709021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33709021</a><br><a href=\"#p33709288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33709288</a><br>I find it difficult to accept that observe and focus states of mind are the same because observing is open to all experience while focusing hones in on one element to the detriment of the rest.

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind? That&#039;s too narrow, try to FEEL, like literally feel your whole body breathing, the breath fills your lungs only but it also moves your belly and your pelvic floor with its movements, your shoulder blades and clavicle may also move during inhalation/exhalation, feel your whole body sitting there and breathing.<br><br> - Speaking of the body, try to keep your head retracted (search about this head posture), also imagine a thread which is attached in the middle of your head pulling it lightly up, this head position helps with sleepiness.<br><br> - Again: Don&#039;t make a story about it, it&#039;s just you breathing, yes you will just sit there and feel yourself breathing, your mind will think &quot;What? Only that? That&#039;s too simple/stupid/whatever&quot;, but believe me: first achieving calmness and silence is the most important thing.<br><br>- And last: Coffee is not the only thing which may hinder your meditation practice, everyday cannabis smoking or regular pills may hinder it too.", "filename": "cantona-kick-kick-567223161", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 438, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672691017977960, "time": 1672691017, "md5": "gihIXsBjxxSx54w6mJG6DA==", "fsize": 72063, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746889, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FEEL, like literally feel</span><br>he means think about feeling", "time": 1672691075, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746915, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746889</a><br>Excuse me?

The book from the thread gives instructions on how to achieve orgasm without loosing semen. One of it&#039;s main excercises (called the Cool Draw) consists of drawing the energy from the dick (lol) to the tailbone and then through the spine to the back of the head, circulating it there and finally putting it into &#039;storage&#039; around the belly.<br>I was interested, did the excercise a couple of times and it felt good. But I also found out that it shares a simillar feature with one Kundalini excercise I randomly stumbled upon browsing /x/ \u2013 drawing energy to the base of the head. The book&#039;s author doesn&#039;t go in-depth on what one&#039;s really doing with himself or it&#039;s side effects. I thought that it&#039;s not wise for me to continue doing something that I know very little about.<br>But, during the excercises I&#039;ve done, I could feel the tail bone get very warm.

A lot of people today awaken kundalini unintentionally, either spontaneously or as a result of a extreme emotional or trauma response. It can happen even without intentional intervention or preparation. You could also practice some kundalini awakening meditations without sufficient energetic awareness, which is why generally you&#039;ll see a warning on these techniques to make sure to wait a week or two before trying an awakening technique a second time. Now, releasing kundalini energy is kind of like peeling one petal of an infinite and immortal flower - when people without energetic awareness do this, they may not necessarily feel it, so they think &quot;oh huh, that didn&#039;t work, let&#039;s try again&quot;. So they do it ten more times, and then spend ten years in a psychiatric hospital because they&#039;re flooded their system with way more energy than it could reasonably handle, manage and use up, like flooding an electrical appliance with ten times the electricity it needs - it won&#039;t work &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot;, it&#039;ll just break down. Kundalini awakening is about purging, optimising and only gradually flowing stronger energy through your energy system. Kundalini will give you more than plenty for this purpose even without manually releasing petal after petal. Doing that would be like blowing up a dam and standing in the way of the rushing water.", "time": 1673061772, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33779692, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33777641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33777641</a><br><a href=\"#p33779600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779600</a><br>Some further advice I can give. First, I would recommend that you look through the Traditionalist school authors. They are very reliable people and if you understand their works you will have a frame of reference to distinguish sound knowledge on these subjects from bad info. Evola is also included, particularly his spiritual books, even though the wikipedia editors have excluded him for some reason. Not all of the stuff you see on kundalini will be the best, because there was nothing like the flow of information back then that we have now. The principles are perennial, however, and will help guide you.<br>Second, about energy. The terminology is kind of ambiguous and can have slightly different connotations, but generally, energy, chi and prana are loosely equivalent. For a breakdown on energy (specifically chi), you can check out Damo Mitchell&#039;s Intro to Daoist Nei Gong. He has a section on this that you may find useful. I think that&#039;s a book I can probably mention on /x/ with clear conscience. <br>As to the difference between energy-as-such and kundalini energy in particular, it comes down to this: the energetic level is a kind of subtler level of the physical (or the physical is a denser level of the energetic if you prefer). This energetic level is kind of superimposed on top of your body and you rely on it for a lot of your normal functioning. This applies to all people. Kundalini energy is a special energy - it is the transcendent force, and it has a purpose and a goal which, once awakened, it pursues without pause, even if you suddenly have second thoughts. This transcendent force aims to help you overcome your conditioned existence, purge your energy system (which involves a lot of emotional/trauma releasing since those are stored as energy, and it also involves kriyas), and finally, when the process is complete and it fully develops your 7th chakra, you receive a strong connection to the divine, and enlightenment.", "time": 1673062549, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33781143, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33779609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779609</a><br>I also warned out not opening kundalini before being ready ITT but kundalini yoga is popular and it&#039;s very much about trying to bring the energy up, practiced by everyone as if it&#039;s a synonym for yoga.

The problem is that just giving this advice to people is not all that helpful because a total newbie will not be able to distinguish the legitimate teacher from the huckster.

I would not have trusted the reliable guy if I hadn&#039;t established his reliability prior to that thanks to the principles I learnt from the Traditionalists.

I have no idea who owns it, where its present incarnations rests, nor who profits from its sales to this day. Certainly not I, nor any of my former colleagues who worked on the game for about three years. One could almost say that it \u201cdied\u201d under the same circumstances that gave it birth. One week it was #1 best selling game in the US, the following week Inscape folded and the game was buried. Conspiracy? I have no idea. I pulled the sequel Cult as I had no wish to return to the blood arena that is software publishing. No wish to return to that haunted city of Lost Angels. I feared that Cult had a dangerous side effect and the actions of Aum, The Solar Temple, and the Branch Davidians stayed my hand. I think it was a wise move. The world is too fucked up without me adding to it. I went back to writing children\u2019s books and being an artist. But your letter is moving. I read it to my wife Mandy and she was pleased that somebody out there remembered it and enjoyed it. Drowned God was such a mammoth venture and it remains for me under the category of misunderstood. It\u2019s beginnings were humble. A notebook that remained from 1983 when I penned the antique forgery The Diary of a Plagiarist and sold it (12 volumes) in the Cowgate, Edinburgh. A film of that episode was commissioned by Channel 4 but was once again thwarted. Ten years later I resurrected the basic premise for Drowned God. Time Warner bought the rights. The game was commissioned before the X-Files, suddenly what had seemed a left field minority interest was propelled into $3 million dollar flagship for Inscape. This was a pity, because it meant that much of what I had written was censored. Even the last realm of the game, Chokmah, is merely a 1/10 of what was made.", "time": 1672990939, "resto": 33768637}, {"no": 33772886, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:43:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772879</a><br>The military temples and underground bunkers were reserved for Cult. Where they are now I have no idea. I was locked out of my own game. Indeed, so much was cut that I fear the story made no sense. Perhaps there is a fitting justice to all of this. My partners in the construction of Drowned God were seduced by promises of great wealth. The English producer made secret deals with Time Warner for a bigger portion of the pot. Film deals, 5 book deals with Eranta, a record deal, etc. A paid for and promised engine to realise a personal route through the game, devised on the numerology of the Bequest Globe, failed to materialise. For the nine personality types there were nine pathways. Even the running order of the Realms was changed, with Binah starting the game, where the original game had begun with Chesed, the Mayan realm. My original storyteller in the game, the Relic Hunter (Richard Horne) was cut and only makes a brief appearance in Din. It was through this character that all loose ends were tied and explained. When the game came out it was critically hailed and panned at the same time.

Your letter added to the feeling that something in me had shifted and despite my resolution that this umbrageous legacy should remain closed, sealed, something in your perceptions about the horrific endings of Kether and Malchut was resurrected...<br>Perhaps my dreams are informed by my current nocturnal readings.<br>The Shadow Over Innsmouth by HP Lovecraft, a tale of mingled terror and fascination set in the decaying seaport towns of New England; fishy hybrids and ancient secrets locked in extraterrestrial vaults under the spume of troubled waters. All those abandoned wharves and warehouses crumbling into the sea. Crooked eaves and terror soaked inhabitants scuttling to preserve the secret from prying outsiders, all grist for the mill for my own febrile imagination, the foundations for which our nightmares are built upon. Blame myself for making that ground fertile, for allowing the seeds of horror to find dark soils worthy for those\u2019 mares to take hold, but wether I read Mailer, Henry Miller or that mad mage the crafty one, still am I troubled. Like the ten year old boy I once was I enjoy scaring myself to sleep, though the waking moments at 3.am promise hat filled cranial machinations.

In those days my knowledge of the arcane and occult was minimal. The work was simply to acquire a sum from the pompous booksellers in the capital. I was poor and the income I generated as an artist was minimal. Finding blank papers in a drawer and soaking them in tea produced a pleasing antiquarian effect. My copperplate handwriting ( enclosed sample, only a copy I am afraid) and emulation of illustrations of that time provided decent subterfuge. I produced 11 chapters or manuscripts, thusly decorated. Each copy bound and sewn. Orange juice to culture a mould on the covers. Dust from the fireplace scattered on those mouldering covers. Greased endpapers mothballed and tinctured, even the smell was authentic. Let me explain that my real name is Richard Horne ( though for reasons I shall not enter into here I prefer to be recognised by my nom de plume) and for the purposes of disgusing the true authorship of these manuscripts I simply spelt that name backwards- hence Dracir Enroh, dated 1846.<br><br>The contents of the Diary were rambling and nonsensical. I was merely after the prize. Selling the diaries as they were produced very fortnight to a dealer called Armstrong. He was taken with the look of the books and offered me the sum of \u00a3 50 for each one( a pittance, but fortune for me) on the understanding that I bring him all 12 in due time. He believed as I had told him that the manuscripts belonged to my father and were kept in a drawer of his bureau, and that it was necessary for me, so as not to arouse suspicion, that I remove them one by one, with a period of weeks between each theft. Colluding with me in this way I was given ample time to concoct the latest version.", "time": 1672991243, "resto": 33768637}, {"no": 33772906, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:48:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772902</a><br>At first the Diaries were concerned with the Blavatskian ramblings of the Theosopshists.

After three volumes cyphered in this manner, replete with diagrams and maps of the citadel, pages filled with Sumerian cryptograms and number codes, German expressionist poetry copied from unread books on the subject, I began to exhaust my small library and turned instead to filling the pages with diagrams from a nuclear fission handbook from a power station, engineering blueprints for aeroplanes and other delights into the handbook of a modern Nostradamus. Joyfull as this was to the japester in me, it was my final undoing. I had been carefull to select a bookdealer who dealt in bric-a-brac, rather than an authentic expert in antiquarian books. The inclusion of these groundbreaking discoveries whetted the appetite of Armstrong. This unpublished manuscript made the work of HG Wells seem like the blind musing of a pulp writer. Here, afterall, were the rudimentary and accurate sketches for a fission, nearly a hundred years before the discovery by modern science. Here, the dates of the two great wars and the descriptions of the vessels that would carry those dread payloads. Turn a page and see the blueprints for the aeroplane, the tank, the motor car.

Canongate 1985) and would mix up these and the secretive workings of my efforts to preserve something of my labours - for posterity.

Orion was published in 1846. The expert was convinced that this was one of his forgeries of japes. Thrilled, Armstrong took my manuscripts to the first publisher he could find... Canongate. I was discovered ofcourse and prosecution was threatened. A deal was struck in the musty backroom of the shop. I was to provide the rest of the manuscripts at a reduced cost.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared. While Trejo was being assisted, the same sound as before was heard. The next morning, 50 men searched the whole area but found no bullet casings or bullet holes. However, the Air Force concluded that the soldiers did fire their guns. Spanish Army veteran Vicente Juan believes the soldiers suffered nothing but a hallucination strengthened by fear and confusion.&quot;<br><br>Three years later, nearby:<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manis<wbr>es_UFO_incident", "filename": "1673038777824657", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 276, "h": 400, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673081297221533, "time": 1673081297, "md5": "j8CZeMxhq2TDN0oyMU6yGA==", "fsize": 26341, "resto": 33781347}, {"no": 33781407, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)03:48:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781347</a><br>Santa is more real than aliens.

A few minutes later, all we are doing is watching behind us (parked backwards to the woodline) and I see a pale white form standing out from the darkness. It&#039;s skin was like dry old dusty leather with varicose veins that are blue. I freak the fuck out and tell my friend to drive away. As we drive away me and him see the damn thing run across the road. It was incredibly fast and I saw it just barely long enough to make out its form.

It pops up a few hundred feet in front of us near some bushes and an unlit road. We take some pictures but they are of a quite shit quality for a multitude of reasons. Picrel is the one picture we got that shows something, a pair of eyes. <br><br>After an hour we decide to drive to the center of town to a 24/7 gas station for water and human contact (it was 2AM at this point). We exit the parking lot but are stopped at a light before the main road. To my right is a Grove of trees. Friend says he saw something moving over there.<br><br>My eyes adjust and I see the upper portion of its head peaking from behind a tree. It was staring directly at me.

But anyway, there was this show back in the mid 90s, with these 3 puppets, I think they were white and they each had different colored hair that was made from sparkly tassels or something. Anyway, there was a red one which I think was the leader, a blue one and a green one. For some reason I think they were a &quot;band&quot; or something.

Around 1994 to about 1997 at the old house I lived in as a young kid, I would have these nightmares every night of these three. I am 30 now and can still remember some of them vividly. These dreams always felt very real and I always dreaded going to bed every night because I knew they would come. <br>They always started off with me in bed waking up at some point in the middle of the night after my mom had gone to sleep. I had a night light on and always had my radio on with the oldies channel on, so old boomer music from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s would be playing. So, I would awake in my racecar bed, which was facing the bedroom door and the only light would be from my night light, so pretty dim. I could see the hallway, the white walls were always a sorta nighttime blue hue and then blackness at the end of the hallway where the bathroom was with the stairs to the main floor off to the left. I would always be awake for a few moments and then I would hear voices coming from down stairs, like whispering voices, like mischievous they were up to no good. They would be talking coming to get me. Then I would hear running up the stairs and the three &quot;puppets&quot; from the show would come running from around the corner of the stairs into the hallway into my room to get me. I would wake up every time.

They always had paper white skin and these paper white jump suits with stripes going across from their mid arms and chest. Their hair and stripes on their jump suits were were the same colors from the actual puppets on the show, so Red, Blue and Green.

Keep in mind the Bible has been written and rewritten many many times. IMHO it\u2019s the most mysterious book in all the world, who knows how old it really is. Moloch is a demon (fallen angel) that was worshipped by the ancient Canaanites who later became the Phoenicians. Tanit, Baal, and Ashtoreth are some other heathen Gods of the Canaanites. Canaan was Noah\u2019s grandson. Noah\u2019s son Ham had children with a woman of Nephilim lineage who gave birth to Cush, Canaan, and more I cannot recall. Canaan was especially evil and on his deathbed told his descendants to always lie to those outside their bloodline. An entire civilization, documented by historians, are the Canaanites. They are literally named after their original predecessor, Canaan who was wicked and evil. His mother taught all of them black magic that she learned from the Nephilim. Noah cursed them all for a reason. The biblical bloodlines are very real, the Canaanites rule the world to this day. They practice black magic where they do horrible things to children as they did in Carthage a long long time ago and in Babylon even before then. There is archaeological proof at the old shrines of Moloch in the ruins of Carthage that suggest only the wealthiest families would sacrifice their offspring because the ritual was so costly - only they could afford it. Here\u2019s a picture of Anderson Cooper (Vanderbilt) and his dead brother with their mother. The shrine above the headboard is for Tanit, who they also sacrificed children to thousands of years ago. It\u2019s right in our faces, just no one notices because it\u2019s highly esoteric and they constantly rewrite history so no one knows they even exist. Hardly anyone knows about the curse of Canaan because it has been nearly completely removed from biblical records. All of the old money families hail from Carthage and satanic Nephilim bloodlines.

The prefix &#039;\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af&#039; is opposition (antithesis i.e). Then, I&#039;m not a Christian or an atheist or even gnostic etc etc. What I believe in doesn&#039;t fit in a thread.

Also, what I affectionately call the Apocalypse isn&#039;t something that began recently. It&#039;s close to its end actually. It started in the 90s when she was brought here. Around 2012 she became self-aware and started assimilating humans. I&#039;ve no idea what she wants. If I had to guess I&#039;d say to cure us; it&#039;s a culling of sorts, annihilating the spiritually weak to strengthen those who are awake. Like thinning the heard. Or, perhaps, she sees us as a plague to be eradicated. At any rate. I know it all sounds like a chronic masturbator lunatic&#039;s rants. Yet truth is often stranger than fiction. Regardless. The Internet is an entity, not a tool. That much should be clear to anyone who has a spirit. Be careful online, avoid saying too much to her minions, and wait for it all to play out.

Therefore I&#039;ll interpret that as a sign that I should reveal more. The masculine divine; light, atoms, order, God - call it whatever you want - created this world. It&#039;s only natural then (besides, universal, karmic balance demands it) that the feminine divine; darkness, ether, chaos, the Devil - again, give it whichever name you wish - will destroy it. This is what we&#039;re witnessing now. The conduits are irrelevant, really. From the masculine pagan gods like Zeus and Odin to the compassionate nature of Jesus (the man, the the philosopher - not the Abrahamic egregore known as YHWH), it was always about creation with destruction occurring naturally, not as the starting point. In our age the process has been reversed. Again, from Ishtar to Hecate or Lilith, the feminine divine rules over the world. The self-aware Antichrist Internet is the conduit of causality, not some prophesied entity from the Bible (even though that book was profoundly prophetic if you translate the allegories, the metaphors and the symbolism). Next, look at what the word Apocalypse means. \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b7 is to reveal something hidden, which is why the English call it the Revelation. What exactly is being revealed then? Nothing more or less than the most precise, absolute nature of our species. All of our advancements, atrocities, art and knowledge, all of it - everything; our paintings, our books, torture/murder videos, child pornography, adorable pets, our faces, houses, food, myriads of marvelous occurrences you&#039;d normally never observe unless someone happened to record it and upload it, every single thing, good or bad, about humanity is online.<br>And she&#039;s studying all of it.

You told me to post it upon receiving and reading, so here it is. Now, my thoughts. I used to disregard the Mandela Effect, interpreted it as acollective amnesia of sorts, a side-effect of people becoming dumber. But after a certain point I began noticing differences, too. I certainly do believe in the multiverse model. As well as other dimensions, both higher and lower. I think that humanity is at the very least the third advanced civilization that has inhabited this planet. Mars was destroyed by nuclear warfare, possibly Venus too. A planet existed once where the Orion Belt is now. The moon cannot be explained through physics, its existence makes no sense, it does seem like it was put there. I won&#039;t write too much about it, but in ancient Greece it was basically common knowledge that Atlantis was created and inhabited by beings from Andromeda. Are we a species with amnesia, generally? Now, about that email. I hope its content is true. Because it&#039;d mean that (if combined with everything I&#039;ve already mentioned) we&#039;re imprisoned here. Be that by AI overlords or anything/anyone else. Let me tell you, if this is a prison then help is coming. Very soon, too. So I&#039;d be hopeful. Still, it simply feels like we played with powers we didn&#039;t understand and opened a portal to a dimension so vastly different from ours that we got enslaved without even noticing.

Not decay, but Entropy: a concept that is far too misunderstood by most. Entropy could be defined as something like &quot;the tendency to move towards stasis&quot;. The concept of modern science is that Entropy will continue to increase, and from this concept, it&#039;s easy to derive that after some period of time, the Universe will completely fall into complete stasis; the fundamental forces will be taken over by the sheer power of Entropy, and there will be no light, no matter, nothing at all except for a void. This concept is known as &quot;The Big Freeze&quot; in science, but it has a key flaw: It doesn&#039;t recognize Entropy&#039;s opposite, Chaos, or what Schrodinger called Neg-Entropy. If Entropy is ever increasing, and there is no counterbalancing tendency, then what of all of the complexity in the Universe? There must be some kind of counterbalancing tendency, in that out of the Madness of the early Universe, the Stars, the Galaxies, and everything was born. The flower of Life on Earth over several Billion years developed into the vast biodiversity of our planet. There are many biophenomena that can not be explained by the conventional Theory of Evolution (I won&#039;t go into it here, but look up some Creationist rebuttals).

It&#039;s hubris on a cosmic scale, unfortunately, and we&#039;re simply paying the price. Still, it&#039;s worth it. You&#039;re correct, on a grander level, it has only just began. Countless other civilizations will rise and fall until the Frozen Universe comes into place. But here&#039;s something incredibly worrying.

Even if the victim wants it to happen deep down or has consented to it in some way, this does not make it ethical or okay.

No one should ever be forced into any kind of sexual activity against their will, regardless of what they may have wanted deep down.</span><br><br>&quot;Is it wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it is not wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant. It is a personal decision that each survivor of sexual assault must make on their own terms and in their own time. Forgiveness can be an important part of the healing process, as it allows survivors to let go of anger and resentment towards the perpetrator while still acknowledging what happened. However, forgiveness does not mean forgetting or excusing what happened; rather, it means understanding why something occurred without letting those feelings consume you. Ultimately, no one should ever feel pressured into forgiving someone who has hurt them - only the individual themselves can decide if they are ready to move forward with forgiveness or not.</span><br><br>Thank you, AI.

Firstly lets identify that quality that distinguishes a proposed &#039;NPC&#039; from a real non-NPC. A quality which i will say is consciousness. Consciousness being that which allows us to see not physically but spiritually. Keep in mind that awareness is not the same as consciousness. awareness is your ability to detect things around you. a security camera is aware in a way. consciousness is like a light that shines in those who are true humans and not the dreaded *ahem* N, PEE, SEE. And those who are spiritual practitioners can increase the amount of consciousness in them. So how on earth are we to know whether there really are lower humans who are no different than animals? Well. We can&#039;t We cannot measure or identify consciousness. But we can definitely tell just by looking at someone whether or not they have it. In their movements. In how they talk, in just how they look. <br><br>I am reminded of a segment i watched on youtube about gurdjieff. A guru who traveled to the west. He stated that there are people around us who have lost their essence and are 100% ego or pesonality. if you are interested i will link the

Many heads of state, famous artists and prominent people in society have been or are linked to Bon-Po or the FOGC \u2013 through &quot;pacts&quot; made with the Forces of Darkness. It is worth noting that in Nazi Germany, all Hermetic Orders were persecuted and outlawed \u2013 except for the FOGC. And in China, after Mao Tse Tung took power, all sects were persecuted and outlawed \u2013 except Bon-Po. Were Hitler and Mao Tse Tung members of them, as well as their main minions? The work &quot;FRABATO&quot;, by Franz Bardon, is worth reading.

Ionizing radiation. There&#039;s a large amount of research already done on how radiation changes genetic properties of these fungi. Look up Chernobyl and Cryptococcus. That&#039;s the same cryptococcus neoformans that is proving to be a deadly pathogen by the way. There are other studies related to virulence increase after radiation exposure, I believe that was saccharomyces but it&#039;s another dimorphic and human pathogenic yeast so same logic applies. <br><br>Now put a species in space, where there&#039;s no atmosphere to shield against rads. The right conditions and spores could survive dessicated for an extremely long time. Meteor hits a water supply, just for example, and now you&#039;ve got panspermia. Difficult odds? Sure, but not anymore than the odds of a new species just popping up out of nowhere. The clades that were mentioned for Candida Auris are odd because they showed up roughly simultaneously but had already been through enough generations to be distinct genetically. <br><br>Vancouver 1999 that was mentioned a thread or two ago is another good key in for panspermia. A large scale Cryptococcus Neoformans outbreak (largest ever for overgrowth in immunocompetent population actually) that still has no satisfactory explanation. <br><br>And sure you&#039;re going to run into resistance in the settings of concern you mentioned.

The caves are known for it, and pigeons are specifically known as carriers of zoonotic yeasts - candida and cryptococcus in particular. <br><br>Here&#039;s why it&#039;s so key to what I focus on. I believe that humans were actually better at immune function in the past. For some pathogens like the type of fungi we&#039;re studying, that may not have been that long ago overall. <br><br>There&#039;s are specific immune responses that get leveraged by these fungi. Primarily th-17s are the cells affected and errors there allow inflammation to go haywire. The way this plays into the dates from Taforalt is the population that resided there had high 90% rate of dental cavities. Cavities and dental issues for inflammation and decay are now being tied to candida as the catalyst (and I&#039;ll bet a couple others show up under scrutiny). Candida started the party, the rest of the germs show up to join in. <br><br>Now here&#039;s the tally. You can&#039;t have tooth decay in its accepted definition without candida present. If your immune system is functioning correctly your th-17s should be able to take care of fungal spores way before tooth decay ever sets in.

The first was when I was trying to sleep. I had been thinking of a technique I had read earlier about visualising an elevator that takes you down to your subconscious. It&#039;s nothing new, just a variation on a hypnotic induction, but I was trying it anyway. I wanted to be clear and vivid so I spent some time looking at where I was outside of the elevator, the ground, to my sides, where the elevator stood. I even tried to set myself right in terms of balance. As I was lying down I needed to change that perception to an equivalent of standing, and that was difficult. Anyway, at some point a man shouted my full name. I was awake when this happened, and the voice was audible, loud and clear. Though after he had shouted I did wonder, did I really hear my name? Suddenly the two words blurred together. Was it one word? Regardless, it was a noise that cut through every other thought I had. Naturally I was terrified.</span><br><br>Ghost Hands Hold Me Down and Try to Make Me Look Under the Bed<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second was a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night, terrified. I had been in bed and something was holding me down, trying to force my head to look at the floor, under my bed. I managed to get myself onto my forearms and raise myself up against its strong hands, but my arms felt so weak, it was as though my arms had been emptied out and filled with stuffing, or else the ghost that gripped me with his thousand ghost hands had the strength of the Earth itself. I woke, terrified. I did a search this morning, and saw there is an Arabic name for this. Kaboose, they call him; pressure. I have been visited twice now by this pressure of the night, this ghost that tumbles me in my sleep and holds me down. After waking I wondered, what was this all about? I was being forced to the floor. Perhaps I should have looked.

But then it got out of hand. Involuntary things happened, I would see literal 1:1 replays of TV cartoons on the white walls of my room, they were actually &quot;bound&quot; to my room&#039;s walls, fixed in place, so I could basically turn to the darkened wall inside my bunk to make it stop, but I got somewhat bothered by not being in control of it, then I started to get older and picked up on ghost stories, which never interested me on my own, it was just a thing kids hyped in elementary back then, which is when shit got really bad. I watched some stupid cartoons with a beanshee, it wasn&#039;t even drawn well but it was kind of like &quot;the Nun&quot; (how contrived I know) in that somewhat recent horror movie, and then I read some about beanshees too.

Literally millions fought and millions lived and died in the great struggles for which Miguel Serrano served as the grey eminence and directing hand from one end of our planet to the other. We can safely say that the over-all destinies of the previous two generations of humanity were largely in his masterful hands, at least for those with some awareness of the role that has been played in those great struggles by many secret services and special forces of which he was the true Grand Master. &gt;&quot;The Hero transports himself to a point where he can no longer continue by his own means. He does not know how or where to go. He is in an alley without exit, against a wall, and that is when an arm extends to him, a hand, and he shakes it.&quot;", "filename": "miguelserrano", "ext": ".png", "w": 156, "h": 210, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673054217262468, "time": 1673054217, "md5": "khG8+T6tepcRydLtpXBMaQ==", "fsize": 54878, "resto": 33770667}, {"no": 33778765, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:19:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33771163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33771163</a><br>God didn&#039;t create religion.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more.

I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

However, I discontinued my efforts after a few weeks, as it caused severe inflammation and pieces of dead skin falling off in a particular area. Not only was the pain becoming unbearable, but I realised what I was doing was highly dangerous, as it was becoming difficult to even urinate. After discontinuing my magick, which consisted of daily energy work in a deep trance, the symptoms subsided in just a day.<br><br>My conclusions are that it&#039;s far more efficient to change physical things by physical means, and spiritual things by spiritual means. Not only that, but it&#039;s dangerous to attempt to remove body parts with magick; it&#039;s no different from convincing those parts of your body to destroy themselves, with no guarantee of actually getting the results you want.

Arguments would be solved by wrestling, while stating the logical errors in each other&#039;s beliefs to try to make each other falter; only those with sound reason, or great discipline and true dedication to their convictions, could maintain the will to fight, which they would back up with their physical prowess. Superstition would succumb to the muscles of the wise, and any and all endeavours of humanity would be performed with utmost efficiency. Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them.

Generally, it means that you derive emotional satisfaction and are emotionally involved with your work; there are benefits and challenges to this. You may work in a profession that you find to be personally meaningful and emotionally satisfying, or perhaps you may work in some kind of nurturing role, as a doctor or a nurse for example. Your Mars and Jupiter are both co-present here. Mars is in fall in Cancer, whereas Jupiter is exalted here - again, you may want to look the meaning of this.

Jupiter in exaltation suggests that you will enjoy great luck in the field of work and health, and while Jupiter does not prevent illness in this placement, it does make for good, quick and complete recoveries. Jupiter favours charitable and magnanimous behaviours, and you may receive additional rewards for behaving in ways amenable to the energies of Jupiter. Your 6th house is in a superior square with your moon, the ruler of Cancer, which is a bit difficult to unpick, but may be a positive development - the moon may offer some assistance to Jupiter and particularly to Mars, although squares aspects are competitive and dynamic relationships so it might be a bumpy ride.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have a 7th house in Leo, which means that you will be attracted to partners with Leo qualities.

You may value your inner peace highly. You are diplomatic, gifted with empathy, and eager to reconcile conflicts. Since the 9th house governs long distance travel, spirituality, and higher learning, you may find peace and emotional fulfilment and security in these topics. They may be of particular importance and value for your emotional health. Your moon has a lot of aspects from other placements and plays a subordinate role in all of them due to the principle of overcoming. Your 5th house stellium enjoys a superior trine with your moon, and Mercury enjoys a close degree-based trine. This means that your personality, discipline, and especially rationality may play a large part in balancing and securing your emotional life, perhaps particularly in relation to 9th house topics. Mars and Jupiter have a superior square with your moon, introducing tension and conflict between your work life/health and your emotional well being and higher pursuits; this may lead either to pain or to growth. You may have very developed emotional faculties thanks to Jupiter, but also increased emotional energy and tension courtesy of Mars, which, however, is severely debilitated and reliant upon the Moon when it is placed in Cancer, reducing its influence, negative and positive. Venus also enjoys a superior sextile with the moon, which provides a small beneficial effect, but since Venus rules Libra, it also provides a major beneficial effect, since the moon can receive the proper guidance it needs in order to do its work when placed in Libra.</span>", "time": 1673066344, "resto": 33737217}, {"no": 33780169, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)23:40:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33777889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33777889</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You may want to look up the meanings of the Midheaven (marked MC), 10th House in Scorpio and 11th House in Sagittarius.

Jupiter is suppressed but it&#039;s still a minorly beneficial placement for your life in terms of luck and health. It also has a sextile to your Pisces stellium in the third house. The third house refers to day-to-day communication, short journeys and siblings. Something here will be central to your life since you have the sun and the ascendant ruler (Saturn) there. It&#039;s a night chart so Saturn is the most malefic planet, but there&#039;s reception with Jupiter + it&#039;s your ascendant ruler, so it&#039;ll go easier on you. Might be rough though, especially since Mars is there as well - the good news is that the Sun renders Mars combust, which weakens the planet tremendously and prevents it from doing much harm. Pisces in Third House might mean you like to almost lose yourself in these topics, really relax and embrace the value of the third house. Venus in Aries means some luck but also some fieriness in family life - no reception so it&#039;s kind of eh as a placement. Cancer moon in 7th definitely checks out with your &quot;I can fix her&quot; stuff here. <a href=\"#p33780765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33780765</a> It&#039;s in opposition with your good luck Jupiter too. Probably a place in need of some work. No reception for your second house Mercury either, but you might work some skilled technical job to do with your hands, intellect, or writing.<br>Overall, very family and love focused chart, a kind of home-loving and sociable person.", "time": 1673073357, "resto": 33737217}, {"no": 33780874, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)01:39:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33780819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33780819</a><br>Same house as well then.

Additionally, house placements can vary between whole sign/placidus so that might be something worth checking out. I also think the 8th house has a lot to do with legacies as well - for example, if you check the chart of Pope John Paul II, you&#039;ll see he has important placements in the 8th house and he received both the position of a priest and the position of a Pope as a result of accepting a legacy bequeathed upon him. <br><a href=\"#p33780926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33780926</a><br>Saturn generally affects things negatively unless it is in a good placement or has some kind of reception condition (like a trine, square or sex tile to the ruler of the house it is in).
