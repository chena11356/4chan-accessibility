Nomadic pastoralists don&#039;t need to organize society. That&#039;s why I said about castes emerging with cities I.e mahajanapadas. There were specialized men who fought.

Father to son ,the secret knowledge passed originally, no matter the occupation of father and son . This can be verified on the vedic texts where one poet says how his father and mother are engaged in handiwork while he is a bard-poet .<br><br>Lowest caste were formed ,not by enslaving but only to include people where they moved to in vedic life .

And rather than being disgusted when you uncover them; rather than raging against the facade and demanding exposure, society trains you instead to open yourself; to process and integrate myriad strangeness into your understanding of reality with finesse and empathy.

So cute! She is around the same age as L. and she sees in her her idol and a teacher. She literally follows her everywhere and tries to mimic her gestures, movement, attitudes etc. Like a little monkey lol.. Chili is a reptilian human hybrid. A sister to L. of sorts. She absolutely adores L. and is almost like a little pet, no offense meant. She is not offended by the way, she doesn&#039;t care what anyone thinks of her, unlike most reptilians. Very openhearted and genuinely curious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s trying to learn how to human haha. She is very interested in us, and L. is her guide. She is also willing to show her reptilian ways, but she wasn&#039;t taught those. She was raised as a hybrid away from the more primal reptilian energies. There is a sweet innocence in her, and also a quest to find out who and what exactly she is. The reptilian part of her family is benevolent, and also hybrid (not related to Draco genetics), and their race&#039;s energies remind me a lot of the Yits (TReb is a reptilian hybrid from that race, channeled by Rob Gauthier). Only Chili is even more human than that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She is not big as most reptilians. Slender and limber, like a tiny lizard scurrying between the rocks. She is about 5 feet tall, perhaps a bit less at this age. But she loves to walk on all fours too, and loves to rock climb, and bask in the sun.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel she is very excited about actually coming to Earth physically in an open contact way. Some day. It&#039;s almost like a Little Mermaid wanting to have feet and live on the land. It is her greatest excitement. But of course she is not desperate about it, she knows about perfect timing and that all will be perfect as it already is.</span><br><br>...yeah so I guess you can shoot your shot now?", "time": 1676081984, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056008, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055973</a><br><a href=\"#p34055937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055937</a><br><a href=\"#p34055984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055984</a><br>I am going to rape an alien", "time": 1676082000, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056013, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>Hmm, to be honest I was hoping to meet an alien diplomat observer whichever.<br><br>One that is willing to dispense with the feel good ideas that humans psychologically require.<br><br>The common masses will always be too dangerous for the foreign nature of aliens, unless modified greatly.", "time": 1676082049, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056014, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>source", "time": 1676082061, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056015, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>It was the Scorpios asking them, and it wasn&#039;t &quot;asking&quot; as much as it was them being grabbed by the arms and escorted out", "time": 1676082062, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056018, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055980</a><br>This is impressive stuff, which 4chan thread was this leaked in?", "time": 1676082083, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056022, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056000</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;divine quads</span><br>What other tidings do you bring uakkh2ms great sage?", "filename": "scientific laws", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1025, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 43, "tim": 1676082103908769, "time": 1676082103, "md5": "oKm3reSBhz0W5Zh3xIaMkA==", "fsize": 107431, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056030, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "do i get lyran dommy mommy gf?", "filename": "lyrian", "ext": ".png", "w": 941, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1676082220023476, "time": 1676082220, "md5": "rQ28E5n6BdgmH9DoWfZ85A==", "fsize": 903365, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056031, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056008</a><br>Thank you for proving my point.<br>What a useful idiot.<br>Enjoy the slave mines, if you aren&#039;t used as compost.", "time": 1676082224, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056032, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056014</a><br>its literally in every pic but: https://www.vashta.com/my-product/c<wbr>hili/<br><br>The guy is fucking great at what he does and you can see that he&#039;s still improving.", "time": 1676082226, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056042, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>Would share body heat with.", "time": 1676082397, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056047, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056031</a><br>You will never outsmart an alien.

To our knowledge, from all the immune cells investigated to date, none of them has been found to be inert to dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Generally, ALA, DHA, and EPA exert an inhibitory effect on the activation of immune cells from both the innate and the adaptive branch. Interestingly, some specific immune functions are promoted by dietary omega-3 fatty acids in specific immune cell types, i.e., phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils or Treg differentiation, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids do not act as unspecific immune-repressors.<br><br>Omega-3 FAs could be a potential antimicrobial drug with little potential for drug resistance [72]. The metabolites of both omega-3 and omega-6 play an important role in the synthesis of different mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, protectins, and resolvins [9]. The study shows that fish oil enhances antiviral response by inducing interferon (IFN) which inhibits viral replication [69]. The anti-inflammatory effect by omega-3 FAs is stronger in DHA compared to that of EPA, and their secretion of cytokines IL-10 is further increased by omega-3. CD8 T cells are responsible for fighting against viruses by inducing the production of different cytokines in the body, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and granzyme B. However, the surge of cytokines by CD8 T cells to defend influenza viruses impose unintended lung damage and further deteriorate the clinical outcome. Omega-3 FAs weaken the antiviral response by CD8 T cells and could potentially be used to modulate cytokine responses as antiviral responses, and this process is further explained in Figure 3 [73].", "time": 1676261671, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34073884, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:15:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073765</a><br>I told you to explain yourself<br>the process<br>examples studies anything and you literally cannot do any of the sort. i have nothing and your coping", "time": 1676261742, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34073946, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:22:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lysine deficiency impaired growth performance and immune response and aggravated inflammatory response of the skin, spleen and head kidney in grown-up grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)<br>Yangyang Hu,a Lin Feng,a,b,c Weidan Jiang,a,b,d Pei Wu,a,b,d Yang Liu,a,b,e Shengyao Kuang,f Ling Tang,f and Xiaoqiu Zhoua,b,c,\u2217<br>Author information Article notes Copyright and License information Disclaimer<br>Go to:<br>Abstract<br>This dissertation was primarily focused on the immune response, inflammatory response and molecular mechanisms in the skin, head kidney and spleen of grown-up grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Six iso-nitrogen diets differing in lysine concentrations (5.6, 8.5, 11.6, 14.4, 17.5 and 20.7 g/kg) were fed to 540 grass carp (164.85 \u00b1 0.79 g) for 60 d.

This study revealed that lysine deficiency (1) suppressed the growth performance of the fish and decreased their ability to resist skin lesion morbidity, (2) impaired the immune organ&#039;s immune response by decreasing the gene expressions of mucin, liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP)-2B, \u03b2-defensin-1 and LEAP-2A and the production of antibacterial compounds of grown-up grass carp, and (3) aggravated the inflammatory response of immune organs in the fish by increasing the gene expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon \u03b32 [IFN-\u03b32], tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL]-15,", "time": 1676262130, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34073962, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lysine enhances the effect of amphotericin B against Candida albicans in vitro<br>Liuya Zhao 1, Jingchen Jiang 2, Zhenyu Zhu 2, Zebin Liao 2, Xiangwen Yao 2, Yu Yang 2, Yingying Cao 3, Yuanying Jiang 3<br>Affiliations expand<br>PMID: 26711896 DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmv125<br>Free article<br>Abstract<br>Amphotericin B (AmB) is a polyene antibiotic produced by Streptomyces nodosus and has been used for &gt;50 years in the treatment of acute systemic fungal infections.

In addition, the combination of AmB with lysine could provide an enhanced action against Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans compared with AmB alone. Lysine could also enhance the antifungal effect of caspofungin or nystatin. An enhanced effect of the combination of lysine with AmB was observed for the prevention of biofilm and hypha formation. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that lysine-mediated oxidative damage, such as the generation of endogenous reactive oxygen species, may be the mechanism underlying the enhancing effect of lysine on AmB. Our results also showed that CaMCA1 gene plays an important role in increasing the sensitivity of C. albicans cells upon AmB treatment.

As functional amino acids, they play important roles in physiological functions, including immune functions. Isoleucine, as one of the branched chain amino acids, is also critical in physiological functions of the whole body, such as growth, immunity, protein metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and glucose transportation. Isoleucine can improve the immune system, including immune organs, cells and reactive substances. Recent studies have also shown that isoleucine may induce the expression of host defense peptides (i.e., \u03b2-defensins) that can regulate host innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, isoleucine administration can restore the effect of some pathogens on the health of humans and animals via increasing the expression of \u03b2-defensins. Therefore, the present review will emphatically discuss the effect of isoleucine on immunity while summarizing the relationship between branched chain amino acids and immune functions.", "time": 1676262409, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074004, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:27:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Branching Out: Alterations in Bacterial Physiology and Virulence Due to Branched-Chain Amino Acid Deprivation<br>Julienne C.

Garsin, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston;<br>Author information Copyright and License information Disclaimer<br>Go to:<br>ABSTRACT<br>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs [Ile, Leu, and Val]) represent important nutrients in bacterial physiology, with roles that range from supporting protein synthesis to signaling and fine-tuning the adaptation to amino acid starvation. In some pathogenic bacteria, the adaptation to amino acid starvation includes induction of virulence gene expression: thus, BCAAs support not only proliferation during infection, but also the evasion of host defenses. A body of research has accumulated over the years to describe the multifaceted physiological roles of BCAAs and the mechanisms bacteria use to maintain their intracellular levels. More recent studies have focused on understanding how fluctuations in their intracellular levels impact global regulatory pathways that coordinate the adaptation to nutrient limitation, especially in pathogenic bacteria. In this minireview, we discuss how these studies have refined the individual roles of BCAAs, shed light on how BCAA auxotrophy might promote higher sensitivity to exogenous BCAA levels, and revealed pathogen-specific responses to BCAA deprivation. These advancements improve our understanding of how bacteria meet their nutritional requirements for growth while simultaneously remaining responsive to changes in environmental nutrient availability to promote their survival in a range of environments.", "time": 1676262479, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074028, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:30:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "wait until the sugar insul carb candida studies come out then maybe youll know how candida works and the human body", "time": 1676262626, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074041, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073977</a><br><a href=\"#p34073884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073884</a><br>down syndrome?", "time": 1676262687, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074177, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073777</a><br>checked", "time": 1676263889, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074206, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:55:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;ll be nice when the big change happens we won&#039;t have to listen to this dumbass and his spam posts", "time": 1676264113, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074225, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:57:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34064922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34064922</a><br>Holy shit.<br><br>Recently I did 5MeODMT experience (and was doing Semen Retention for about 2 weeks because the Neoshaman I did it with told me that it&#039;s better to be sexually &quot;free&quot; so to speak). <br><br>Anyway long story short, I had a partial Kundalini awakening and my entire 2/3 weeks after 5meo were wild as fuck.

At the time, I was five or six. It was a Sunday night, and for whatever reason I slept in the same bed as my mother. We both woke around three, and rushed to the window. A man, followed by a helicopter search light was rushing from the end of our cul-de-sac, accessible by a footpath, and up our street. In a flash, he was surrounded by armed police(?) officers dressed in all black. My mother then dragged me away from the window and I quickly fell back into sleep. To this day, she affirms this happened and remembers only as much detail as I do.

Most ancient sites resonate in the same frequency range as human brain waves (roughly 5-50Hz) and in the same frequencies as the earth resonant fields (Schumann Freqs) of between 7-28Hz. Whatever it is, I think it has to do with acoustics and the conversion of acoustic energy into electrical energy and vice versa.

Muscle hypertrophy is the process of strengthening muscle through repeated stress, causing the fibers to tear and heal, becoming stronger and larger. This is what most people do to train strength in the gym. There is another way, however. This is called Neural Adaptation; training your brain and nervous system to utilize muscle more efficiently and effectively.<br>Whether you define these techniques as meditation is up to you. I want you to stand up and place your arms in front of you. Tighten your core and flex your arms without moving your hands. As hard as you can. Flex until you can feel every muscle in your arm straining. Try to maintain that flex and move to the next step.<br>While keeping your core tight, reach forward as if you were grabbing onto a ball. Without relaxing your arms, pull them back, as if placing the ball onto a table beside you. Reach forward again and repeat the motion. Keep your arms flexed, your core muscles tight, and breath steadily. Over time your brain will learn more efficient neural pathways to the muscles fibers, allowing you to activate specific muscle groups more effectively. This will not enable you some magical strength, but it will unlock your full potential if done correctly.", "time": 1676291714, "resto": 34035925}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34040903, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:16:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Post the most schizo sounding thing you actually believe.", "filename": "1658311218820", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 871, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 217, "tim": 1675923366499869, "time": 1675923366, "md5": "0li3+3EAkTBMe5qKhKTN6A==", "fsize": 417693, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "post-the-most-schizo-sounding-thing-you-actually", "replies": 268, "images": 58, "unique_ips": 175}, {"no": 34040919, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:19:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;34040917</span><br>no thanks", "filename": "1674616143075", "ext": ".png", "w": 1312, "h": 1249, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1675923590314418, "time": 1675923590, "md5": "wtlVu5dJkRjwlPFPrPAxwA==", "fsize": 2303616, "resto": 34040903}, {"no": 34040938, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:22:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34040903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34040903</a><br>A long time ago we did something in another place.

NDEs are almost always described as more real than our reality. And often people compare the reality shift to that which people experience when waking up from a dream. In other words, we know dreams are not real since, when we wake up, it is more realistic than the dream.

Break the phrase down: A conspiracy is a secret plan, often among powerful people, to do something bad. A theory is an idea. A conspiracy theory is inherently a rebellious thought. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone was making an intentional effort to feed conspiracy theorists weird shit. This would accomplish several things for conspirators of all kinds:<br><br>1. Anyone who could be defined as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; will look like a crazy person to normies. This would make it harder for conspiracy theorists to gain supporters, or even friends. They will probably even lose existing friends, though they will also gain a few friends in the conspiracy theorist world. However, the overall end result is that the conspiracy theorist becomes an outcast in society, and they can only go to other conspiracy theorists for support.<br><br>2. Anyone who gets into conspiracy theories will be fed tons of red herrings, many of which contain outrageous and fantastical things like aliens and demons and stuff. These kinds of theories will naturally be better at spreading than the legit but boring ones. Even if the true story is out there, nobody is interested in it. Aliens are much more fun to talk about.<br><br>3. Due to constantly discussing ufos and witchcraft and mind control and shit as if those were real things, a conspiracy theorist&#039;s grip on reality is likely to slip. They&#039;ll end up fitting the schizo theorist stereotype to some degree. They&#039;ll also become more fearful of the subjects of their conspiracy theories, and therefore less likely to form any actual resistance against them. Sorcerers and lizard men are a lot scarier than corrupt politicians and entrepreneurs, and politicians are extra scary if you think that they&#039;re lizard men that can read your thoughts.", "time": 1676115826, "resto": 34040903}, {"no": 34059513, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34058183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34058183</a><br>Ha, ok that was a pretty good story, even if they were somewhat condescending dicks.

It&#039;s why the geometry is sacred and math is the language of the universe. God was the source that split itself apart so that other forms of life could exist, and in this reality we see that play out on a massive scale. All things in this universe are extensions of the first duality, the first choice. <br>If someone asks me what the meaning of life is this is what I would tell them.<br><br>What they were explaining to me was that that concept is why evil exists. Evil, low vibrational beings are needed to be the opposing point to Good. Evil exists because good exists and vice versa. God as the source was the first being to have a choice.

In 3 months he had normal blood pressure. <br>I for instance had huge cravings of tuna cans. I supplemented omega 3 pills to that. Turns out my seborrhea dermatitis (skin disease like that of psoriasis) just entirely went away.

My most successful attempt I was floating in the corner of my room looking at my body but I felt a very dark energy coming from the closet. For some context, my brother used to complain about all sorts of weird shit with this closet and his wife even picked up and left in the middle of the night one time because of some shit she was experiencing in that room. The first time I myself stayed in the room I woke up in the middle of the night half dragged into the closet legs first, which is especially interesting because I was sleeping on a bed with my legs facing the opposite direction. ANYWAY, as I&#039;m floating there noticing this scary energy, I start to panic and I can feel this shadow dragging me into the closet. Luckily I had done a ton of &quot;research&quot; into this topic and recalled that things can only &quot;touch&quot; me in this state if I am scared, since I am in a form of raw energy. So I took a deep breathe and closed my eyes and repeated that I will be okay, and as I&#039;m doing this I can feel myself slowly floating back towards my body uninhibited. I open my eyes and I feel like I&#039;m going too slow for me so I panic for another moment, quickly feeling myself getting jerked back towards the closet. So I close my eyes and repeat that I&#039;m going to be okay, focusing all of my energy to relax, and lo and behold I start slowly floating back towards my body. Once I open my (real) eyes I swore off ever fucking with this shit again.

This can be interpreted as a Doppler effect of the galaxies all moving away from us. This was Hubble\u2019s interpretation, and it is the commonly accepted interpretation now. The most natural conclusion to draw from this is that we are at the center of the universe. As Hubble writes, \u201cSuch a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth\u201d (The Observational Approach to Cosmology 40). Hawking agrees that this is the most natural explanation of the observation: \u201cNow at first sight,\u201d he writes, \u201call this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe\u201d (A Brief History of Time 44-45).<br><br>So both admit that this is the most natural interpretation of the evidence. That puts the burden of proof on anyone claiming otherwise. Nevertheless, both Hawking and Hubble admit that they reject this most natural interpretation without being able to shift the burden. They do not even try. Indeed, they do not even pretend to try. Hubble calls the principle on which his alternative explanation rests \u201csheer assumption\u201d (Observational Approach to Cosmology 42), and he admits that the hypothesis that we are at the center of the universe \u201ccannot be disproved\u2026\u201d (Observational Approach to Cosmology 40). In other words, he admits that the burden of proof cannot be shifted. Hawking agrees, saying, \u201cWe have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption [the assumption that the universe has no center]\u201d (A Brief History of Time 45).", "time": 1676290833, "resto": 34076040}, {"no": 34076568, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:21:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076364</a><br>Hubble\u2019s justification for rejecting the geocentric interpretation is sheer horror of its implications.

It would be most remarkable if the universe looked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe!\u201d (A Brief History of Time 45).<br><br>The alternative view they are referring to is \u201cFriedmann\u2019s second assumption,\u201d and it explains the observed phenomenon by claiming that there is no center to the universe. The usual analogy is to imagine a balloon with dots on it. The surface of the balloon represents all of space, and the dots represent galaxies. In that scenario, no matter which dot you are, all the other dots would seem to be leaving you as the balloon expands.<br>Of course, this requires you to ignore the actual space inside the balloon, the expansion of which explains what is happening on the surface.

This mental form lasts as long as the power given to the original thought or wish allows it to. The thoughts of many people are indecisive and evanescent, so that thought forms created by them do not last longer than some minutes or maybe hours. However, a powerful wish or an often-repeated wish or thought can give rise to a mental form lasting for days.<br><br>These thought-forms seem to have an instinct or tendency to preserve themselves as all living beings do have. People\u2019s thoughts mostly refer to themselves, so that the thought form will stay with them and, in this way, it will provoke a tendency to repeat the thought or wish from which it was created so as to gain power and prolong its own life. Such a thought-form nourished by often-repeated thougths is able to haunt a person for many years, gaining strength and influence, sometimes with very negative effects.&quot;<br><br>The 4 usually attributed types of Thoughtforms according to the Western Magickal Tradition are as follows: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tulpas</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Servitors</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Egregores</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Godforms</span><br><br>What are your experiences with these, /x/?

Regardless of a bad situation, he found silver linings and was always optimistic for a better future. But this event damaged him beyond repair. I was friends with John while this all happened, and although you may think he&#039;s luckily to be alive, this incident completely shattered his mind. He initially was ok, but after he found out it was human traffickers or some crazy shut like organ harvesters, he shut down. No more optimism, no silver lining or hopeful for the future, he now looked at life through a cynical and doom filled lense. John bought a gun and locked himself inside his house for multiple weeks. We had police do welfare checks on him so we knew he was alive, and everytime he would answer and say he&#039;s fine. But he wouldn&#039;t talk to his friends, family, job, nothing. Just the cops when they showed up, and there wasn&#039;t much else they could do since he hadn&#039;t threatened suicide or doing any harm.<br><br>After a couple weeks he finally started talking to me, and he told me all of this, and that this whole experience destroyed his mental health and that every time he sees the scars on his bodies he&#039;s reminded of the fate he almost met. Cold dead eyes and doesn&#039;t laugh or smile, and anytime we hang out and he always keeps his right hand by his side next to his gun. That&#039;s the new John.

Although, I used to hold the belief that he was born on Sept. 11th, 2001, and that the Twin Tower attacks were a ritual to signify his birth. One tower had an antenna atop it, whilst the other had a landing pad. Male and female, Boaz and Jachin, white and black, good and evil, etc. And then the One World Trade Center which took the place of the Twin Towers had both a flat base and an antenna, signifying the merging of the opposites into one, which is a key occult ideal. This would mean the Anti-Christ would actually be a hermaphrodite, not a post-op transsexual. The Jews also allegedly believe that God is both genders, so there\u2019s that, too, as the Jewish messiah is the Anti-Christ. As for when they revealed themselves, I would say 2030 if they were born in 2000, and 2031 if born in 2001. They work false miracles and build power over a 3 year period, and then in 2033/2034, they enter the Third Temple (which I believe will be fully built by that point in time), and declare themselves to be higher than God. The seven year tribulation would then last until 2040/2041.", "time": 1676273474, "resto": 34074296}, {"no": 34076447, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)06:51:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "mr beast is the antichrist", "filename": "1676211532950486", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 449, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 77, "tim": 1676289079054173, "time": 1676289079, "md5": "nNWmN5+A74tEP3et/WJpTg==", "fsize": 33239, "resto": 34074296}, {"no": 34076465, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)06:55:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076447</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;caring about either and following that russia ukraine shit at all</span><br>absolutely NGMI", "time": 1676289349, "resto": 34074296}, {"no": 34076490, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:03:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076447</a><br>Slav(e)", "filename": "Slav(e)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 599, "h": 478, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1676289797403741, "time": 1676289797, "md5": "73miWudhRerrcvBxEz8Z3A==", "fsize": 52267, "resto": 34074296}, {"no": 34076516, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)07:11:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34074296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34074296</a><br>Yes he does and he will be making this place hell<br><br>Personally im all in him", "time": 1676290318, "resto": 34074296}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34076470, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)06:56:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do zoomees only di &quot;research&quot; by watching tourube vudeos and youtubers now?

Your identity is fused with your pain, hard to separate your &quot;self&quot; and &quot;wound&quot; from each other. At times you feel guilty for existing, a tendency for being harsh on yourself.

Able to guide your community towards these solutions because of clear principles and efficiency. A need for sense of belonging in the world, knowing how each individual is connected as one. A deep connection to animals or plants. You are intelligent and have a natural curiosity. Lots of creativity and ideas that can influence others, which ties into holding a certain idealism or concept about the world, for how things should be, could be, ect. A need for seeking new things, ideas, thoughts. This idealism may have been somberly tempered after a certain point in your life because of your experiences, but trying to rekindle it is something that will come with time.

Tidus and friends broke the cycle of Summoner + Guardian Sacrifice. In X-2 people were once again free to decide and thus created factions and splinter religions trying to find a new compass and direction.<br><br>There is plenty of symbolism and esoterics to be found in Final Fantasy X and the sequel. While I don&#039;t knock down the inquiry by the OP for phrasing the title of the thread like that, it does conjure up the need to replay the game to get a better thesis on the structure of the in-game religion.<br><br>For example, a System of sacrifice was created to keep humanity in check in Spira since whatever the Cause was it was better to contain the power of Sin by propping it up and destroying it every ten years to prevent the End of all life in Spira.<br><br>Tidus was just a puppet created by the Fayth who dreamed a simulation of what life was like back before the catastrophe that befell Spira. Which is analogous to Neo from the Matrix franchise.<br><br>I bring up Neo because just like Sin, Neo is so full of Potent Power that even the Machine Authorities (Fayth) want to prevent a Jabberwock scenario whereby their Puppet Creation becomes an indestructible Machine God (like Sin) because if they have to resort to another Integral Anomaly they&#039;d risk yet another Neo vs Smith Scenario. This of course implies previous Jabberwocks (NEOs) that the Authorities (Momeroths) repurpose (Agent Smith) to serve the System just in case the new Integral Anomaly becomes indestructible. So they use trickery to do what they do for the fixes regardless of fairness or unfairness to the integral anomaly.<br><br>What I Am typing is quite simple, eventually, a Jabberwock (any program character that might have been a NEO Son of Man from the Matrix) could become like a Sin or far more powerful.", "filename": "OIP (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676229080923513, "time": 1676229080, "md5": "a+LeBFcpEnfd/U3FxXQf3Q==", "fsize": 25413, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34070561, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)16:23:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066666</a><br>How are you reading things into it that aren&#039;t there?", "time": 1676237008, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34071033, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)17:16:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066666</a><br>By having us fight Seymor 1000000000000 times", "time": 1676240218, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34072025, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)19:07:05", "name": "Anonaymouse", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066666</a><br>You know Gongaga?", "time": 1676246825, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34072321, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)19:46:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i love the ff games the ones ive played anyway.<br><br>theyre based on dragon quest, which is based on 80s crpgs, which are based on D&amp;D, which is based on real magic... so you have a remote association with sorcery there. but the magic is mostly just a tool in battles, a genre staple. but i dont know. one time i was playing ff7r and just as i summoned ifrit my cat turned her head to the left and stared at this one spot like something had appeared in the room. sp00ky.<br><br>the stories are rich with archetypes. aeris is basically a saint figure. her theme expresses her character and fate so beautifully, i cry when i hear it. sephiroth is an eloquent embodiment of the opposite idea/archetype. aeris sacrifices herself for the world, sephiroth sacrifices the world for himself. makes u think. and the wonderful uematsu soundtracks, and the games look so charming.<br><br>is it alright to play them? i dont know. is it alright to read homer and hesiod? is it alright to enjoy stravinskys rite of spring? are veggietales and spurgeon sermons the only thing a christian can consume?", "time": 1676249182, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34073091, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)21:35:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066666</a><br>Final Fantasy is a distraction from Shin Megami Tensei which shows time and time again that the only path forward is to reject all false idols, focus on the traits that make humanity worth saving, and find our own path forward.", "filename": "rip_and_possibly_tear", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 632, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676255727346527, "time": 1676255727, "md5": "tEE/h6yAR8/xqRxKEDtVyA==", "fsize": 69225, "resto": 34066666}, {"no": 34074645, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:05:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34066666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34066666</a><br>Square enix has been dropping schizo truth bombs for years.

In other words, the &quot;number of the beast&quot; was not expressed as &quot;666&quot; (indeed, discrete Arabic numerals would not be invented for another five hundred years) but by the phrase hexakosioi hexekonta hex or the numerical values of the Greek letters themselves, chi (600), xi (60), and stigma (6).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what is curious is not so much that 666 can be decoded to signify Nero but that the name is encoded in this particular number, especially since it could have been represented as readily in other ways. It only is when the words are transliterated from Greek into Hebrew and then calculated that the numeration adds up to 666 (nrwn qsr, 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 + 100 + 60 + 200). Even so, this is an alternate spelling, a letter being transliterated in &quot;Neron&quot; (nrwn instead of nrw) but not in &quot;Caesar&quot; (qsr instead of qysr). Although these forms do appear in the Talmud and an Aramaic scroll from Qumran, they no doubt complicated the solution to the puzzle.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For Watt, the significance of 666 is that its expression in Latin is the sequential Roman numerals DCLXVI, which parallels but is the antithesis of the &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; that John used to characterize both Christ (22:13) and God (1:8, 21:6). As the Deity represents the beginning and end, so the Antichrist is a reversal of the first and last, D (500) preceding I (1). To phrase this another way, 666 (or rather DCLXVI) signifies the Antichrist because that number signifies Nero, and Nero\u2014who was a matricide, proclaimed his divinity on coins as the &quot;Savior and Benefactor of the World,&quot; and was the first emperor to persecute Christians\u2014signifies the Antichrist.</span><br>https://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grou<wbr>t/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/n<wbr>ero.html", "time": 1676255861, "resto": 34072931}, {"no": 34073162, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)21:43:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34072942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34072942</a><br>There is no pre-tribulation rapture.<br><a href=\"#p34072991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34072991</a><br>The elect are going to be present when the Anti-Christ is on Earth, as it says that if possible, even the elect would be deceived by him.<br><a href=\"#p34073013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073013</a><br>Nero isn\u2019t the Anti-Christ, glownigger.", "time": 1676256181, "resto": 34072931}, {"no": 34073188, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)21:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073162</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no pre-tribulation rapture.</span><br>this is what I am leaning towards but my church teaches pre-trib pretty hard.

You seriously think these are aliens? Let me ask you a question that hopefully is going to change your mind. What do you think is more likely: our government knows what these objects are and they belong to and were created by our governments, OR these are alien spacecrafts? Do you know how far away the nearest star is? 4.24 light years. That means it would take 4.24 years if you travelled at the SPEED OF LIGHT. Einstein proved this to be impossible for spacecraft to achieve because the mass of the spacecraft would get infinitely big as it approaches the speed of light. Imagine dragging an Eiffel tower that becomes two Eiffel towers, then four, then 80, then 16000 as you approach the speed of light. It\u2019s not possible to do this. Moreover, there is no guarantee that aliens would even be that close, meaning they could be even further away than that. Our governments are lying to us to distract us from the real issue: experimental aircrafts and otherwise secret projects and they are hoping that you are dumb enough to believe that they are instead aliens\u2026and a lot of people do. Long story short: \u201cUFOs\u201d are publicly identified if they belong to other governments, but not if they belong to your government.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

First would be that all parties involved, even ourselves, are involved in a secret struggle of factions who have decided that mutual suppression is the most beneficial state for their control over the game pieces. Second would be that the metaphysical nature of these phenomena is somehow constrained from being revealed on a grand scale, except sometimes it does with things like the apparition at Fatima or the Phoenix Lights. But even those things are essentially &quot;in dispute&quot; as to what is real. In a certain sense, the paranormal may be bound to its secrecy at a conceptual level such that it is always at the edge of our awareness both as individuals having liminal encounters and as a collective culture trying to comprehend the subject. Circumstances will always conspire to make ultimate proof impossibly elusive. The best videos, which will be rare, will be exciting but too mysterious to prove anything. The best pictures are so stunning that they MUST be fake, because otherwise we have all stared directly at proof, right? It&#039;s the same for witness reports with corroboration through multiple witnesses, physical trace evidence, and all that stuff that makes a report credible. We already have mountains of it. It&#039;s a no brainer if you actually start researching the subject. So how does skepticism hold any power in society? <br>I suppose the third possibility is that they already have, many times, and no one seems to care. There is a massive literature of &quot;aliens came down in a ship and we interacted, then they left&quot; reports which suggests that they regularly reveal themselves. Combine this with all the reports of other ways in which people report experiencing contact with &quot;the other.&quot;", "time": 1676268494, "resto": 34069028}, {"no": 34074705, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:14:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073900</a><br>my buddy sent me this on discord", "time": 1676268869, "resto": 34069028}, {"no": 34074708, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:15:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073254</a><br>im wondering this too. makes you think.", "filename": "1612753895164", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 961, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676268900443952, "time": 1676268900, "md5": "s3Z1CI6nxtRSICv+aA8Z2A==", "fsize": 182082, "resto": 34069028}, {"no": 34074728, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:18:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34072137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34072137</a><br>Oh god i hope not, we&#039;d never, ever hear the end of it.

I met a certain man, and we could hear each other&#039;s thoughts, and couldn&#039;t tell our feelings apart. It felt like fate, and we remembered our time together in a past life, where I &quot;lovingly&quot; haunted him (although it should be noted that I was something along the lines of vengeful spirit at the time, but he fell in love with me even though I was a just ghost, and that really touched my metaphysical heart at the time). We both broke up with our partners to date each other instead. The next few weeks, I spontaneously &quot;remembered&quot; various psychic techniques, one of which was how to initiate spirit sex with a (fellow) human. At the time, I had some body issues that prevented me from enjoying sex physically, so being able to do it astrally felt very liberating, and often I&#039;d have about 12 mind-blowing orgasms even in the span of just 20 minutes when doing it with him.<br><br>But overindulging to such an extent wrecked my sacral chakra to the point that my both my physical and astral body would go numb temporarily, and I&#039;d become unresponsive. I was already feeling overwhelmed with intense bliss at that point, but even so I felt like there was room for improvement. Then I &quot;recalled&quot; that I could simply pull in the sexual energy that was overwhelming my energy body, back to where my sacral chakra is supposed to be (it was wrecked to the point that I couldn&#039;t feel it), compress it into an appropriate shape, and use the energy to simulate the chakra&#039;s functions so I could continue to feel even more pleasure.

What I meant is that people who go into it with more positive expectations will have more positive experiences. You said it yourself by mentioning that goal-oriented people see what they believe, and I mentioned it by saying &quot;like attracts like&quot;. By setting negative expectations, you&#039;re sabotaging the goal-oriented newcomers who read your posts from having a positive experience. Although your actions come from a place of wanting to warn people, you are in fact projecting your own negative experiences on them, which can only end in 3 ways:<br>1) They believe you and heed your advice and avoid having any personal experiences with sexual entities.<br>2) They partially believe you but are desperate enough to try anyway, and the fears you instilled cause them to attract a parasite and have the negative experiences you warned them about.<br>3) They conclude you&#039;re wrong and are otherwise unaffected, thus they will likely have a positive experience.<br>If you simply stayed out of it, the outcome would be similar to outcome 3, but without the &quot;need&quot; to mock you. As for me, by calling out this negative projection of yours, outcome 3 is more likely, which makes me happy as I want to more people to know the joys of spiritual sex. I may not be with an entity currently, but it permanently changed my life, and I think the world would be a better place if more people experienced it; even if not, it&#039;s also simply fun to see people post happily about their unusual experiences that I can relate to. I don&#039;t dislike you as I generally don&#039;t dislike people, but please do try to be more mindful of how you come across.
