I really appreciate him for taking a different approach with all of this. It felt like a real date. He would ask me questions and I could tell he was into it. It confused me because I didn&#039;t think he would care about human things like movies. My truck is lifted to shit so no one could really see me and him talking. I was also towards the back. I didn&#039;t know Avatar was 3 hours long. I started to fall asleep towards the end and then I felt him turn around and started kissing me. This time I didn&#039;t tell him to stop as he has been trying really hard to get closer to me and I was also starting to like him a lot. I wanted to leave but he said it was alright and no one would see us. But I kinda ruined it because I started getting paranoid that someone would see me. So we left early and I found a secluded spot pretty quick out in a field because he was all over me as I drove and he couldn&#039;t wait for me to make it home. We did more things. When I got home it was different he was very happy and I actually like him a lot now. The conversations are still very limited to his one word answers but from reading the previous threads it seems it&#039;ll get better overtime. We seem to be complete opposites in a way but it works. We had a long conversation at night that I intend to keep doing every night now. He sat on my lap and we talked about life while I downed some beers. He says he loves it out here where I live it&#039;s very secluded. My initial thoughts on what he is and what he wants have shifted. He&#039;s told me that I&#039;m the first guy he&#039;s ever been with.

The Statue of Kilkenny banned the use of Gaelic in the early 1300\u00b4s within the PALE, which is a small area around Dublin, since the rest of Ireland at this time was largely autonomous and was ruled by a collection of Hiberno-Norman lords nominally in service to the English crown (apart from the Pale) but in reality independent. The purpose of the Statutes was to curb the increasing Gaelicization of these former Anglo-Norman lords.The Statutes were ignored and failed outside of the Pale and by the time the Plantations happened in the 1600\u00b4s, the now Gaelic nobility ruled rather supreme, with Gaelic culture (and language) perhaps being the strongest at any point in its history. By now the Statutes as piece of legislation are forgotten about.<br><br>After that the Penal Laws banned the use of Gaelic within the legal system. It was forbidden to use Irish in courts and for legal matters. It certainly wasn\u00b4t promoted or encouraged in other aspects of Irish life but it wasn\u00b4t illegal to speak it.

These are spirits in your dreamscape, within your bubble of influence, you literally have the power to compel the truth out of them or banish them away yourself so you don&#039;t need any help you just need to not be so uptight about things you want and not be lazy when actual shit happens to you.", "filename": "1569511455450", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 1130, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675044588113672, "time": 1675044588, "md5": "SxIozJvOwuNY8dE3uCyDkA==", "fsize": 197653, "resto": 33960712}, {"no": 33962577, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:12:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "pray.<br>https://youtu.be/nqAGdE6l_Js<br>https://youtu.be/K2HbHuGvhoo<br><br>jesus is real, the way lucifer is going to decieve the world is &quot;defeating&quot; the jews and ushering in what appears to be a golden age. masons and jews are the first beast of revelation. the second beast system is q, trump, the reset, illuminati, templars, and pseudo christians. they will say jesus was what is called an ascended master like st germaine, who is a figure who appeared in many lives throughout hidtory. st germaine is actually lucifer. <br><br>here is litteral proof of christ for anyone who wants it. read the bible afterwords. <br><br>shroud of turin <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLn<wbr>CIp3OVmE&amp;ab_channel=JesusIsLordGame<wbr>s <br><br>proof satan runs the world from both sides, both dark and &quot;light&quot;. freemasons, jews, illuminati, nazis and government white hats, black hats and grey hats are all comtrolled satanic opposition. this includes trump and q and the coming financial reset.<br><br>https://odysee.com/@probablyalexand<wbr>ra:6/the-root-of-all-evil:2 <br><br>https://odysee.com/the-cult-of-kek:<wbr>88d5126bee1d7109c8c9128216b1af5fef5<wbr>cf576?lid=cec6fdb7967c267ad791ff812<wbr>6cbb8c5fa62bebf <br><br>https://odysee.com/@probablyalexand<wbr>ra:6/an-inconvenient-history:b <br><br>https://odysee.com/@probablyalexand<wbr>ra:6/an-inconvenient-reality:8 <br><br>MARK OF TH BEAST <br>https://odysee.com/@probablyalexand<wbr>ra:6/what-is-the-mark-of-the-beast:<wbr>8?lid=cec6fdb7967c267ad791ff8126cbb<wbr>8c5fa62bebf <br><br>all the different aliens are fallen angels and weve been in contact performing rituals for at least a century <br>https://youtu.be/GUpzzeYbzCc <br><br>i highly reccomend all of alexandras videos. remember, if you seek god and pray, and search with all your heart and soul, you WILL find god and christ.", "time": 1675044722, "resto": 33960712}, {"no": 33964081, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)01:41:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33962085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33962085</a><br>Tarot tend to give me answers all over the place when I make a read on myself, despite being quite accurate for others.

When you were a child, you threw tantrums when your family couldn&#039;t provide you with the things you wanted and this never went away in adulthood. One of your adaptations for your delicate temperament is to resort to rationalizing the mind to keep things under control.

Vampires, lycanthropes, berserker druids, all manner of things exist where people change into entirely different beings. But there has to be some sort of bridge which causes a genetic trigger. I want to know these things. It&#039;s not even just a human thing, certain ayy species also have genetic triggers to evolve certain classes of themselves into something else. There is a whole mystic mystery here that is kept guarded and spread through different traditions but so secretive that there is barely an inkling on piecing the initiation portion of the process down to trigger actual change. It is only feasible to find magic which emulates this stuff, or only half-steps before the initiatory process.

There&#039;s a distinct shape and character to it but it&#039;s discreet. More importantly than the teeth they also see this light when they close their eyes, blue for men and red for women. It&#039;s their own soul perpetually in it&#039;s essential motion. Also they&#039;re more sensitive to the noetic world and can also sometimes see the spirits as small sparks of light.

Candida depletes glucose leading to the rapid death of macrophages.[25] In this particular manuscript, there is an interesting fact. Metformin was administered to healthy mice, but they didn\u2019t have low blood glucose even after long-term administration. However, in the case of infection with small doses of C albicans, the same animals had severe hypoglycemia even on the first day of infection. Our research has confirmed that Candida increases insulin secretion provoking decreasing in blood glucose levels. <br><br>Sugar is deadly toxic to blood vessels it may just be trying to get rid of excess sugar<br><br>Candida has developed several mechanisms that enable successful colonization and evasion of host immune response. This leads to the question of whether the presence of Candida in the food is desirable or not. Consumption of sugar-rich food means intake of Candida too.

So if you take anti fungals and blow it up you&#039;re basically just doing chemo warfare. All the anti fungal rx meds don&#039;t work and I haven&#039;t seen anyone here post proofs of it working either. One person said they did the protocol for an entire year. You can eat garlic Cayenne turmeric jalepenos and many other herbs spices anti fungals and anti parasites and shit out fungus and parasites but it doesn&#039;t completely get rid of either especially not fungus as it&#039;s integral to our body and much smarter than you. If fungus dies you&#039;ll die that&#039;s why it&#039;s there until it over grows from poor diet eating things like processed food sugar refined carbs plants fruits ect. Our bodies can&#039;t handle THIS much sugar and its why it&#039;s happening to everyone. The sugar consumption has 10x since 1800s or 1900s at 120lbs per year or something. Taking that into account the chemicals they put in food Coffees drinks and pesticides in veggies ect. So the only way is to get the sugar until control and then the candida have a less viable food source. Your immune system will begin to work better pancreas organs inflammation ect ect. But right from day 1 or 2 your body starts pooping out fungus and parasites. Fat and ketosis is the way your body expels toxins. Your toxins are absorbed in your fat and so when you replace it with clean new steak fat and butter your body expels the old fat with the toxins and replaces it or burns the new fat for energy doesn&#039;t need the old. It&#039;s why fungus and parasites are pooped out for a month or two on the beginning of every carnivore diet and why people lose weight gain muscle feel amazing lose all that water your body is holding onto. Which like alcoholics , the water counteracts the poisons. If you just do the protocol for a year maybe it will work like a nuclear bomb killing everything in sight.

Hitler had been in contact with these groups in the 1920s, and he was part of a council, an offshoot of the Round Table Group, which looked for a common metaphysical ground between the eastern and western worlds, called &quot;Der Ring&quot;. This group I have visited multiple times during 1938 and 1939, after the events of 1938, the Reichskristallnacht, the Conference of Evian, the Anschlu\u00df of Austria, and many different things that showed the impredictability of both national socialists and jewish organizations, which were perfectly willing to sacrifice millions of their ethnic brethren, many dropped National Socialism like a hot potato and wanted nothing to do with it. <br>Your other question about Gu\u00e9non: It is precisely the nature of counter-initiation that you have indicated. Gangstalking, as you call it, is conceivable on the psychic and corporeal plane. It is the case that certain groups do only operate effectively when they are in line with collective psychic entitities that attack certain groups or individuals, this has happened with Guenon for example.

It&#039;s different from something like cunny where kids are just cute and innocent, there are no redeeming features and it&#039;s just a base sexual drive misfiring in the form of a fetish that society worships now.<br><a href=\"#p33960627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33960627</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey I get that you&#039;re sexually attracted to other men but why does your sexual attraction have to be so... sexual?</span><br>Really not surprising if you just look at it as a fetish, imagine if footniggers were allowed to have foot parades and showing their big stinky feet to people with pride was celebrated.", "time": 1675027884, "resto": 33959354}, {"no": 33960803, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:37:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33959354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33959354</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What Are Gays?</span><br>They\u2019re carriers of the girl virus. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the secret about them that they don&#039;t want people to know?</span><br>They want to rape you and turn you into a girl with their girl virus.", "time": 1675028279, "resto": 33959354}, {"no": 33960890, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:50:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33960639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33960639</a><br>After this covid farce, I don&#039;t really care what the (((medical establishment))) thinks.", "time": 1675029003, "resto": 33959354}, {"no": 33960902, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33960890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33960890</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Big pharma is bad so that means I can peddle snake oil</span><br>You&#039;re ALL retards.", "time": 1675029097, "resto": 33959354}, {"no": 33960906, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:52:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33959354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33959354</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the secret about them that they don&#039;t want people to know?</span><br>That buttsex feels amazing when you&#039;re the bottom.", "filename": "Me and who", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1210, "h": 1194, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1675029130228169, "time": 1675029130, "md5": "exXIgK5YIkeTP3qZfWiimg==", "fsize": 638969, "resto": 33959354}, {"no": 33960944, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)16:59:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33959354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33959354</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the secret about them that they don&#039;t want people to know?</span><br>Gays want you to know everything about them including but not limited to the fact that they enjoy having their chest be chat on and rubbed around.

Air Force sergeant Jonathan Lovette was assisting Major William Cunningham on a mission to recover scattered debris from a recent rocket test. The two military personnel ventured into the desert to search for the debris. Major Cunningham was shocked when he suddenly heard a loud scream. Assuming Lovette had been bitten by a snake, Cunningham crossed the dune to aid Lovette where he witnessed an unfathomable sight.<br><br>Instead of finding Lovette tending to a snake bite, Cunningham watched as the soldier was being dragged by a long serpentine arm wrapped around his legs, connected to a silver disk hovering in the air 15 to 20 feet away. The major found himself unable to move during the encounter, in a state of paralysis, Cunningham was only able to watch in horror until Lovette was pulled inside the craft which then took off with astonishing speed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/co<wbr>mments/qqw2o9/the_disturbing_human_<wbr>mutilation_of_jonathan_p/</span><br><br>So... no fucking wonder some of the aliens abduct cows.", "filename": "Babe the big blue ox", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 468, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1674997659908010, "time": 1674997659, "md5": "x2SikFAa2bRADTe+B0uvWQ==", "fsize": 95050, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958021, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661715401198", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997718916627, "time": 1674997718, "md5": "+/gEalFfMbmUCJ/utXuzvA==", "fsize": 972796, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958022, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958010</a><br><a href=\"#p33958004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958004</a><br><a href=\"#p33958001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958001</a><br> Absolutely not, you mongloid cointelpro wannabe faggot fucking glow bitches.<br><br>https://www.theblackvault.com/casef<wbr>iles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-tre<wbr>pang-ssn-674-march-1971/", "filename": "glowerers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674997720784313, "time": 1674997720, "md5": "Lw+IqQaf11hXYkKWpri9pw==", "fsize": 48878, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958026, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673795875791611", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674997780642169, "time": 1674997780, "md5": "vhgu+iA0fsrWX4sXqlblhw==", "fsize": 868389, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958033, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1668161218895432", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1674997844067726, "time": 1674997844, "md5": "hnG5MXJG+uK2CzCyfpjwrw==", "fsize": 1468817, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958039, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:11:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661881458144", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997906502974, "time": 1674997906, "md5": "sq5Q7rkavj2v9PUMw2rHfw==", "fsize": 784756, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958046, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958033</a><br>unironically i spent about 4 hours a few weeks ago looking into this and its the real deal.

I learned meditation through the Goenka retreats where they teach a body scanning technique that allows you to tap deeper into your bodily feeling sense (kinesthetic sense) to the point that you start to see how this interacts with other layers that we would usually describe as psychological (i.e. thought) or feeling (i.e. emotional). I practiced very hard for a couple years a learned a bunch but ultimately it was not well suited for my psychology. The technique gave me to much to do. I think some people might benefit from a task oriented meditation like that but for my psychology it just provided too much opportunity to distract and obstruct myself through analysis.

In acknowledging this, I acknowledge that what may have been an important step or critical tool for my journey may be the opposite for you.<br>The heart of my practice is to destroy all that is false, and this starts with realizing you, and everyone around you, has a voice in their head that they listen to.

I&#039;m not trying to be clever, I am being honest that only your awareness is faster, smarter, and stronger than your mind. In all other ways, mind is faster, stronger, it knows your weak points, it can pre-empt any attempt to get ahead of it. But awareness precedes all thought. Thought is encompassed by awareness.<br>Since the mind is always trying to generate some illusion or falsehood, the practice of watching the mind is something you can do all day, every day. <br>&quot;Oh, there it goes again, telling that story about how worthless I am.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh wow, look at my mind go, making up stories about why I feel what I feel. It&#039;s really on the loose now!&quot;<br>Awareness is the weapon, so every time you see your mind making things up, you are aware that it is only making things up, not discerning truth. Every time you catch your mind, you take energy away from it, you kill it. &quot;See the thing, kill the thing, clean up the mess.&quot;<br>This is an endless process and there is never a time you must stop.

Nothing is satisfying and your day will be ruined, back to work on Monday. But he sits down comfortably on his bed and practices the awareness-watching-awareness method.

Up until the age of 14, I didn\u2019t think much of complexities of the Bible, faith or God, I just accepted and knew that God was The Father, Jesus Christ was The Son, and completing The Trinity was The Holy Spirit. I still accept and know this. However, as I said, at around 14, I started to explore more into the faith and esoteric factors of it. For some time, I accepted and believed notions such as Jesus and Osiris being one-in-the-same, the Demiurge being the \u201cGod\u201d of the Old Testament, etc. As time went on, my research veered into the occult. I started trying harder to link Pagan beliefs with Christianity. Not to evaporate religions, but to evaporate division, so the good could unite to overcome the evil. At the age of 18, I finally sat down and read the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelations. It simultaneously gave me better insight, and pushed me farther from a conclusion.<br><br>As years passed, I continued to delve deeper into the esoteric, occult, and religion as a whole. I began to fine-tune my beliefs. I still held the concept that some Pagan and Christian beings were one-in-the-same, though I came to view it as multiple beings filling an archetype; namely The Archangel Michael being the same as Zeus, Thor, and Indra, as a thunder-bearing leader or king that does battle with a serpent / dragon. However, I came to view other beings, such as Osiris and Horus, as extensions of Lucifer. My beliefs were much more in-depth than this, but it serves as a very light example for you. Another belief I had, which I believed greatly, was that The Blessed Virgin Mary was the Holy Spirit, and that The Trinity was a family (Father as God, Son as Jesus, Mother / Holy Spirit as Mary). I greatly loved Mary, I held Her in such high regard, that I only viewed God and Jesus as above Her.", "time": 1675070741, "resto": 33959435}, {"no": 33964614, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)04:26:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33964609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33964609</a><br>(2/2)<br>Of course, throughout my research, I had come across the idea that \u201cMary\u201d was really just Isis / Semiramis, and that the vast majority of depictions / beliefs around Her were really about them.

Then, on Sunday morning, I watched this video: https://youtu.be/iV9f1vdUN6U<br>Nothing in it was new to me, yet, for some reason, it completely broke me. All of my beliefs shattered like glass. Everything I knew and found comfort in, just completely subverted. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so demoralized. I don\u2019t know why this video had such an effect on me, I really don\u2019t know. I knew my beliefs weren\u2019t typical of a Christian, I accepted that.

None of the fantasical magical bullshit written in any of the religious texts for all religions happened. There were never ant magical humans walking around that did shit like turn water into wine or any of that nonsense. And the shroud is no more proof than the stories made up about it either.

As the hidden fire, and infernal abyss, is the nature of what the light of consciousness shines against, and the product seen by the light of consciousness upon the hidden fire is the astral world which is not the same thing as the hidden infernal and thus not the black sun which remains hidden even when viewing astrally).

So basically, you visualize yourself inside of a cube. You can use the walls around you for this. There are 8 corners around you. Breath light into your chest, and draw it out of your middle and index fingers while drawing a yellow/gold plus sign, then a red circle around the intersection. Do that into a corner of the room, then draw a white line to the next corner. Do this until all corners have the circled +, and are connected to each other by white lines so that they form a cube. Then, you want to breath white light into the center of the Earth until it glows as big and bright as you can make it, and breath it out, through your chest, into one of the walls, feeling the light harden as it forms a barrier. Complete the wall and then move to the next, and keep doing this until all six surfaces around you have been made into barriers. I believe this is the basic outline to the advanced version of sealing the aura. There&#039;s a word of power for this but I forget what it is. I may go and try to find it so that I can post it here. Also, in my experience, it can be difficult to get the barriers to stay solid throughout the entire process.

It has been known since antiquity as the astral plane, heaven, hell, and sheol. It was documented by the army in the gateway process as a holographic torus. Tesla knew about hyperspace and invented zero-point energy and scalar waves. The original maxwell equations were also hyperdimensional. Current literature on consciousness also describes a torus hyperfield. Telepathy is instantaneous and across space and time. Consciousness masters throughout time have used this field to manipulate reality. There are many accounts of levitation, astral projection, teleportation, non-locality, telepathy, and manifestation. UFOs and interdimensional beings have also been documented throughout history as objects in the sky and strange interactions. Names for beings include gods, demons, angels, faeries, djinn, and others. It is noted the consciousness field is a singularity and can be construed as god himself. In modern times, world war 2 is thought to have allowed the creation of anti-gravity and zero-point energy by the axis. Vimana may have been retrieved. Vimana have been documented historically by the hindu scriptures and include knowledge of pressurized mercury. Many extraterrestrial craft were spotted during world war 2 and identified as foo fighters, balls of light. Craft were downed by scalar wave weapons, including roswell. Alien bodies were recovered. Technology was reverse engineered. Such technology includes anti-gravity, kevlar fabric, and integrated circuits. Bob Lazar may have witnessed an alien craft and noted it was a single piece, indicating it was manifested upon manufacture using the transdimensional consciousness field. Victor from the alien interview documentary in 1997 provided footage of a supposed alien leaked from the department of navy intelligence.

A recent disclosure witness from boeing noted the humanlike aliens are known as &quot;the orange.&quot; Synthetic telepathy has been in development since world war 2 when the frey effect was discovered. It was later updated to include radar EEG pings to read brain waves remotely. It is all AI encoding and decoding now, and involves hyperdimensional scalar waves. The nsa spies on aliens in their homeworlds and no SCIF is secure. Dr. Robert Duncan is a cia whistleblower who worked on such systems and has revealed many details of the technology used on targeted individuals. A us navy special operations disclosure document was released in 2013 and 2014 that documents the overall operations of these systems. It also includes synthetic timelines, teleportation, manifestation cloning, total weather microcontrol, remote force fields, cosmic ascension, non-linear spacetime generation, and contact with guardian angel interdimensional beings.

The only time itt I&#039;ve warned people away from reading something is when talking about Perennialism and Western sources on Sufism and I didn&#039;t discourage people from reading that stuff because I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything to be learned from it, I discouraged people from reading it because it&#039;s going to mislead them about what Islam and Sufism are if they don&#039;t already have a grounding in mainstream Islam when they approach it. Reading works from people outside Islam can help us defend Islam better and do dawah more effectively and for people who have strong faith, intelligence and enough Islamic education, I think it&#039;s probably great to do.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;theism</span><br>There are a lot of philosophical reasons why theism is necessary and why it&#039;s a stronger position than deism. I&#039;m not an expert on them but you can look into Asharii or Maturidi aqeedah if you&#039;re curious. I&#039;ll just say that this mangles your point about Islam being small minded because it doesn&#039;t believe in anything outside itself. Most religious and metaphysical systems throughout human history have been theistic so you can&#039;t be engaging with them too deeply or giving them too much of a hearing if you&#039;re unwilling to consider that any sort of deity literally exists.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Abrahamic history</span><br>There&#039;s not that much history in Islam that&#039;s hard to have faith in, certainly not compared to the history in the Torah. And Islam recognizes that people guided by God frequently corrupted their books, invented lies about God and went astray from his teachings, as well as recognizing that God has names that haven&#039;t been revealed to us. So if YHWH was originally a Canaanite deity, so what? They probably had a prophet too at one time. Maybe El is one of the names of God. Islam can contextualize historicist deconstruction more easily than probably any other religion out there.", "time": 1675046570, "resto": 33953691}, {"no": 33962840, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)21:51:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33961900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33961900</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why does God care about physical cleanliness</span><br>Why does He care about spiritual cleanliness? Without saying there&#039;s a 1:1 connection or that I understand what the connection is, clearly there is one. Jinn like to dwell near filth, which is their food, and are associated with disease. The left side of the body is devalued in Islam and the left side represents evil in most cultures, also left handed people have higher rates of many kinds of deviancy and immorality. The metaphor of romantic desire is sometimes used to describe God&#039;s approach to the pious and vice versa. Nature and the animals have some consciousness and some awareness of God.

Saying the Bismillah before a speech or before sex with one&#039;s wife or before eating is important because these are all actions that glorify God and bring us closer to Him if done for His sake. So why shouldn&#039;t there also be a way to slaughter our food that glorifies us and brings us closer to Him?

At first whites look very dark, but as you get used to it, you can see the dress is white or it&#039;s blue depending on what you adjust to, and the other one always looks darker (once you set on a white, whatever is not white is darker, lightness/darkness is relative.)", "time": 1674811263, "resto": 33930658}, {"no": 33942293, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)04:30:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33942260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33942260</a><br>Yeah but you&#039;re the sane one for seeing it as something it isn&#039;t.

I was with my friends who introduced me to her. We were hanging in out in some kind of shanty. And then some some little bombs started rolling through the streets. I ran off with her and my friends ran off the other way. <br>She said that her mom and dad were &#039;lost&#039;. When we went to her home, which was like a swap meet tent, her mom was behind a curtain, covered in bruises and drunk, yelling for this girl. Just then, a bomb, which looked like a small propane tank rolled under the tarp and my friend Amy grabbed me and dragged me to some shanty tent and told me not to worry. But everything was on fire and explosions going everywhere.<br>I spent forever in my dream after this running around looking for my dream girl. I never found her or her shanty tent again either. My friends kept calling me me crazy too.<br>There was a lot that happened after this but was not part of the dream girl part.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard that this person exists somewhere irl. <br>It;s literally the same girl in every dream.", "time": 1675053123, "resto": 33963254}, {"no": 33963495, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)23:41:40", "name": "&gt;&gt;33963293 (You)", "com": "Don&#039;t know how this works, sorry.<br>Is that what it means?

Think about a video game, say GTA or the sims or something similar. Every now and then you play the game and control a character. Let&#039;s assume for argument sake that the character is &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;sentient&quot; in this game, and the game is like its own little existence. When you stop playing, let&#039;s assume the character continues to live, autonomously. No so much an NPC, but learned and absorbed enough from your personal control as a &quot;spirit&quot; enough to carry out everyday life as if it were indeed a sentient being with a consciousness and free will. I believe something similar happens with us, here. <br> There is evidence that our consciousness is non-local; meaning our brains &quot;receive&quot; it. Who&#039;s to say that consciousness or spirit has to be present ALL of the time? Perhaps, much like the game, it can come and go. Perhaps that consciousness plays many other games or as many other characters? This is what I think, or at least something similar, has to be the case for all of these sentient conscious beings walking around in this reality. Combine that with the theory of reincarnation, or a recycling of souls; whether they be trapped or not. It matters not what circumstances surround the source. There could be an infinite number or there could be a finite number. I don&#039;t think anyone could be able to answer that. All we can do is offer theories as to how so many individuals can be walking around with souls at a time.", "time": 1675050781, "resto": 33963142}, {"no": 33963292, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)23:02:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33963170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33963170</a><br>I read it.

Everything and every soul is just expression of greater whole. Call it God if you will. The greater whole seeks self-discovery and refinement. If all souls move beyond this sphere of existence, they will just exist in another, more subtle one. Maybe reincarnate just as somewhat more advanced beings.
