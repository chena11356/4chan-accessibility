Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here. As NDErs say, everybody on Earth is a star on the other side for having the courage and endurance to come to this nightmare planet.<br><br>https://youtu.be/mhANf60Y4Nk", "filename": "1615120187322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674303358820587, "time": 1674303358, "md5": "VSla6OBrWteYgUkZkobScA==", "fsize": 7568, "resto": 33893009}, {"no": 33895459, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:17:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33893009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33893009</a><br>Hang in there science is advancing at insane leaps and bounds.<br>Find your solace.<br>Get a little pup so you have a bus and something you feel responsible for.

However, man has believed himself beautiful in all ages. I suppose rather that man believes in his beauty only through self-love; but that he is not really beautiful and that he suspects it, for why does he look at the face of his fellow with so much contempt? I greet you, old ocean!<br><br>Old ocean, you are the symbol of identity: always equal to yourself.

Truth doesn&#039;t need defend and thus all the internet censorship is an admission that (((they))) want to keep people believeing in the lies.

The fact that truth doesn&#039;t need censorship will always remain and if they defend the censorship it exposes them as lies defenders. That&#039;s what they should be called: lies defenders.

Lucifer is the &quot;morning star&quot; and when God said &quot;let there be light&quot; that light &#039;may&#039; have been Lucifer. Lucy specifically betrayed God because God asked the Host of Heaven to kneel before his most prized creation: Man. Lucifer, miscontrueing his relationship with God, took GREAT offense to this and with 1/3rd the Angels of Heaven; flipped his shit and was expelled into Hell by Archangel Michael (who isn&#039;t more powerful than Lucifer, but that&#039;s another rant). <br>Lucifer resides in Hell plotting his various stupid schemes and plans to compromise God&#039;s work. Lucifer is fundamentally a tragic character because at any moment he could leave Hell and be forgiven by God, but his pride disallows this. <br><br>Satan and Lucifer are kind of similar characters who had very different responses to a situation. Satan is an Angel, who just like Lucifer; held an intense dislike and contempt for Humanity and actively sees them as an inferior, flawed, and stupid creation. Satan, however unlike Lucifer, trusts in God&#039;s judgement and wisdom and continues to obey God&#039;s will in Heaven. Satan works within the system as an acuser, critic, and tester of humanities character: sending challenges and difficulties to test them. Jesus isn&#039;t sending you your hardest battle: Satan is sending them to you because he hates your guts and thinks you&#039;ll fail. <br><br>Beelzebub (according to Biblical Lore) is one of the 1/3rd the Host of Heaven Fallen Angels that defected with Lucifer in the big split. Know to his worshippers as Baal, as far as Fallen Angels go, was quite powerful and was worshipped by the Caanites as a god.

This is truly amazing. <br><br>The last few days I spent on mycotoxins and I understand why the dose in the morning of NAC is doubled. Glutathione depletion is a common attack vector, especially with Ochratoxin, and NAC becomes a protective shield against our DNA damage. It reduces it so much at that dosage that the body goes into surplus and begins repairing things. NAC actually repairs the guanine then protects it, so that it can repair longterm damage.

If you&#039;re going to be talking about masculine and active signs then it makes no sense to ignore the traditional designation. If Sagittarius is the sign of the wanderer or adventurer, Gemini is the sign of the trickster or &quot;manipulator&quot; (in the objective rather than the social sense). It&#039;s not a coincidence that Gemini rules the arms. As the third sign in the zodiac, Gemini also invokes the symbolism of the number three, which symbolises the emergence of self-awareness and the manipulation and control over other things. A lot of the active and masculine archetypes you find in modern fiction, like the lovable rogue, for example, can be much more closely identified with Gemini than with Sagittarius. At its best, Gemini is an insightful and strategic sign, and at its worst it is a cunning and malicious one. It seems unfair to me to reduce it only to the ideas of superficiality and unreliability - it entirely depends on the situation and the manifestation (like which house and what planets are involved). In mutable-type situations I think you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a sign that does better than Gemini.", "time": 1674253183, "resto": 33888585}, {"no": 33891390, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)17:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are Scorpios one of (if not) the most volatile signs?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

See picrel.<br>(Context: I asked someone what he finds so hot about women who want to peg their partner. Someone else replied: &quot;strap on is hot because its something you have to get and wear. it shows how kinky a girl is that she goes out of her way to try and fuck her man in a way that doesnt directly stimulate her just to make him feel good.&quot; I replied that I understood his point, but commented that I can cum from mental stimulation alone anyway. Someone asked &quot;how do you cum from thinking alone?&quot;, so I tried my best to explain it in a way that doesn&#039;t rely on spiritual things that people would only know from experience.)<br>In practice, it&#039;s just a matter of linking minds to the point of sensing each other&#039;s astral form; then if we touch the other&#039;s astral form, we both feel it, and it feels better than physical touch. We also like to link chakras to feel each other&#039;s love, pleasure and arousal.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how come it improves physical sex as well?</span><br>It&#039;s like the physical and the astral stack together in terms of pleasure, so as long as I&#039;m into it mentally, it&#039;s really easy to cum even if I don&#039;t go too hard physically.<br>To put it another way, sensory hallucinations based on energy make up like 90% of my sexual pleasure nowadays (that alone makes it feel 10\u00d7 better than it used to), and since it feels so much better, I&#039;m way more into it which also makes it twice as good. Hence overall, sexual things feel 20\u00d7 better now.<br>Note that before learning about this, I was sexually dysfunctional due to multiple issues (it was very difficult for me to get aroused or have orgasms at all). I don&#039;t know if the difference would be as profound for others with less baggage as it was for me, but it honestly changed my life.

From what I understood, the husband was unable to enjoy sex due to circumcision as well as issues with his sacral chakra, causing him to be unable to perform well, which led to his wife being sexually frustrated; and she was also repressing polyamorous urges to begin with (as it isn&#039;t socially acceptable). They talked things out with each other, then both summoned a spirit lover for themselves, with the agreement that they wouldn&#039;t open or extend the relationship any further beyond that (so physically, they would still be monogamous). The husband was able to feel arousal and pleasure for the first time in years due to his succubus&#039; help and influence, which made him able to perform much better even when doing it with his wife. As for the wife, she seemed really happy to be getting so much attention and sex from *two* lovely men all of a sudden, when she was used to barely getting any from at all one. They both seemed very pleased with the arrangement. I noted that don&#039;t seem concerned about their afterlife, since they&#039;re only married &quot;until death do them part&quot; anyway. Others on those forums called the husband a cuck and the wife a whore, which confused me; isn&#039;t the arrangement clearly symmetrical? They didn&#039;t let that get to them, though.<br><br>Although they had a positive experience, do be warned that it could backfire, and in the first place, would only work out well if both people involved were open to it. My fianc\u00e9 and I are both the type to get jealous, so something like that wouldn&#039;t work for us; if hypothetically we were in such a situation we&#039;d lash out at the spirits, which could in turn invite more problems.<br><br>If you don&#039;t mind sharing your partner with someone, and that it might end up being a permanent thing, then go for it.

I think it&#039;s just difficult for some to imagine if they haven&#039;t had that sort of experience themselves.<br><br>3 years ago when I had a few sexual experiences with a kitsune spirit, it also happened out of nowhere. I&#039;d started doing chakra meditations like a month prior, and then I noticed a presence when walking in the mountains near a shrine in Japan, and then after briefly asking for my guardian spirit&#039;s approval, I did a 5 minute prayer to greet him and I felt a tingling sensation in my head. Then when I was in bed in the evening, I felt his presence again, and soon his touch as well. I felt overwhelmed and morally conflicted, but he was kind enough to stop when I asked him to.<br><br>Even with just that light touching that first time, I already felt more than I&#039;d ever felt physically before, and ended up cumming 5 times without even being penetrated (at the time I struggled to have even 1 orgasm normally). A week later I said I&#039;m mentally ready, and he fucked me and again I felt so many things I&#039;d never felt before. It felt a bit different from physical touch, but was more intense and pleasurable in comparison. The next time we did it (another week later), it was even more vivid.<br><br>At this point I began to feel emotionally torn between him and my human partner. The kitsune said we could continue as long as I don&#039;t fall in love with him, but I offered to break up with my partner, so that clearly wasn&#039;t working. He told me to value my partner more as I need the people around me for my mental stability, and we didn&#039;t have sex anymore after that. I ended up telling my partner what happened and he felt heartbroken over it, but agreed to let me teach him spiritually so that we can figure out how to do these things together instead.<br><br>Maybe it&#039;s just due to me being more experienced now, but what I&#039;m able to feel now with my fianc\u00e9 is way better even compared to what that kitsune made me feel.

Based on what much I managed to communicate with him despite my inexperience at the time, I understood him to be a messenger of O-Inari, which are said to be foxes (kitsune). However, he also seemed to be on good terms with the entity who acted as my guardian spirit, who in turn works with Lilith. So maybe there&#039;s some sort of connection there?

I can&#039;t explain it other than it just really brought me down in an incredibly unpleasant way. Purely negative. So much music is designed specifically to fuck with you on a spiritual level. Of course there&#039;s music in hell, and of course it&#039;s #1 pop hits.", "time": 1674267453, "resto": 33892581}, {"no": 33892744, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)21:21:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33892682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33892682</a><br>This.

When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard.

Basically everyone needs to find what gives them inner peace and a clean conscious before they die. I think that&#039;s ultimately the most important thing. The rest I think is a matter of your strongest desires. You need to be honest, figure out what these are, imagine what kind of world allows one to fulfill said desires and if that&#039;s really the kind of place you want to go.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end. Sometimes we just get too self conscious about it (which is what the mindfulness industry seems to profit off of).", "time": 1673854756, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33854306, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841531</a><br>Exactly.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

One important thing for me was realizing that much of what we want in meditation are the results. But you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; results, instead you do things which bring results.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

I try to stick to what I know or fundamentally believe. For instance reincarnation makes a lot of sense to me and makes me feel a lot better about things. What also makes me feel better about things is that there are quite a lot of good and worthwhile experiences to have on this planet. To tell you the truth as much as I am generally having a pretty bad time in life and yearn for much more, I am attached to this planet and the idea of sticking around for at least one more life here in order to experience what I want to experience here. Every reality is unique and flawed. This one is probably far from the worst one. There are probably infinite different realities we will have the pleasure/misfortune to experience.

A challenge was raised even against the life review as a form of control. If you can freely decide where you want to go without any considerations on the life you just had and everything you&#039;ve done, the good and the bad, the mechanisms of cosmic justice, order, karma, natural law falls apart. That line of reasoning by itself also leads to condoning &quot;the easy way out&quot; if you catch my drift. Seemingly that option would guarantee immediate solution to the current difficulties with the benefit of ceasing to generate loosh (that special type of food), but that idea wasn&#039;t entertained along with the others above. Perhaps an answer to that is that the nuclear option would cause suffering to others and that is why it would be discouraged and not even mentioned. Why should anyone bother to raise their vibration even?

Maybe leave out a big bowl of pot roast or pulled pork, something meaty and flavorful but not so overwhelming they take offense.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project.

The king of Moab asked Balaam to go and pronounce curses over Israel in return for money. Balaam was unable to fulfill that order because Yahweh had blessed Israel. Eventually he found a roundabout way to invoke God\u2019s anger against Israel by enticing Israel to sin. However, while on his assignment, Balaam rides his donkey when she\u2014the donkey\u2014sees the angel of the LORD standing in the way. Three times the donkey had to sidestep the angel and each time Balaam hit her because he could not see the angel. Then Yahweh \u201copened the mouth of the donkey\u201d (Num. 22:28) and she asked Balaam what she had done for him to hit her. Balaam answered that she made a mockery of him. Then he said that if he had a sword, he would kill her. The donkey responds that Balaam has ridden her all his life and asked if she had ever acted like that before. Balaam answered \u201cno\u201d (Num. 22:30). Then Yahweh opened Balaam\u2019s eyes and he was able to see the angel of the LORD with a sword in his hand. Balaam bowed down and fell on his face. The angel of the LORD asked why he struck the donkey three times and said that he came to stand in his way because his way was perverse \u201cbefore me\u201d (as the angel is a representation of Yahweh), (Num. 22:32). He proceeded to say that, \u201cIf she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her.\u201d (Num. 22:33).<br><br>Cont.", "time": 1674264150, "resto": 33878413}, {"no": 33892456, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)20:23:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33892334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33892334</a><br><a href=\"#p33892436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33892436</a><br><a href=\"#p33892450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33892450</a><br>Note here that the donkey could see the angel of the LORD without God opening her eyes, unlike Balaam.

Most of all, this illustrates the ignorance of the human, Balaam, rather than the donkey. He wanted to kill the donkey only to find out that she had saved his life. The angel of the LORD even specified that he would have killed Balaam, but not the donkey, had the donkey not avoided the angel (Num. 22:33).

The story of Balaam\u2019s donkey is one illustration in the Bible and Alexander the Great and his horse Bucephalus is another example from Biblical times. Cats in ancient Egypt were domesticated and highly revered and in India cows were, and still are, sacred. Horses are one of the most important animals in history and they play an important role in the Book of Revelation. They are featured in Revelation 6:1-8 carrying the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. In what is commonly understood as Jesus\u2019 second coming (chapter 19) he returns riding on a white horse and is followed by his army who also rides white horses while clad in white linen (v. 14) to signify purity. Horses carried warriors and in Revelation it serves as a contrast to when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. Contrary to popular belief that this was a sign of meekness and humility, it was the sign of kingship and riding in the name of peace. Horses, as well as donkeys, were not just a feature in the Bible like a piece of clothing. They are co-warriors in the coming Apocalypse, co-workers on farms, and in this way companions, living up to the original purpose God gave them during creation.

It\u2019s evident that it was only ever meant as an informational handbook or reference manual for the faithful, not as the main way for people to come to know God personally, let alone as a springboard for people to invent their own man-made Christs..", "filename": "DCA7A676-6EBA-4852-A7A3-1C54B0F816F9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 521, "h": 662, "tn_w": 98, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674282395258306, "time": 1674282395, "md5": "rcCwFs/B+UpYxqVGfqW+2w==", "fsize": 397193, "resto": 33879116}, {"no": 33894022, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)01:27:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33887154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33887154</a><br>Corinthians is Saul&#039;s letter to the Corinthians.", "time": 1674282447, "resto": 33879116}, {"no": 33894136, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)01:50:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33887220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33887220</a><br>your verse doesn&#039;t say what you say <br>jesus is talking about the lamb in your verse", "time": 1674283817, "resto": 33879116}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33893861, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)00:56:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What was the M cave?

The longer you wait, the less effective they are.<br>2) Aspirin. First 7 days, 160-240mg twice per day. After first 7 days, 80-160mg twice per day. Morning and night - keeping your blood thinner is important in the prevention of clotting causing stroke or severe loss of circulation. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH ACETAMINOPHEN OR IBUPROFEN.<br>3) Ivermectin. If you source from veterinary products (e.g. horse paste), you use the dose measurement it comes according to your weight as closely as possible. Put a small amount on your lips and wait for 1 hr to ensure you have no adverse reactions to the flavorings or preservatives in it. <br>Take 1 dose per day for 3 days. Repeat monthly for 3-6 months. You should also take 1 dose per day for 3-5 days should you get sick with COVID, vaxxed or not.<br>3) Vitamins C, D, K and Zinc. Really you can just take a daily vitamin but pay attention to the amounts because you&#039;ll want at least 120%. Note: If you are a woman and the vax hasn&#039;t rendered you infertile, you should NOT take vitamin C in high amounts while pregnant or trying to become pregnant.<br>4) Pumpkin seed oil. Promotes better circulation and heart health. Take daily and consider it part of your daily vit regimen.<br>5) Garlic, ginger and thyme. Concentrated tablets or oils daily. Helps prevent and treat respiratory illnesses (which you are now more susceptible to) and promotes better circulation.<br>6) Avoid long periods of sitting down and high-intensity exercise.

The most recent research is showing that exposure to sunlight and IR are surprisingly effective against COVID; this includes the spike proteins from the vaccine. This is not purely because of vitamin D, but it helps with that too. Try to be outside at least 1 hr per day - taking a daily walk would nail two birds with one stone by getting the low-intensity activity you need for better circulation.<br>9) Resveratrol.

Antibodies don&#039;t matter for shit because all the action for these two is in the cellular immune system. You can know in advance how bad someone will catch COVID based on their T cell counts. Big pharma approached the vax as if COVID was like most respiratory viruses, completely disregarding how it actually interacted in the body. So they opted flood everyone with their artificial approach to antibodies.<br>You have specialized T cells with specific roles. One of them attacks viruses by slicing them up into tiny pieces. Another specialized T cell will dispose of them. The specific way the vaccine&#039;s proteins were designed is disrupting the entire process; those disposing T cells aren&#039;t picking up the slices left behind, and their shape allows them to hook onto each other. Their shape is also very irritating (COVID protein is in general). <br>So basically, you have a recipe for insane clots that is also the equivalent to sandpaper flowing through your veins, and the vaccine just programmed your cells to produce insane amounts of it.

From his shrine he sprang forth again, swift as a thought, to speed again to the ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy, in the prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his hair: and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged words:<br><br> \u201cStrangers, who are you?

Are you for traffic, or do you wander at random over the sea as pirates do who put their own lives to hazard and bring mischief to men of foreign parts as they roam? Why rest you so and are afraid, and do not go ashore nor stow the gear of your black ship?

Now tell me truly that I may surely know it: what country is this, and what land, and what men live herein?

I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought here over the wide gulf of the sea, meaning you no hurt; nay, here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among men, and you shall know the plans of the deathless gods, and by their will you shall be honoured continually for all time. And now come, make haste and do as I say. First loose the sheets and lower the sail, and then draw the swift ship up upon the land. Take out your goods and the gear of the straight ship, and make an altar upon the beach of the sea: light fire upon it and make an offering of white meal. Next, stand side by side around the altar and pray: and in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me as Apollo Delphinius; also the altar itself shall be called Delphinius and overlooking[3] for ever.

Then, landing upon the beach of the sea, they hauled up the ship from the water to dry land and fixed long stays under it. Also they made an altar upon the beach of the sea, and when they had lit a fire, made an offering of white meal, and prayed standing around the altar as Apollo had bidden them. Then they took their meal by the swift, black ship, and poured an offering to the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus. And when they had put away craving for drink and food, they started out with the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, to lead them, holding a lyre in his hands, and playing sweetly as he stepped high and featly. So the Cretans followed him to Pytho, marching in time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers and of those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced song.
