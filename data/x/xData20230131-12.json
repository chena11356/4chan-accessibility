Without those 2 clearly defined genders, life would be impossible.<br><br>Androgyny should be kept to the realm of symbolism and allegory.

They could also seek out new experiences and gather evidence from the outside world that contradicts their solipsistic beliefs. Additionally, they could engage in philosophical discussions and learn from others who have different beliefs and perspectives. They could also learn from various sources of information and knowledge, such as science, history, and spirituality. The process of discovering objective reality can be difficult, but it requires a willingness to question one&#039;s beliefs and to consider new evidence and perspectives. With an open mind and a critical approach, The Nobody can begin to understand the nature of objective reality.<br><a href=\"#p33972436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33972436</a><br>Good point! Just because &quot;The Nobody&quot; is convinced that their subjective reality is the only true reality, doesn&#039;t mean that it actually is. It&#039;s entirely possible that their beliefs and experiences are just as flawed and inaccurate as anyone else&#039;s. In fact, the very idea of a solipsistic world where only one individual exists is a contradiction, because there would be no one to confirm or deny the existence of anything else. The concept of solipsism itself relies on the assumption that one&#039;s own thoughts and experiences are the only things that truly exist, which is a subjective belief that can&#039;t be objectively verified. So, it&#039;s important to remember that even &quot;The Nobody&quot; is fallible and their beliefs and experiences should be constantly questioned and evaluated in light of new evidence and perspectives.

To begin with, I wasn&#039;t even attracted to him.

The Statue of Kilkenny banned the use of Gaelic in the early 1300\u00b4s within the PALE, which is a small area around Dublin, since the rest of Ireland at this time was largely autonomous and was ruled by a collection of Hiberno-Norman lords nominally in service to the English crown (apart from the Pale) but in reality independent. The purpose of the Statutes was to curb the increasing Gaelicization of these former Anglo-Norman lords.The Statutes were ignored and failed outside of the Pale and by the time the Plantations happened in the 1600\u00b4s, the now Gaelic nobility ruled rather supreme, with Gaelic culture (and language) perhaps being the strongest at any point in its history. By now the Statutes as piece of legislation are forgotten about.<br><br>After that the Penal Laws banned the use of Gaelic within the legal system. It was forbidden to use Irish in courts and for legal matters. It certainly wasn\u00b4t promoted or encouraged in other aspects of Irish life but it wasn\u00b4t illegal to speak it. It was largely the Irish themselves who abandoned Irish. For economic reasons and also the social stigma that was attached to it from being/speaking Gaelic in the context of the British Empire. Not to mention that a huge number of native speakers died or emigrated during the Famine (it hit the West strongest, which is where the language was most dominant).

A fun question. One I do actually have a partial answer to.<br><br>Okay, so the whole lake of fire thing where you burn forever is just some nonsense that came about as a simple and metaphorical way to get the point across: it\u2019s bad.<br>There\u2019s no lake of fire and no million mansions with streets of gold. That\u2019s a Sunday school concept that\u2019s not at all an accurate representation of reality. What happens is that your body will die and your soul will move on. Where it goes doesn\u2019t depend on some \u2018naughty or nice\u2019 list that God has up in Heaven. It\u2019s dependent on the vibrational frequency of your soul. Either positive or negative.<br>You see, that\u2019s what we are all here to do. To choose our frequency, which we do every second of every day with our choices. It\u2019s vaguely like what people call karma, but not in the My Name Is Earl sense. The more bad you do, the more it weighs on your soul negatively.<br>So, you do enough bad, the frequency of your soul becomes negative. Then when you die, your soul moves to the next world. Either a positive one or a negative one. Positive ones house positive entities and negative ones house negative entities.<br>Now, there\u2019s a bunch more semantics and finer details about how it all works and various exceptions to the rules, but that is the gist of it.

Vitamin E from food sources is listed as &quot;d-alpha- tocopherol&quot; on food packaging and supplement labels. Synthetic (laboratory-made) vitamin E is listed as &quot;dl-alpha-tocopherol&quot;. Some food-sourced vitamin E supplements provide other forms that are vitamin E-related, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. They constitute the vitamin E complex. All of those must be present to utilize vitamin E efficiently to accomplish the many things that our bodies perform with it. Some people take large doses because they believe or hope that doing so will keep them healthy or lower their risk of certain diseases.<br><br>The myth is that we have to derive vitamin E from food or supplemental sources. The truth is that our bodies create vitamin E from completely raw natural fats through healthy natural bacterial processing during digestion. If digestion is healthy and uncontaminated, during digestion, our bodies&#039; intestinal bacteria not only fractionate food molecules but redesign them, including the production of vitamin E. Cooking, processing and chemically treating food destroys creative bacteria in our intestines, causing massive deficiencies such as vitamin E.

Most food manufacturers sell waste as animal feed that will grow inferior and diseased animals for meat, diary and eggs. All animals have grown and been vital on their natural raw diets, disease-free for millions of years. As Hippocrates stated, let food be your medicine and medicine be your food. Processed chemicallized fodder is not a natural diet to any creature.<br><br>In &quot;natural&quot; supplement-manufacturing what actually happens is, a well-meaning person representing a company approaches representatives at laboratories and asks for bids or estimates for cost of producing an &quot;all natural&quot; vitamin supplement.

The vulnerability of fortification contrasts with the durability of character.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Tower is the tumultuous power at the center of everything. It is the constant potential for an occasional experience of the unexpected, the violent and sudden disruption of normal conditions; the power of complete surprise and the feeling of head-over-heels.

The Tower is the end of complacency.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Chariot is the steady flow of ceaseless intention that is the warrior in everything. Its job is to harness all competing impulses and energies, to overcome all obstacles and resistances, and against all odds, carry everything to its destiny. On this journey, everything becomes what it must become and nothing is lacking.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unintegrated and imperfectly realized, The Tower can be capricious, frightening and disastrous. It can rob effort of its proper reward, and destroy faith in both justice and mercy.

I also read several accounts of a whole tibetan Legion defending the F\u00fchrerbunker till their last breath, even after the german chancellor commited suicide, giving the Soviets high losses and as revenge (or for what purpose whatever) being wiped out from history.

When you wake up in the middle of the night, avoid going back to bed right away. Instead, get up and do something like walking around your room or getting a glass of water. When you go back to bed, focus on the sensation of your body falling asleep and try to be aware of the process. As you start to fall asleep, you may begin to feel a vibration throughout your body. At this point, it&#039;s important to stay calm and not get too excited as this could cause you to wake up. Remember, the key is to be calm and concentrated. Lucid dreaming can be difficult to master, but the potential for creating vivid and lifelike dreamscapes is worth the effort.<br><br>The potential benefits of lucid dreaming are vast and varied. With the ability to control and manipulate dream scenarios, individuals can use this skill to enhance creativity, problem-solve, and even work through unresolved emotional issues. With proper training, the potential uses for lucid dreaming are limitless, and one can imagine the impact it could have on society if more people had the ability to harness this powerful tool.", "time": 1674881964, "resto": 33937037}, {"no": 33948582, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:11:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33941087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33941087</a><br>I got it in my teens, and every so often I get the start of it.

I realize these things intuitively (serving others and spreading positivity) and have learned how important they are over the years but I rarely implement them. (I&#039;m not certain why exactly, I think it&#039;s my health making things very difficult to do.) I view generosity though as the easiest and best way to go combat evil and negativity in this world, that and finding, understanding, and sharing the truth. <br><br>I&#039;ve put myself in extremely negative situations before intentionally and unintentionally and it feels like my suffering is what has always given me the most power and energy and ability to change and create and transform. From being put into a psych ward (multiple times, the first:) because of my mother lying to the government. Being in jail because of using benzos and blacking out, and while in jail having extreme pain for days and almost losing a part of my body and being unable to even sleep. Almost dying due to cutting my arm open, when I think about it still it hurts my soul. There were many odd circumstances around that event, such as someone trying to give me a ride that I didn&#039;t recgonize and knowing my name. There&#039;s a lot. Being homeless, etc.<br><br>In the same vein as this I&#039;ve been wondering if doing negative things to myself or going into the depths of depravity is worth it simply to experience these things, but even then I don&#039;t have the energy to even do that. <br><br>What do you mean be aware of my breathing? Is there a proper way to breathe you&#039;ve been taught? Or do you just mean be aware of the feeling itself? <br><br>I am serious about the psychic and spiritual path because I don&#039;t want to waste what I&#039;ve been given, it is unique and powerful, and I can use it to help others and improve their lives in many ways. It is the same reason why I want to cultivate my creativity, I want to give others what I have.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

Can I just point out that the entire concept of \u201cDivinely ordained war\u201d is so stupid.. why not \u201cdivinely ordained rock paper scissors\u201d? If, as Evola puts it, divine war is ordained and justified bc \u201cGod was called as a witness and would bestow his favor upon the victor\u201d then why not call God as a witness to a divinely ordained coin flip, and avoid the gruesome and pointless violence and bloodshed of war? The answer of course is because a rock paper scissors match or a coin flip would not appease the corrupted man\u2019s need for senseless violence to inflate their overgrown egos. and if it was a bloody battle that these brothers desired, could they not have fought it amongst themselves rather than sending thousands of men into battle to kill one another under the justification of settling the dispute for them?? absolutely ridicoulous that Evola fails to see the hypocrisy and senselessness of it all.<br><br>Although Evola does credit the terms of this specific battle as being more civil and humane than most, since they agreed to not loot and pillage, and also they agreed to care for wounded soldiers; the problem is that he begins with the faulty axiom that men must do war in the first place, so therefor it\u2019s best that they do war in the spirit of the Gods.

I\u2019d be more impressed with a philosopher that stated outright and clearly: \u201cIf men must do war simply for war&#039;s sake, then take no part in it, instead go your own way. Don\u2019t be a sheep. Don\u2019t follow the herd. Be your own person, and do not bend your will, your actions or your morals for the sake of any cause that misaligns with them.\u201d", "time": 1675158730, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33972584, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:53:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33972582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33972582</a><br>Evola goes on to say later in the chapter:<br><br>\u201cEven torture, which was conceived as a means to interrogate prisoners was originally related to the notion of divine judgement.

Tesla knew about hyperspace and invented zero-point energy and scalar waves. The original maxwell equations were also hyperdimensional. Current literature on consciousness also describes a torus hyperfield. Telepathy is instantaneous and across space and time. Consciousness masters throughout time have used this field to manipulate reality. There are many accounts of levitation, astral projection, teleportation, non-locality, telepathy, and manifestation. UFOs and interdimensional beings have also been documented throughout history as objects in the sky and strange interactions. Names for beings include gods, demons, angels, faeries, djinn, and others. It is noted the consciousness field is a singularity and can be construed as god himself. In modern times, world war 2 is thought to have allowed the creation of anti-gravity and zero-point energy by the axis. Vimana may have been retrieved. Vimana have been documented historically by the hindu scriptures and include knowledge of pressurized mercury. Many extraterrestrial craft were spotted during world war 2 and identified as foo fighters, balls of light. Craft were downed by scalar wave weapons, including roswell. Alien bodies were recovered. Technology was reverse engineered. Such technology includes anti-gravity, kevlar fabric, and integrated circuits. Bob Lazar may have witnessed an alien craft and noted it was a single piece, indicating it was manifested upon manufacture using the transdimensional consciousness field.

Dr. Robert Duncan is a cia whistleblower who worked on such systems and has revealed many details of the technology used on targeted individuals. A us navy special operations disclosure document was released in 2013 and 2014 that documents the overall operations of these systems. It also includes synthetic timelines, teleportation, manifestation cloning, total weather microcontrol, remote force fields, cosmic ascension, non-linear spacetime generation, and contact with guardian angel interdimensional beings.

Air Force sergeant Jonathan Lovette was assisting Major William Cunningham on a mission to recover scattered debris from a recent rocket test. The two military personnel ventured into the desert to search for the debris. Major Cunningham was shocked when he suddenly heard a loud scream. Assuming Lovette had been bitten by a snake, Cunningham crossed the dune to aid Lovette where he witnessed an unfathomable sight.<br><br>Instead of finding Lovette tending to a snake bite, Cunningham watched as the soldier was being dragged by a long serpentine arm wrapped around his legs, connected to a silver disk hovering in the air 15 to 20 feet away. The major found himself unable to move during the encounter, in a state of paralysis, Cunningham was only able to watch in horror until Lovette was pulled inside the craft which then took off with astonishing speed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/co<wbr>mments/qqw2o9/the_disturbing_human_<wbr>mutilation_of_jonathan_p/</span><br><br>So... no fucking wonder some of the aliens abduct cows.", "filename": "Babe the big blue ox", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 468, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1674997659908010, "time": 1674997659, "md5": "x2SikFAa2bRADTe+B0uvWQ==", "fsize": 95050, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958021, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661715401198", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997718916627, "time": 1674997718, "md5": "+/gEalFfMbmUCJ/utXuzvA==", "fsize": 972796, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958022, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958010</a><br><a href=\"#p33958004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958004</a><br><a href=\"#p33958001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958001</a><br> Absolutely not, you mongloid cointelpro wannabe faggot fucking glow bitches.<br><br>https://www.theblackvault.com/casef<wbr>iles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-tre<wbr>pang-ssn-674-march-1971/", "filename": "glowerers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674997720784313, "time": 1674997720, "md5": "Lw+IqQaf11hXYkKWpri9pw==", "fsize": 48878, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958026, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673795875791611", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674997780642169, "time": 1674997780, "md5": "vhgu+iA0fsrWX4sXqlblhw==", "fsize": 868389, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958033, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1668161218895432", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1674997844067726, "time": 1674997844, "md5": "hnG5MXJG+uK2CzCyfpjwrw==", "fsize": 1468817, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958039, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:11:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661881458144", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997906502974, "time": 1674997906, "md5": "sq5Q7rkavj2v9PUMw2rHfw==", "fsize": 784756, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958046, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958033</a><br>unironically i spent about 4 hours a few weeks ago looking into this and its the real deal.

And he opened the bottomless pit\u2026 And they had a kind over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.\u201d<br><br>also pic related, I recall https://www.theguardian.com/science<wbr>/video/2016/aug/18/mock-human-sacri<wbr>fice-at-cern-video<br>note the statue of Shiva.", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-26 at 10-42-37 Is CERN located where the ancient temple for Apollo used to be located", "ext": ".png", "w": 891, "h": 2813, "tn_w": 39, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674722809590321, "time": 1674722809, "md5": "EniMZQ9gm7uveeW3TA9vSQ==", "fsize": 1861435, "resto": 33926391}, {"no": 33933344, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:47:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33933338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33933338</a>", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-26 at 10-46-57 Mock human sacrifice at Cern \u2013 video", "ext": ".png", "w": 1185, "h": 753, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1674722871763091, "time": 1674722871, "md5": "HkBm/wRkuI4qtQ+IfBQCOA==", "fsize": 368083, "resto": 33926391}, {"no": 33933361, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:52:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33933344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33933344</a>", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-26 at 10-51-40 Photo Surfaces of W.H.O.

I&#039;m hyper analytical and critical by nature. I learned meditation through the Goenka retreats where they teach a body scanning technique that allows you to tap deeper into your bodily feeling sense (kinesthetic sense) to the point that you start to see how this interacts with other layers that we would usually describe as psychological (i.e. thought) or feeling (i.e. emotional). I practiced very hard for a couple years a learned a bunch but ultimately it was not well suited for my psychology. The technique gave me to much to do. I think some people might benefit from a task oriented meditation like that but for my psychology it just provided too much opportunity to distract and obstruct myself through analysis. I eventually settled into a more &quot;do nothing&quot; style practice and I feel that I&#039;ve advanced much farther and faster since then.

So you stop doing those. But here is where I think a lot of people get hung up. In my experience you can&#039;t really stop thoughts or have the mind become completely blank as some describe it (or maybe you can if you&#039;re way more advanced than I am), but you can realize that you are not your thoughts - the thoughts keep churning away, appearing, changing, running their course, in your mind, but you are separate from that. Just as you can passively watch the ocean waves without have to somehow STOP the waves which is impossible, you just passively allow the thoughts to do their thing and soon you&#039;ll come to a place of awareness that is separate and more fundamental than the layer on which thoughts are happening.<br><br>You continue going on like this - noticing what is the next subtlest layer of things you&#039;re doing, and stopping doing them, or at least stopping identifying with them / being involved in them.

Nothing is satisfying and your day will be ruined, back to work on Monday. But he sits down comfortably on his bed and practices the awareness-watching-awareness method.

The point to be taken is that it changes your mind from negative to positive, and you end up behaving different and your day goes totally different than had you not practiced.

You are sentimental and the capacity for you to suffer and feel pain is deeper than that of the average person. Your heart yearns for profound, meaningful relationships. You cannot just settle for someone who makes your benis wet. Romanticism is the core of your personality and to be deprived of love is a cause of great suffering. However, your emotionality acquires an extremely disruptive nature. Your mood waxes and wanes along with the phases of the Moon. You feel helpless when the detrimented Mars takes rein of your body and mind. You may not be quarrelsome but you can be very spiteful. When you were a child, you threw tantrums when your family couldn&#039;t provide you with the things you wanted and this never went away in adulthood. One of your adaptations for your delicate temperament is to resort to rationalizing the mind to keep things under control. Most likely you are an attractive person, and you like to foster friendships with others in order to contradict your latent selfishness. But what you are doing is merely hiding your undesirable emotions in a dark corner, resulting in involuntary emotional outbursts. You probably ended your last relationship with bad blood and burned a lot of bridges the past few years. With all of these being said, I still do not think that you are a complely unsalvageable person. People with fucked up emotions often have the most creative genius.

Of course this is not something that you can just say to yourself and quickly be done with it, because it is a long, painful process of self-discovery that requires the person to cultivate a greater sense of self-awareness. You will achieve transcendence from your suffering only if you can say to yourself that you are a very flawed person without the faintest hint of self-deprecation coming from your heart. I&#039;d like to recommend you Carl Jung. There are many excellent YT videos about his teachings, which have helped even me during the nadir of my own depression.<br><br>I noticed that your Mars sextiles Sun. This is a great indication that you can use your emotionality as a source of energy to make personal projects that let you express yourself. I&#039;m suse that you can be a very productive person when you are deeply inspired. I know that life&#039;s extremely rough right now especially during your Saturn return but don&#039;t give up on life just now. I think that isolation is not a bad thing. People like us who are borne out of feminine signs have this natural ability to spontaneously heal one&#039;s self of the suffering that comes with living in this amazing world. Isolation is good because it facilitates this process, bit I do not mean you to become a hermit for life. Socialization is important to one&#039;s mental health but so is isolation and self-discovery. I&#039;m hoping that you may see the light at the end of your tunnel soon, anon.

You&#039;re constantly searching for the meaning of your existence, each time you take on challenges in your life, you feel like you&#039;ve been reborn again and again, as though each challenge is constantly putting you through trial and error in the path of your search. You question the path, whether it was worth going through, whether all these challenges are worth what you&#039;re searching for in the end. The inner struggle within yourself that puts forth challenges in your path towards finding meaning and purpose. You are very interested in the mysteries of life. A very active mind, wanting to understand the unknowable. You very much enjoy learning about the various aspects of life and universe. A question you always have on your mind is &#039;why?&#039; Your mind is always racing and moving, trying to understand the underlying reasons of why certain things are the way they are.

You can be very sensitive to how others speak and their words. Sometimes you look for ways to rationalize your emotions which can be counterproductive to your own emotions. Sometimes your emotions gets spilled onto other people and other people can react negatively to this because you cannot hide your emotions well. They can be very obvious to others, and can affect others. Sometimes taking the time to be alone to ride out your own emotions will help you. You are often stuck in the past, constantly replaying the past in your mind. You can feel as though no one truly understand you, contributing to a deep sense of loneliness and depression.

You are highly aware of what people&#039;s perception of you may be and can sometimes be too self-conscious about this. However, you are also a very compassionate and empathetic person, wanting to help those who also feel cast out by society. You use your own wounds and experiences to empathize and understand others who may have gone though similar experiences as yourself in order to help heal them. You probably have a high sense of ethical principles. You find comfort in being around those close to you, feeling that sense of belonging with others is something you find lots of comfort in and you may be very selfish and needy at times. Learning to stand up for yourself, to be able to have self-confidence in yourself to stand on your own two feet is very important towards self-growth in your life.

All it means is that you need to treat your addiction or else live with your addiction.<br><br>By the way, there is a lot of evidence that pornography is bad for you physically, mentally, and emotionally. It can harm relationships (e.g. pornography doubles the chance of divorce). It can affect your satisfaction with life. It affects your goals. It affects your motivation and patience. And so much more. Like cigarettes, the research is there, but nobody is willing to talk about it. Why?<br><br>Some more facts:<br>In the United States, pornography generates more revenue than CBS, NBC, and ABC combined and more than all professional football, baseball, and basketball franchises.<br>1 in 5 mobile searches are used for pornography.<br>Pornography has been linked to erectile disfunction.<br>Pornography has been linked to depression and anxiety.<br>There is so much more than this, but you should just research it yourself if you are interested.", "time": 1675123343, "resto": 33967585}, {"no": 33969445, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)19:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33967585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33967585</a><br>Lust is just an emotion.

Hear me out, if you&#039;re anything like me no matter how hard we may deny it, wanting pussy is a powerful motivator that creates a positive feed back loop that is a better expenditure of your energy. You want pussy, so you seek women, seeking women makes you realize there are things you need to work on, like your hygiene physique, hair, financial status, and most importantly, your ability to actual have a sociable personalty like a chad instead of an overly introverted loser. All of these things are ultimately enhancements to your life brought about by a desire to wreck pussy that all have major carry over into every other area of your life. We as men are unfortunately designed to crave pussy but in its pursuit we become better. Just be careful to understand the difference between lust and love and for whom you&#039;ll be directing each at. Do not fall in love like a faggot for some random club bitch that&#039;s low quality, literally doesn&#039;t view you as human on a psychologically evolutionary level, and has a body count of literally 50+. Use these females as the objects they ultimately are designed to be and just create fun life experiences going out to clubs and bars trying to expel your lust in them.

Even indica strains are like a visually psychedelic stimulant. I used to be able to enjoy it in moderation -- only once or twice a month, only on weekends, only while &quot;doing something&quot; like camping/hiking, lifting, or cycling. But a number of personal stressors in 2021-22, totally unrelated to the weed, drove me into a depressive breakdown. My sanity became tenuous, and the only thing that &quot;helped&quot; me hold on until I got my life sorted out was copious amounts of marijuana. I put &quot;helped&quot; in quotes because I realize now that I was using the drug as a crutch, consuming an edible every day because it kept me in &quot;survival mode,&quot; it helped me swim through my imminent psychosis instead of drowning in it. I would consume it when sad to dull the sadness, consume it when happy to enhance the happiness, but that really meant I was just letting the weed consume all my natural emotions in one indistinguishable slurry of numbness. That awful year of my life broke something in my brain. I can&#039;t do weed anymore. Nowadays, I&#039;m no longer depressed, my life is stable again, but I can&#039;t have even a baby-dose of THC, or else my brain goes right back into a psychotic break. I get extreme paranoia, aggression, delusions, and audiovisual illusions for the duration of the high, then crippling depression for 1-5 days afterward. I spent a while wishing it could be &quot;fun&quot; like it used to, but at a certain point I simply acknowledged it was poison. To me, at least, to the structure of my brain in particular, it&#039;s poison. The other anon is right; you can&#039;t &quot;try&quot; to quit. Assess honestly whether or not weed is a net positive or net negative force in your life, and if it&#039;s a negative, acknowledge it as such. Stop making rationalizations and see it for what it is.

Lay Catholics have no education about Catholic theology and pay no attention to Catholic morality or what the pope says unless it bolsters their political preconceptions. 64% of US Catholics support abortion. 12 million Catholics worship a death goddess condemned by the Church, most of them in the heartland of Catholicism, a problem that didn&#039;t exist just 50 years ago.

In modern magic, there&#039;s often a deification of man that takes place where the human will is said to be able to shape metaphysical reality.

This &quot;topic&quot;, if you will, of the recurring synchronicities (during a specific timespan), points to something that was previously unconscious. The synchronicity in this way represents an archetype, which is at the moment prevalent in one&#039;s psyche. Archetypes mirror your state of consciousness, because they stand for certain emotions properties or goals. So this overarching theme of the synchronicites, points to the process of your individuation in this moment. So if your life were a movie, you&#039;d actually see the genre, which character you play and what the possible outcomes are at this point.

Once results were sufficient they erased the coover drug from circulation as much of it as possible. LSD and other positive substances were then purposefully replaced by alcohol and weed, coupled with mind destroying pharmaceuticals under the cover of psychiatry. The balanced interactive experience that gave us a highly creative number of artists and engineers were now substituted by mindless agitation of exciters (uppers) and prostation of suppressors (downers). Ecstasy, Speed and a cocktail of other uppers were added to the big star of the seventies onwards (cocaine) to drive an unbalanced restless daily workaholic and nocturnal maniac towards an overall depressive state.<br>Weed is useful to counter tension but without the heightening of LSD types of substances it merely reinvigorates the ant to return to work or deepens its prostation. Alcohol is the dullest drug as it merely confuses further and added by coke it powers a apparently diverse class of people into further enslavement (&quot;productivity&quot;) and nothing else. We have been the subjects of mass mind control. The TV screen in its many variants is the substitute to both the shroom and the spiritual guide and is mostly geared towards delivering a most harrowing bad trip while the sedated crowds misperceive all as being either mindless entertainment or (worse still) information.<br>Dave McGowan misapprehended what the whole thing was about.
