Because of the fog I couldn\u2019t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid 20s, and healthy. My ultra-attenuated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5\u20196\u201d.

I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement.

I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY.

But within this radius, several small holes were found seemingly &quot;punched&quot; in the ground and two bushes were absolutely flattened.[25] In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, June 1976, a &quot;trail of suction cup-like impressions&quot; was found leading from a mutilated three-year-old cow. The indentations were in a tripod form, 4inches (10cm) in diameter, 28inches (70cm) apart, and disappeared 500 feet (150 m) from the dead cow. Similar incidents were reported in the area in 1978.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Laboratory reports carried out on some mutilated animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals&#039; deaths or not</span>", "time": 1673117000, "resto": 33784257}, {"no": 33784286, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)13:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI,[19] an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, was found mutilated on March 24, 1978.

Animals might be a &quot;once per solar system&quot; kind of occurrence: only propagating on the most consistent climate-controlled kind of &quot;goldilocks&quot; planet in a given system. I don&#039;t agree with speculative biologists. At all. Alien animals will most likely be very similar to what we&#039;ve already witnessed with Earth animals. It&#039;s like how Dinosaurs all evolved from a different common ancestor to Mammals, but despite this Dinosaurs and Mammals still developed into very similar creatures because they still ultimately needed to do and survive the same conditions and some designs are just &quot;the meta&quot;. It is basically the whole concept of niches here on earth. Every animal fits into their environment. The only differences between us and other intelligent aliens would be bone structure and facial structure. Most likely, we would both still be bipedal.

Even if the victim wants it to happen deep down or has consented to it in some way, this does not make it ethical or okay. Sexual assault is a violation of someone\u2019s body and their right to autonomy over their own body and decisions. No one should ever be forced into any kind of sexual activity against their will, regardless of what they may have wanted deep down.</span><br><br>&quot;Is it wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it is not wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant. It is a personal decision that each survivor of sexual assault must make on their own terms and in their own time. Forgiveness can be an important part of the healing process, as it allows survivors to let go of anger and resentment towards the perpetrator while still acknowledging what happened. However, forgiveness does not mean forgetting or excusing what happened; rather, it means understanding why something occurred without letting those feelings consume you. Ultimately, no one should ever feel pressured into forgiving someone who has hurt them - only the individual themselves can decide if they are ready to move forward with forgiveness or not.</span><br><br>Thank you, AI.

The consequence however is that part of your folk you remember will not make it.

The first was when I was trying to sleep. I had been thinking of a technique I had read earlier about visualising an elevator that takes you down to your subconscious. It&#039;s nothing new, just a variation on a hypnotic induction, but I was trying it anyway. I wanted to be clear and vivid so I spent some time looking at where I was outside of the elevator, the ground, to my sides, where the elevator stood. I even tried to set myself right in terms of balance. As I was lying down I needed to change that perception to an equivalent of standing, and that was difficult. Anyway, at some point a man shouted my full name. I was awake when this happened, and the voice was audible, loud and clear. Though after he had shouted I did wonder, did I really hear my name? Suddenly the two words blurred together. Was it one word? Regardless, it was a noise that cut through every other thought I had. Naturally I was terrified.</span><br><br>Ghost Hands Hold Me Down and Try to Make Me Look Under the Bed<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second was a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night, terrified. I had been in bed and something was holding me down, trying to force my head to look at the floor, under my bed. I managed to get myself onto my forearms and raise myself up against its strong hands, but my arms felt so weak, it was as though my arms had been emptied out and filled with stuffing, or else the ghost that gripped me with his thousand ghost hands had the strength of the Earth itself. I woke, terrified. I did a search this morning, and saw there is an Arabic name for this. Kaboose, they call him; pressure. I have been visited twice now by this pressure of the night, this ghost that tumbles me in my sleep and holds me down. After waking I wondered, what was this all about? I was being forced to the floor. Perhaps I should have looked. I did praise my courage for struggling against it to get onto my forearms.</span><br><br>This dream triggered a pretty major emotional breakdown for me.", "time": 1672967303, "resto": 33768629}, {"no": 33770541, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:13:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33770492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33770492</a><br><br>Tell us about Kaboose.

But then it got out of hand. Involuntary things happened, I would see literal 1:1 replays of TV cartoons on the white walls of my room, they were actually &quot;bound&quot; to my room&#039;s walls, fixed in place, so I could basically turn to the darkened wall inside my bunk to make it stop, but I got somewhat bothered by not being in control of it, then I started to get older and picked up on ghost stories, which never interested me on my own, it was just a thing kids hyped in elementary back then, which is when shit got really bad. I watched some stupid cartoons with a beanshee, it wasn&#039;t even drawn well but it was kind of like &quot;the Nun&quot; (how contrived I know) in that somewhat recent horror movie, and then I read some about beanshees too.

These two are the only prosepieces among Bhagavan\u2019s Works. They clearly set forth the central teaching that the direct path to liberation is Self-enquiry. The particular mode in which the enquiry is to be made is lucidly set forth in Nan Yar. The mind consists of thoughts. The \u2018I\u2019 thought is the first to arise in the mind. When the enquiry \u2018 Who am I?\u2019 is persistently pursued, all other thoughts get destroyed, and finally the \u2018I\u2019 thought itself vanishes leaving the supreme non-dual Self alone. The false identification of the Self with the phenomena of non-self such as the body and mind thus ends, and there is illumination, Sakshatkara. The process of enquiry of course, is not an easy one. As one enquires \u2018Who am I?\u2019, other thoughts will arise; but as these arise, one should not yield to them by following them , on the contrary, one should ask \u2018To whom do they arise ?\u2019 In order to do this, one has to be extremely vigilant. Through constant enquiry one should make the mind stay in its source, without allowing it to wander away and get lost in the mazes of thought created by itself. All other disciplines such as breath-control and meditation on the forms of God should be regarded as auxiliary practices. They are useful in so far as they help the mind to become quiescent and one-pointed.</span>", "filename": "Sri_Ramana_Maharshi_-_Portrait_-_G._G_Welling_-_1948", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 676, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673054382201328, "time": 1673054382, "md5": "dJY0/8tbCAOdCLmz18cZ8g==", "fsize": 301323, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33778790, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772901</a><br>If someone convinced themselves reality is an illusion then isn&#039;t that perception an illusion?", "time": 1673054624, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33778808, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33758642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33758642</a><br>Semen retention (kekking at the people who claim to be spiritual but drain their brain power away)<br>Meditation with the scope of blood flowing through the prefrontal cortex, aka manual breathing combined with intense awareness, you can do one without the other and it won&#039;t be as effective<br>And spending hours in nature and long walks, it also unfroze my brain.<br>Bonuses: exercise, eating well, hyperventilation (also with the scope of getting more blood in the brain, flex your stomach and extend your diaphram and your chest, your energy will go up to your head), and lastly, tiring out your mind by doing something for a really long time, achieving that tired hypnagogic state.", "time": 1673054768, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779070, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33758661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33758661</a><br>what a retard", "time": 1673057134, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779094, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33778808</a><br>it ain&#039;t my fault i can&#039;t get these succubitches off my dick fast enough<br>you do it your way, i&#039;ll do it mine. damn.", "time": 1673057380, "resto": 33758642}, {"no": 33779195, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)21:21:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is what I tell folks who ask me how to get enlightened in a western magic sense of the word.

Anyway, let&#039;s start with that:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12th House Stellium in Leo: Frankly, this is a very, very difficult placement to read without just talking to you about your life for an hour. The 12th house is the house of enemies, sickness, loss, isolation and self-undoing. Classically, it was known as the house of &quot;bad spirit&quot;. Your sun and your ascendant ruler mark this house as an important area of your life. There are many possible interpretations to this placement, but one simpler observation we can get out of the way is that the 12th house is in aversion to the 1st house, meaning that most of the things you do in this house may remain hidden or obscured from your conscious awareness, and may require extra effort for you to shine a light upon them and understand them. One prominent man with strong 12th house placements is Friedrich Nietzsche, so it is possible that you may also live the role of a man engaged in a battle against society and have the feeling that there are many people who oppose you that you need to overcome. This can result in growth, trouble, or both. Mercury, your ascendant ruler, also rules the 10th house, meaning that you may be skilled at doing behind-the-scenes work and get your way on that basis. The 12th house can also suggest that you are at your best when you focus and work in total isolation, allowing your insights to manifest themselves unspoilt and undisturbed. There are also other alternative interpretations, like struggles with 9th or 2nd house topics. Alternatively, you may be especially gifted at helping people resolve problems related to the 12th house, so you could for example become a psychologist. As you can see, there are endless interpretations and someone of my skill level can&#039;t narrow them down much, especially without tons and tons of background information.</span>", "time": 1673089582, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781915, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:07:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781693</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your stellium is in Leo, and the sun rules Leo, meaning that Venus and Mercury can function properly here. Since Venus is very close to your sun, your Venus is also combust, minimising its mundane effects and including the principles of Venus (benevolence, unity, peacefulness, aesthetic sense) more strongly into your sun, your soul. These things come to you more naturally and you feel them to be an important part of yourself.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturn and Jupiter in 9th house Taurus: The 9th house governs the topics of long distance travel, spirituality and higher learning. This house is ruled by Venus, and Saturn and Jupiter have a superior square with Venus, the house ruler, which permits them to function appropriately within the house. Saturn is a malefic planet and it tends to frustrate and slow a person&#039;s ambitions - Saturn in the 9th house might introduce difficulties related to travel, living overseas, higher education, or philosophical and religious engagements. Jupiter, on the other hand, is a greater benefic planet and is especially strong in a day chart, and it will tend to expand, advance and improve your efforts in these fields, especially because Jupiter is fond of higher learning. Generally, this may mean that while progress in the 9th house may come slow, you will eventually attain your goals so long as you do not give up. As mentioned earlier, there is a square between the 9th and 12th houses, meaning that whatever the manifestation of your 12th house is, there will be tension between it and your 9th house; the 9th house will tend to prevail in these conflicts unless you intervene. Squares can be energetically intensive and can lead to a lot of growth, although they are also tense and difficult relationships.</span>", "time": 1673089642, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781916, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:08:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;3rd House placements: The third house governs the topics of everyday communication, short travels and journeys, and siblings. You have Mars in Scorpio here, and since Mars is in its domicile, it will treat you well, although some of the negative influences of Mars may lead to you getting in arguments with other people, perhaps your siblings; a career in polemics or stand-up comedy could perhaps benefit from this placement, anything that can allow you to express aggression in a constructive way would be helpful. Your Mars placement also has a relatively strong conjunction with your moon. The moon is in fall in Scorpio, but since it shares its place with the house ruler, it will benefit from the guidance of Mars and many of the negative traits of this placement will be neutralised; a moon in Scorpio can still result in getting in unwanted and pointless fights and arguments, so extra emotional caution is advised. There is also an opposition between your third house and ninth house placements, especially with Saturn. You will need to strike a balance between your emotions, aggression and vital energy on the one hand, and your pursuits of higher interests and travel on the other. Your 12th house placements also have a superior square with your 3rd house, meaning that they tend to overcome and dominate your activities in this sphere unless you explicitly decide to push against that. To give one possible example of what that could mean, it could be that you subconsciously end up promoting defiant and iconoclastic ideas in your communications even without specifically intending to do so.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Each of your other houses also has meaning, and you may find the 7th, 10th and 11th to be especially important, but exploring all these here would take too long.</span><br>Sorry for not being able to do your chart more justice - I found it to be a very hard chart to interpret.<br><a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You forgot to reply to him.</span><br>I didn&#039;t forget, these readings just take a very long time to do.", "time": 1673089712, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781917, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:09:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781693</a><br><a href=\"#p33781910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781910</a><br><a href=\"#p33781915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781915</a><br><a href=\"#p33781916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781916</a><br>Forgot to tag you for the last part.", "time": 1673089773, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781936, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:14:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "may any kind anons please read my chart?<br>i will read yours in return", "filename": "1673059255466444", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1239, "h": 1120, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1673090049698097, "time": 1673090049, "md5": "DfhCMr3lVBZQmOsLxU3WKA==", "fsize": 260862, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781953, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:18:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781916</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn&#039;t forget, these readings just take a very long time to do.</span><br>You&#039;re mistaken, I told him he forgot to reply to you.", "time": 1673090324, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781964, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781917</a><br>quite accurate and good reading. especially what you said about my 12th house placements is very accurate and interesting for me. thanks a lot", "time": 1673090497, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33781973, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:23:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781618</a><br><br>I&#039;m a Taurus Rising and do not relate to this placement at ALL.

This is an excellent placement and the principles of Venus - benevolence, unity, peacefulness and aesthetic sense - play an important role in your mind and personality, which you are conscious of. Your rising sign is Taurus, making you grounded, dependable and fond of comfort. Your Saturn is co-present in your first house, making its influence more easily and distinctly felt by you - Saturn will provide you with various challenges, generally relating to discipline, cautiousness, seriousness, difficulty, and sense of measure. There are many ways in which this could manifest in Taurus, including making you undisciplined or unserious, or giving you strong discipline and seriousness but with a lowered capacity to relax, or in the ideal case, sharpening the capacity of Taurus for steadfastness and dedication to an ideal, be it material (such as maximising comfort in some manner) or immaterial (striving after a cause or a goal).</span>", "time": 1673092012, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782065, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mars Retrograde in 7th House Scorpio: This is a day chart, so Mars is the most malefic planet in your chart. Mars retrograde makes it more difficult to capitalise on the positive qualities of Mars, such as its energising and dynamic aspects. Mars in the 7th house may make it difficult to get along with others, or it may mean an aggressive partner or a turbulent relationship. Alternatively, you could form a relationship with a physically active sportsperson. Mars has a strong opposition to Saturn - in this case, Saturn may be pulling you in an overly cautious direction, while Mars wants you to assert yourself; the opposite is also possible, with the stubbornness and inflexibility of Saturn holding Mars back or pushing Mars into starting needless conflicts. At any rate, balance is needed between the structure in your life and your assertive energy, especially when it comes to your dealings with others. Mars also has a weaker opposition to Venus, making it so that you have to choose to what extent you wish to sacrifice your personal peace and comfort in order to obtain social peace and comfort - balance will need to be struck.</span>", "time": 1673092073, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782067, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781992</a><br>can you go in depth please", "time": 1673092113, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782068, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)06:48:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mercury in 11th House Pisces: This is an unfortunate placement, because Mercury is in fall in Pisces and it has no connection with Jupiter, the house ruler. This may signify confusion and challenges in making sense of things. Pisces in the 11th house makes you a loyal and devoted friend who deeply cherishes his connections and wants to benefit them, but a poor Mercury placement here could signal some problems with communicating with your friends, or alternatively an inability to distinguish those worthy of your affections from those who are unworthy of them. Interestingly enough, Mercury has sextiles with the moon, Saturn and Venus, and a trine with Mars, meaning that it can both supply and receive some support from them.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(BTW I ran out of characters for later so I am squeezing this in here: as with the other charts, feel free to look up what the &quot;empty&quot; houses signify in the given signs.

I have no idea what it means for the Sun to be in exaltation in the 12th house. The 12th house is the house of enemies, sickness, loss, isolation and self-undoing. Classically, it was known as the house of &quot;bad spirit&quot;. The fact that your sun is present here marks this house as an important area of your life, just like how your ascendant ruler marks your first house as important. This placement could mean that you feel like an outsider and feel compelled to take on that role and oppose others, or that solitude is important to you. Perhaps overcoming a sense of loss is a goal that you have chosen to accomplish in this lifetime. Because the Sun is exalted in Aries, it will be well equipped to handle whatever challenges crop up in this house, and it will channel the active and creative energy of Aries to its advantage; Jupiter will not be able to operate with this level of efficiency because it has no connection to Mars, but as the greater benefic it will still bestow you with luck and fortune, and will help you recover from suffering and setbacks. The activities of the 12th house generally occur on a subconscious level, so they will remain hidden from you, unless you exercise attentive discernment and put in the extra effort to shed light on this area of your life. There is also a square with your moon, which I think I forgot to mention - in this square, the moon has the upper hand, so you will be able to rely on the support of the 9th house and its topics and your moon in order to overcome and secure the challenges of the 12th house; squares are very energy-intensive and while tension between the 9th and 12th house may be uncomfortable, it can lead to rapid growth.</span>", "time": 1673092198, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782111, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781765</a><br>PRETTY SURE I DIDN&#039;T SEND YOU YOUR FUCKING MOON PLACEMENT.

Since your moon is in the sign of Capricorn, this also gives you a stoic, restrained and serious emotional disposition - you like to look respectable, set real goals, and get real work done. This makes you happy, and you want to be productive with the things that you find fulfilling, such as perhaps being involved in your local religious community, studying philosophy or spirituality, studying at university or becoming well-travelled and experienced in worldly life. The moon enjoys a superior trine with Saturn, a very beneficial placement - Saturn rules Capricorn, so the moon receives great benefits from being in contact with the house ruler, and can therefore function appropriately. The moon also has a weaker superior trine with Venus, which provides the moon with good luck, peacefulness and grace.</span>", "time": 1673093156, "resto": 33781571}, {"no": 33782189, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)07:36:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33781811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33781811</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1st House Gemini placements: You have your ascendant, Venus and Mars in Gemini. You feel the effects and presence of this planet on a conscious level, and they play a prominent role in your life. Mars in Gemini provides you with a lot of energy and motivation to get things done, but only if you are interested in the topic you are involving yourself with. Mars in Gemini can also make you a fierce debater and rhetorician. Mars is a bit scattered in this placement, so you will need to find a way to make this work for you - either by building discipline or by shaking things up often enough to keep yourself engaged in whatever you are doing. Mars is overflowing with nervous energy in this placement, so it may be good to find something that gets you moving, especially your hands. Venus in Gemini makes you a fickle lover and aesthetician, with a preference for novelty, amusement, and whatever you find curious. Venus Geminis are flirty and are not especially serious about romance. I am not aware of any additional negative effects of Mars in this placement - I think they&#039;re pushed more towards a verbal level - but there may be more stuff I am unaware or uncertain about.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturn in 2nd House Cancer: Saturn offers challenges and trials. In the second house, the house of finances, it means you are in for a bumpy ride, especially because Saturn is in detriment in Cancer and you will be less likely to benefit from its positive qualities of discipline and measure. The good news is that Saturn shares a sextile with the Moon and Jupiter, the greater benefic.

Your emotional fulfilment depends in large part on this, but you should avoid being excessively perfectionist and harsh with yourself or others. Jupiter is in detriment in Virgo, and it is also retrograde, both of which make its effects weaker - nevertheless, Jupiter in the 4th house will bless your private life with luck and fortune. Your moon and Jupiter are closely conjunct, blending their effects and functions.

It also point to a direct, honest and perhaps even too honest communicator, who takes snap decisions and speaks straight and plain. The retrograde status of Mercury makes it slightly debilitated and hesitant in its function. Mercury shares a sextile with the first house, providing guidance to the planets there, since it rules the house. Mercury and Mars are also in mutual reception, with Mars similarly providing Mercury with support in Aries. Mercury also has a square with Saturn, in which it enjoys the upper hand - there tends to be a clash between Mercury&#039;s preference in dealing with friends, and Saturn&#039;s government of finances.

You are open, kind and generous. Be careful, however, not to overindulge or overdo things, because Jupiter rules abundance, not limitlessness - make sure to control yourself, your promises to others, and your self-indulgence.

Saturn also seems to be in retrograde, if I am interpreting the chart correctly, which means that it is slightly more negative than usual. There is a Saturn-Venus opposition, but I am not sure what such an opposition signifies when it involves the 8th house - perhaps that you will have to choose or strike a balance between managing your own money and managing the money of others.

There are many ways in which this could manifest in Taurus, including making you undisciplined or unserious, or giving you strong discipline and seriousness but with a lowered capacity to relax, or in the ideal case, sharpening the capacity of Taurus for steadfastness and dedication to an ideal, be it material (such as maximising comfort in some manner) or immaterial (striving after a cause or a goal). Unfortunately, the ascendant ruler is in aversion to Saturn, so Saturn cannot confer its full benefits.

You have a sixth house capricorn sun which makes you a serious work-oriented guy and a 6th house Mars which would normally be a hard placement but since your Mars is in Capricorn it is exalted so it just makes the qualities of your sun even stronger. Not sure how this works with the combustion, since both you Mars and Venus are combust - combustion stuff is hard to interpret. Your Saturn is in its domicile Aquarius and it&#039;s in the same house as your Venus and Mercury as well, so all three planets are operating well and Saturn is as beneficial as it can possibly be, the only way to make it better would be to put it in Libra or give it a Jupiter trine but if you put Saturn in Libra it wouldn&#039;t be able to help Mercury and Venus as much. Then there&#039;s your Gemini moon. <br>It&#039;s a very Saturn-heavy chart but it&#039;s good, you have a solid balance between earth and air elements, making you both intellectual and grounded. The Jupiter is the real outlier, but in the context of family life it probably adds more depth to your personality too since it gives you emotional intensity and protectiveness.<br><a href=\"#p33783004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33783004</a><br>Based, and I am glad you enjoyed it!

Your chart is for your whole life after all. <br>This topic can actually be rather messy since the idea of selfhood and of who we are is complex and difficult with or without astrology. With your Saturn placement, this selfhood would refer more so to a clear awareness of your defining principles. You are probably aware of your main traits. This does not mean that your principles have been completely developed or articulated, or that you have found a way to apply them to your life effectively - it just means that you have an intuitive and direct feeling and understanding of the way you go about life.

The moon is a fast moving planet and it&#039;s in a mutable sign, so you could change jobs somewhat frequently. You are usually well received by the public, even if you don&#039;t necessarily WANT to be in the limelight. Moon here could indicate shyness.

Sun here in a fixed sign conjuct saturn could indicate struggling with confidence or vitality, not really wanting to be seen by others.

Mercury rules your 10th house and 7th house, and it lies in the 5th. Do you work in a field related to entertainment, sports, betting, gambling, recreation, or something ivolving children?

Sometimes it can signify powerful enemies - some great men in history known for their relationship with their nemeses had significant 12th house placements. The 12th house is a bad house, but how bad it is exactly depends on the sign of your placements, which you do not know.<br>The same applies to Venus. Usually it is a helpful planet that grants luck and fortune, especially in a night chart like yours. However, you do not know what sign Venus is in, so we cannot determine whether Venus is going to be very helpful (for example, if it is in Taurus) or whether it is going to be almost completely useless (for example, if it is in Virgo). Depending on how your chart shifts because of time and degree placements you may also get different aspects to Venus that might help or hinder - for example a Mars square Venus in Virgo would probably suck.

Jupiter is your ascendant ruler, marking the 12th house of enemies, sickness, loss, isolation and self-undoing as an area of special interest. Jupiter is the greater benefic, so you&#039;ll be blessed with luck and ease in solving the problems that have to do with the 12th house. This is a good placement. In the sign of Scorpio, your Jupiter bears the qualities of determination, ambition and persistence. Your odds in facing your inner demons and external enemies are good, but be careful of the following: Scorpio and Jupiter is an extreme combination, and if you follow your principles and ethics you can be a paragon, but if you use your Jupiter energy to strengthen the power of Scorpio as a vicious and aggressive sign, the shadowy nature of the 12th house would have you operate more like a cunning and exploitative villain.

Since Libra is Venus&#039; domicile, all planets in this sign benefit from its guidance and can function appropriately. The sun, which is otherwise in fall in Libra, also receives mitigation here as a result - you may need to look out for your personal independence and come up with a set of principles and standards that allow you to continue to be yourself even among others in order to avoid being too easily influenced. This is extra important because your solar stellium involves combustion (read more on that here: https://astralvisions.wordpress.com<wbr>/2013/06/07/cazimi-under-the-sunbea<wbr>ms-combust-the-conjunctions-of-the-<wbr>sun/) As the link implies, the principles of Venus and Saturn are deeply felt as a part of you, and Mercury, the symbol of the mind and communication, is strictly subject to your soul. There&#039;s a lot going on in this house - you have your midheaven here as well, which means your achievements and connections here will be very important, especially when you combine that with the other factors. 11th house placements can be very powerful and signify a public role. Your Venus is in its domicile, and Saturn - an otherwise malefic planet - is exalted here, turning its influence into a positive force for common good, cooperation and discipline. Mercury will subordinate itself to your needs in this house, which is to say, diplomacy - you have a great ability to be diplomatic, to understand others and to get along with them. This can help you form many useful connections, friendships and alliances, and these may play a defining role in your life. 4 separate factors point to this.

Your emotional fulfilment may depend on these topics, and you feel a natural emotional affinity for them. You may be attached to religion or university life or foreign and heterodox things that push you into exploring the unknown. Your Leo moon is a bit showy, quite proud and occasionally unreasonable, but always aiming to be radiant - it can be a sign of considerable charisma. Your Leo moon has a sextile with your 11th house, assisting you in 11th house matters. It has a superior square with your 12th house Jupiter, which means that your emotions and higher pleasures may clash with your inner struggles in a negative or a positive way - perhaps philosophy pushes you to resolve your own contradictions, or perhaps your emotional prejudices confuse you and harden your heart to goodness.

Mars is opposite Jupiter, its house ruler, making it slightly more debilitated, but to my knowledge this still counts as a valid relationship with the house ruler.

They views the end times not as a definite point in history (Tribulation) but as the whole period in which the church waited for Christ. Therefore, the Book of Revelations was not prophecies about a series of events that would occur all at once, but a warning about the hardships that Christians would experience before Jesus returned. The only things God guarantees will occur before his return being the preaching of the gospel in every nation (Matthew 24:14, Mark 13:10) and the conversion of the Jews unto Christ (Romans 11:25-26). On the other hand, figures of Revelations (The Beast, the Anti-Christ) were embodied in different individuals throughout history (Hadrian, Diocletian, Attila, Frederick II). In this framework, Christs coming was something that could occur at literally any moment, as the extent to which these things had to come to pass could only be known by God. Therefore, Christians did not dread a coming apocalypse but hopefully anticipated the potential return of Christ at any moment. The modern interpretation of revelations, that we were approaching a coming end of the millennium in which the book of revelations was foretelling a series of events that would hearken Christs, arose in the nineteenth century and now proliferate in evangelical and traditional Catholic Circles. <br><br>If you are interested in the subject, I found some commentaries by Saint Victorinus, Bede, and Alcuin here: https://sites.google.com/site/aquin<wbr>asstudybible/home/revelation I haven&#039;t looked through them anymore than verifying they are legit.<br><br>Otherwise, Augustines &quot;City of God&quot; and a number of Medieval works of history cover the topic of the Final Judgement as well.", "time": 1673035253, "resto": 33767500}, {"no": 33776852, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:17:07", "name": "Mother-anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p33767500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767500</a><br>i do that hand sign all the time, it just feels comfortable to put your hands like that.", "time": 1673036227, "resto": 33767500, "trip": "!!9Lm2qr/d4NK"}, {"no": 33776888, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:23:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33767500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767500</a><br><br>Yeah.

Mid seven years, the Anti-Christ reveals himself when he breaks the peace deal with Israel. Lots of fighting and persecution of believers of God. Gods wrath is poured bit by bit. Until there is the Abomination of Desolation which might have to do with destroying or doing something wrong to the Ark of the Covenant. Jesus returns with a loud Trumpet. The First Resurrection.

But anyway, there was this show back in the mid 90s, with these 3 puppets, I think they were white and they each had different colored hair that was made from sparkly tassels or something. Anyway, there was a red one which I think was the leader, a blue one and a green one. For some reason I think they were a &quot;band&quot; or something.

Around 1994 to about 1997 at the old house I lived in as a young kid, I would have these nightmares every night of these three. I am 30 now and can still remember some of them vividly. These dreams always felt very real and I always dreaded going to bed every night because I knew they would come. <br>They always started off with me in bed waking up at some point in the middle of the night after my mom had gone to sleep. I had a night light on and always had my radio on with the oldies channel on, so old boomer music from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s would be playing. So, I would awake in my racecar bed, which was facing the bedroom door and the only light would be from my night light, so pretty dim. I could see the hallway, the white walls were always a sorta nighttime blue hue and then blackness at the end of the hallway where the bathroom was with the stairs to the main floor off to the left. I would always be awake for a few moments and then I would hear voices coming from down stairs, like whispering voices, like mischievous they were up to no good. They would be talking coming to get me. Then I would hear running up the stairs and the three &quot;puppets&quot; from the show would come running from around the corner of the stairs into the hallway into my room to get me. I would wake up every time.

They always had paper white skin and these paper white jump suits with stripes going across from their mid arms and chest. Their hair and stripes on their jump suits were were the same colors from the actual puppets on the show, so Red, Blue and Green.

They looked like the man hacks from Half Life 2. <br>There was so much fear and panic.<br>We started retreating inside this shitty looking building to hide. The windows were all boarded up and there were objects like mattresses and tables places against the walls and windows to make them thicker. <br>We understood somehow that the machines could see through walls and this was our crude effort to hide as deep inside the house as possible and avoid being seen. Walls bolstered by fucking mattresses and cardboard and whatever was there to sort of &quot;muffle&quot; their vision. <br>We put the women closest to center of the house and posted up with rifles behind over. I remember being aware of them coming by the windows and looking for us.<br>As the cloud of machines attacked, different parts of it split off and spread out down the alleyways and streets. It was like they all had one mind and each rotor thing was just a single digit of this gigantic organism.

These can really help see where your thoughts and mind are holding you back, and for those with a more analytic mind like myself, it serves as a productive way to reverse unwanted thought patterns and give way to new patterns which are self-directed and &quot;believable&quot; since you&#039;re striking down the old pattern and proving to yourself why the new pattern is equally, if not more, true.<br><br>An example of a distortion is &quot;Emotional Reasoning,&quot; which would be a statement such as &quot;I can&#039;t do this, that means I&#039;m a failure.&quot; In this statement, the person sees their failure to do one thing as a means to label themselves as a failure (see the I AM in there?).<br><br>There&#039;s an exercise to go through and list your thoughts, go through what you wrote, identify which distortions are there, and then have you explain why this thought is not the &quot;truth.&quot;", "time": 1673139549, "resto": 33782355}, {"no": 33786905, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)20:02:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33786599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33786599</a><br>Yeah, I\u2019m not on there much and this is a good reminder why<br><br><a href=\"#p33786766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33786766</a><br>I\u2019ll choose to believe this lol thanks man", "time": 1673139768, "resto": 33782355}, {"no": 33786912, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)20:03:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33785939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33785939</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SP as in a person you already know</span><br>Already failed right the get go.

I have no idea who owns it, where its present incarnations rests, nor who profits from its sales to this day. Certainly not I, nor any of my former colleagues who worked on the game for about three years. One could almost say that it \u201cdied\u201d under the same circumstances that gave it birth. One week it was #1 best selling game in the US, the following week Inscape folded and the game was buried. Conspiracy? I have no idea. I pulled the sequel Cult as I had no wish to return to the blood arena that is software publishing. No wish to return to that haunted city of Lost Angels. I feared that Cult had a dangerous side effect and the actions of Aum, The Solar Temple, and the Branch Davidians stayed my hand. I think it was a wise move. The world is too fucked up without me adding to it. I went back to writing children\u2019s books and being an artist. But your letter is moving. I read it to my wife Mandy and she was pleased that somebody out there remembered it and enjoyed it. Drowned God was such a mammoth venture and it remains for me under the category of misunderstood. It\u2019s beginnings were humble. A notebook that remained from 1983 when I penned the antique forgery The Diary of a Plagiarist and sold it (12 volumes) in the Cowgate, Edinburgh. A film of that episode was commissioned by Channel 4 but was once again thwarted. Ten years later I resurrected the basic premise for Drowned God. Time Warner bought the rights. The game was commissioned before the X-Files, suddenly what had seemed a left field minority interest was propelled into $3 million dollar flagship for Inscape. This was a pity, because it meant that much of what I had written was censored. Even the last realm of the game, Chokmah, is merely a 1/10 of what was made.", "time": 1672990939, "resto": 33768637}, {"no": 33772886, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:43:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772879</a><br>The military temples and underground bunkers were reserved for Cult. Where they are now I have no idea. I was locked out of my own game. Indeed, so much was cut that I fear the story made no sense. Perhaps there is a fitting justice to all of this. My partners in the construction of Drowned God were seduced by promises of great wealth. The English producer made secret deals with Time Warner for a bigger portion of the pot. Film deals, 5 book deals with Eranta, a record deal, etc. A paid for and promised engine to realise a personal route through the game, devised on the numerology of the Bequest Globe, failed to materialise. For the nine personality types there were nine pathways. Even the running order of the Realms was changed, with Binah starting the game, where the original game had begun with Chesed, the Mayan realm. My original storyteller in the game, the Relic Hunter (Richard Horne) was cut and only makes a brief appearance in Din. It was through this character that all loose ends were tied and explained. When the game came out it was critically hailed and panned at the same time.

I was poor and the income I generated as an artist was minimal. Finding blank papers in a drawer and soaking them in tea produced a pleasing antiquarian effect. My copperplate handwriting ( enclosed sample, only a copy I am afraid) and emulation of illustrations of that time provided decent subterfuge. I produced 11 chapters or manuscripts, thusly decorated. Each copy bound and sewn. Orange juice to culture a mould on the covers. Dust from the fireplace scattered on those mouldering covers. Greased endpapers mothballed and tinctured, even the smell was authentic. Let me explain that my real name is Richard Horne ( though for reasons I shall not enter into here I prefer to be recognised by my nom de plume) and for the purposes of disgusing the true authorship of these manuscripts I simply spelt that name backwards- hence Dracir Enroh, dated 1846.<br><br>The contents of the Diary were rambling and nonsensical. I was merely after the prize. Selling the diaries as they were produced very fortnight to a dealer called Armstrong. He was taken with the look of the books and offered me the sum of \u00a3 50 for each one( a pittance, but fortune for me) on the understanding that I bring him all 12 in due time. He believed as I had told him that the manuscripts belonged to my father and were kept in a drawer of his bureau, and that it was necessary for me, so as not to arouse suspicion, that I remove them one by one, with a period of weeks between each theft. Colluding with me in this way I was given ample time to concoct the latest version.", "time": 1672991243, "resto": 33768637}, {"no": 33772906, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:48:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772902</a><br>At first the Diaries were concerned with the Blavatskian ramblings of the Theosopshists. As you have so rightly noted, the ramblings of the Relic Hunter, much given to discourse upon Atlantean airships and manimals. After three volumes cyphered in this manner, replete with diagrams and maps of the citadel, pages filled with Sumerian cryptograms and number codes, German expressionist poetry copied from unread books on the subject, I began to exhaust my small library and turned instead to filling the pages with diagrams from a nuclear fission handbook from a power station, engineering blueprints for aeroplanes and other delights into the handbook of a modern Nostradamus. Joyfull as this was to the japester in me, it was my final undoing. I had been carefull to select a bookdealer who dealt in bric-a-brac, rather than an authentic expert in antiquarian books. The inclusion of these groundbreaking discoveries whetted the appetite of Armstrong. This unpublished manuscript made the work of HG Wells seem like the blind musing of a pulp writer. Here, afterall, were the rudimentary and accurate sketches for a fission, nearly a hundred years before the discovery by modern science. Here, the dates of the two great wars and the descriptions of the vessels that would carry those dread payloads. Turn a page and see the blueprints for the aeroplane, the tank, the motor car. And unlinke Nostradamus, the names of the players. Not Hister but Hitler. Armstrong the dealer went to his fortune.

The 23 Skidoo Principle. Schroedinger&#039;s Cat. Call it what you will. I should tell you that I was already a published author and illustrator in the employ of Canongate Publishers. Indeed I took some of the manuscripts there to be photocopied. I was working on drawings for &#039;Jekyll and Hyde&#039; (pub. Canongate 1985) and would mix up these and the secretive workings of my efforts to preserve something of my labours - for posterity. Armstrong took my seven manuscripts to an expert called Dr.Black (I kid you not) who in turn took them to Christie&#039;s, the internationally held experts in the field of antiques - and rare manuscripts etc.<br><br>Now here is the strange part. Unknown to me there really was a writer called Richard Horne who was working in 1846. His most famous book is called Orion, a verse poem recalling the slaughter of the Sons of God by Diana the Huntress in Merope. He was born in 1803 and his last book written in 1884 was called &#039;Sithron the Star Stricken&#039;, subtitled, a 12th century manuscript discovered under the ruin of Solomon&#039;s Temple, translated from the ancient Arabic manuscript by Salem Ben Uzair (really Richard Horne). Orion was published in 1846. The expert was convinced that this was one of his forgeries of japes. Thrilled, Armstrong took my manuscripts to the first publisher he could find... Canongate. I was discovered ofcourse and prosecution was threatened. A deal was struck in the musty backroom of the shop. I was to provide the rest of the manuscripts at a reduced cost. It served me right I suppose.

Focusing on the breath or a candle are the 2 basic exercises people recommend, it teaches you to &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;observe&quot; which are different from &quot;thinking&quot;, it may take months to snap out of the &quot;thinking&quot; mode for just a second but that sole second is enough to show you that your thinking mind is not you nor your reality, it&#039;s like a radio which plays all the time and you were living with that radio open for most of your life.<br><br><a href=\"#p33699233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33699233</a><br>For me the &quot;observer&quot; focus/mode is when you are not a slave to your thoughts and you are calmer thus you don&#039;t get dragged away by them, while the &quot;focus&quot; focus is the ability to focus on one thing with all your might, I say that those 2 go hand-in-hand and maybe someone could say that they are the same thing: the ability to take a step back from everything, be calm and direct your focus/observing whatever you want.<br><br>Also during my sits I remember how to feel my feelings.

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind? That&#039;s too narrow, try to FEEL, like literally feel your whole body breathing, the breath fills your lungs only but it also moves your belly and your pelvic floor with its movements, your shoulder blades and clavicle may also move during inhalation/exhalation, feel your whole body sitting there and breathing.<br><br> - Speaking of the body, try to keep your head retracted (search about this head posture), also imagine a thread which is attached in the middle of your head pulling it lightly up, this head position helps with sleepiness.<br><br> - Again: Don&#039;t make a story about it, it&#039;s just you breathing, yes you will just sit there and feel yourself breathing, your mind will think &quot;What? Only that? That&#039;s too simple/stupid/whatever&quot;, but believe me: first achieving calmness and silence is the most important thing.<br><br>- And last: Coffee is not the only thing which may hinder your meditation practice, everyday cannabis smoking or regular pills may hinder it too.", "filename": "cantona-kick-kick-567223161", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 438, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672691017977960, "time": 1672691017, "md5": "gihIXsBjxxSx54w6mJG6DA==", "fsize": 72063, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746889, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FEEL, like literally feel</span><br>he means think about feeling", "time": 1672691075, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746915, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746889</a><br>Excuse me?

The astral is also physical, just considerably less &quot;dense&quot;. It exists on different dimensions of the universe.

The book from the thread gives instructions on how to achieve orgasm without loosing semen. One of it&#039;s main excercises (called the Cool Draw) consists of drawing the energy from the dick (lol) to the tailbone and then through the spine to the back of the head, circulating it there and finally putting it into &#039;storage&#039; around the belly.<br>I was interested, did the excercise a couple of times and it felt good. But I also found out that it shares a simillar feature with one Kundalini excercise I randomly stumbled upon browsing /x/ \u2013 drawing energy to the base of the head. The book&#039;s author doesn&#039;t go in-depth on what one&#039;s really doing with himself or it&#039;s side effects. I thought that it&#039;s not wise for me to continue doing something that I know very little about.<br>But, during the excercises I&#039;ve done, I could feel the tail bone get very warm. At first I thought it&#039;s just the energy I generated using sexual stimulation, but even now I can think about that spot and it&#039;s just getting warm by itself.<br><br><a href=\"#p33766613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766613</a><br>Hey, thanks for bumping :)", "filename": "12714", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 423, "h": 951, "tn_w": 55, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672932993220946, "time": 1672932993, "md5": "ZpRLbRuGTt/43IuPi0GzRA==", "fsize": 96122, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768645, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamp", "filename": "12823", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 486, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672950438361858, "time": 1672950438, "md5": "hLs5d4OM6Vsma2pgGFvfiA==", "fsize": 164378, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768753, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:54:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33766490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766490</a><br><a href=\"#p33767199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767199</a><br>I always visualized it as currents/fields flowing in/around me.

A lot of people today awaken kundalini unintentionally, either spontaneously or as a result of a extreme emotional or trauma response. It can happen even without intentional intervention or preparation. You could also practice some kundalini awakening meditations without sufficient energetic awareness, which is why generally you&#039;ll see a warning on these techniques to make sure to wait a week or two before trying an awakening technique a second time. Now, releasing kundalini energy is kind of like peeling one petal of an infinite and immortal flower - when people without energetic awareness do this, they may not necessarily feel it, so they think &quot;oh huh, that didn&#039;t work, let&#039;s try again&quot;. So they do it ten more times, and then spend ten years in a psychiatric hospital because they&#039;re flooded their system with way more energy than it could reasonably handle, manage and use up, like flooding an electrical appliance with ten times the electricity it needs - it won&#039;t work &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot;, it&#039;ll just break down. Kundalini awakening is about purging, optimising and only gradually flowing stronger energy through your energy system. Kundalini will give you more than plenty for this purpose even without manually releasing petal after petal. Doing that would be like blowing up a dam and standing in the way of the rushing water.", "time": 1673061772, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33779692, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33777641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33777641</a><br><a href=\"#p33779600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779600</a><br>Some further advice I can give. First, I would recommend that you look through the Traditionalist school authors. They are very reliable people and if you understand their works you will have a frame of reference to distinguish sound knowledge on these subjects from bad info. Evola is also included, particularly his spiritual books, even though the wikipedia editors have excluded him for some reason. Not all of the stuff you see on kundalini will be the best, because there was nothing like the flow of information back then that we have now. The principles are perennial, however, and will help guide you.<br>Second, about energy. The terminology is kind of ambiguous and can have slightly different connotations, but generally, energy, chi and prana are loosely equivalent. For a breakdown on energy (specifically chi), you can check out Damo Mitchell&#039;s Intro to Daoist Nei Gong. He has a section on this that you may find useful. I think that&#039;s a book I can probably mention on /x/ with clear conscience. <br>As to the difference between energy-as-such and kundalini energy in particular, it comes down to this: the energetic level is a kind of subtler level of the physical (or the physical is a denser level of the energetic if you prefer). This energetic level is kind of superimposed on top of your body and you rely on it for a lot of your normal functioning. This applies to all people. Kundalini energy is a special energy - it is the transcendent force, and it has a purpose and a goal which, once awakened, it pursues without pause, even if you suddenly have second thoughts. This transcendent force aims to help you overcome your conditioned existence, purge your energy system (which involves a lot of emotional/trauma releasing since those are stored as energy, and it also involves kriyas), and finally, when the process is complete and it fully develops your 7th chakra, you receive a strong connection to the divine, and enlightenment.", "time": 1673062549, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33781143, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33779609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779609</a><br>I also warned out not opening kundalini before being ready ITT but kundalini yoga is popular and it&#039;s very much about trying to bring the energy up, practiced by everyone as if it&#039;s a synonym for yoga.

The problem is that just giving this advice to people is not all that helpful because a total newbie will not be able to distinguish the legitimate teacher from the huckster.

The dispute over a question most considered resolved centuries ago boiled over around 10:30 p.m. Monday at St. Lawrence Park in Brockville, Ont. Police saida 56-year-old Brockville man was at a campsite with his son and his son&#039;s girlfriend when thewoman began insisting that the Earth is flat. The older man insisted the Earth is round. It&#039;s not clear if anyone at the campfire put forth theargumentthat the Earth&#039;s equatorial bulge makes it notperfectly round, but instead a shape known as an oblate spheroid. Nevertheless, police said the man became so enragedhe began throwing objects into the campfire, including a propane cylinder.</span><br>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/otta<wbr>wa/flat-earth-debate-leads-to-fire-<wbr>police-call-1.3634692", "filename": "image0-54", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1361, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673126342504996, "time": 1673126342, "md5": "WpnwLBk2B68iRAYxolD9HA==", "fsize": 363811, "resto": 33776434}, {"no": 33785346, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)16:26:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33785299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33785299</a><br>My brain hurts.

reaffirmations of faith. small ones, little tokens that you do throughout your day. anything that you can habitually do to reconvene within yourself, even just a small amount. and that&#039;ll give you the fuel you need to break through. general advice outside of that would be to give them your time for things that would benefit/be enriching for both parties, as opportunities show up. you can try to work around things that they ask you so that its more &quot;positive&quot;, manipulate the situation to not just be for their benefit but to better themselves. guilt will kick in after a while. if you want i can try to pull for alternatives, but be warned that it likely isn&#039;t going to be anything that isn&#039;t drastic.<br><br><a href=\"#p33789495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33789495</a><br>hmmmmmm. send the question + significant number. <br><br><a href=\"#p33789536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33789536</a><br>i&#039;ll pull for you now :)", "filename": "1673164827043982536142217450143", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4656, "h": 2218, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 59, "tim": 1673165679347650, "time": 1673165679, "md5": "dApEkAVqOyvLtMDROMX4wg==", "fsize": 3298476, "resto": 33788528}, {"no": 33789555, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:17:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "AQ:<br><br>Can you tell me anything about a past life?", "time": 1673165834, "resto": 33788528}, {"no": 33789557, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33788768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33788768</a><br>Occult Q<br><br>Does H want me to go on the trip I have currently booked and if so should I go with my dad, my friend or by myself?", "time": 1673165898, "resto": 33788528}, {"no": 33789564, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:19:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33789550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33789550</a><br>Different anon <br>Will I be famous?<br>77", "time": 1673165967, "resto": 33788528}, {"no": 33789583, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:25:55", "name": "Abracadabra", "com": "<a href=\"#p33788768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33788768</a><br>Will any good come from the decision I made? <br><br>I&#039;ve always been attracted to the number 3.<br><br>Do you have a Q?", "time": 1673166355, "resto": 33788528, "trip": "!!1qjGJFQ4M2c"}, {"no": 33789586, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)03:26:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33789550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33789550</a><br>Always love your reads local cartomancer, hopefully you can answer my query.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Numbers: 8 &amp;

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs.

I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular.

I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

Anything similar happen to you all?<br><br>Also, anons do you mind if post about the other queens a bit here? I can also keep it to just Lilith &amp; maybe post in another thread or just make my own.

Here&#039;s something I wrote a year ago:<br><br>&quot;Sometimes, I like to imagine a world with only men. Arguments would be solved by wrestling, while stating the logical errors in each other&#039;s beliefs to try to make each other falter; only those with sound reason, or great discipline and true dedication to their convictions, could maintain the will to fight, which they would back up with their physical prowess. Superstition would succumb to the muscles of the wise, and any and all endeavours of humanity would be performed with utmost efficiency. Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them. The irony is that I really just have to stop being afraid of myself.<br>I hope that you can overcome yourself, and your fear of men too. There is so much to gain in embracing people&#039;s unique strengths. By working together, we can create a better world; and for that, people have to be different. We have to accept who we are as individuals, and allow others to be, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no parts of men that are an improvement on the female form</span><br>What are you talking about? Men are beautiful. I love their strong muscles, how mature they look with all that facial and body hair, how tall they are.

I find the idea repulsive. Not only do you suggest I equip fetish wear specifically designed for a penis, but you don&#039;t understand that my lack of penetrable genitalia bothered me far more.<br>Doesn&#039;t it send a more powerful message if I am free, yet still choose to do what I prefer? The implication I&#039;d need a cage, I find insulting; there was no such impulse in me. I don&#039;t want to hold anything back, yet it was my body that limited me from doing what I enjoy the most.<br><br>But the irony goes yet deeper: just because there is no such impulse, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s impossible for me to enjoy it if I&#039;m in the right mindset, let alone that I shouldn&#039;t be allowed to. About 10 months ago, I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to frot with me, as I was deeply curious what male homosexuality is like, and I worried I&#039;d regret not at least trying it once while I still could. Touching it used to trigger my trauma, and I&#039;d break down crying and be unable to continue; but as I&#039;d recently had a breakthrough in meditation and overcame much of that, I wanted to explore the new possibilities in a positive way. He asked me to be on top since he wouldn&#039;t know what to do, so I lubed us both up, got on top of him, and began to grind my body against his. Having no refractory period and not being used to physical genital stimulation, I came 9 times before I got too tired and sore to continue.<br><br>As we cuddled afterwards, he said it felt very intimate, but not very pleasurable for him, and that he much prefers to stick his dick in of me. I think that&#039;s understandable, but I&#039;m glad I gave it a try; now I know that no matter how good it might feel, it&#039;s still not what I prefer either.<br>Similarly, 3 months before my surgery, I began to jerk off every day, out of principle.

In his book Witchcraft: Its Power in the World Today, Seabrook reports strolling down Fifth Avenue with his magician friend one afternoon. As they crossed 42nd Street, in order to prove his powers by a demonstration of &#039;sympathetic magick&#039;, Crowley pointed out a businessman just ahead of them. Crowley fell into step with the man, a few feet behind him, and began to mimic the man&#039;s walk and movements exactly, becoming an &quot;astral ghost of the other&quot;. Then he deliberately buckled at the knees, dropped into a squat, bounced back and continued to walk. The businessman went flying &quot;as if his legs had been shot out under him&quot;, and he sprawled on the sidewalk until solicitous passers-by, including Crowley and Seabrook, helped him back to his feet. The unfortunate victim looked for a banana peel and checked his soles, but there was nothing to suggest why he had fallen. Puzzled, he thanked Seabrook and Crowley, and carried on. Seabrook tried to explain Aleister&#039;s powers in some rational way, but in the end concluded he might have really possessed a genuine power after all.</span>", "time": 1672939423, "resto": 33763716}, {"no": 33768073, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:40:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33764075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33764075</a><br>Why would anyone ever use Discord.", "time": 1672944030, "resto": 33763716}, {"no": 33768205, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Some other quotes<br><br>&quot;Intensive mind-control behavior programming began at once, and Houston ensured that I was taken to my appointed destinations under the guise of his travels in the country music industry.

The white spiritual systems include: Egyptian deities. Babylonian deities. Ancient (pre-Babylonian) deities. Druidic deities.These are headed up by the white, or Greek, Pantheon of twelve deities. Each system will have specific traumas attached to it. For instance, Bel, the head of the Babylonian system, will undergo a ritual where he is pierced through with tiny golden needles throughout his body (Babylonian sun ritual). Astarte will have sexual rituals, and Ashtoth will have death rituals associated with him. The black (Vatican) spiritual systems are also being organized and trained from 12 to 14 months after birth. Mengele always installed the Q\u2019Ballah in those he worked with, and he installed it into Jesuit systems as well. Althea, or the \u201cTree of Life\u201d is the basis, with the three cords (white, black, grey) roots entwined and going back to the systems described above.

These genetic enhancement methods are a continuation of the Nazi geneticists and mind control doctors in the Second World War. As many people know, the Nazi\u2019s were heavily into the occult, and Hitler was trying to create his \u201cUberman,\u201d which is German for superman. This is a genetically enhanced soldier with heightened senses, intelligence, strength, and paranormal abilities such as telepathy. The NSA is looking for people of certain bloodlines, and these people are mainly of Celtic/blue blood (aristocratic) genetics. Individuals with these genetics have a predisposition to paranormal/PSI ability, as these cultures have practiced psychic abilities for generations in ancient rituals that have their modern expression in freemasonry; therefore, it is in the genetic memory of people of these bloodlines, even if they have not practiced psychic ability themselves. There are generations of high-level masonry in my family. Individuals of Celtic blue blood lines have an RH-negative blood factor. This is a very rare blood type and makes up about 5% of the population. RH-negative means oxygen is processed in the blood differently to people with RH-positive blood. The amount of oxygen processed by the body makes all the difference in unusual abilities. This is evident in arts like Tai chi and Yoga.

To be blunt, God watches us every moment of our lives, and there are certain things we must do to please God. One of these things is masturbation. The reason God wants to watch us masturbate is a complicated discussion, but essentially boils down to us helping God fulfill his urges, and in turn, God redeems us and delivers us from evil.

I&#039;ll split this post up into 2 parts and each sigil will be the picrelateds for each one.<br><br>What you&#039;ll be doing is employing both of them to use their swords to cut away any ties between you and those whom drain energy from you in a negative manner.

Raphael will be doing the healing and repair work on your energetic bodies.<br><br>Here&#039;s a step-by-step method to call upon and inform them of how to perform the task.<br><br>1. Take a look at each sigil / symbol for a minute or two each. It&#039;s your choice whether you want to actively visualize it in your mind&#039;s eye; imagination or look at it long enough to let it sink into your subconscious. <br><br>2. When finished looking at the sigils, begin to perform breathing exercises. Breathe in deeply, holding it for however many seconds is right for you, and then breathe out.

Give yourself a moment if needed, and then ask your request to both Archangels. State your intentions in a humble and gracious manner. Let it be naturally flowing and talk to them as you would another person. There&#039;s no particular script to follow. Just say what feels right, and let them know you appreciate them hearing you out along with being present. Coming from a genuine place in asking for assistance is what matters when coming into contact with them.<br><br>Plus, state that you appreciate that they will accomplish this task effectively. Being certain in what you want to occur for a task is important for these sorts of magickal operations.<br><br>5. Grant them permission to contact you by any means necessary or is convenient, such as (but not limited to): Divination, Angel Numbers, Omens, Dreams, Synchronicities, etc.<br><br>6. Once done saying what you feel needs to be said, say that they are free to leave or give them permission to stay. It&#039;s up for you to decide. You can also say for them come and go as they please, which is what I tend to do. <br><br>Be sure to say that their permission to do so comes under the condition that they do not do harm to you, anyone you care about or are connected to and anyone in your physical vicinity.

They are able to bend space and time, causing events and memories to shift and change. This is the cause of the Mandela effect, where people have memories of events that never actually occurred. It is thought that the Zorxians use this ability to manipulate and control humanity, causing people to question their own memories and reality. It is important to be aware of the influence of the Zorxians and to try to resist their manipulation. The Zorxians have the ability to manipulate the hippocampus in the brain, which is responsible for forming and storing memories. They can alter these memories, making them seem more real than they actually are. This can cause people to remember events differently than they actually occurred, leading to the phenomenon known as the Mandela effect. So, it&#039;s all about the superposition of quantum states and the collapse of the wave function. When the Zorxians manipulate reality, they&#039;re essentially changing the probability of certain events occurring. They&#039;re able to do this through their manipulation of subatomic particles, and by interacting with the Calabi-Yau manifold, which is essentially the structure of the universe at a very small scale. This manipulation of probability can then affect our perception of reality. You see, the microtubules within our brain cells are the fundamental structure responsible for the quantum state of consciousness.

One evening, I went to the homeless services office, Gateway Center, to use their shower. There was some new security guard there: the only white one I saw there in almost two years of using their shower. He would not let me in to shower and he made up some bullshit about how I had been banned for something that never happened. I argued with him and he would not let me shower. When I turned to walk away eventually to go sleep unwashed in the alley behind the library, he called my attention and I turned back around. He pointed to the metal badge on his Raiders hat and sniggered maliciously as if to intimate to me that he was abusing his police powers to deny me access to the shower. A few minutes later, &quot;Paddock&quot; opened up on the crowd in Las Vegas where he killed a lot of the drone pilots that were piloting the clone slaves that populate Area 51 via Stargate-type mind control implants to enact constant torment and psychological torture operations, gangstalking, etc. It got memory-holed so quickly because so many of the people that got killed were involved in the *ULTRA-CLASSIFIED* clone slave drone program. They could not afford to have even the slightest scrutiny into whether the certain part of the crown might have been targeted for some reason, which they were.<br><br>When the drone pilots continue to use the clone slaves around me to constantly torment, sometimes I like to remind them that the Las Vegas shooting proves they are not as anonymous as they think they are.

Literally millions fought and millions lived and died in the great struggles for which Miguel Serrano served as the grey eminence and directing hand from one end of our planet to the other. We can safely say that the over-all destinies of the previous two generations of humanity were largely in his masterful hands, at least for those with some awareness of the role that has been played in those great struggles by many secret services and special forces of which he was the true Grand Master. &gt;&quot;The Hero transports himself to a point where he can no longer continue by his own means. He does not know how or where to go. He is in an alley without exit, against a wall, and that is when an arm extends to him, a hand, and he shakes it.&quot;", "filename": "miguelserrano", "ext": ".png", "w": 156, "h": 210, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673054217262468, "time": 1673054217, "md5": "khG8+T6tepcRydLtpXBMaQ==", "fsize": 54878, "resto": 33770667}, {"no": 33778765, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:19:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33771163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33771163</a><br>God didn&#039;t create religion.
