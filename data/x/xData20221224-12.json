Also if I&#039;m about to fall asleep my body jolts me back awake by slightly moving my arm or leg.

Not your parents, not your friends, not your classmates, not your co-workers, not society.<br> <br>It takes some work to really get clear about it but I urge you to spend a couple of weeks if not months really thinking about it and writing it all down. For some reason writing it down just changes everything and speeds up the process. It&#039;s like a top down approach where you live from the end and then suddenly the HOW begins to reveal itself to you and then you can cross those bridges of incidence and next thing you know you&#039;ll have accomplished all of those great things and became someone awesome no matter how big the desire, goal or vision is.<br> <br>Most people are incredibly pennywise but abhorrently pound foolish when it comes this type of thing and most down even have a grand vision for their lives which is possibly the greatest sin one can commit just squandering their creative power and potential.

And he already was getting kinda old.<br>He was a celebrity, at least very much in the city (nationally slightly less), but it was not like you would see him on tv every day or anything. Then this one time he was silent for quite a while. Rumors were slowly but surely going around. And what do you know, in 2008 there was a local news report that Jules Deelder died. Of course people believed it, it&#039;s not weird to think that a man with that lifestyle would suddenly pass away. Until he crawled out of whatever drug binge he was in from, and learned of his death trough that local news outlet. He then went to that news station and let everyone know, in person, that he was somewhat hungover and high, but still very much alive.<br>Jules Deelder is now dead for real btw, he died in 2019 at the age of 75 after a short sickbed (he was still a user), in the precense of his family.<br>But yeah that&#039;s our own mini Mandela episode right there, thought it&#039;s a fitting little anecdote here.", "filename": "images0.persgroep", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 694, "h": 463, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671829719289965, "time": 1671829719, "md5": "VnIcjfudBiLPfKHWBnhxEQ==", "fsize": 31097, "resto": 33672747}, {"no": 33673901, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)16:11:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33673850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33673850</a><br>This.

These things supposedly keep the working man proud and content and not aware that he is being exploited by the bourgeois classes. <br><br>Marx predicted that successful communist revolutions would first occur in highly developed capitalist industrial countries like England, Germany, or America. He was totally wrong and in fact communist revolutions invoking Marx occurred in backwards semi feudal rural agrarian shithole societies like early 20th century Russia and China. <br><br>In the 30s and 40s, a bunch of predominantly secular Jewish intellectual Marxists called the Frankfurt school pondered why communism had not taken root in Western Europe and America. They thought that the culture that ties workers to their nation, their family, and their Christian religion was too strong and created false consciousness meaning the workers could not see their common class interest. <br><br>The Frankfurt school developed a set of ideas called Critical Theory and set to undermine western Christianity and nationalism, to make Marxist revolutions possible. They wanted a Long March Through the Institutions in universities to shift western culture away from Christianity and conservative values. <br><br>During WW2 they escaped the Nazis and came to places across the west, particularly Californian universities. Their ideas sprung the post war generation of hippies. <br>The rest is history. <br><br>These whole things (secularism, modern feminism, modern art and architecture, anti nationalism) leads back to one thing and forwards to one thing.

His spirit spreads out (through Astral projection) and heals people (the lingua frenulum) which actually secures their death. I know that he destroyed the lives of the people who wrote it cause he got tired of everyone&#039;s bullshit (the exact same people btw) over all his incarnations. Basically Jesus got betrayed so much that he learned how to pull the reverse card on everyone&#039;s reality as many times as he wanted. They wrote the gospels to teach people morals but what they didn&#039;t know yet was they were writing about him through Astral projection and he wouldn&#039;t be alive for about 2000 more years. He is literally alive today, and he can literally die and come back to life as many times as he wants. The problem is that he came to fuck shit up for the people that kept betraying him, so his real story is kinda fucked up and not at all Sunday school friendly and so it&#039;ll be the greatest story never told.

Grace is not just for justification it is also empowerment.<br><br>Angels and humans are different. Humans will be like Jesus in many ways, but they are differentiated and &quot;speced&quot; by the person. Jesus is the way yes, but being like him doesn&#039;t mean being carbon copies. It means being who you are in the spirit of God. The secret is the more you focus on self, the less you have. Because he built us for relationship with him and others. The more you love, the more love you recieve, however the more you focus on narcissistic l ove, the less you can give or recieve love. The more you cling and try to strive, the less you achieve. The more you ask, and follow through with instructions by grace through faith, the more you accomplish to glorify God. The more you glorify yourself, the more you are brought low. The lower you are, the higher you will go.

It is like a brain that self references cross matching multiple concepts. The narrative is consistent. It is just confusing if you read it with unspiritual eyes. Is God merciful or Just?

You have to, judging by the placements for the event under consideration, isolate the particular matters you are concerned about from both the chart and the real life situation, and then apprehend the particular manifestation of that matter in this instance and identify the features unique to it. You must both draw a commonality between this instance and other instances of the exact same placement, as well as rationally distinguish this kind of situation from other placements concerning the same sort of matter.<br><br>In the distant past long before astrology was &quot;settled&quot;, the planets presumably had no names, or at the very least not descriptive ones that denoted any symbolism to use. They looked up at the cosmos and charted what they saw without any inkling of what it meant. At some point, some people noticed that certain things happened when certain cosmological objects were in particular spots in space. They investigated the link between human psychology and cosmological placements and eventually were able to associate aspects of human behavior with influences astrological bodies were apparently exerting.<br><br>They deduced that the body known as Mercury seemed to be affecting the particular ways people rationally think and communicate; and looking at the zodiac signs, the influence seemed to come out most emblematically in Gemini, who are known for thinking and speaking miles ahead of everyone else, and who seem to find their life&#039;s fulfillment in these activities.<br><br>The system established early on that every astrological body around Earth must have an influence upon the beings upon it.

The US had previously done several tests involving nuclear weapons detonated about 50 miles above the Earth, but these tests had been performed hastily. They had demonstrated a lot of curious effects\u2014for instance, people at a corresponding spot on the opposite side of the equator would instantly see huge, vivid auroras\u2014but they hadn\u2019t done a good job of capturing the effects with instruments and they hadn\u2019t experimented with different altitudes. Some of the shots had also used very small nuclear weapons. And perhaps most importantly, they had noticed that the electromagnetic pulses that interfered with radios were different in these high-altitude detonations, but they needed more data to understand them.<br><br>So the military decided to perform a series of more carefully-designed, better-instrumented experiments with larger weapons at different altitudes. Well, relatively more carefully designed. They basically strapped some warheads to modified ICBMs and programmed them to fly into space and explode. Because the Pacific islands they had previously used for testing were all full of natives who, for some strange reason, didn\u2019t really want any more nuclear testing done on their islands, they chose Johnston Island, a remote island 900 miles from Hawaii.<br><br>The original Fishbowl plan was to perform three tests:<br><br>Bluegill, about 25 miles up<br>Starfish, about 250 miles up<br>Urraca, at a much higher altitude than Starfish (probably around 3\u2013400 miles, but it&#039;s still classified)<br>The planners anticipated that some of the test attempts would fail, so they decided that the first shot would have the codename, the second would have the codename followed by \u201cPrime\u201d, the third would use \u201cDouble Prime\u201d, and so on.", "time": 1671869545, "resto": 33676794}, {"no": 33677521, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:21:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33676794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33676794</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pulls up santatracker.com </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell US government he wears a red suit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he must be communist</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they shoot him down</span>", "time": 1671870060, "resto": 33676794}, {"no": 33677872, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:10:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33676794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33676794</a><br>Please allow me to introduce myself<br>I&#039;m a man of girth and joy<br>I&#039;ve been around for a long, long years<br>Stole loosh from millions of girls and boys.<br><br>And I was &#039;round when Georgie Floyd <br>Had his moment of doubt and pain<br>Made damn sure that dirty cop<br>Knelt until his breathing stopped<br><br>Pleased to meet you<br>Hope you left cookies<br>But what&#039;s puzzling you<br>Is how I travel down a chimney<br><br>Stuck around Kenosha, Wis<br>When I saw it was a time for a change<br>Killed that pedo and his faggot friend<br>Made the other commie scream in pain<br><br>I hijacked jets<br>Took Silverstein&#039;s bets<br>When the towers blazed<br>And the wagies leapt<br><br>I watched with glee<br>When those flamboyant queers<br>Marched in pride parades<br>For their gay monkey AIDS <br>I shouted out<br>Who no scoped John f Kennedy?<br>When after all<br>It was Ted Cruz&#039;s pappy <br><br>Let me please introduce myself<br>I&#039;m a man of mirth and haste<br>I&#039;ll fuck a trap, I&#039;ll smash any old whore<br>and dump their corpses on the highway<br><br>Just as every black is a criminal<br>No woman can admit to being wrong<br>As heads is tails<br>Just call me old Saint Nick<br>&#039;Cause I&#039;m about to pack dank bud in this bong<br>So if you meet me<br>Behind the Applebee&#039;s<br>I&#039;ll hook you up with primo coke or ecstasy<br>Don&#039;t be narc or try to pull some shit on me<br>Or I&#039;ll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah", "time": 1671876631, "resto": 33676794}, {"no": 33678034, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:05:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33676794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33676794</a><br>he also collaborates with duendes and elves", "time": 1671879950, "resto": 33676794}, {"no": 33678125, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)06:34:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33676794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33676794</a><br>Kys", "filename": "9737309C-9955-46FF-BCA1-FE794257E82E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 317, "h": 400, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671881692605179, "time": 1671881692, "md5": "v9tsHB/ChfRlSf5TqHmTOw==", "fsize": 17556, "resto": 33676794}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33677733, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:33:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Red pill me on sikhism.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

It is released prior to and during searh in order to &#039;help&#039; you transition from a physical existence to the spiritual one.<br><br>Other Psychedelics seem to do the same thing but DMT is the only one the body produces on its own and actually needs to function properly, so ingesting DMT is incredibly potent and produces incredibly profound effects even in comparison to something like psilocybin.<br><br>The experience is much more off the rails. Astral projection is real and involves this, but this is why Astral projection must occur during sleep as the brain is releasing DMT. You can explore the spiritual (4th dimensional) realm in a similar manner if you just do DMT, however since DMT can be so rapid acting and quick, helping your brain &#039;slow&#039; it down such as by creating Ayahuasca can allow you to explore this realm but is also riskier since you are also &#039;trapped&#039; their longer. <br><br>Upon and after death, since cognitive processes have ceased DMT no longer plays a role, and you conscious experience fully transforms into a spiritual one rather than a split between physical and spiritual with a heavy leaning towards physical for most people.

I have no memories of past lives, reincarnation, and have only correlated possible targets for reincarnation from logical overlap.

You can think of it as the line of coding that determines how software operates. Morphic Fields underlie the organizations of minds, bodies, crystals, plants, molecules, planets, solar systems, galaxies etc. They give things their shape, their form and their organization.<br><br>They are generated through repetition. In fact, morphic fields direct your personality\u2019s behavior. When you repeat the same patterns of behavior, you are essentially creating a pattern of informational energy that normalizes your state of being. That is why you think, act and react in certain ways.

What I believe happened is that Muhammed grew enough of a reputation attacking caravans travelling along the silk road that they caught wind of it, and either proposed him to work for them and use their influence to help him become more powerful, or they manipulated him into thinking he was an actual Messianic figure by drop feeding him a curated version of their mythos (which sound very likely of them, as its basically just Pilpul) and he got such a massive ego that he genuinely started believing it, rounded up anyone willing to serve him and then betrayed his benefactors when he had grown enough in influence that he knew they couldn&#039;t do anything against him.", "time": 1671866007, "resto": 33675668}, {"no": 33677293, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:13:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33677281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33677281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incestuous cream pie gang bangs. </span><br>Whoops!", "time": 1671866023, "resto": 33675668}, {"no": 33677294, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:13:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33677281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33677281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faith in what?</span><br>whatever<br>any single one of you reading this post<br>choose to have faith in<br><br>duh<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you think you&#039;re the only one who doesn&#039;t trust anyone?</span><br><br><a href=\"#p33677282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33677282</a><br>your move<br>and yes<br>you can still move<br><br>cause you lied about the whole check mate thing<br><br>stranger who is not my buddy<br>and NEVER<br>will be<br><br>duh", "time": 1671866038, "resto": 33675668}, {"no": 33677296, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:14:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33677291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33677291</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and he got such a massive ego that he genuinely started believing it, rounded up anyone willing to serve him and then betrayed his benefactors when he had grown enough in influence that he knew they couldn&#039;t do anything against him.</span><br>Sounds about right!", "time": 1671866086, "resto": 33675668}, {"no": 33677352, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)02:28:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33675668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33675668</a><br>What, I should have a bunch of friends so people can&#039;t do me like you did?

I thought you said you went deaf in real life and the earphone was in dreaming. Good thing, though. Better your earphone than your real life ear. Yes, you can skill your dreaming stat. Read the bible for instance. Daniel, he had dreams. In numbers, God declares to Aaron and Myriam that He speaks to prophets through dreams, although this was to emphasize how special Moses was that God spake to him directly, face to face. And to chastise them, because they grew envious of Moses. Also, in gospel of Matthew i think, Pilate&#039;s wife had urged him not to punish Christ because she had a dream about Him the night prior.<br>To excercise this &quot;ability&quot; you basically have to not do anything. Let the dreams come as they will. When i dream and i realize i&#039;m dreaming, i try to force a scenario and the dream doesn&#039;t let me and i just wake up. You have to have a receptive mood. Sleep earlier. Don&#039;t take drugs, not even coffee. But weed especially kills dreams. Do as Daniel. Pray, fast, and the book of Daniel specifically mentions he didn&#039;t eat meat. At least when receiving his visions. So, be vegetarian.
