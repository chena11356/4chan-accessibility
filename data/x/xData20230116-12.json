But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

Such a choice must be pondered deeply as in order to become a true priest or priestess of the Saturnine deity, one must freely surrender one&#039;s own essence to the lord of chains. In other words, the magician must deliberately offer to the god his very soul, as well as his personal hopes and ambitions, as an act of sacrifice. The Saturnine deity will accept no lesser gift as the price of admission to His inner sanctum. One does not need to perform this ritual in order to practice the Saturnine cult, or Saturnine magic. This route must exclusively be taken by those who having tasted the bittersweet gnosis of the god, wish to bind themselves to the Black Cube, and to its eternal current. To the believers in the cycle of rebirth, this ritual creates karmic (or psychic) chains that cannot be broken, and commit the magician&#039;s future selves to the service of the god.

If you look at planetary correspondences with the tree of life, Binah corresponds with Saturn, Chokmah with the Zodiac, Kether with nothing, and Malkuth with earth/the 4 elements (which you guys usually say means the cube). So the material world is on the bottom of the tree and you move up that through the spheres past Saturn and the Zodiac until you reach a philosophical, apophatic God who&#039;s somehow identical with you and everything else.

Keel claimed to have been a psyops officer in the Canadian military, and to have given propaganda broadcasts during WW2 from inside the pyramids. Also a notorious forger. Icke is 100% a theosophist with Gnostic leanings, reptilians are just archons for the sci fi age. And he was commanded by spirits to do things, he&#039;s said that himself. Maxwell is a Mason who specifically takes shots at the Abrahamic conception of sin, he says it&#039;s a corruption of sine, as in the sine waves from Saturn that generate our false reality. I.e. there&#039;s no right or wrong and no obedience to God, only enlightenment or being trapped in the matrix.

For example, traditional Sufism is not antinomian, it&#039;s actually a lot more bound up with a traditional approach to the sharia than Salafism is since Salafis tend to want to revise Islamic law in an attempt to return to the early days of Islam. al-Ghazali&#039;s last book was on fiqh, not ego annihilation, and none of the great Sufi authorities thought you could get to a stage of spiritual development where you don&#039;t need to follow the sharia anymore. Sufi wine and romantic imagery is exclusive to a certain strain within Sufism, a basically nonexistent one these days afaik, and was just metaphor for the love of God in the same way that the Song of Songs uses erotic imagery to talk about the soul&#039;s approach to God. Sufism is not pantheistic, with some possible fringe cases of heresy. Most Sufis I&#039;m familiar with are Asharii but there have been some great Athari Sufis as well. Sufism is not pacifistic, many of the great Sufis fought in jihad themselves, many others wrote about it, and there are Sufi groups to this day fighting in Iraq. Sufism is ascetic but Salafism can be ascetic too, look at Sh. Ibn Uthaymeen.<br><br>Tldr, Western treatments of Sufism tend to try to separate it from more orthodox Islam, and to downplay its overlap with orthodoxy. They do this because of a bias that tells them Islam couldn&#039;t possibly have rich interior spirituality, that must come from outside Islam, because white wine moms love Rumi but aren&#039;t so sure about sharia, and on the part of 5 eyes, because Western spooks think they can defang Islam by promoting Sufism as an alternative to &quot;Islamism&quot;.", "time": 1673820623, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849448, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:15:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846552</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians also engaged in genocide.</span><br>Ever consider that us human beings are universally retarded and such absurdities like genocide are just a perk of living in this gay, stupid ass world in the sufferings of the human condition that not even the greatest of worldly luxuries and escapism can cure?", "time": 1673820926, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849568, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:30:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33848683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33848683</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t and I consider that a completely valid question. <br><br>Even if we were to accept the Christian narrative of the crucifixion, complete with death and resurrection, why should it be the death that gets the focus and not the resurrection? If you&#039;re a Protestant it has to be the former because most Protestants think the death and resurrection was a human sacrifice that allowed God to create a legal loophole in order to forgive people (subsititonal atonement). But that&#039;s not the only way it&#039;s been framed by Christians. Eastern Orthodoxy has an entirely different scheme of salvation, they go with christus victor theory rather than subsititonal atonement theory, and in the medieval era they criticized the Latin West for an excessive focus on Christ&#039;s suffering and death. So yeah, I don&#039;t think the veneration of the cross does self-evidently make sense, an awful lot about the many ways Christianity has handled the crucifixion story doesn&#039;t make sense.<br><br>But on top of that, there&#039;s no biblical basis for God reclaiming the cube.

Time, death, limitations, decay, wealth, and a few other things.

I&#039;d always put Keel in the &quot;unreliable crackpot but with some interesting ideas&quot; category. Oddly I&#039;d never really thought of him as directly connected to Vallee, and that does seem to open up some real possibilities of a glow aspect, along with, as you say, his possible role in helping seed the modern gnostic deception. The ET view of UFOs seems to be the staple of glows (apart from standard debunkery), which they seem to want to tie into the ancient aliens stupidity, but like you I&#039;ve noticed that lately they seem to be moving into the territory of metaphysical hypotheses. This almost makes me second guess my position on UFOs and associated entity encounters as of demonic origin, but I&#039;m still pretty sure that&#039;s correct. Presumably they want to muddy the waters with idiotic metaphysical ideas and topics, like the big glow fest that is Skinwalker Ranch.<br><br>Vallee seems to have taken the trajectory of a lot of glowing disinfo specialists lately, insofar as the quality of his work has deteriorated so conspicuously.

Your moon and your Mars are here, meaning that you put most of your energy into these war crimes and you derive emotional satisfaction from them.

It is likely that you build your financial strategies slowly and with great care, and are loath to change them once you feel that you have arrived at a good plan or arrangement.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mercury in 4th house Aries suggests an active, energetic mind that always tackles goals aggressively with explosive force, but for that reason is prone to exhaustion. Your mind is especially concerned with the topic of family, which is the signification of the 4th house. Venus is also in the 4th house, making you perhaps lucky in matters of descent or love, and perhaps also a passionate lover.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5th house Taurus Stellium + IC. This is the house of creativity, joy, children and family. With the IC here, which also has family-connotations, it is very likely that this part should be interpreted literally. With your sun and ascendant ruler (Saturn) here, this area is of prime concern for you. It is likely that you want to start a family and be a great father. Taurus is a fixed earth sign, so you want a stable, simple home. You have Jupiter and the two malefic planets here - there may be turbulence and many difficulties here, but also great successes thanks to Jupiter.</span><br>Cont", "time": 1673778850, "resto": 33841661}, {"no": 33845631, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)05:36:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33845560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33845560</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your MC is in 11th house Scorpio, meaning that you will probably be publicly known for your friendships. 11th house in Scorpio makes you an intense, very passionate and protective, but also combative friend.

You may be inclined to overspending for the sake of your family in order to take care of them, or perhaps financial anxieties can lead you to start arguments and conflicts at home.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4th and 5th house in mutual reception: Mars rules the 4th house and Venus rules the 5th house. Since both planets are in each other&#039;s signs, there is connection and support between the houses, harmonising them and making it more likely for you to get a good outcome from activities related to these houses. </span><br>On the whole, the chart would seem to suggest an almost all-too-traditional, stern but loving father figure with a public reputation for reliability and helpfulness. Family plays a very important role in this chart, but family life may be stormy or difficult at times. Please note that this is my own reading and by no means the definitive way to read the chart - many manifestations of a chart are possible.

I feel like I have strong ideals, but am eccentric in my work and pursuits as well.</span><br>I am not sure if it is possible to read someone&#039;s ideals from a zodiac - maybe some could do it, but I can&#039;t. One of the people I deeply admire had very strong Taurus placements and he is the most idealistic person I&#039;ve ever seen, so it&#039;s certainly possible - for a lot of other people, &quot;idealism&quot; is just a word or something they think, but with fixed earth signs like Taurus, idealism means inflexibly adhering to your ideal through the greatest storms and arduously working towards its achievement, come what may. It&#039;s an idealism married to determination and hard work.<br>The red lines are called challenging aspects: squares and oppositions. Aspects are links between planets, excluding co-presence and conjunction, which do not have any lines - you have a ton of planets in co-presence, so only your squares from the 2nd to the 5th house light up.<br>There&#039;s a handful of aspect types: outside of conjunction, there&#039;s sextile, trine, square and opposition. The last two are difficult, the middle two are beneficial. Sextiles have a range of 3 houses, squares 4, trines 5, oppositions 7. Your 2nd to 5th house is a range of four, so you have squares between your moon and your 5th house planets. A square is a challenge, but it is not necessarily bad - it causes difficulties that result in events, developments, growth etc. It can produce both good and bad results depending on your actions. These moon squares are the only aspects you&#039;d have from a Hellenistic perspective, which is the perspective I use. They&#039;re the better &#039;negative&#039; aspect to have - oppositions are worse because there&#039;s no way to &quot;resolve&quot; them and there is no action generated from them, the only way to deal with them is to strike a balance between the opposing planets.

You might be onto something, actually. Keep in mind that I am trying to read your chart in Hellenistic whole sign (even though you posted your chart in Placidus). It is interesting though. You don&#039;t quite have a grand cross because the degrees don&#039;t quite align, but you do have a sign-based grand cross, I guess. It&#039;s all mutable signs too, actually - your only non-mutable placement is Venus in Taurus. Honestly, you could probably get a whole professional reading just on this aspect form.<br>Honestly, I am not sure where to start with interpreting this because I&#039;ve never done a grand cross (or a grand cross-like formation) before. I guess the most important things you need to know is that a square is a very energetically intensive placement - conflicts always breeds a lot of movement, and it can lead to powerful feedback loops of growth or destruction, depending on how you direct and control your life. There is definitely a ton of tension, but it can be highly productive tension, if you master it and put it to work for you. The square is the most energetically intense aspect, even if it is adversarial, and can lead to good results just as well as it can lead to bad ones. Here comes in a second concept: overcoming. When planet A has a square with planet B, if B lies on the right side of A, then A overcomes B. If B lies on the left side of A, then A is overcome by B. This is loosely a balance of power issue - without your intervention, the stronger planet prevails and pushes your life in the direction that it chooses. <br>For you, the houses involved are 3, 6, 9 and 12. I am not sure which house I should begin my examination from, but in any case there&#039;s many different interpretations - you might want to look up all the significations of these three houses. <br>Cont", "time": 1673792159, "resto": 33841661}, {"no": 33846353, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:16:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846314</a><br>besides being a piscean you&#039;re a relatively fire sign heavy person. your sun is also in good aspects to these planets. mars in gemini probably means you&#039;re good with ideas and the like and also driven by them, mercury in the first house adds into this aswell.you&#039;re lucky your aquarius saturn isn&#039;t in aspect to your sun", "time": 1673792187, "resto": 33841661}, {"no": 33846355, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)09:17:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846297</a><br>Try Demetra George&#039;s recent book.

Your moon, which governs the emotions and sensitivity, is in a strong conjunction with your ascendant (I assume within 3 degrees). This makes you very aware of your own emotions, and perhaps those of other people as well - you may be a natural-born psychologist. However, moon in 1st house can also make you emotionally vulnerable and inconstant, qualities already present within your rising sign. You will need to learn how to set hard boundaries, be firm, define yourself and defend yourself and your value. The presence of Saturn in this house may mean that trials may test your ability to make this change, perhaps especially in your youth. Saturn may also add a depressive tendency, which is undesirable in the strongly emotional Pisces - make sure to take care of your emotional health, not take on the burdens of others unless you really can handle it (no, REALLY!), and avoid addictive substances. Saturn is the house ruler of the 11th house, meaning that you may have more conscious freedom to pick your friends, groups, affiliations etc - use this freedom wisely.

The presence of the sun here suggests that social life, perhaps friendship, perhaps groups and affiliates (like a political party or music subculture or what have you) will play a very important role in your life. As mentioned earlier, your Saturn placement gives you more conscious freedom in choosing your commitments here. The sun marks this area as a central theme in your life. Mercury in Capricorn gives you a realistic, cool headed, arid and strategic intellect - you might want to make sure you balance it with your emotions appropriately so that they mutually support each other instead of distorting each other&#039;s functions or disrupting each other&#039;s work. Mars is also here - normally, Mars would be a mostly negative planet, especially in a day chart, but Mars is exalted in Capricorn and is more beneficial in the 11th house. You will have a lot of energy and drive in supporting the cause of your friends or your affiliates and comrades by heart. Depending on how close the conjunction between Mars and Mercury is, you may also receive intellectual benefits, like a strong, rigorous and incise intellect, with a drive to reach the bottom of things and express itself forcefully, but also strategically as a result of the Capricorn placement.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jupiter in 10th house: Jupiter is in its own domicile in Sagittarius, and this is the house of public life and career.

LOL.)<br>I guess a super quick rundown of your chart might be that romance is super important to you (Sun in 7th) and that you&#039;re after serious, mature girls (Sun in Capricorn).

Rodriguez-Lopez purchased an archaic ouija-type talking board at a curio shop as a gift for Bixler-Zavala. They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it during their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly became the band&#039;s post-show ritual. Dubbed &quot;The Soothsayer&quot;, the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as &quot;Goliath&quot;. The more the band interacted with &quot;The Soothsayer&quot;, otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band&#039;s experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio&#039;s harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez&#039;s home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album&#039;s original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: &quot;I&#039;m not going to help you make this record.

We know it&#039;s killing people, but it&#039;s certainly not killing as many people as the &quot;mainstream conspiracy media&quot; (ie. Alex Jones, Stew Peters, Mike Adams) would have had you believe early in the vaccine program. Many people were acting like every single vaccinated person would be dead within 5 years, and it just doesn&#039;t seem like that is going to pan out in reality.<br><br>So we know there is excess mortality. Quite a large number, young and old, are dying from both the vaccines and other causes related to the political actions taken due to the fake pandemic. But these &quot;excess deaths&quot; are not civilization ending as far as I can see at this point. I know quite a few vaccinated people and not a single one has died. Of course all the unvaccinated people I know haven&#039;t died either, from COVID or otherwise. So what did the vaccine do to them? They still got COVID, but they haven&#039;t died. Most of them haven&#039;t had the latest booster, but some have. Those people have gotten sick every year, but they haven&#039;t had any heart attacks (yet). I only know one person who has had all the vaccines who seems to be having some autoimmune issues. He is in his mid 60s and he is having severe allergies in the middle of the winter, even after extensive treatment. Personally I attribute it to the mRNA cocktail (I shouldn&#039;t have been calling it a vaccine, oops).<br><br>In any case, life has mostly returned to normal even in my far left shithole state.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project. The point is creating as much stress as possible within the subconscious, resulting in powerful subconscious motivation to AP, which is especially important because it&#039;s highly probable that right now you&#039;re subconsciously resistant to AP. <br><br>What techniques you use in combination with this isn&#039;t super important, it&#039;s only important that you practice them as often as possible.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers. Same for vague queries.<br>\u2022Making an AQ (air query) by not addressing a reader, in particular, is possible but doesn&#039;t guarantee an answer.<br>\u2022Avoid making the same query repeatedly and/or to different readers in a short period of time, as this may lead to more confusion.<br>\u2022Provide feedback when applicable and be considerate to the reader.

Passing connections teach us life lessons, and it seems as if this one was to teach you that you need to respect yourself first and foremost in the face of unfair treatment. You cannot accept it when people treat you selfishly. There are many people out there in the world, you don&#039;t need to keep focusing on a connection that is a clear dead end.<br><br>However, it doesn&#039;t feel as if your story with A is over just yet. A does still think of you, A does have regrets and has been mulling over the situation and would like to reach out and talk again. A misses you in a romantic context and will try to sell himself to you and tell you why he would be great to take back, but make no mistake, this is also driven by selfish desires. You&#039;ll accept him back into your life, but you won&#039;t trust him as a romantic partner, you&#039;ll try to keep a strictly platonic relationship, and this works in your favor because he will try to coerce you and may act a little nasty when he doesn&#039;t get his way. This too, will be a lesson in self respect. He does not respect you, and at times may even view you as a dramatic, emotional women, as men often do.<br><br>The first encounter is the pain.

They will not help\u2026 But to ask for help is against the ego, so you try to compromise.<br>This compromise will be more dangerous, it will confuse you more because made out of confusion, it will create more confusion. So try to understand why you hanker for compromise. Sooner or later you will be able to understand that compromise is not going to help. And compromise may be a way of not going in either direction, or it may be just repression of your confusion.<br><br>It will assert itself. Never repress anything, be clear-cut about your situation. And if you are confused, remember that you are confused. This will be the first clear-cut thing about you: that you are confused.

This explains why commercial flights are forbidden to fly below 200\u2019 in Glacier National Park; and why no one is allowed to bring firearms into the park for protection against the aggressions of the resident grizzly bears. There are many more secret CIA New World Order Nazi bases at other National Parks around the country, including the Grand Canyon. These planes are optically invisible and make no audible sound at all. The SR-71 et al. are periodically brought in to the secret underground hangers located in the hollowed-out mountain below Grizzly Peak on Going-to-the-Sun Road. These levitating airplanes are slowly lowered into the waters of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park, seen above. The planes are capable of traveling underwater like submarines for short distances. Once the planes are submerged in Lake McDonald they travel to the underground/ underwater hangers inside the hollowed-out mountain. Once inside the underground hangers the planes are serviced. There is a giant elevator inside the mountain that brings the planes up to a full-size hidden runway inside the mountain. During the night, when Going-to-the-Sun Road is closed, a large camouflaged section of the mountain is briefly opened for aircraft to exit the facility. Once the plane has left the mountain base, the secret runway bay doors are closed. Otto Skorzeny presented the photograph below, taken on August 27, 1997, describing the hidden stealth technologies active around Glacier Park\u2019s Lake McDonald. Skorzeny pointed out the flat, squared rock as being a hidden flat-panel radar array (circled), one feature among several secret installations enabling covert surveillance of the sensitive airspace.", "filename": "C29C8084-EE79-4E46-AE0E-7B8331CD6B37", "ext": ".png", "w": 1082, "h": 631, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1673844639180139, "time": 1673844639, "md5": "PXiN0CucE0Lne4qkm1xU0A==", "fsize": 841467, "resto": 33850669}, {"no": 33852350, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)23:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33852337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33852337</a><br>The disc-shaped cloud (upper left) is actually a plasma-cloaked stealth disc aircraft silently hovering above the CIA boat.

That line is disinformation \u2013 stealth planes spray mists of water on themselves while flying to create the illusion of optical invisibility by interaction with the electrified aircraft shell. Water vapor is used by stealth planes to disguise the aircraft in a white- colored artificial cloud that, when ignited, forms a plasma mirage envelope for complete optical cloaking.

Most people are in some kind of cult masquerading as Christianity. The whole point of the genuine form is to understand what Jesus was supposed to be and what he brought that was new. If you&#039;ve read the Bible before, then you&#039;re probably familiar with the figure of Melchizedek or the King of Righteousness. Melchizedek was a priest who offered wine and bread to the Most High God or El Elyon. He was around when Abraham was alive and had an impact on him. He pretty much made him monotheistic. When Jesus instituted the ceremonial meal in the Last Supper, he was alluding to Melchizedek. He was also showing that he was going to be the new sacrifice victim and replace the Old Testament system of many sacrifices. The idea of the bread and wine becoming the body and blood of Jesus is legit. The people who do it are priests and this ties the Old and New Testaments together. The people who have sold you Christianity have been selling you a Christianity devoid of many parts of the Bible and have limited your knowledge of it&#039;s books. To make matters worse, the Catholic Church has done self sabotage to the Latin Rite and destroyed the beauty of the Latin Mass with the new ritual. Some genuine branches of the Catholic Church remain, but they&#039;re more in the Eastern Church. The point is to find a genuine church that has the actual Mystery. That would be the Mysterium Fidei or Mystery of Faith.

First, the cleansing of your meridians/chakra/space veins or whatever you want to call them seems to provide a noticeable improvement to your body. Probably improves circulation and balances hormones and other gland type stuff, possible as a side effect of the brain being able to put more of it&#039;s resources towards your body due to the de-stressing. Second, storing energy in your body feels like it&#039;s actually working as advertised, and my energy levels and mental clarity has been much more stable over the day than before. For example, it&#039;s no longer difficult to get up and do dishes after getting home from work, because I feel just as energized at home as I do at work.<br><br>Read about this shit in a bunch of silly fantasy books, tried it out irl and found that its actually pretty legit.

Maybe some of them ended up in Hong Kong, but the best all went to Taiwan. <br>There are some valuable principles in the internal arts but it is not the woo woo people here think it is. The term &quot;internal&quot; is referring to the internal muscles of the body, rather than the muscles of the limbs. It is a gross misunderstanding of Chinese language and philosophy to interpret these things as supernatural abilities. However, I found the Chinese way of describing and training these principles very helpful. The brief lessons I had with a legit internal arts instructor gave me an understanding of several principles that I applied to my own arts. One thing I noticed right away about Chinese internal arts, is that they are very well thought out training methods designed to give you as much ability as possible without damaging your body. They will never defeat someone like Tyson or a great muay thai fighter, but they won&#039;t be brain damaged or crippled by 50 either. They will also absolutely wreck an untrained street punk.<br>There are no magic secrets, Anons. Fighting takes a LOT of hard work, and to be a champion you will ultimately have to destroy yourself.

It&#039;s not &quot;qi user&quot; if you think of that like a Star Wars &quot;force user&quot;. There&#039;s no magic there, it&#039;s just a different way to describe things, which for some reason was a bit easier for me to grok than say, Cus D&#039;Amato yelling &quot;Put your hip into it!&quot; or &quot;Punches start in the feet&quot; but it is ultimately the same thing.

If they used the method you describe that evidence would not exist. <br><br>Examples of that evidence include machining marks left behind in tubular bore holes, circular saw marks suggesting powered diamond-tipped saw blades with a diameter of tens of feet, micron and sub micron precision cuts in various stone blocks, perfectly cut granite jars that look to have been made with a powered lathe (including one example showing evidence of starting in the wrong axis, stopping, realigning the work, and continuing), and much more.<br><br>These are processes and levels of precision only found in modern CNC machine tools using modern materials like diamond tipped cutters. Some of the cuts seen such as the tubular drill hole marking even exceeds the performance of any modern tools. Christopher Dunn made a mold of one such tube hole and its corresponding plug in a granite block in egypt, and published his findings including the angle of the cut. He clearly showed that it was a continuous tool mark and that whatever tool made the marking had managed to cut several inches into the granite with just a few rotations of the tool. Making such a deep cut in so few rotations in a material as hard as granite is quite literally impossible for even our best tools using diamond cutting surfaces. He speculated about what kind of process could be used to achieve such a cut and thought that something using resonant frequencies to weaken the material while cutting could have been used. Machining of this type does exist today, but its usually used for machining very hard and brittle materials like cast iron.

They don&#039;t use any cement or anything.

If you tried to use the drag saw method that the egyptologists suggested, with a copper saw swung like a pendulum back and forth with sand in between the stone and the blade to cut through a granite block, not only would it take months of non-stop cutting just to make the facing cuts on a block of granite about 15 feet long and a third wide, you&#039;d also go through tons of copper in the process. The workers would essentially need to replace the blade every 13 hours or something, it would just get worn down so fast. it&#039;s completely impractical and makes zero sense. If there is one thing we know about construction, its that at no point in human history did people ever waste time on such retarded building method. If people built something, that means they had a proper system in place to do it efficiently and quickly. Using pounding stones, copper tools and sand to try to cut through the hardest stones found in nature is the very opposite of this principle. This isnt even factoring in the time involved, the amount of stones found, their sheer weight (even modern cranes could not handle the largest megalithic blocks which weigh upward of 1k tons, you would need special purpose built cranes just to maneuver such stones) making it a logistical impossibility to try to transport them miles away across deserts, through the fucking mountainous jungles of the andes, etc. and the huge amount of these blocks found vs the time during which they were allegedly made (especially the andes, seriously you expect us to believe the inca did all that in 300 years? Absolutely fucking not). <br><br>It&#039;s all bullshit.

You could say the moon was the &quot;beta test&quot; for humanity, a place where the majority of people were very spiritually powerful and connected to the gods. Of course, the moon wasn&#039;t as small as it is now, nor were it&#039;s deserts (or seas) present then. The reason it ended up the way it did was a civil conflict between the gods, while it was eventually resolved, it resulted in the massive overcharging of energy into the moon, causing it to, well, fucking explode. The pieces that fell off broke into smaller and smaller pieces, creating shit like asteroids and small planets (which would later become lunarian colonies.) After this event, the majority of the human population on the planet was wiped, it&#039;s size was severely reduced, and only half of it was left habitable. Seeing the moon as a failure, humanity&#039;s main gods decided it was time to start anew, and begin with the creation of our earth.

And i have also made it very clear that i do not want a long term relationship. And i wanted the relationship to last about two weeks. While i was writing the letters, i have recited and threw some of the letters because i was concerned i have messed something up. After that it was time to wait until 3 AM. While waiting i had trouble memorizing the sentences i am supposed to say to Lilth. So i wrote it on a note. I wanted to do the ritual on the floor. Near a wooden square pole. Because i thought it was the best place to do it in my room. I have put the candle on a small plate to not burn the floor and leave burn marks.Then, i have picked up my lighter and then lit up the candle.

Concerned that i have messed up the ritual, i immediately picked up my lighter and lit the candle again. After that, i was supposed to &quot;relax and clear up my mind.&quot; I did not understand what he meant by &quot;clearing up my mind&quot; And then my immediate thought was meditation. To get rid of thoughts. While sitting next to that candle on the floor, i spent the next 30 minutes sitting near that candle and relaxing. Every one and then i would meditate. In the early time of those 30 minutes, i saw something static behind the pole, and then when it dissapeared, i saw again, one behind the corner of my eyes. I thought it was just my bad vision or long time on the monitor. It never appeared again after the rest of the day. Every one and then i will feel a sexual arousal. It happened 3 times during those 30 minutes. And sometimes i will feel a presence behind me. When i was done, i said &quot;Thank you&quot; And extinguished the fire.

This explains why they too eat food and feel the urge to reproduce themselves. And it also explains why they are skillful in the arts and crafts. And since they have these two bodies they are, like man, subject to the diseases that arise from the elements and from the heaven. But they lack one of man\u2019s three bodies, and this makes them beings of their own. They have not the soul. In that they are like animals. They look like men but are not descendants of Adam.

He married another wife but the nymph came back and killed him on the day of his wedding. Paracelsus finds that she was justified in doing it, since no judge would have given her her rights as she was not from Adam, and so God put the law into her hands and allowed her to punish the adulterer.</span>", "filename": "unnamed (24)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 602, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 117, "tim": 1673798595036682, "time": 1673798595, "md5": "EFnoQYABz7xOH79OG8MOsQ==", "fsize": 47280, "resto": 33834937}, {"no": 33846781, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)11:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846762</a><br>Where did I make this claim?

It requires great experience to judge in such matters, for the breaking of a pledge never remains without sanction, whatever it may be, to uphold honor and honesty and to prevent other evil and vice. If she had been a ghost, from where would she have taken blood and flesh? If she had been a devil, where would she have hidden the devil\u2019s marks which always go with it? If it had been a spirit, why should it have needed such a being? She was a woman and a nympha, as we have described them, a woman in honor, not in dishonor, and this is why she wanted duty and loyalty to be kept.

She started off the way we all end up at the end of The book of Revelation after we have been perfected and our sin has been removed. We end up like her in nature. We don&#039;t think of her as a spiritual mother of Christ but as the physical mother of Christ Jesus. We call her Queen because it was common in the old world for kings to appoint their mother as queen rather than their wife. You couldn&#039;t trust a woman who had been married for political reasons, possibly from a foreign land. If the people needed to get a message to the king they could go to his mother. He always knew that she would have his interests at heart. And so the poor and lower classes could appeal to the queen if perhaps they didn&#039;t have standing or some other means in court. It is for this reason that the church calls Mary Queen of heaven because we feel that she has been given the office of intercession. Intercession is simply what happens when one Christian prays for another. Where two or more are gathered in his name, God is present. You always have someone who is willing to pray with you. Alwsys. Mary watched her son&#039;s church grow from scratch and she was his first disciple. All of his children are dear to her heart. &quot;And your own soul a sword shall pierce&quot;...You can ask her to pray for you just as you can ask any of the saints. We are all mystically connected in Christ Jesus. One body. You have a team of cheer leaders in heaven waiting to pray with you. When Our Lady was alive she manifested the miraculous gift of bilocation and warned the early disciples of danger. She was the first of Christ&#039;s disciples and the best, though she was not an apostle. She leads the way to her son.

When I calm myself and get rid of the panic I&#039;m left with some minor pains usually that go along with it and no other negative feelings or thoughts, and minor pains are easy to handle. For pains too bad I use pain relief music, it really does work as long as you relax and let it. &quot;Fighting pain&quot; works short-term, long-term you accept pain and allow it to pass harmlessly, it&#039;s like nausea&#039;s bigger brother.<br><br>With the use of this technique nausea literally doesn&#039;t matter to me, I will sit there with a vomit bucket and just be watching TV or youtube completely unaffected.

It should either feel like nothing or something like &quot;freedom&quot;.<br>It should be a feeling of being unconstrained, but that should also feel like nothing.<br>Things like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; only feel like something when you&#039;re living in a negative world, because the world tries to make you think those are not neutral states. Like they have to be earned or something (which is unloving and unfree).<br><br>I know the idea of &quot;feeling nothing&quot; can sound cold, but just put that aside for a moment (because I think it&#039;s caused by confusion about the way the world works).<br>If you really think about it, the feeling of &quot;nothing&quot; is the feeling of just letting everyone be themselves. It&#039;s only when you want people to be something other than what they are that you start to have feelings typically called love, lust, or hate. Most of the normal kinds of &quot;love&quot; come from some feeling of incompleteness within someone. Like an unhealthy need or attachment. Or to fill a hole inside oneself.<br><br>For example, if someone is &quot;evil&quot; and you feel nothing then that &quot;nothing&quot; is like you allowing them to just be who they are. What&#039;s more loving than that? That&#039;s literally the definition of unconditional love.<br>Why should you require a burning passionate feeling in your heart to want to let people be themselves? The very idea that feeling something is required to have a world like that is actually kind of oppressive isn&#039;t it?<br><br>Wanting people to be themselves, and enjoying a reality where each soul

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end. Sometimes we just get too self conscious about it (which is what the mindfulness industry seems to profit off of).", "time": 1673854756, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33854306, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841531</a><br>Exactly.

Because of course, if they don&#039;t, when people come out about this, Adamites are going to be horribly persecuted. I will tell you, I&#039;ve been praying to Yahweh and Yahshua for a long time, and he&#039;s helped me with addiction, helped me find a house, helped me with many things. Crumbs from the masters table for the kunarion (Koine Greek for &quot;little dog or &quot;puppy dog&quot;), as opposed to a street dog that eats trash. Matthew 15:27. The Canaanite woman is referred to as such first, by Yahshua. So, that&#039;s somewhat hopeful. Maybe there&#039;s crumbs to be had in a miserable afterlife? Yahweh never used to answer Cainites for the most part. Now he does. Some things have changed. However, I&#039;ve gone through some extreme bitterness recently, thinking on the mere fact that Cain even existed, how he probably wasn&#039;t even aware he was serpent seed, and the need for such self-awareness with blind people in particular. Seems like a cruel joke. I don&#039;t know what kind of answer Yahweh could give us that would bring us peace.

Who would have the biggest incentive to hate Yahweh? Canaanites. Simon the Zealot was also known as Simon the Canaanean. He was a Gnostic (reportedly), and Peter told him to GTFO after he offered money for the miraculous abilities that Peter had. That&#039;s classic Canaanite/idumaean behavior. Buying the powers of the Holy spirit. You have to have a serious lack of self-awareness to ask Peter to sell those abilities. Also, Gnosticism may have many sects that disagree with eachother, and they did carry on SOME old, forgotten traditions that the church scrubbed from the Bible (serpent seed stuff), but their stuff is so plastered throughout degenerative media that just makes everything worse in the world, even if there are some reasonable Gnostics, the ones in charge happen to hate Yahweh, and also happen to live child rape, adultery, etc etc etc etc. There isn&#039;t a lot of positive outcomes I can see from the Gnostics today, quite the opposite. If the Gnostics were in charge, there&#039;d be even more serpent seed everywhere, forced into existence, only to be destroyed and tortured because of generational cursed and bad blood. Seems like the actual would who would make up that religion would just lose in the end, so what&#039;s the point? Pride? Honor? You fought Yahweh aren&#039;t you so so strong and brave? That just seems like what Yahweh would want you to do. Playing right into his hands as the typical Canaanite enemy. We can see that everything is going according to His plan, can&#039;t we? He&#039;s obviously in charge of this place. There&#039;s no escaping that fact, for me. There&#039;s a side of Him that&#039;s so beautiful, that I feel like I&#039;ve seen, and the fact that someone gets to experience that love, his children, who have been terribly persecuted, makes me focus more on them instead.

There is a clarity born, increasing my senses physical and astral, I feel energized and limber, and very aware. But at the same time, it is corrupting because it is easy and encouraged to feed off people, astrally but as time went on I felt a physical craving as well. I noticed things weren&#039;t right when I caught myself sort of no longer seeing people as really people to me, it was an odd sensation, and the notions of any harm really didn&#039;t conjure much empathy. In general, even when I don&#039;t delve into any feeding side when I try to go into its vibrations and powers normal feeling towards others feels more distant, so it doesn&#039;t all have to do with feeding techniques. I can easily squelch demons and spiritual problems when going into the path, but I find that doing so is actually a bigger demon itself imo. And no, unfortunately there isn&#039;t nearly enough &quot;malevolent entities&quot; I can use as an experiment to see if that is self-sustaining.<br><br>God, I know what you mean.

The Michelson-Morley experiment, as it is commonly known, was designed to measure any differences in the speed of light in different directions in space, specifically to search for the existence of the luminiferous aether, a hypothetical medium thought to fill space. and allowed the propagation of light. However, the experiment did not find any difference in the speed of light in different directions, which led to the conclusion that the ether did not exist.
