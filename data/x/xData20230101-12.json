Everything else is your choice as well as the myriad of other individuals creating consequences upon one another due to their own choices, any of which can change at any time. This is only possible due to your own determination, not determinism, for God to be the ultimate benefactor would not just create, but create more like himself. That is what it means to be the ultimate good. Since you are but a young soul stretching out its limbs, you aren&#039;t to God&#039;s level of fate defiance yet but you are getting there.

I have a few beginner questions I hope you can provide perspective on:<br>1) Should we avoid being surprised when our manifestations become real? Being happy would be normal, but whenever I think about having my thoughts materialize, I always have this thought of being surprised and amazed that it worked, but doesn&#039;t that mean I&#039;m not fully believing in the law?<br>2) Are intrusive thoughts dangerous during manifestation? If I am deep in concentration and an unpleasant thought starts swirling around, is there a risk of contamination towards the manifestation? I would assume magic is dangerous to not handle properly.<br>3) If the true final stage of all this is to reach a point of totally creating your reality, then does that mean that most masters would not share their experiences? If we are supposed to get to a point of not caring what others think, then what are the motives behind sharing our stories? Perhaps this is just a difference of opinion, perhaps I just only find posting about stuff to be worth it to see other&#039;s reactions, and maybe other people just like putting their experiences into a shared pool with fellow manifestors?<br>4) Do you talk to anyone (outside of this board) about your rituals &amp; thinking? If so, why and how do they react. If you don&#039;t, why? Is it just not needed, or can it ruin it (I basically asking if jinxes are real I suppose).<br><br>Thank you, and happy new year frens.", "filename": "1655896040889", "ext": ".png", "w": 568, "h": 568, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672555259006450, "time": 1672555259, "md5": "/oMzOoRYQ08O10w//AQT7g==", "fsize": 466454, "resto": 33733825}, {"no": 33736722, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)01:49:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201c When you know that consciousness is the one and only reality \u2013 conceiving itself to be something good, bad or indifferent, and becoming that which it conceived itself to be \u2013 you are free from the tyranny of second causes, free from the belief that there are causes outside of your own mind that can affect your life.\u201d<br><br>- Neville<br><br>This sh*t is crazy!!", "time": 1672555755, "resto": 33733825}, {"no": 33736773, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:06:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201c A man&#039;s consciousness is all that he thinks and desires and loves, all that he believes is true and consents to.\u201d<br><br>Why is this guy not more famous?", "time": 1672556782, "resto": 33733825}, {"no": 33736830, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:20:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33734614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33734614</a><br>Your house is great man, thanks for inviting us to your housewarming!", "time": 1672557646, "resto": 33733825}, {"no": 33736862, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33736695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33736695</a><br>1) nah<br>2) if you accept them as true, then yes. otherwise no. you are the gate, you are the censor.<br>3) your lack of &#039;masters stories&#039; is also a manifestation. if you want to change that, you know what to do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we are supposed to get to a point of not caring what others think</span><br>be, do, experience what you want. there&#039;s no &quot;supposed to&quot; involved that you don&#039;t make for yourself.<br>4) no. i am a rather private person, other obvious reasons aside.", "time": 1672558066, "resto": 33733825}, {"no": 33736922, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:40:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33736695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33736695</a><br>I&#039;m of the mind that one cares of what others think only if thats what one created them for.

Chumbley\u2019 to John Power on June 06/21 and asked him to comment on it, with a view to his being quoted in this blog-post. Here is his reply in full from June 07/21:<br><br>\u201cThe idea at one time was that he would be next in line as preceptor, as he did have obvious talents. However I never gave him full initiation or the cult mantra, so it was more of a \u2018probationer\u2019 initiation, so that I could see how he shaped up. Yet he went around telling the world and his uncle that he was something grand. Eventually he cut ties with me with a \u2018Kill the Guru\u2019 ritual [so hence the tradition] then started a pseudo tantrik micro group with Mike Staley of Kenneth Grant\u2019s Typhonian OTO, but soon fell out with him too after the usual ego-maniac attempt to take over. In all of this the only tantrik connection was bookish. He never did any work in the Uttara kaula tradition. Exaggerations and disinformation like this have since been quoted elsewhere and compounded errors. The example I gave you before from \u2018India and the Occult\u2019 by Gorden Dyurdjevic, where a ritual is quoted, he had adapted it from the Tibetan, Chod rite, so not even Indian. Even the quote you\u2019ve sent says that Ranchi is in Uttara Pradesh State, which it is not, but it is in Bihar State, a couple States further south. He had never been out of England, let alone to India, yet is in your quote claiming to be head of a lineage of one of the 5 great Tantrik traditions, when he doesn\u2019t even know where the guru lived who first passed the tradition to a westerner who passed the westernised form to me. The tradition continues in India with a native Indian and any use of the term Paramapraya [guru to the lineage] is again delusional self importance from Chumbley.&quot;", "time": 1672550233, "resto": 33731339}, {"no": 33736546, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:59:20", "name": "P.

You will be persecuted, perhaps even tortured and killed and you must be willing to accept that. <br>Physically you must be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect you and your family and that may involve fighting, living off the land, or constantly being on the run.

The next two things happened in an order that I can&#039;t remember, though I suspect it was in this order.<br>1.

I laid in bed for a while, processing everything that happened, then suddenly felt pins and needles all over my body, and became paralyzed. I possibly could have fought it and broken the paralyzation, but I was too focused on the sounds of thunder and flashes of white light peaking in through my window and door way, all the while what sounded like a kid&#039;s voice repeated the words &quot;Hey, listen1&quot; three times (sounding vaguely like a certain fairy from the Legend of Zelda)<br>The light show was trying to unnerve me, as the light that was coming through my doorway was shaping itself in such a way as if my door was opening letting in even more light and an implied &quot;something else&quot; along with it. I was smart enough to figure out that was just a trick of the light though, and so I regained my ability to move. I wasn&#039;t scared, but a bit uneasy.<br>After all that I didn&#039;t go back to sleep and just thought about it all.

She was basically implying I wouldn&#039;t have asked that on my own and that my sister put me up to it.<br>2a.) The concept of time holds no meaning. The only reason we have time on planet earth is due to the rotational spin of the globe. 1 day is 24 hours and 1 year is 365 days through pure chance. How does one keep track of what year it is on another planet, much less in a dream world where time can behave differently and people can dream a year or even more in just the short timespan of a night.<br>2b.)

Part 2 coming in another post.", "time": 1672289837, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711112, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33711077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33711077</a><br><br>After that I fell back asleep again and had another disturbing dream. I repair certain machines for work, and often have to talk on the phone with a partner while I do it for help/advise. In this dream I was in a government propaganda center working on a machine there. I could not for the life of me understand what the fuck my partner on the phone was saying. I couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong with the machine either, and nothing was making sense. This was very disturbing to me as I do this job every day and I&#039;m usually very good at it. (I&#039;m a service technician and travel all over to many different types of facilities to fix these machines). After awhile of this I decided to call in sick for the rest of the day and left the propaganda center. When I got back to my house a man who was pale yellow and looked sick as fuck handed me a note with some sort of conspiracy on it. I don&#039;t remember what the note said. What I do remember is that he was shot by an unknown marksman right after that. I ducked down for cover but was shot as well and woke up.<br><br>My wife had a nightmare about being kidnapped and sold as a sex slave on the darknet that same night. A &quot;special forces&quot; style team broke into our house and kidnapped her. She was put into a shipping container type device with other women. The pretty ones were going to be sold as sex slaves, and the ugly ones were having their organs harvested.<br>My best friend texted me the following morning before I woke up. He has a paradontal cyst (look it up if you dont know what it is)<br>That night it was extremely inflamed and he was suffering. He had texted me several times during the night about this to my astonishment that morning waking up. I did not see these messages that night as I sleep with my phone on airplane mode. He was also suffering the whole night. This is very abnormal for him as it usually never bothers him to the point he can&#039;t sleep.<br>Don&#039;t know what the FUCK was going on in the spirit world that night bros", "time": 1672290119, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711266, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:26:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1672291608, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711401, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i fingered my ass while in a dream moments before i got actually lucid and it felt great.", "time": 1672293322, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711652, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:02:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707440</a><br>That&#039;s a nice point of view anon, I can see where you&#039;re coming from.

But there are some established archetypes or patterns of conformity to beware of. I believe these people lack a creative spark to develop a personality of their own like a normal human being and so they tend to adapt to whatever &#039;everyone else is doing&#039; so to speak. That&#039;s how they blend in. Which is why when it becomes suddenly normal or even encouraged to be transgender, you have many youths coming forward and identifying themselves as transgender. And some people might say &#039;oh, it&#039;s because it&#039;s acceptable now that&#039;s why there&#039;s more.&#039; Which is wrong. It is so obviously due to the fact that these people are bombarded with propaganda 24/7 that glamorizes these &#039;types&#039;.<br>Which is why every zoomer in America talks like a hoodlum. It&#039;s because they cannot develop a personality of their own, and in order to masquerade what they truly are, to give the appearance of being &#039;normal&#039; when they are actually abnormal, they do what appears to be common. This is how it&#039;s always been in human society, though. Which helps to paint a broader picture that these people act like a sort of hive mind. Which points to an even broader picture, that these people have strings attached to them. This is the sum of human history and the human experience in general.

The roulette is arguably the easiest game to cheat using remote viewing. You just have to guess if the ball will go on red, black or green color. In my experience, in big casino roulette are always situated in the most noisy place, making it really difficult to concentrate. In las vegas there are always DJ playing near roulette game. also, the time to chose your color seems tailored to just not be enough to remote view. With enough training you can still get it to work. But there is the weird part. I personally can get consistently 8 good bet out of the 10 first before running out of stamina and going back to a 50% chance. But each time I start winning too much, the roulette &#039;cancel&#039; the game. It still spin, goes where I predicted but then it spin again and only the second spin count. And each time the second spin isn&#039;t my bet. I know I sound like a schizo addicted to gambling but if you tried it you&#039;ll get the same result as I do. Something really weird is going on.

I know that even big demigods like brahm\u00e4 do not see the rays of the nails of your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years together. still, o infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. o m\u00e4dhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of your lotus feet, but because your lordship is inconceivably powerful, you can do what is impossible to be done. your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore I am very much attracted by them. o supreme eternal, please, therefore, let my mind be fixed at your lotus feet so that eternally i may be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service.\u201dthe devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the lordand have no ambition to see his all-beautiful face or aspire for the protection of the strong arms of the lord. They are humble by nature, and the lord is always leaning towards such humble devotees</span>", "filename": "d20ffd36d783fbbff371508b8e19e645--krishna-krishna-lord-krishna", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 693, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1672498738402011, "time": 1672498738, "md5": "w3XMMvpk5kOiHq2d5hY0RQ==", "fsize": 128309, "resto": 33726109}, {"no": 33730864, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)10:16:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33730790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33730790</a><br>I&#039;ll look into it.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more. I thought I accepted myself now that I&#039;m finally at peace with my body, only to feel lost again as spiritual experiences confront me with all sorts of sides of myself that I don&#039;t know how to reconcile. I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore. And although I recall her offer to guide me, I&#039;m reluctant as I fear I&#039;ll be forced to face even more.<br><br>That&#039;s what I get for being dishonest with myself; for being so easily seduced as my contradictions are exposed.", "filename": "serge_and_leena_by_tokio_okt0w0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 533, "h": 710, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672561287536300, "time": 1672561287, "md5": "QBYx8/ImgV0F1BS1XLVKqg==", "fsize": 213325, "resto": 33725319, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33737152, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)03:29:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33725319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33725319</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sexuality is but one small part of who she is.</span><br>Why do people need to downplay sexuality?

It&#039;s closer to being farmed, or rather milked for vitality that is normally pretty difficult to accumulate at these lower vibrations with a significant surplus. In the grand scheme of things, this is the deep sea abyss where life is closer to death than living.<br><br>This is the tale of the reverse Golden Goose. Instead of a killing songbirds for their meager harvest of meat, it&#039;s a continuous harvest of golden eggs. Gold is normally pretty hard to find, but if you genetically engineered a golden goose and figured out how to breed them to not only be numerous, but lay larger golden eggs more frequently, that&#039;s closer to what it is. Golden geese require a special sauce though, one that can&#039;t be created, otherwise they&#039;re just animate earth golems walking around, eating and shitting everywhere, and sending profits into the red.<br><br>It requires capture of consciousness essence, or what we recognize as souls. The beings can&#039;t travel high enough to collect as much as they please, being of lower vibration. However, souls can travel very far, enough to be ensnared for harvest. Sometimes a few particles sink to the abyss. Once ensnared it&#039;s very difficult to seek release from those chains. The bodies are engineered to be harvested from. Those energy centers that keep us alive separate what is supposed to be a singular energy (oneness?). They&#039;re also very localized to specific locations with specific flow patterns for easier harvest.<br><br>Most exercises related to energy work involve restarting a flow to reunite separated energies into one component, and decondition compartmentalization. This destabilizes the body (kundalini?). Under unity, cultivate vitality to sustain OBE state, from physical reality to metaphysical reality, and remastery and rediscovery of higher existence. They vibrate higher, and suddenly *poof*, they&#039;re gone. Out of reach.

That&#039;s, like, the whole reason I got so interested in spiritual sex: if dysphoria was like a phantom pain, then stimulating that area directly in my consciousness relieved it temporarily, as the lack of nerves in the right area wasn&#039;t an issue.<br>Since I was little, I was usually a girl in my dreams. The sexual dreams involving her were the exception. I&#039;m not sure how else to interpret it other than that she shapeshifted me during those dreams. Once, I even saw this change as it happened. If I wonder why she&#039;d do that, it comes to mind that she prefers male partners. A few days after I regained the memories that once made me feel suicidal, I vaguely sensed that I&#039;d had a sexual relationship with her before, and I asked if by any chance she wants something like that. I understood her response as: &quot;Only if you were more masculine spiritually.&quot;<br>Unlike Lilith, who said any decision I make on this is meaningless unless I decide it for myself, she wanted to prevent me from having surgery.

Recently, he got a job for the first time since we met. On his first day, he texted me to express that he felt suicidal and wanted to quit. I sent a few texts to reassure him, then considered my options.<br>We&#039;re from neighbouring countries, and I&#039;m with him about half of the time. Financial stability is one of the requirements to marry, but I can&#039;t get a job in his country until we&#039;re married. I could only get an exemption if I spent 7 years saving up.<br>Delaying our marriage that much is unacceptable to me, so I used telepathy to overwrite his emotions with positive ones. An hour later, he texted me again to let me know he&#039;s feeling much better, and that he&#039;s starting to enjoy his job. He asked if I did something to him spiritually; I admitted that I did. He thanked me, and apologised for being so negative earlier. I said he shouldn&#039;t apologise, as his openness allowed me to help, and that I&#039;m just glad he&#039;s feeling better now.

Almost every longitudinal study that has followed schizophrenics and other people who have experienced psychosis for upwards of 20+ years have found that those who were able to get off and stay off of antipsychotic drugs had profoundly higher rates of functional recovery compared to the people who stayed on the drugs, which, despite immediate or short-term benefit, can result in more frequent relapses and more disability. The schizophrenics who didn&#039;t take meds even had better outcomes than the people with just bipolar or other &quot;milder&quot; disorders who stayed on antipsychotics. <br><br>Additionally, psychosis has usually been thought of as episodical, and there have been numerous projects and studies that have tried to track (or argue for) the benefit of &quot;letting the psychosis play its course&quot; as a strategy that can result in better outcomes compared to episodes that were crudely halted by the traumatic encounter of hospitalization and medication. And from the beginning of theorizing, going back to Freud&#039;s time, psychosis has long been understood as a process that arches towards a definite end that becomes a new normal for the subject, where what we take for visible symptoms are the mind&#039;s attempt at its own cure.

We do live in a world where the very ideas we use are sometimes seen in derogatory ways but it is always safer to understand ideas as things to explore rather than things to shut out or about the information for.

I think because they have similar roles in their respective pantheon and are more or less major deities in their pantheon that they could be the same.</span><br>I think that&#039;s partially true. I&#039;ve come to understand it that a lot of the entities we interact with when communing with a deity tend to be more like &#039;titles&#039;, for lack of a better terminology, than individuals. Most gods tend to embody fundamental concepts and are woven into an egregor of persona by the observations of man, but that&#039;s simply all that we&#039;re observing, not necessarily the totality of the the entity we&#039;re interacting with. So that&#039;s to say, these entities we commune with are made up of &#039;multiple&#039; deities from various mythologies /pantheons because the inherent nature of what we&#039;ve collectively deified is a specific facet of them. That said, I suspect there&#039;s an affinity you could try and quantify an entity with as &#039;more Zerus than Ares&#039; or perhaps &#039;definitively Odin&#039; if an entity primarily (but not entirely) embraces that aspect of themselves. When viewed in this light, it also helps reconcile a lot of the seemingly schizophrenic behavior they exhibit in mythologies because there&#039;s more than one entity embodying that aspect in the story and the nature of conflating the deified title with the essence of being tends to lead to the appearance of a somewhat schizophrenic-looking behavior pattern. I also suspect many of them feel very misunderstood by this &#039;typecasting&#039;, but that likely varies on an individual basis. As a disclaimer, this is my current working understanding after a lot of work with a lot of &#039;gods&#039; but ultimately still filtering through my body&#039;s perception so not everything may be perfect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33728021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33728021</a><br>Young brunette woman with blue eyes.

Thus, although green can be made by combining blue and yellow, there is also a true or primary green which is not a compound. This can he proved by breaking up the spectrum with a prism. Helmholtz found that the so-called secondary colors of the spectrum could not be broken up into their supposed primary colors. Thus the orange of the spectrum, if passed through a second prism, does not break up into red and yellow but remains orange.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consciousness, intelligence, and force are fittingly symbolized by the colors blue, yellow, and red. The therapeutic effects of the colors, moreover, are in harmony with this concept, for blue is a fine, soothing, electrical color; yellow, a vitalizing and refining color; and red, an agitating and heat-giving color. It has also been demonstrated that minerals and plants affect the human constitution according to their colors. Thus a yellow flower generally yields a medicine that affects the constitution in a manner similar to yellow light or the musical tone mi. An orange flower will influence in a manner similar to orange light and, being one of the so-called secondary colors, corresponds either to the tone re or to the chord of do and mi.</span>", "time": 1672563970, "resto": 33734220}, {"no": 33737304, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:09:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33737288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33737288</a><br>The ancients conceived the spirit of man to correspond with the color blue, the mind with yellow, and the body with red. Heaven is therefore blue, earth yellow, and hell--or the underworld--red. The fiery condition of the inferno merely symbolizes the nature of the sphere or plane of force of which it is composed. In the Greek Mysteries the irrational sphere was always considered as red, for it represented that condition in which the consciousness is enslaved by the lusts and passions of the lower nature. In India certain of the gods--usually attributes of Vishnu--are depicted with blue skin to signify their divine and supermundane constitution. According to esoteric philosophy, blue is the true and sacred color of the sun. The apparent orange-yellow shade of this orb is the result of its rays being immersed in the substances of the illusionary world.<br><br>In the original symbolism of the Christian Church, colors were of first importance and their use was regulated according to carefully prepared rules. Since the Middle Ages, however, the carelessness with which colors have been employed has resulted in the loss of their deeper emblematic meanings. In its primary aspect, white or silver signified life, purity, innocence, joy, and light; red, the suffering and death of Christ and His saints, and also divine love, blood, and warfare or suffering; blue, the heavenly sphere and the states of godliness and contemplation; yellow or gold, glory, fruitfulness, and goodness; green, fecundity, youthfulness, and prosperity; violet, humility, deep affection, and sorrow; black, death, destruction, and humiliation. In early church art the colors of robes and ornaments also revealed whether a saint had been martyred, as well as the character of the work that he had done to deserve canonization.<br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/st<wbr>a/sta11.htm", "time": 1672564149, "resto": 33734220}, {"no": 33737371, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)04:32:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33734220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33734220</a><br>YELLOW IS SO MELLOW<br>IT&#039;S LOTS OF FUN<br>IT&#039;S THE COLOR I WEAR<br>WHEN I DON&#039;T GET SUN", "filename": "4382750990", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672565559737842, "time": 1672565559, "md5": "347dZ0HFAR5Ha3iDJfbSOg==", "fsize": 62397, "resto": 33734220}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33737168, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)03:33:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "All hail the.

In Exodus 7-8, it&#039;s written multiple times that the Lord hardened Pharaoh&#039;s, so that Pharaoh wouldn&#039;t go along with what Moses said (first example is Exodus 7:3 - &quot;And I will harden Pharaoh&#039;s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.&quot;).<br><br>So my two takeaways is that God wasn&#039;t always omnipotent about everything that would happen in the future (I mean this not in the sense that He wasn&#039;t capable of it, just that He for some reason chose not to use that power 100% of the time, hence Him regretting certain things early on in Genesis, but then He used it for other moments like foretelling incidents involving Jesus, or Revelations), and other times He will use His power to control people and override free will, like with Pharaoh. I think this is the case with Judas as well in your example.<br><br>I will say this, which might not make it sound any better for people to accept, but with the context of Peter denying Jesus also being &quot;set in stone&quot;, I think that the actual acts are what the person would&#039;ve thought to do on their own, and God or Jesus&#039;s declarations of those actions certainly happening are a result of God not letting them change their mind after that.", "time": 1672558754, "resto": 33736168}, {"no": 33736975, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:48:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33736918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33736918</a><br>It is hard to grasp though.

I could be wrong.<br>Even though those events were set in stone, because he truly was remorseful, he was given forgiveness and gods grace because as you said &quot;god won&#039;t let them change their minds after the fact&quot;.<br>But in other moments of the bible, no matter how much one pleaded for forgiveness, they were told they would suffer Gods Eternal Wrath for their actions.<br>Even stuff like &quot;Cain did this horrible thing, the first murder of humanity&quot;. Yeah, something like that is unforgivable, and Cain showed me remorse or regrets for it.<br>But to punish all his offspring after the fact who had nothing to do with his choice the same way?<br>It continued like that for a long time in the bible.

Jung&#039;s works.<br><br>The primary issue when reading Jung&#039;s works is that he never properly defines how to do active imagination. He states what it is, but from the works of his I&#039;ve read (~7), he never gives enough detail for you to start doing it in a methodological way.

I would lay down on my back, and I would engage in a sort of meditation. I would hold a conscious image in mind, and wait for something to happen.

Now, thankfully, I had enough self-awareness to catch myself doing this during the process. I disregarded it as contact with the Unconscious. If it were truly from the Unconscious, then what would happen will catch the conscious mind off guard. I would right down the transformations in the images, but I never had an &quot;amazing insights.&quot;<br><br>The most important thing, if you&#039;re going to do it, is to develop the mindfulness to know whether or not it&#039;s legit versus just a conscious fantasy.

Free energy just means that we are able to harness the energy/work that is produced by a certain reaction. For example, in the case of nuclear fusion, we are able to utilize the energy which was originally mass before molecular splicing. You do not &quot;make&quot; free energy, you can only make energy more free. The Universe is a closed system, but you can still harness the latent energy found in the universe and make it more &quot;free&quot;. Tesla thought that everything exists in a frequency, which is true. If we are able to harness the energy of various things (like waves which make up the EM spectrum), we can use that energy rather than just allowing it to completely dissipate. That all being said, there are holes in our current understanding of physics, such as those present in astrophysics and quantum physics. We have yet to discover gravitrons, and we have yet to identify dark matter and energy, or an alternate theory which allows our model of the universe to make sense.

He documented Jesus, treated him as any other sorceror and more or less debunked him trying to figure out how he performs his mystical arts. An example is the water to wine trick. Celsus documents the exact school in Cairo using this \u201cspell\u201d (hollow bowls filled with extra wine, normally used as an infinity bowl). He also assigns Jesus father (Pantera of Sidon), documents how Joseph was a cuck and took in Mary.<br>Celsus was right. He said a Pantera of Legio Sagittarius was the father. German archaeologists independently confirmed a Pantera of Sidon was the bannerman of Legio Sagittarius (an important position and exactly the wealth of an officer who could afford to send his bastard to school) from his grave. It\u2019s all there if you look and the Christcucks have been trying to remove his dossier for 2000 years and didn\u2019t realize their notes on their witch-hunt gave enough information to infer he was right.

SC thinks it&#039;s the fungus hijacking our quantum states, others like the fruitcake Lear believe it is a device on the moon. After seeing the changes post protocol I agree with SC.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer\u2019s suicidal automatic machines.

To call upon such spirits to a true capacity though that matters, you need to be initiated into a tradition those spirits recognize and thus will feel actually responsive and kin to you.<br><br>2. 100% legit. They are not sumerian gods, but many general powerful gods of the land lost from ancient times (I guess including some of sumeria) and not gods in the traditional sense but gods in the sense of the Japanese kami, similar to that. They lived on past their neglect from their varying lands and people through Solomon&#039;s tradition. They are strong entities with their own agendas willing to work with practitioners they like/that pay them, all there is to it.<br><br>3. There are TONS of ET species. Tons. Nordics are just one, and yes, Nordics are friendly. The vast majority of ET&#039;s are not friendly. Nordics are NOT humans, however, they are related to humans. There is a famous german medium who made contact with various ET&#039;s, but this was not a Nordic. I do not want to get into interdimensional Hitler theory.<br><br>4. Psy-abilities, correct. Rather, phasic, not telekinesis. UFO tech operates by phasing into the astral and then out of the astral, using the astral to travel far faster across vast distances that you could not physically.

It was absolutely lifechanging. I wrote down the entire experience on paper somewhere, and i may be able to find it, but I asked the &#039;entity&#039; all of the hard hitting questions. Tl;dr it was amazing and the pure love you feel is indescribable. The best way I can describe it is being held by your mother chest to chest. It felt as if I were naked laying on a giant woman while she pet me and played with my hair etc. It was the most calming moment of my life. I must preface this next part with a short story about a bad experience with edibles I had a few years prior to this experience. Long story short I ate enough edibles for 8-9 people (on accident) and experienced something that can only be described as an angry father scolding and reprimanding me. The voice of consciousness in my mind was so loud and upset with me that I felt like a helpless child hiding in the closet hoping that my father calmed down and didnt kill me. He was absolute furious with me and told me to grab a piece of paper and pen (and I did so literally in the physical) and told me to write everything down that he said. It was basically a list of all the wrong ive done that I needed to correct and shit like that. Stop smoking weed, stop drinking, stop being a lazy fuck etc. So this time around in the present experience I acknowledge this &#039;presence&#039; as the same being, only this time it was much more gentle with me and it was a totally different vibe. I asked this presence (which i acknowledged as God) what sex it was. She literally giggled while still playing with my hair and answered &#039;Im what ever you need me to be. Last time we (referring to the edible trip) I needed to appear to you as an angry but loving father who is upset with your actions.

I got baptized in a calvinist church. They taught the bible through a historical, grammatical, and literal lens. Prayers were answered here and there, or so I thought. I had a challenging time walking with the spirit (adhering to hebrew morals/ethics). most challenging of all was the nagging realization that christianity is judaism full circle with the messiah as the wheel&#039;s linchpin. Christianity is meant for jews and i&#039;m a gentile. Remember, &quot;the jew first and then the gentile.&quot; I was reading a jewish book, written by jewish authors from beginning to end. <br><br>I watched a lecture series by a yale academic (see link below) who helped me dispel the notion of god as yhwh, the national deity of ancient Israel and Judah. I left christianity and my situation in life has actually improved since my departure. I didn&#039;t return to the new age. The new age is still a sham. life quality has definitely improved, no thanks to prayer, the holy spirit, jesus, or yhwh. I simply take responsibility for things and get the necessary work done. I focus on my circle, such as family and work relations. I live by the natural order of things.

I&#039;ll check those out too. I hadn&#039;t read through the thread yet when I made that comment. I took the NDE pill ~10 years ago after reading &quot;The Holographic University&quot; by Michael Talbot. So the only big question for me is if the experience is what it presents itself as, or is it some kind of deception or trap? I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;d be able to conclude either one with any degree of certainty though, so I&#039;m very curious what all the supporting evidence and logic is for the trap theory. I&#039;m also trying to keep my own biases in check as someone with trust issues and slightly anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic tendencies.<br><br>I&#039;m skeptical of anyone who asserts overly specific details like archons, greys, reptilians, loosh farming, ultra sci fi machines and what not for too many reasons to get into. However, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re wrong about the basic gist of things. I think most people just don&#039;t well enough understand the concept of symbolism within a holographic/fractal model of consciousness. What I mean is most people take what is experienced in altered states of mind far too literally.<br><br>What you experience when you astral project, remote view, dream, or have an NDE is almost never literally what is appears to be. Our basic 5 senses are stable and well developed. When we sense beyond that, our minds struggle to decode information into something coherent to present our awareness with, and we end up with highly subjective symbolism. This is why it&#039;s not always &quot;a light at the end of a tunnel&quot;, but often it&#039;ll be a bridge, a boat, or a trail through a forest even. It&#039;s your mind presenting an extremely in accurate and subjective approximation of reality to your awareness.<br><br>1/2 I guess", "time": 1672421250, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722852, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33721725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33721725</a><br>turns out your consciousness can do alot when it isn&#039;t bound to a body.", "time": 1672422234, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722886, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:47:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33722714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33722714</a><br>Because of this, it&#039;s also possible much of the &quot;trap&quot; theory is simply the result of subjective projections of common fears and uncertainties. Very understandable ones which I share. Who would ever choose to reincarnate in THIS timeline? Who would choose to be raped to death as a newborn? Is this much suffering really most ideal and efficient for learning and growth? What&#039;s the point, and how can we learn or progress, if we start with no memories each time? They&#039;re valid and important questions with no solid answers, and I think everyone promoting and drawn to the trap theory are likely motivated by similar questions. I know I am.<br><br>So I agree the more more common views on reincarnation simply don&#039;t add up. Though I think most of the more specific, literal, yet fantastical and sensationalist views which often read like sci-fi, while maybe not intentionally dishonest, definitely should not be taken too seriously or literally. Similar to montalk for those familiar. It&#039;s what happens when slightly dumb people are spiritually gifted. They perceive more then most, but aren&#039;t able to understand or process it effectively.<br><br>This is also why I&#039;m a bit skeptical about the &quot;net&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;. There very well may be a system in place serving similar functions, but I&#039;m suspicious of how accurate the net concept is. If one reads about said net, tends to be a slightly gullible person / open to suggestion (a trait universally required for one to be spiritually gifted) then what are they going to see when they astral project? Of course it&#039;ll be a net for them. <br><br>The astral is not the material, where we all more or less see the same apple, the same tree, the same Joe or Sue. You perceive things in highly subjective terms you can understand to some extent. More people need to understand this if we&#039;re ever to make more progress on understanding this, proving it, or reaching consensus, let alone ever getting the word out.

I&#039;ve had one experience that (for me personally) was complete confirmation that it really is possible for your consciousness to leave your body. The last time I tripped I tried meditating at the peak, and the trip instantly just &quot;turned off&quot;. The visuals, the trippy mindfuck headspace was gone, the body load, all of it stopped instantly. The only way that could happen to me is if my consciousness had separated from my physical, mushroom-addled brain and body. Instead of meditation enhancing the trip as one might expect, the psilocin seemed to help send me into a deeper state of meditation, and this completely overrode the trip. It&#039;s difficult to describe what the experience that replaced the trip felt like, but it was joyful yet very calm and peaceful, not ecstatic or overwhelming. It just felt like absolute stillness, and all my senses could perceive were a pale golden light and a steady drone. As soon as I willed myself back to reality, the trip instantly returned as if I had just returned to my body. <br><br>Weird shit, and I&#039;m hesitant to try and draw more conclusions about what I had experienced or attempt to explain it more. I want to go back though. It also reminds me of a story mentioned in the holographic universe book I mentioned in a previous post. Some Buddhist monk was given 900mcg of acid and all he had to say was &quot;this is nice, but meditation is better&quot;. Now I understand exactly what he meant. That&#039;s how he was able to basically just ignore 900mcg of LSD, that&#039;s why he claimed meditation is better. Deep meditation separates your consciousness from your body, or at least turns off your senses. Which is obvious in hindsight, this is why you&#039;re supposed to focus on a single subject to the exclusion of all else.

If the buddist goal of cessation can be equalled to what we would describe an atheists state of death as, then it means you cannot have knowledge of, or percieve the attained peacefullness.

Symbols can never perfectly represent something or have identical meaning to any two people, as each person&#039;s understanding of any given symbol is formed by unique life experiences, association, and pattern recognition. <br><br>The inherent inaccuracy of language leads to exponentially more complex language barriers as we try to create symbols for increasingly abstract concepts built upon previous symbols assumed to be understood. Similarly with perspective. It&#039;s like arguing over the color of a coin that&#039;s red on one side and blue on the other, because both parties are unwilling to look at the other side of the coin and see why the other&#039;s perspective makes sense to the other party. Now imagine an object with an infinite number of faces and an infinite number of observers. That&#039;s the nature of discussing spiritual concepts.<br><br>If I were wrong, the entire world would have formed a consensus on a single spiritual worldview a very long time ago.

The best explanation I have found for why they might begin to happen to a person is because they are associated with &quot;individuation&quot;/bringing unconscious material to the forefront.
