The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE).", "filename": "Aryan", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 770, "h": 730, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 118, "tim": 1672399712981983, "time": 1672399712, "md5": "yQpXAGt2BhfNn03oSS6F/A==", "fsize": 299756, "resto": 33718969}, {"no": 33720970, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)06:32:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Nobody remembers a single Neanderthal word, a single Neanderthal name, a single Neanderthal myth...

I used to hate myself and the world, but now not only do I love myself and the world, I also actively feel that love from full-body shivers I experience daily. It&#039;s truly as if I was in a wholesome loving relationship with the source of love itself. All your worries go away because you finally know that there&#039;s an infinitely benevolent being that has your back. You&#039;ll need the following:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pregnancy pillow (I recommend the U or C shaped ones)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Weighted blanket (if you find them uncomfortable just go for regular blankets)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lubricant (normally I&#039;d go with water-based lube but since you&#039;ll probably want to go for longer sessions, I have to recommend silicone-based lube)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masturbator of your choice (no need to be fancy, I use the fleshlight blue ice grip)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Prostate massager (no need for vibration but I use the edge 2)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic meditation skills</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic anal cleanliness skills</span><br>There are other things you can do but these are the bare essentials. Before starting the process, make sure your ass is clean and your body is in a healthy state, don&#039;t eat heavy meals and junk food beforehand. Here are the steps:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Insert dick in lubricated masturbator and lubricated prostate massager in ass; get in bed and bundle yourself up in the pregnancy pillow and weighted blanket</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Hump the masturbator and body pillow at a slow pace until you get close to cumming</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. DO NOT CUM! Stay near the edge and stop humping</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Start meditating now; concentrate on nothing but the pleasure you&#039;re feeling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. The longer you go without cumming the more the pleasure will spread throughout your entire body, keep going</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. You&#039;ll eventually reach a state of delirious ecstasy, you&#039;ll be saying things like &quot;I love the world&quot; &quot;Thank you for this love, O&#039; universe&quot; &quot;I love myself&quot; without realizing it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7.

So we can&#039;t fathom the idea that god isn&#039;t a conscious being because religion has said &quot;your nothing, and god is everything that&#039;s why you should believe in our religion&quot;. But really, there is no religion and god is energy/source.

This is a general &quot;magical&quot; philosophy, which applies to LoA, but you&#039;ll come across this if you research other magical practices, religions, and so on. You don&#039;t have to apply any of this, but just throwing it out there for anyone that wants to know.<br><br>Essentially, your &quot;ego&quot;, the reasoning, logical part of your mind is dumb. It has its purpose to interact with the world, but it&#039;s also the reason you develop doubts, get led on wild goose chases (seeking and NOT finding), and getting into all sorts of trouble.<br><br>You might&#039;ve learned about the conscious and subconscious minds, but there&#039;s another higher form, called the superconscious mind. This mind has a better understanding of your life and what would fulfill you because it sees things from the spirit plane, and thus it gives &quot;perfect&quot; ideas. When you hear about spiritual guidance, that&#039;s from the superconscious mind. If you&#039;ve ever heard of LoA people talking about &quot;inspired action&quot;, that&#039;s from the superconscious mind.

Happens if I lay on both sides, but only the right shoulder has this problem. If I go about my day the pain mostly stays at the base of the neck. Idk maybe its a herniated disc. But I had everything checked and even went to chiro/physio at my own expense. Nothing helped. I have random jolts in my limbs or stinging in my dick during ejaculation. Sometimes I have locked up fingers. Im aware of my posture and muscle tightness. And all my problems started during an depressive episode where I drank, smoked alot of weed and ate like shit.

It&#039;s closer to being farmed, or rather milked for vitality that is normally pretty difficult to accumulate at these lower vibrations with a significant surplus. In the grand scheme of things, this is the deep sea abyss where life is closer to death than living.<br><br>This is the tale of the reverse Golden Goose. Instead of a killing songbirds for their meager harvest of meat, it&#039;s a continuous harvest of golden eggs. Gold is normally pretty hard to find, but if you genetically engineered a golden goose and figured out how to breed them to not only be numerous, but lay larger golden eggs more frequently, that&#039;s closer to what it is. Golden geese require a special sauce though, one that can&#039;t be created, otherwise they&#039;re just animate earth golems walking around, eating and shitting everywhere, and sending profits into the red.<br><br>It requires capture of consciousness essence, or what we recognize as souls. The beings can&#039;t travel high enough to collect as much as they please, being of lower vibration. However, souls can travel very far, enough to be ensnared for harvest. Sometimes a few particles sink to the abyss. Once ensnared it&#039;s very difficult to seek release from those chains. The bodies are engineered to be harvested from. Those energy centers that keep us alive separate what is supposed to be a singular energy (oneness?). They&#039;re also very localized to specific locations with specific flow patterns for easier harvest.<br><br>Most exercises related to energy work involve restarting a flow to reunite separated energies into one component, and decondition compartmentalization. This destabilizes the body (kundalini?). Under unity, cultivate vitality to sustain OBE state, from physical reality to metaphysical reality, and remastery and rediscovery of higher existence. They vibrate higher, and suddenly *poof*, they&#039;re gone. Out of reach.

Jung&#039;s works.<br><br>The primary issue when reading Jung&#039;s works is that he never properly defines how to do active imagination. He states what it is, but from the works of his I&#039;ve read (~7), he never gives enough detail for you to start doing it in a methodological way. And where there&#039;s no methodology outlined, how can you say you&#039;re doing it as he intended?<br><br>The idea is that you are allowing your Unconscious to produce images, symbols, narratives, etc. etc. Those details alone necessitate a specification: How do you know when you&#039;re in true contact with the Unconscious or if it&#039;s a conscious fantasy by the conscious mind?<br><br>Here&#039;s what I used to do. I would lay down on my back, and I would engage in a sort of meditation. I would hold a conscious image in mind, and wait for something to happen. What happened is that I began noticing that I would sometimes reflexively produce changes in the images through my conscious mind. In other words, my conscious mind was creating a fantasy. Now, thankfully, I had enough self-awareness to catch myself doing this during the process. I disregarded it as contact with the Unconscious. If it were truly from the Unconscious, then what would happen will catch the conscious mind off guard. I would right down the transformations in the images, but I never had an &quot;amazing insights.&quot;<br><br>The most important thing, if you&#039;re going to do it, is to develop the mindfulness to know whether or not it&#039;s legit versus just a conscious fantasy.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer\u2019s suicidal automatic machines. There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart. The man\u2019s crime is different from other crimes\u2014for it makes even crimes impossible.</span><br>~G. K.

I guess where I might differ, is that I believe the spiritual world and physical world exist alongside each other, and should be in communion on some level. For you to reject the call of life, which is the call of communion between matter and spirit, and to try jumping from matter to spirit, just means that you are not fixing any of the problems with your existence, you are just trying to move the arena of your existence to another state of being. But that other state already exists alongside this state, if you were capable of living a steady existence in the spiritual state, you would already experience it in daily life. The fact that you don&#039;t, means that what awaits you is something akin to an unconscious dream where you vaguely know of your existence and wander aimlessly into the next illusory existence. I think what I&#039;m trying to say, is that this world is basically our arena through which we ground eternity into the present.

The next two things happened in an order that I can&#039;t remember, though I suspect it was in this order.<br>1.

I laid in bed for a while, processing everything that happened, then suddenly felt pins and needles all over my body, and became paralyzed. I possibly could have fought it and broken the paralyzation, but I was too focused on the sounds of thunder and flashes of white light peaking in through my window and door way, all the while what sounded like a kid&#039;s voice repeated the words &quot;Hey, listen1&quot; three times (sounding vaguely like a certain fairy from the Legend of Zelda)<br>The light show was trying to unnerve me, as the light that was coming through my doorway was shaping itself in such a way as if my door was opening letting in even more light and an implied &quot;something else&quot; along with it. I was smart enough to figure out that was just a trick of the light though, and so I regained my ability to move. I wasn&#039;t scared, but a bit uneasy.<br>After all that I didn&#039;t go back to sleep and just thought about it all. Especially what the girl said.<br>&quot;You don&#039;t actually think that do you?&quot;<br>This could imply about 2.5 things.<br>1.) She was basically implying I wouldn&#039;t have asked that on my own and that my sister put me up to it.<br>2a.) The concept of time holds no meaning. The only reason we have time on planet earth is due to the rotational spin of the globe. 1 day is 24 hours and 1 year is 365 days through pure chance. How does one keep track of what year it is on another planet, much less in a dream world where time can behave differently and people can dream a year or even more in just the short timespan of a night.<br>2b.)

I repair certain machines for work, and often have to talk on the phone with a partner while I do it for help/advise. In this dream I was in a government propaganda center working on a machine there. I could not for the life of me understand what the fuck my partner on the phone was saying. I couldn&#039;t figure out what was wrong with the machine either, and nothing was making sense. This was very disturbing to me as I do this job every day and I&#039;m usually very good at it. (I&#039;m a service technician and travel all over to many different types of facilities to fix these machines). After awhile of this I decided to call in sick for the rest of the day and left the propaganda center. When I got back to my house a man who was pale yellow and looked sick as fuck handed me a note with some sort of conspiracy on it. I don&#039;t remember what the note said. What I do remember is that he was shot by an unknown marksman right after that. I ducked down for cover but was shot as well and woke up.<br><br>My wife had a nightmare about being kidnapped and sold as a sex slave on the darknet that same night. A &quot;special forces&quot; style team broke into our house and kidnapped her. She was put into a shipping container type device with other women. The pretty ones were going to be sold as sex slaves, and the ugly ones were having their organs harvested.<br>My best friend texted me the following morning before I woke up. He has a paradontal cyst (look it up if you dont know what it is)<br>That night it was extremely inflamed and he was suffering. He had texted me several times during the night about this to my astonishment that morning waking up. I did not see these messages that night as I sleep with my phone on airplane mode. He was also suffering the whole night. This is very abnormal for him as it usually never bothers him to the point he can&#039;t sleep.<br>Don&#039;t know what the FUCK was going on in the spirit world that night bros", "time": 1672290119, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711266, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:26:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1672291608, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711401, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)00:55:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i fingered my ass while in a dream moments before i got actually lucid and it felt great.", "time": 1672293322, "resto": 33649266}, {"no": 33711652, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:02:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707440</a><br>That&#039;s a nice point of view anon, I can see where you&#039;re coming from.

Personally I think the Bible very clearly alludes to reincarnation. It never clearly states the precise nature of heaven and hell or the second death or anything like that. It&#039;s always extremely vague riddles and parable. The basic idea is if you fuck up your afterlife will be shitty, if you do things right your afterlife will be good. Basically the same in essence as almost any other religion. Any specifics beyond that is always just guesswork and wishful thinking.<br><br>The general concept of reincarnation just seems logical and self evident to me though. Physical matter reincarnates into vessels for life over and over forever. This is a fact. The genetic lines of our ancestors reincarnates as their descendants. Again, basic observable fact of nature. So it&#039;s only logical to assume the nature of consciousness or the soul is similar to some degree. Again, can&#039;t really infer specific details, so I will only eve use &quot;reincarnation&quot; very loosely here, but the basic concept of reincarnation seems like an obvious, clearly observable universal principle of all life.<br><br>This idea only breaks down when people attempt to make up precise details to fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, most find comfort in deluding themselves into thinking they already know everything. But if you think you already know everything, then you can&#039;t learn anything new.

The fact that a human must make money to survive on this planet stresses us and due to stress and the need to do something other than hunt like we&#039;re supposed to caused our lifespan to shorten.

The notion of forsaking pleasure, comfort etc as spiritual discipline is known as &#039;tapas,&#039; literally &#039;heat&#039; in Sanskrit.

I believe this God is an eternal, supreme, creative energy and spirit that doesn&#039;t love or hate. This God has no form, no incarnation. He is ambivalent towards the world. However he may grant blessings and help because his nature is good, he is a good being. He is like an enlightened being and enlightens those that seek after him, revealing to them the truth behind the veil of reality. The origin of the world is probably eternal, as we see, matter is energy, and energy cannot come from nothing. Therefore it is very likely that creation ex nihil is impossible. My stance is currently the universe has existed since eternity, and will continue on existing until eternity, ever taking new forms, new stars get born, new galaxies form, new earth cycles, new civilizations. As above, so below. These are my rules:<br>1 i do not harm any living beings, not even in self-defense, except certain types of insects like big spiders and mosquitoes for obvious reasons<br>2 i pray a lot to the divine spirit and ask for it&#039;s assistance and blessings<br>3 i always practice mindfulness before acting, thinking, and speaking (took this one from Buddhism but i don&#039;t believe in Buddhism)<br>4 i honor animal and plant and nature spirits. Not pray to them but honor them in a spiritual way, like hunter gatherers do, they pay their respects to the animals they&#039;re about to hunt.<br>5 i meditate daily to lessen the tight grip of evil internal forces stemming from illusion about reality. Lessens lust, Anger, heightens kindness and love.<br>6 i do not engage in romantic or fleshly love.<br>7 i constantly seek solitude. The more solitude my mind can deal with, the better. Less need for social contact is also a perk of years of meditation.<br>8 i engage in the rest of the worldly pleasures as much as my heart desires. I always eat the best food i can afford, the best drinks, the best cigarettes.<br>That&#039;s all I can think of.

I had a very strange experience the last time I did psychedelics that left me much less interested in psychedelics and more interested in meditation. I have no idea what to make of it and was hoping you (or anyone interested really) might read my gay blog post and share your thoughts. <br><br>I had taken 6g of purple mystic and had a somewhat bad trip. During the peak I spontaneously had an urge to &quot;be still&quot; or &quot;meditate on stillness&quot;, despite not having any experience with meditation or any idea that &quot;stillness&quot; was such a prominent theme in Buddhism at the time. As soon as I did this, it was as if the trip instantly turned off. The visuals, the mindfuck head space, the body load, all of it was instantly gone.<br><br>It was as if all my sensory input had either been replaced or maybe simply removed, revealing what the senses hide? I don&#039;t know<br>All I could perceive was a pale golden light and a steady drone. It didn&#039;t feel anything like what people describe as ego death, and I didn&#039;t feel the presence of any entities, loving or otherwise. I just felt a profound sense of peace and calm joy. Words fail me beyond this much. It was just so strange.<br><br>At some point (my sense of time was impossible to describe) I decided to &quot;return to reality&quot; and the trip resumed immediately, as if my awareness had been somewhere else and had just returned to my body as soon as I willed it. The &quot;bad&quot; part of the trip was over at that point, and I spent the rest of it pondering what the fuck had just happened.<br><br>I suspect I somehow accidentally stumbled onto some deep state of meditation I absolutely had not earned on my own. Now I&#039;m more interested finding out just what that state was and how I can work toward being able to reach it totally sober. So... Any ideas or recommendations? I guess I think just want to learn pure and simple meditation.

For mechanistic science, however, it was a different matter. In agreeing with Aristotle that a primary physical existent must be a unitary entity, rather than composite, the discovery, particularly in medicine with Sebastian Basso, that human bodies are composite, led mechanistic thought at the time to conclude that human beings could not be primary physical existents. Rather, the primary physical existents are their most elemental components. This led to atomism and the consequent return to Neoplatonism in which reality was reduced to the divinely caused, mathematically abstract motion of inert, indivisible and immutable atoms. Matter was thus separated from what had been its Aristotelian correlate, form, and given primary ontological status, at the same time denying natural existents any immanent capacity for \u2018kinesis\u2019. As Leclerc argues, this formed the basis of modern physics as mechanism, rather than organism, and established motion, like space and time, as ontologically distinct, rather than as derivative.</span>", "time": 1672347656, "resto": 33704970}, {"no": 33716195, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:04:00", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<a href=\"#p33716172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33716172</a><br>You might get a kick from the theology of the Temple of Set and their notion of Xeper.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In agreeing with Aristotle that a primary physical existent must be a unitary entity</span><br>Why do we need to agree with this when Aristotle didn&#039;t even demonstrate this, simply insisting that it was the case?<br><br>Oh nevermind, I see.<br>You may also get a kick from Nalanda University&#039;s objections to atomism.<br><br>I&#039;m very reluctant to get sucked into a philosophy paper when I have Invoking the Akelarre to read.", "time": 1672347840, "resto": 33704970, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 33716254, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:12:08", "name": "Pachad", "com": "<a href=\"#p33716037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33716037</a><br>What you&#039;re describing sounds like revelations received while high, dreaming, during astral visions, and mystical experiences.

Every culture will tell you to go into the light, etc, it&#039;s a scheme. The light is in part, the Death Trap. Look into people with NDEs who get as far as a life review, this is part of the Death Trap where the entities (who appear to the religion of your choosing/culturally relevant) will ignore your religious doctrine and say &#039;aww geez bro, you weren&#039;t a perfect human, you need to go back to Earth as a newborn and learn a new lesson/do it over this time&#039; so you can act as a power source for them. <br><br>Now your poignant question, what if I don&#039;t go up into the light, which by itself is allegedly a feat to escape it even willfully, is a hard one.

But all in all, it was similar to earth that&#039;s why we were even able to go there. They have found other earth like planets, even ones with beings on them but they won&#039;t tell us that. They will not divulge that information to the public, they&#039;ll deny it.

That&#039;s a very complicated question. <br><br>You have to understand that most of the main demons listed in Grimoires originated as pagan deities whose identities were demonized / Stygian-tized (as entities of the underworld) with the spread of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. <br><br>As such, a lot of these deities can put on different cultural masks to fit the worldview or the mythology that the practitioner has chosen to engage in. <br><br>For example, the Goddess Aphrodite is identical with the Demon Astaroth. Astaroth was a demonization of the Near Eastern deity Astarte, who was literally that culture&#039;s version of Aphrodite; they have a shared historical origin. <br><br>Things get complicated with syncretism. Although the substance of their identity as deities most often remain in tact in different cultures, syncretism often results in those masks taking on the characteristics of other deities / myths. <br><br>Lucifer started as the Indo-European morning star deity way, way before Christianity, associated with the Planet Venus; for the Planet Venus was mythologically thought to bring in the light of the day and exile the darkness of night. As such, Lucifer has always been associated with the deity who brings knowledge and enlightenment to mankind (hence his role as the serpent in Genesis 1 and his role as Azazel in the Book of Enoch).<br><br>(Page 1)", "time": 1672333989, "resto": 33707302}, {"no": 33714543, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)12:14:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707302</a><br><br>His most crystalized form as Lucifer as the deity whom we know him as was in the form of the Greek deity Phanes (whose name in Greek literally means Lucifer but &quot;light&quot; as in an enlightenment sense), who was the Supreme God of the Orphics - an ascetic but spiritually epicurean sect that sought social responsibility and kindness to all beings, but still sought refined sensual experiences as the highest goal of life. They identified Phanes with Dionysius, the Greek God of wine drinking, music, and eroticism, and saw him as the creator deity - they saw the fire of human desire that moves civilization forward as the spark of the divine itself. They also connected Phanes to that Morning Star God who brought enlightenment from the heavens. <br><br>The Mithraics stole a lot from the Orphics.<br><br>The Christians were in direct competition with both the Orphics and Mithraics in Rome as a &quot;mystery school&quot; sect and one for the time being, and part of their propaganda was demonizing the deity Phanes as Satan. They identified Phanes as Satan by reference to Isaiah 14, because they saw the same name &quot;Lucifer&quot; in that verse and connected it to that sect; &quot;Hey you, you claim that Phanes is the Supreme Deity, but it says here in our magical book that Lucifer (Helel / Phanes) is actually Satan who wanted to overthrow God! You are worshipping the Devil!&quot;<br><br>For that reason Lucifer became crystalized as Satan in Christianity.<br><br>So Satan, as part of the Judeo-Christian mythos, is synonymous with Lucifer if you choose to work through that cultural system. <br><br>But Satan standing alone has different origins than Lucifer. In Judaism, he originates as the Archangel Samael and based on what we know of Jewish mysticism, is likely connected more to the Greco-Roman god Ares / Mars than Dionysius.

The lower your partner is in the ranking looks, the more afraid they will be to lose you. Because they will always feel you are too good for them. But don&#039;t let them become too complacent. You have to spark their jealousy very often. For example post pictures aside attractive male friends and that sort of stuff in social media to make your boyfriend feel insecure time to time. That will make them even more afraid to lose you, remind them their position as the &quot;lucky&quot; one in the relationship, give you power over them and push them to improve themselves in looks/career or both to be deserving of you. This will particularly work with a short guy. Dating a 6/10 manlet as a 8/10 woman will 100% work guarantee you a devote boyfriend as long he comes from a conservative household and is a virgin. This won&#039;t work 100% with non virgin men whatsoever.
