Constant forced pregnancies on trying to produce a Messiah, and even cursing/putting hexes on Jesus so that he would suffer in the Underworld.<br><br>Modern Jews today believe in something called Adam Kadmon, which is preserved in the traditions of Kabbalah. This is a variation of the idea of Jesus, which by the Jews who are learned, understood what happened in those tragic times when Jesus walked. People who sought to usurp power for personal means by embodying the avatar, or being embodied by the avatar, of certain dieities that exist within certain spheres of reality. The Early Church fathers would be the first to overthrow Jesus&#039; throne, after he died, someone took his place and darkness began. The problem is, the throne is meant to still be occupied after death, not just life. So the throne remained vacated, but Jesus; asleep. <br><br>He wasn&#039;t all lovey dovey though. The guy was tough as fucking nails dude, and looked fed up with everyones shit, but dealt with it anyway. Everyone who was Jewish, all agreed that the fanatics went to far. However the power to usurp the throne and control the masses was engineered by forces who sought to benefit, by creating a narrative of the aforementioned parties.

Usually not but they reveal a few tricks to keep people dumb and from guessing the real thing. Chris angel comes to mind as well I seen a few clips of him doing stuff that seemed pretty phenomenal and strange to me. Maybe it&#039;s all a trick though who knows but I&#039;ve personally witnessed things myself some of which I seemed to be the cause of at least fully or partially. I&#039;ve seen things appear out of thin air for example and seen many many improbable and unlikely events happen as it may relate to what&#039;s normally considered chance among other things.

These are the energy vampires. They don&#039;t seem to be able to connect with source directly as the meditators do. The magicians for example seem to steal people&#039;s life energy by fooling them into believing the illusions. Illusion in Hindu or vedic or whatever it&#039;s called doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t real, it means it&#039;s not what it appears to be. (I just had deja Vu) I bet that is how a lot of ancient structures like pyramids actually were built as well now that I think of it. Ancient atlantaens we&#039;re said to employ some sort of mystical crystal technology for example which is the adage that sufficiently advanced technology is also indistinguishable from magic. Modern computers use crystals for example: silicon germanium etc... Quartz crystals produce piezo electricity all that used in watches. They put rubies and other gems in those watches as well to keep time they emit some sort of pulse that is consistent and can be tuned to be counted and measured. It&#039;s knowledge a lot. But many of these &quot;people&quot; have an evil or demonic disposition they seek to hoard that knowledge and use it to dominate others instead of free or liberate them. Words are spells that&#039;s why it&#039;s called spelling. Words are concepts the more you know and understand the more power you have. The word gospel for example is very interesting. It seems to be the combination of the words gnosis and spell. A knowledge spell. Jews call Jesus a magician derogatorally but why is it derogatory? Isn&#039;t it actually a compliment and didn&#039;t he seek to liberate others and share with them instead of being tyrannical? Much the same they try to spin gospel to mean good news which is not really correct if you study the actual etymology of what I just mentioned. These are the ancient Egyptians who only allowed certain ones to read and write and be a &quot;priestly&quot; class to rule over the masses.
