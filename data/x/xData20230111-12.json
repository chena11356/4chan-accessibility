You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself you&#039;re an ok person, but deep inside you feel the guilt creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight. Eventually it\u2019ll be too much to bear - you\u2019ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. In the afterlife you will feel heartbroken but relieved that you no longer have to live with the unbearable guilt. God will send you to hell, and he will know for the rest of eternity he sent a liar there.

She commands 180,000 malicious spirits (18 legions of 10,000 each). She also rides through the air in her big chariot leading smaller bands of angels of destruction. Lilith is her rival and competitor.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to a legend, Agrat came upon King David sleeping in the desert and coupled with him while he dreamed. She conceived and bore Ashmodai, King Solomon\u2019s brother, rival, and alter ego. Agrat may be a fierce demon queen, but she is also a spirit of wisdom. She trains witches, procures succubi, and is believed to be the spirit who communicated magical secrets to Amemar, a fifth-century CE Jewish scholar. Agrat is allegedly more interested in human men than women, or at least they are the ones who are strongly cautioned against her. Men are traditionally advised not to be alone, sleep alone, or enter the water during the times of the week when Agrat is most powerful, lest they fall under her spell. Days: Agrat is at the peak of her power on Wednesday and Friday nights. At other times, Agrat inhabits places uninhabited by people (that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find her), but on those two nights she can go where she will and do as she likes. Once upon a time, Agrat was free to come and go as she pleased, wherever and whenever she wanted, but a compromise with Hanina ben Dosa, first-century Galilean rabbi, wonderworker, exorcist and general thorn-in-her-side restricted her powers. He agreed to halt his attempts to completely banish her, and she agreed to start keeping regular hours.</span>", "time": 1673300276, "resto": 33798426}, {"no": 33801116, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)18:04:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33799172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33799172</a><br>Honestly, I kinda dig that look for myself when I become a succ.<br>Kinda has an &quot;Easygoing sexpot&quot; vibe that I like.", "filename": "5a2a8c0c0c4e33b3f71cd0f469c514c4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3081, "h": 2803, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1673305488918182, "time": 1673305488, "md5": "fQel8vM03//uLlkW8q40Sw==", "fsize": 883483, "resto": 33798426}, {"no": 33801320, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)18:37:44", "name": "HWA Anon", "com": "It&#039;s very fascinating to me how Reinin can basically just reach into my body and touch my nerves, petting them and massaging them.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

No. You would not feel it.<br>Why do we get tides then? It&#039;s complicated, but basically it comes down to aggregate action on the water.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwC<wbr>hk4S99i4<br>Jump to minute 4 if you want to skip the pre-amble, but long story short: the water at the poles is pushing down towards the earth. But it&#039;s also, ever so slightly, pushing towards the moon because the moon is pulling it.<br>Which is pushing into water molecules that is, likewise, being pulled towards the moon. It&#039;s an aggregate force and that&#039;s why lakes don&#039;t have much of a noticable tidal affect. (The great lakes experience all of 5 centimeters of tidal affect. Amazing, innit?)<br><br>Now, as for the moon being tidally locked with the earth: That&#039;s also true for mercury, which is locked towards the sun.<br>And I think quite a few of Jupiter&#039;s moons. The reason is very simple, the moon is *not* perfectly even with the mass distribution. As such, in the past it may not have been tidally locked, but its rotation has slowed to the point that it is now. Now you might ask: Where did the energy go? The answer is the rotational energy is lost due to internal friction on the moon.<br><br>Also fun fact, the moon in fact does have a (negligable) atmosphere. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmos<wbr>phere_of_the_Moon", "time": 1673411575, "resto": 33808167}, {"no": 33811403, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:36:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33808917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33808917</a><br>...

Flerfers often post it as proof the Earth is flat. Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck. Note that we see more of the closer rig, proving curvature.<br><br>Here&#039;s a line of sight calculator: http://www.calculatoredge.com/elect<wbr>ronics/lineofsight.htm<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but we&#039;re talkin&#039; about muh horizon</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH HORIZON IS TOO FAR AWAY!</span><br>No it&#039;s not.

The tunnel awakened an ancient evil. When the rescue team arrived at Church Hill, they encountered a creature covered in blood and holding human skin hanging between its fangs as it leered over the workers. The creature quickly left the scene and ran towards the James River. It was then approached by a group of men, after which it escaped to Hollywood cemetery, where it was said to have hidden in the tomb of W. W.

They feel that something is very wrong with the world and their relation to it. They feel lost, confused, frustrated, alienated and estranged, and they can&#039;t explain it. They have everything and yet they want more. And when they get it, they are still left empty and dissatisfied. They want happiness and peace, and nothing seems to bring it. They want fulfillment, and it never seems to come. Everything is fine, and yet everything is wrong. These feelings are often suppressed by frantic activity and endless running around after distractions. They are drowned out by television, computer games and social media. But when this frantic activity ceases and everything is quiet, then the dread sets in, and the meaninglessness of it all, and the boredom, and the fear weigh heavily on the heart and mind. Why is this so? Because, as Occult Science tells us, we are not at home. We are exiles. We are alienated and estranged from our true country. We are not with God in the land of the living. We are spiritually sick.

Because of the fog I couldn\u2019t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid 20s, and healthy. My ultra-attenuated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5\u20196\u201d. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me.<br> <br>Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike.<br> <br>I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinter starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth.<br> <br>As I float into the celestial abyss of the greater Crab Nebula, I am not filled with regret for having left my world, but rather happiness for having left it a better place.", "time": 1673171309, "resto": 33789862}, {"no": 33790001, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:02:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33789882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33789882</a><br>I do but I&#039;m not an internet personality am I?", "time": 1673172126, "resto": 33789862}, {"no": 33790012, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:05:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve been practicing semen retention for over 6 years, started in June 2016.<br>I do it for religious purposes mainly, but also personal reasons.

I need to rethink my dosage, my supplement has 1 mg of it LOL.<br>A few things to talk about, I&#039;ll take some space here today. First of all, BPC.<br><br>Started taking it 3 days ago, took 1/3 of the full dose on day one, 2/3 next, full dose yesterday. Full dose has 1mg of BPC-157 and 750mg of phenibut in it, as well as some other less important ingredients in smaller quantities. Guess I&#039;ll scale back down to 1/3 or 2/3 if 0.1 mg is sufficient. Apparently, phenibut builds up tolerance real quick, so I plan on taking this supplement 3 or 4 days per week.<br>First impressions: it didn&#039;t knock me out at all, but sleep was deeper and more refreshing. Focus during the day is slightly better, the unpleasant feeling at the back of my head that was there for the last couple of months (while on oregano follow-up) is reduced. Muscle-brain connection felt much improved today at the gym, comparable to pre-workouts but without the agitation caused by stimulants. Physical performance up ~10%, subjectively.<br>No weird dreams or any anomalies. I can&#039;t remember my dreams again and was only able to do that on months 3-5 of the protocol. Guess I&#039;ll be taking galantamine in a couple of months or so.<br>One outstanding observation is that yesterday, after the full dose, I suddenly regained access to multiple childhood memories. Normally, I don&#039;t remember my childhood at all. I didn&#039;t have any psych trauma that could wipe memory out, I just never really cared for it and never exercised this non-pragmatic type of memory. I assume that&#039;s why it degraded. This time, memories had senses in them - smell, touch, taste, emotions. This is rare for me.<br><a href=\"#p33787740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33787740</a><br>Side note, had to take a break from Ormus. It improved my hearing so much that I could hear dogs barking 1 block away with my windows closed, interfered with my sleep. The sound also became almost constant. Will pace it a bit slower, maybe once every 2-3 weeks (was taking it 1-2 times per week in small pinhead-sized doses).", "time": 1673186146, "resto": 33787403, "trip": "!UNLEAVENS."}, {"no": 33790807, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)09:11:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33787740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33787740</a> brand names or links to ones you recommend?<br>bump", "time": 1673187063, "resto": 33787403}, {"no": 33790906, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)09:30:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33790735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33790735</a><br>Second, a few questions to the group.<br><br>1. Apparently, ibuprofen taken at high doses can lower T and increase LH? Is this a concern, or is it not that much of a problem at lower doses and shorter courses? Or did the side effects they observed come from actual die-off?<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC5789927/<br>I usually don&#039;t take it more than 5 days in a row and only take 100-400 per day, so not really concerned but still. Sorry if this was already discussed.<br><br>2. Need a second opinion here. The ONLY medication from my &quot;past life&quot; that I&#039;m still taking is allergen-specific immunotherapy (dust mite allergen). The region that I&#039;ll move to in a few months doesn&#039;t have med available, and even in my current place I have to get it from abroad, so I&#039;ll discontinue it soon. Thing is, when I was looking for the availability and alternatives, I finally read some detailed info on how this therapy works. Apparently, the sign that it&#039;s &quot;working&quot; is a significant increase in target IG4 levels.<br>Isn&#039;t that how T cell exhaustion or &quot;vax AIDS&quot; works? Am I actually killing my immune system for the sake of reducing allergy?<br><br>3. Another thing to note, also from digging around ASIT stuff. Apparently, oral mucosa exhibits extremely (if not the most) powerful immunomodulatory properties for the whole body. If I understand that correctly, fungus could modify your entire immune system just through the mouth. Sublingual supplements could be also much more serious that just &quot;LOL lozenges&quot;.<br>For example: https://www.jacionline.org/article/<wbr>S0091-6749(08)01185-8/fulltext", "time": 1673188243, "resto": 33787403, "trip": "!UNLEAVENS."}, {"no": 33791458, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)11:11:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33790807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33790807</a><br>Etsy is great for this stuff.", "time": 1673194314, "resto": 33787403}, {"no": 33792021, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)12:42:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "1 month into protocol and now i&#039;m starting to feel pain in the lymph node below my left ear.

I thought they were just stupid, but that&#039;s far too great a reduction. The reality is that they are more or less your garden variety conspiracy theory enthusiasts with a few noticeable differences. For one, they operate entirely emotionally. They literally don&#039;t care that none of their arguments stand up to scrutiny, because when you inevitably tear it down logically, that&#039;s just proof you are a fed or a disinfo agent etc. Another difference I have noticed is that many conspiracies emerge as what I would call an &quot;incentive rumor.&quot; Basically, everyone can agree there is more than enough incentive for something like Epstein getting killed before he blabs. Lots of conspiracies emerge because people will start speculating about precisely who the incentive belongs to and why. However, flat earth has no other incentive than something totally ridiculous like &quot;globe makers are taking your money!&quot; as if someone would create the most sophisticated conspiracy in existence just to keep raking in those fivers for the wish.com plastic globes. There&#039;s no logical incentive for their to even be a conspiracy.

In the afterlife you will feel heartbroken but relieved that you no longer have to live with the unbearable guilt.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more. I thought I accepted myself now that I&#039;m finally at peace with my body, only to feel lost again as spiritual experiences confront me with all sorts of sides of myself that I don&#039;t know how to reconcile. I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them. The irony is that I really just have to stop being afraid of myself.<br>I hope that you can overcome yourself, and your fear of men too. There is so much to gain in embracing people&#039;s unique strengths. By working together, we can create a better world; and for that, people have to be different. We have to accept who we are as individuals, and allow others to be, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no parts of men that are an improvement on the female form</span><br>What are you talking about? Men are beautiful. I love their strong muscles, how mature they look with all that facial and body hair, how tall they are.

The implication I&#039;d need a cage, I find insulting; there was no such impulse in me.

About 10 months ago, I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to frot with me, as I was deeply curious what male homosexuality is like, and I worried I&#039;d regret not at least trying it once while I still could. Touching it used to trigger my trauma, and I&#039;d break down crying and be unable to continue; but as I&#039;d recently had a breakthrough in meditation and overcame much of that, I wanted to explore the new possibilities in a positive way. He asked me to be on top since he wouldn&#039;t know what to do, so I lubed us both up, got on top of him, and began to grind my body against his. Having no refractory period and not being used to physical genital stimulation, I came 9 times before I got too tired and sore to continue.<br><br>As we cuddled afterwards, he said it felt very intimate, but not very pleasurable for him, and that he much prefers to stick his dick in of me. I think that&#039;s understandable, but I&#039;m glad I gave it a try; now I know that no matter how good it might feel, it&#039;s still not what I prefer either.<br>Similarly, 3 months before my surgery, I began to jerk off every day, out of principle. I wanted to prove to myself that I accept myself, and that I made my decision out of longing rather than hate. Yet I prefer the way my body is now so much.

But then I see her expressing those things that I couldn&#039;t accept about myself in such positive ways instead, and I begin to realise it was my fears that caused those sides of me to come out in the wrong ways in the past. When it&#039;s coming from her in such a calm and dignified manner, she makes it look so natural, and I realise I can be like that too.<br><br>What I thought to be so monstrous and feared, turned out to be womanhood; in the most unapologetic sense, unfiltered by society&#039;s expectations. It&#039;s embarrassing to admit that I got those things mixed up, and it&#039;s honestly a lot to take in. But as I come to understand her, and myself, the fear fades away.<br>Of course, men nor women are inherently good or bad. But people can get so lost as they misunderstand each other, and themselves in turn. If they feel ashamed of things that are perfectly natural, it saddens my heart. It&#039;s useful to know what&#039;s socially acceptable, but people mustn&#039;t lose themselves.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if that relates at all to the fear in your own heart, but I feel like I understand it in a way. As people idealise others from their own limited perspective, they&#039;re in fact rejecting the parts they don&#039;t understand; then if those misunderstandings are revealed, that can be very shocking or even frightening.<br><br><a href=\"#p33793029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33793029</a><br>I&#039;ve been on the fence, but if you recommend it, then I shall.

You misunderstand the nature of these beings. They aren&#039;t shapeshifters, they aren&#039;t evil shamanic witches, they aren&#039;t cannibals driven to madness, these are all (common) themes used to describe them.

It was almost impossible for me to even break eye contact with it and the fucker was a distance away and I was safe. Not locking eyes with it (if it&#039;s observing you through a window) has the benefit of preserving your mental health somewhat and if the damage thing can&#039;t really see you it&#039;ll probably get bored and leave.

It also could&#039;ve been a parasitic trickster entity duping him into worship. I guess I&#039;d have to experience myself to sus it out.<br><br>I like that image of dark entities being bugs.

It was very foggy out. I crested a hill way too fast not seeing over the hill. Just ahead in the middle of the road was a herd of deer. There was no way I was going to stop in time, I was on them in the time it took to move my foot from the gas to the brake. At the last second the deer parted like moses parting the red sea and I sailed right through the herd with deer inches away on each side. I hit the brakes by then and as I looked in the rearview, the red light lit up the fog and I saw deer scrambling left, right, every which way across the road, with no gap for a car.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another night (was foggy then too), I left a friends house after a party, was about 3 AM. I had to drive about 40+ miles home along a normally very busy highway. This is not an interstate, there are traffic lights, cross streets, bars, restaurants, shopping malls, etc... Now it was very late and foggy/miserable out, but I saw not one car the whole way. No one behind or in front of me, no one passing the other direction, no one waiting at traffic lights or cross traffic, not even a cop sitting somewhere. After a while I started looking down side streets as I passed just to see. There were 2 cars I saw sitting in parking lots with their headlights on. That was it. I travel this road all the time, every day and night, I&#039;ve never seen it that deserted even that late at night. And what&#039;s weird is, the road goes across state lines with a toll bridge in the middle. There are no toll booth people, it takes your picture and bills you or your EZ pass if you have it. But I never got billed for the toll.</span>", "time": 1673369648, "resto": 33792843}, {"no": 33806605, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)11:54:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33803007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33803007</a><br>It&#039;s in Bongistan lad.", "time": 1673369687, "resto": 33792843}, {"no": 33806653, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:02:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800015</a><br>I hope I never develop schizophrenia", "filename": "1668953896815691", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 351, "h": 359, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673370121557592, "time": 1673370121, "md5": "lgBtlaSGssIkr3mYsHO+ZA==", "fsize": 41779, "resto": 33792843}, {"no": 33806876, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)12:29:40", "name": "Poncho", "com": "<a href=\"#p33806467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33806467</a><br>That&#039;s why I like /x/.

I&#039;ve recently stumbled across a weird video genre on YouTube, involving the animation company &quot;Klasky Csupo&quot;.<br>Basically, the videos all consist in taking spots and animated logos and applying weird effects/filters, creating an awful result that I can&#039;t really find all that appealing. If this was one channel, I&#039;d understand, some nutcase is into this shit and can&#039;t stop making videos about it. The problem is that there&#039;s HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of channels that have a plethora of content with a small amount of views strictly dedicated to taking the same fucking logos and editing them, many times reuploading them for absolutely no audience. And the few that actually leave any comments or likes on the videos are channels that upload the same kind of content. Some are even dedicated to TEACH people on how to make these kinds of videos.<br>Another pattern that is common among these channels is they demand their audience to &quot;NOT SUBSCRIBE&quot;<br><br>Some examples:<br>https://www.youtube.com/@joeysgonoo<wbr>dlegetmoving9168/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@BritskyCsu<wbr>po<br>https://www.youtube.com/@lelonetwor<wbr>k<br>https://www.youtube.com/@cometario<br>https://www.youtube.com/@klaskycsup<wbr>oinstructionsthe4222<br>https://www.youtube.com/@FakerfaceF<wbr>an6238/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@PumpkabooT<wbr>ehEditsThingy755/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@xxfarmitfa<wbr>n330xxofficial/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@ChoksAmryi<wbr>nLikesFrance/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@TKCVES2022<wbr>/videos<br>https://www.youtube.com/@Robloxian7<wbr>97/videos<br><br>Who&#039;s watching this shit?

We feel like we are being watched when we pull up and park. A few minutes later, all we are doing is watching behind us (parked backwards to the woodline) and I see a pale white form standing out from the darkness. It&#039;s skin was like dry old dusty leather with varicose veins that are blue. I freak the fuck out and tell my friend to drive away. As we drive away me and him see the damn thing run across the road. It was incredibly fast and I saw it just barely long enough to make out its form.

I had a night light on and always had my radio on with the oldies channel on, so old boomer music from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s would be playing. So, I would awake in my racecar bed, which was facing the bedroom door and the only light would be from my night light, so pretty dim. I could see the hallway, the white walls were always a sorta nighttime blue hue and then blackness at the end of the hallway where the bathroom was with the stairs to the main floor off to the left. I would always be awake for a few moments and then I would hear voices coming from down stairs, like whispering voices, like mischievous they were up to no good. They would be talking coming to get me. Then I would hear running up the stairs and the three &quot;puppets&quot; from the show would come running from around the corner of the stairs into the hallway into my room to get me.

I was separated from my friends and family and fighting alongside a group of strangers. We had no uniforms, and there were women and unarmed people in our group. We looked like homeless people with guns. <br>Suddenly this huge, dark cloud of whirling flying machines comes over the horizon. It came up and over one of those big, steep hills like they have in San Francisco. Countless machines actually darkening the area with their shadows. They looked like the man hacks from Half Life 2. <br>There was so much fear and panic.<br>We started retreating inside this shitty looking building to hide. The windows were all boarded up and there were objects like mattresses and tables places against the walls and windows to make them thicker. <br>We understood somehow that the machines could see through walls and this was our crude effort to hide as deep inside the house as possible and avoid being seen.

I went into a room that was locked that I didn&#039;t have the key to, so I know I was AP and not sleepwalking or something.

Finally, after being unsatisfied with the performance of the other warlords, the Ming pulled the strings in favor of Mao from the post-WW2 conferences and agreements that eventually gave Mao, the chosen heir, the ability to take the throne back from his distant brothers.

Someone said no, but not much else.<br><br>So let me explain why I ask:<br><br>4 beings contacted me in my mind and energetic feeling when I was really high on weed a year and a half ago. 2 of which I was more drawn to. I was told to draw sigils for all 4 of them. They came out through automatic drawing to be pictographic and had their names on the outside like Goetia sigils. <br><br>One of the 2 I was drawn to had a sigil looked like a phallus ejaculating, and had energy of water and fire mixed together for transformation.<br><br>The other had a ghost woman with horns and a Trident pointed at a downward facing star with 5 candles on each point. She seemed to be about Earth, Moon and night energies.<br><br>They said they&#039;d help me or something, but I wasn&#039;t sure what they really were as there was no real major contact made in the first place and not much after.<br><br>Then I had a vision during meditation not related to the 4. Basically a white skinned human-like being with black eyes sat on a chair in front of a river at a cafe. He communicated with me telepathically and said he&#039;d &quot;download&quot; some information through the back of my head because I was seeking wisdom. I consented. A small energetic wave was felt and that was it. Not really abnormal. I thanked it and went to sleep.<br><br>Then a few months later I had the worst mental breakdown where I believed I was a Christian apostate that God decided to cast away for eternal damnation. I was weeping daily and begging Jesus and YHWH for forgiveness. Constantly in a state of fear and suffering. Childhood fear of damnation, sexuality, etc. Being brought up and I was being punished. Started going to church again, but then quickly realized that I was very Alien in my understanding because I could see esoteric patterns that no one else was able to see.

I decided to chant her name and she whispered to me and from there on I knew it wasn&#039;t a figment of my imagination. She was real. <br><br>But I was the one who wasn&#039;t contacting her and wasn&#039;t choosing the correct mediums to do so. I still don&#039;t really know how to correctly set up a good contact with her.<br><br>A few weeks after this, I had dreams where a woman, who was the same essence but different forms every time, was trying to follow me and get a peek at me but keeping her distance. <br><br>Then, more recently, I had a very vivid dream that felt like I was in a past life in a place (apparently real at one point) called Ugarit. There was a king who conjured 10-12 &quot;dakini&quot; spirits to help him build a ziggurat. During a narration cutscene in the dream, I learned one of them he decided to curse for some reason and she became known as the Infernal/cursed dakini. She would be violent and attack people apparently afterwards.<br><br>In the dream I decided to go to the door of the room where she was cursed which had mushrooms growing out of the center of the door, and hit the mushrooms off with a heavy cloth. Then I turned around and walked 200 ish meters away and turned back to look at the door and the dakini was there.

Each life is like a fresh new slate. When you die, all your debts, problems, anger, resentment, and most other emotions die with you.

Earth is a school, you come here to learn so the more you learn, the more you&#039;ll get out of it, the more you&#039;ll evolve. That&#039;s why souls who have harder lives are more evolved an mature souls. People with easy lives are weak and struggle more emotionally. No spirits are gonna help you get revenge because you yourself planned for the things you wanna get revenge for to happen to you. You put these lessons in your path to learn from. You need to figure out why you feel you need revenge. You probably just need closure, or to just speak with the person or people, then you&#039;d realize its probably not that serious. You can&#039;t go around trying to consult mediums or spirits with the intent of harming a person or doing something against their will cause it will tie you to that person karmically and you&#039;ll owe them karma that you&#039;ll have to come back and plan a whole other life with just to pay back. Do you wanna come back here an have a whole nother earth life just specifically for the purpose of paying some random person their karma back? No, you don&#039;t.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared.

Islam doesn&#039;t allow drinking alcohol. Islam doesn&#039;t allow premarital sex. It also makes you focus on what food you eat. Things like that can be very good for some people. It&#039;s a way of life, so there really is no &quot;end&quot; to it. The religion teaches that you build up good deeds through your daily salat or prayer. You also do this by giving, which is called Zakat. That is to say giving money to support Islamic causes. Or support poor Muslims. There&#039;s also the discipline of fasting on the month of Ramadan, which is when the Quran was revealed to Muhammad. Muslims also tend to say things like &quot;alaihi salaam&quot; when mentioning a prophet and &quot;Sallahu alaihi wa sallam&quot; when mentioning Muhammad. Also &quot;Subhan wa Ta&#039;ala&quot; when they mention Allah.

The thing about the Psalms, is that it&#039;s &quot;easier&quot; than LoA. You don&#039;t deny anything in the 3D. You accept that you have problems, and you bring those problems to the wisdom of the Psalms to fix. Much easier to wrap your head around, in my opinion. They&#039;re also flexible, in that you can mix whatever process you want with them, like visualization of the end goal, or even just writing down what you want (preferably in past tense of having accomplished/received it).<br><br>Do you know about the Purification Psalms? They&#039;re a set of 7 Psalms - 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, and 143. You use them for when you have big problems in your life, and feel overwhelmed. As a personal testimony, whenever I use these Psalms, I become unfazed by anything. I feel practically bulletproof. Traditionally, you go through one of them a day, until you do the whole set, and you can rinse and repeat each week. Just keep doing that process until things get solved or until you&#039;re mentally clear. If you do feel choked on time, maybe do two a day, probably spaced out though by at least a couple of hours.

I guess pushing through makes sense, I went hard on mental diet for the month before the bad news, but as soon as I got it, I gave up. I appreciate the perspective. If I were more in touch with these ideas at that time, I should&#039;ve treated it less like a full-out failure and more like a quirky delay. Didn&#039;t know about the psalms then either. And since you&#039;re mentioning these particular psalms, I&#039;m thinking you&#039;re the person who told me about them in the first place when I asked for help recently with the family member&#039;s health. Those were the ones I did! Worked great. Absolute day and night between how things are now and how they were then, you would not believe it. And it ended up I didn&#039;t do anything physically. (I took some 3d actions before the psalms with no real results, for comparison). Just resolved by itself. Tho in retrospect, I should&#039;ve stuck with the psalms longer, not for the outcome, but just to keep the mental momentum.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;maybe do two a day, probably spaced out though by at least a couple of hours.</span><br>I feel like I might still have the time to do them 1 per day but I like the idea of repeating them every few hours, seems like a good way to keep the right awareness throughout the day.<br><a href=\"#p33804448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804448</a><br>Different anon.

Just a few weeks ago I was trying to manifest more friends and some guy dm\u2019d and told me one of his friends were looking for people to hangout with while doing our hobby. On the day we hung out another person I know and have hung out a few times came over and gave me their number so we can hang out later granted it was a nice day out in the middle of winter so obviously people are going to be outside. But I\u2019ve seen this person so many times and they never offered to hangout outside of the general area before up until then. And then a few days later I was trying to manifest my friends showing more interest in me the next day a few of them texted me to see what I was up too. Other things I \u201cmanifested\u201d were a job (that I applied to and interviewed for) but what I tried to manifest was an easy interview with no leetcode and guess what\u2026 there was no technical portion and I was hired. For my apartment i scripted that I wanted an apt with huge windows, under a certain budget with good location and up until I scripted that I had been looking for months with no luck. Shortly after I found exactly what I was looking for. So yeah that is my experience with loa so far.

If anything&#039;s not done, put it on the next day&#039;s list, and move it up to prioritize it.<br><br>This will give you a very objective look at your capabilities. If you&#039;re on the right track, you&#039;ll end up with a bunch of blessings to be thankful for, that you can point to with confidence like &quot;yeah, I did that!&quot;, and build positive momentum in your practice.

I&#039;m afraid we&#039;re losing the real virtues of living life passionately, sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the ability to make something of yourself and feeling good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it&#039;s a philosophy of despair. But I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre once interviewed said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. But one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance of feeling on top of it. It&#039;s like your life is yours to create. I&#039;ve read the postmodernists with some interest, even admiration. But when I read them, I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more that you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility, he&#039;s not talking about something abstract. He&#039;s not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians would argue about. It&#039;s something very concrete. It&#039;s you and me talking. Making decisions. Doing things and taking the consequences. It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting. Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms. Makes a difference to other people and it sets an example. In short, I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off and see ourselves as the victim of various forces. It&#039;s always our decision who we are.", "time": 1673408216, "resto": 33810478}, {"no": 33811042, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:37:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the nobody is not addicted to weed. he might be addicted to sleeping but he never gets enough of it anyways so it doesnt even matter.", "time": 1673408272, "resto": 33810478}, {"no": 33811043, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:37:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33811033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33811033</a><br>You&#039;re both dead.", "time": 1673408273, "resto": 33810478}, {"no": 33811046, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:38:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the cross is me", "filename": "1672420859850584", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 334, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1673408285372251, "time": 1673408285, "md5": "KILY+S/9pGO84LxueZpYHw==", "fsize": 6958, "resto": 33810478}, {"no": 33811055, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:39:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33811025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33811025</a><br>Mine is.. <br><a href=\"#p33811035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33811035</a><br>What does existentialism have to do with france in particular?

As intelligence piles on intelligence, as ability piles on ability, the speed changes. Until what? Until we reach a crescendo in a way could be imagined as an enormous instantaneous fulfillment of human? human and neo-human potential. It could be something totally different.

But things are not based on nothing, everything is based on consciousness, we can be sure of this because our own existence is the only thing we can know for sure, everything else might be an illusion but an &quot;I&quot; must exist. We may disagree on the definition of consciousness of course, but at the end of the day it must be conceded that there is some kind of awareness that exists.

You know what HUMAN SIZED SPIDERS would prey on? HUMANS. This is a great explanation of why the CIA is a despicable organization who&#039;s ethical boundaries are inherently flawed and evil. The CIA are literally HUMAN SIZED SPIDERS that ENTRAP HUMANS in their web via blackmail, extortion, organized crime, etc. Do you know see the problem?

I didn&#039;t even consider the aspect in regards to the symbolic need for light when intelligence gathering, analysing, etc. That was a pretty big revelation that you brought to me, honestly. Now, as far as how they abide by ethics law and morality, it&#039;s definitely questionable. At the very least, much of the material they classify is only Classified because of &quot;how the information was obtained&quot;, according to what I&#039;ve heard. Now, what we already know about the organization is very sadistic to put it mildly, but to classify documents because of how the information in them was obtained certainly brings up questions.

Lets say, for example, if the CIA had gathered information on an American citizen that would be considered &quot;privileged information&quot;, such as receiving information about the person from a doctor, a lawyer, etc. This would certainly be illegal under any American court if they ever found out. The information received by the CIA about said American citizen would have to undergo mandatory classification and compartmentalization, simply because if it was ever revealed to the courts or the American public that the CIA had intentionally obtained privileged information via illegal means, there would be outcry, possible legal action, and a risk for a decrease in funding.", "time": 1673383839, "resto": 33806576}, {"no": 33808322, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)15:57:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33806576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33806576</a><br>I&#039;m personally pretty repelled by spiders due to a few childhood traumas in Florida (little known fact, they have actual Skulltulas in Florida) but I never kill them unless they&#039;re directly intruding upon my space, and even then I usually try to relocate them first.

I was either put back into a state of mindlessness through a device I can only describe through noise or Jesus truly shielded me. I am at my wits end. I cannot function here.

The book from the thread gives instructions on how to achieve orgasm without loosing semen. One of it&#039;s main excercises (called the Cool Draw) consists of drawing the energy from the dick (lol) to the tailbone and then through the spine to the back of the head, circulating it there and finally putting it into &#039;storage&#039; around the belly.<br>I was interested, did the excercise a couple of times and it felt good. But I also found out that it shares a simillar feature with one Kundalini excercise I randomly stumbled upon browsing /x/ \u2013 drawing energy to the base of the head. The book&#039;s author doesn&#039;t go in-depth on what one&#039;s really doing with himself or it&#039;s side effects. I thought that it&#039;s not wise for me to continue doing something that I know very little about.<br>But, during the excercises I&#039;ve done, I could feel the tail bone get very warm. At first I thought it&#039;s just the energy I generated using sexual stimulation, but even now I can think about that spot and it&#039;s just getting warm by itself.<br><br><a href=\"#p33766613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766613</a><br>Hey, thanks for bumping :)", "filename": "12714", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 423, "h": 951, "tn_w": 55, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672932993220946, "time": 1672932993, "md5": "ZpRLbRuGTt/43IuPi0GzRA==", "fsize": 96122, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768645, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamp", "filename": "12823", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 486, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672950438361858, "time": 1672950438, "md5": "hLs5d4OM6Vsma2pgGFvfiA==", "fsize": 164378, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768753, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:54:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33766490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766490</a><br><a href=\"#p33767199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767199</a><br>I always visualized it as currents/fields flowing in/around me.

A lot of people today awaken kundalini unintentionally, either spontaneously or as a result of a extreme emotional or trauma response. It can happen even without intentional intervention or preparation. You could also practice some kundalini awakening meditations without sufficient energetic awareness, which is why generally you&#039;ll see a warning on these techniques to make sure to wait a week or two before trying an awakening technique a second time. Now, releasing kundalini energy is kind of like peeling one petal of an infinite and immortal flower - when people without energetic awareness do this, they may not necessarily feel it, so they think &quot;oh huh, that didn&#039;t work, let&#039;s try again&quot;. So they do it ten more times, and then spend ten years in a psychiatric hospital because they&#039;re flooded their system with way more energy than it could reasonably handle, manage and use up, like flooding an electrical appliance with ten times the electricity it needs - it won&#039;t work &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot;, it&#039;ll just break down. Kundalini awakening is about purging, optimising and only gradually flowing stronger energy through your energy system. Kundalini will give you more than plenty for this purpose even without manually releasing petal after petal. Doing that would be like blowing up a dam and standing in the way of the rushing water.", "time": 1673061772, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33779692, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33777641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33777641</a><br><a href=\"#p33779600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779600</a><br>Some further advice I can give. First, I would recommend that you look through the Traditionalist school authors. They are very reliable people and if you understand their works you will have a frame of reference to distinguish sound knowledge on these subjects from bad info. Evola is also included, particularly his spiritual books, even though the wikipedia editors have excluded him for some reason. Not all of the stuff you see on kundalini will be the best, because there was nothing like the flow of information back then that we have now. The principles are perennial, however, and will help guide you.<br>Second, about energy. The terminology is kind of ambiguous and can have slightly different connotations, but generally, energy, chi and prana are loosely equivalent. For a breakdown on energy (specifically chi), you can check out Damo Mitchell&#039;s Intro to Daoist Nei Gong. He has a section on this that you may find useful. I think that&#039;s a book I can probably mention on /x/ with clear conscience. <br>As to the difference between energy-as-such and kundalini energy in particular, it comes down to this: the energetic level is a kind of subtler level of the physical (or the physical is a denser level of the energetic if you prefer). This energetic level is kind of superimposed on top of your body and you rely on it for a lot of your normal functioning. This applies to all people. Kundalini energy is a special energy - it is the transcendent force, and it has a purpose and a goal which, once awakened, it pursues without pause, even if you suddenly have second thoughts. This transcendent force aims to help you overcome your conditioned existence, purge your energy system (which involves a lot of emotional/trauma releasing since those are stored as energy, and it also involves kriyas), and finally, when the process is complete and it fully develops your 7th chakra, you receive a strong connection to the divine, and enlightenment.", "time": 1673062549, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33781143, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33779609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779609</a><br>I also warned out not opening kundalini before being ready ITT but kundalini yoga is popular and it&#039;s very much about trying to bring the energy up, practiced by everyone as if it&#039;s a synonym for yoga.

The problem is that just giving this advice to people is not all that helpful because a total newbie will not be able to distinguish the legitimate teacher from the huckster.

As says the Commentary:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men had not created evil yet in those days of bliss and purity, for they were of God-like more than of human nature.</span><br>But when mankind, rapidly increasing in numbers, increased also in variety of idiosyncrasies of body and mind, then incarnated Spirit showed its weakness. Natural exaggerations, and along with these superstitions, arose in the less cultured and healthy minds. Selfishness was born out of desires and passions hitherto unknown, and but too often knowledge and power were abused, until finally it became necessary to limit the number of those who knew. Thus arose Initiation.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every separate nation now arranged for itself a religious system, according to its enlightenment and spiritual wants. Worship of mere form being discarded by the wise men, these confined true knowledge to the very few. The need of veiling truth to protect it from desecration becoming more apparent with every generation, a thin veil was used at first, which had to be gradually thickened according to the spread of personality and selfishness, and this led to the Mysteries. They came to be established in every country and among every people, while to avoid strife and misunderstanding exoteric beliefs were allowed to grow up in the minds of the profane masses. Inoffensive and innocent in their incipient stage\u2014like a historical event arranged in the form of a fairy tale, adapted for and comprehensible to the child\u2019s mind\u2014in those distant ages such beliefs could be allowed to grow and make the popular faith without any danger to the more philosophical and abstruse truths taught in the sanctuaries.\u201d</span><br><br>\u2014 H.P.
