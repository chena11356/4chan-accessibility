And that you can use the same powerful imagination to manifest any desire.<br>You confirm the validity of his teachings by doing so. No one cares about a ladder, and that&#039;s the point. It is necessary for some but not all.<br><br>The experiment also has a hidden meaning related to Jacob&#039;s ladder.<br>Let Neville explain:<br>Have you ever thought that when Jacob placed his head upon the rock he made contact with eternity? Or that the ladder he saw was Christ? Just think of it: when you put your head on a pillow tonight and close your eyes to this world, you are really on your skull, making contact with God&#039;s power and wisdom, the mediator between human nature and divinity! That is the true ladder of Jacob. Dwell on it, for I tell you it is true.

I think Shinto is based on the old Canaanite religion and Egyptian mythos. I am really happy, because through this study I felt relief in knowing that Yahweh is not the only god in this world, and before that people worshipped the gods the similar way Japanese people do today.

With that said, Abrahamists are retarded, so they decided to demonize the left face of God by calling it &quot;Satan&quot;. Shiva himself though is too enlightened to care about our opinions of him, so he&#039;ll gladly manifest in the west as Lucifer to bring about knowledge and enlightenment to those in the west who seek these things but are unaware of eastern archetypes causing many westerners to gravitate to the western idea of the God of the left hand path.<br><br>Basically, he shows up where he&#039;s needed in whatever form we perceive him as, and he brings knowledge and enlightenment with him, even if dumb Abrahamists consider knowledge to somehow be &quot;evil&quot;.", "time": 1669637333, "resto": 33476649}], "last_modified": 1669637333}, {"no": 33477031, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)02:39:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s the esoteric/paranormal implication behind getting tinnitus even tho you got checked and you don&#039;t have damaged ear drums?", "filename": "b8dd73496563797e1b8a5b1c4ecf2bc1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 736, "h": 920, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669621191530478, "time": 1669621191, "md5": "8bik1JJAC1wecEei+4+IyA==", "fsize": 277588, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-the-esotericparanormal-implication-behind", "replies": 10, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 33477953, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)06:11:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33477031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33477031</a><br>Sound travels on frequencies.

First, the stores devolved into empty, boxed plexiglass rooms. Then the NPC shoppers disappeared altogether, along with the mall&#039;s sound &amp; ambiance, and then the security guard shortly after. <br><br>At this point, I stopped running - but that&#039;s when sheer terror began to set in as I could help shake off this innate, instinctual feeling of &quot;their&quot; presence. That &quot;they&quot; knew and were in the process of tracking me down or ending the dream altogether. Regardless, my mind was in some sort of &quot;fight or flight&quot; animal state of sheer terror and I continued trudging forward - though doing a mix of panicked jogging-and fast walking instead of sprinting. Even then, the complex&#039;s interior continued to deteriorate. The color of the walls transitioned from a chrome-white to a dull, grey chrome. The night-sky windows vanished, removing any traces of an outside world. The empty, blank plexiglass shops disappeared - were then replaced by said chrome walls. The interior&#039;s lighting began to dim a little bit more- yet everything was still quite visable without any discernable light sources.

They get into a crouching position and attempt to surround me from all angles. Their movements are swift and graceful, but also give off a &quot;mechanical&quot; gait.

I&#039;ve been a bit suicidal, in regards for desperation of control or agency over my state of being. Though I am aware of the fact that if this ISN&#039;T just a material universe, this is a very bad idea. I am still lucid enough to understand that placing such a decision on what amounts to a coinflip is less than wise, and the pain I cause my loved ones is not something I can leave this world knowing I am to blame for. Suffice to say, suicide is off the table for the forseeable future. Which means I must confront these thoughts and in doing so I am asking for your help. A bit of wisdom, some new perspectives maybe. I am so anxious about my life ending and the concept of existing forever because none of these things are congruent with my value systems and finite human psyche. I feel like my mind is fracturing or something, like the stress of such revelations has broken some deeper part of me.
