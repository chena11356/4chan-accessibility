Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience. It&#039;s like having the TV turned to static and just letting it sit like that forever. Giving your mind an object to focus on and refine, such as the breath &quot;energy&quot;, gets you deeper.<br><br>But being aware of those things is crucial - you just need to stop giving them input if they&#039;re causing too much movement or darker states of mind. Instead of seeing thoughts just as some things which happen, see how they arise due to things within your control (your volitional thoughts and way of seeing things, posture, etc). Learn to use those things to relax the body while brightening and stilling the mind. <br><br>Once you&#039;ve become absorbed in the body, things are much more clearer and expansive.

Just to get a sense of things. Then I put a little more attention to the breathing and feel it out for tight spots and softer spots. In general the quality of the breath is connected to certain feelings, emotions, thought patterns etc, which may need to be addressed specifically, but sometimes just working with the breath to soothe it and the body is helpful enough. Naturally the body kind of relaxes and the mind gets quieter and more steady.<br><br>This is how I do it after a long time of struggling with that balance (although I can&#039;t say it&#039;s totally &quot;solved&quot; as there is always more room for refinement). At the beginning I was just kind of watching the mind as it is, then after like two years of that I realized I was going nowhere and tried to get a little more methodical. At that point I began to try too hard and get too uptight, so I gradually just began to realize that being observant and &quot;doing&quot; things worked hand in hand. One important thing for me was realizing that much of what we want in meditation are the results. But you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; results, instead you do things which bring results.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

You cannot &quot;reverse&quot; it since it is literally gene therapy. Keep in mind that because the vaccine is experimental, so are the proposed solutions for it - that also means the effects they mitigate are only the ones that we know about so far.<br>1) All of the below should be done as soon after exposure as possible. The longer you wait, the less effective they are.<br>2) Aspirin. First 7 days, 160-240mg twice per day. After first 7 days, 80-160mg twice per day. Morning and night - keeping your blood thinner is important in the prevention of clotting causing stroke or severe loss of circulation. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH ACETAMINOPHEN OR IBUPROFEN.<br>3) Ivermectin. If you source from veterinary products (e.g. horse paste), you use the dose measurement it comes according to your weight as closely as possible. Put a small amount on your lips and wait for 1 hr to ensure you have no adverse reactions to the flavorings or preservatives in it. <br>Take 1 dose per day for 3 days. Repeat monthly for 3-6 months. You should also take 1 dose per day for 3-5 days should you get sick with COVID, vaxxed or not.<br>3) Vitamins C, D, K and Zinc. Really you can just take a daily vitamin but pay attention to the amounts because you&#039;ll want at least 120%. Note: If you are a woman and the vax hasn&#039;t rendered you infertile, you should NOT take vitamin C in high amounts while pregnant or trying to become pregnant.<br>4) Pumpkin seed oil. Promotes better circulation and heart health. Take daily and consider it part of your daily vit regimen.<br>5) Garlic, ginger and thyme. Concentrated tablets or oils daily. Helps prevent and treat respiratory illnesses (which you are now more susceptible to) and promotes better circulation.<br>6) Avoid long periods of sitting down and high-intensity exercise.

The most recent research is showing that exposure to sunlight and IR are surprisingly effective against COVID; this includes the spike proteins from the vaccine. This is not purely because of vitamin D, but it helps with that too. Try to be outside at least 1 hr per day - taking a daily walk would nail two birds with one stone by getting the low-intensity activity you need for better circulation.<br>9) Resveratrol. A powerful antioxidant that also helps combat the cell damage resulting from inflammation caused by the vaccine.

Antibodies don&#039;t matter for shit because all the action for these two is in the cellular immune system. You can know in advance how bad someone will catch COVID based on their T cell counts. Big pharma approached the vax as if COVID was like most respiratory viruses, completely disregarding how it actually interacted in the body. So they opted flood everyone with their artificial approach to antibodies.<br>You have specialized T cells with specific roles. One of them attacks viruses by slicing them up into tiny pieces. Another specialized T cell will dispose of them. The specific way the vaccine&#039;s proteins were designed is disrupting the entire process; those disposing T cells aren&#039;t picking up the slices left behind, and their shape allows them to hook onto each other. Their shape is also very irritating (COVID protein is in general). <br>So basically, you have a recipe for insane clots that is also the equivalent to sandpaper flowing through your veins, and the vaccine just programmed your cells to produce insane amounts of it. It continuously builds up in your system, causes inflammation, clots...and because your T cells are so preoccupied with this chaos, your immune system is now shot. Ironically, the better your immune system is, the more this problem compounds.<br>Anywhere your blood goes these splices can damage.

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

I tried it once but the pump was sending in a fine mist of pump oil and I couldn&#039;t stand it. Our solution was to take one of those snorkel tubes and stuff it full of rags to filter out the oil. The spot we chose to test it out was a decent size pond that connected up to the drainage system of a newly constructed shopping center/strip mall type place. My friend goes in with the new filter and he is going right towards the large black plastic corrugated drainage tube. all of a sudden, the tubing jerks and a whole bunch of bubbles blast out of the water. the line, still belching air, was separated from the snorkel and my friend was gone. He had gotten sucked into the drainage tube sideways and was blocking the flow like a log jam. Some how he got loose but when he did he got sucked down the drainage tube out to where it opens up into a ditch by the street. Miraculously, he was able to hold his breath and come out alive at the other end. From Our perspective, he had just disappeared and he didn&#039;t come back up. We went in looking around the edge of the pond trying to find him, hoping that he was just playing a joke and that he had swam away unseen somehow. It didn&#039;t make sense but we where so desperate and scared we couldn&#039;t understand at the time. Minutes since he disappeared, two police came and hollered at us, and when we looked over, our friend was with them. He was wearing his shirt tied up around his waste, tied up like a loincloth, with a decent gash across his chest from where he was pressed up against the pipe. Later, he recalled that his pants had been torn off, and he was gasping for air, half naked, in a huge rocky ditch where the police happened to see him as they where driving by. Nothing can describe the terror I felt when I realized that he wasn&#039;t going to come back up.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project. The point is creating as much stress as possible within the subconscious, resulting in powerful subconscious motivation to AP, which is especially important because it&#039;s highly probable that right now you&#039;re subconsciously resistant to AP. <br><br>What techniques you use in combination with this isn&#039;t super important, it&#039;s only important that you practice them as often as possible. What&#039;s most likely going to happen is you&#039;re going to fall asleep at some point during this process and your subconscious will do the work for you, you&#039;ll wake up right into the mind awake body asleep/vibratory stage and that&#039;s when the work you&#039;ve put towards practicing separation will be most useful", "time": 1673721418, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840856, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1673734509, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840909, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:21:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The laws of physics are almost exactly like The Matrix.<br>The only question is if our matrix is naturally occurring or a technological construct.<br>Mind over matter physics is considered to be fact.<br>Manifestation, levitation, teleportation, telekinesis, remote viewing, and other abilities.<br>The brain is an electromagnetic quantum computer.<br>There are higher dimensions that interface with consciousness, a holographic God singularity.<br>There are considered native beings in these higher dimensions, interdimensional beings, demons.<br>We can enter the higher dimensions using astral projection, and physically using UFOs.<br>There are considered to be extraterrestrials with similar technology to our own.<br>Artificial intelligence and synthetic telepathy are considered to be advanced and active.<br>UFOs are powered by zero-point energy and propulsed by electromagnetic gravitics.<br>They are considered to have mind over matter physics domination systems.<br>Get ready to astral project!<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCe<wbr>66Vz6v8E", "filename": "hyperspace", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 679, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673734871886062, "time": 1673734871, "md5": "50++o/B0othSSc2bhdfoTQ==", "fsize": 261556, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840929, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:24:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "had another experience, first in a few months, where after waking up i felt strong vibrations and lightness of body. this time i also had vision, though not through physical eyes i think, a bit more abstract and less detailed. when i moved my hands in the air in front of my face, i saw they were glowing with faint blue light. afterwards i moved my arms back and tried opening my eyes for real - this time i was back in the waking world and my arm placement was completely different from before.<br><br>what techniques should i try if random experiences like this are my only tangible successes? does Raduga describe similar things?", "time": 1673735051, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33841003, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what he hell happened to me?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;managed to AP once last year but quit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now trying again but struggling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drank a lil, went to bed early</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;woke up after 3 hrs, decided to try to go back to sleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for some reason end up on my back</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suddenly entire body vibrating strongly</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;completely physically paralyzed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtfishappening.ogg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mentally enter (1) state and manage to push through it and sit up</span><br><br>I know I am trying to AP but how did this happen?

The orbiting clocks also pass through that field at a rate of three kilometers per second \u2014 their orbital speed. For that reason, they tick 7,000 nanoseconds a day slower than stationary clocks.<br><br>To offset these two effects, the GPS engineers reset the clock rates, slowing them down before launch by 39,000 nanoseconds a day. They then proceed to tick in orbit at the same rate as ground clocks, and the system \u201cworks.\u201d Ground observers can indeed pin-point their position to a high degree of precision. In (Einstein) theory, however, it was expected that because the orbiting clocks all move rapidly and with varying speeds relative to any ground observer (who may be anywhere on the Earth\u2019s surface), and since in Einstein\u2019s theory the relevant speed is always speed relative to the observer, it was expected that continuously varying relativistic corrections would have to be made to clock rates. This in turn would have introduced an unworkable complexity into the GPS. But these corrections were not made.

He was a son of the raja of Venkatagiri, who had got to know Sai Baba early his career and wished to invite him to his palace. He ordered his son to fetch him, but Gopal refused, saying he had no interest in gurus or swamis. That night he woke from a dream shortly after falling asleep. Sai Baba had come to him and brought him a delicious mango, which he loved. The dream changed everything: Gopal quickly got dressed and set out with his attendants, arriving at Puttaparthi at lunchtime the following day. As they approached they saw Sai Baba standing on the other side of the river, and before they could speak, Sai Baba said: \u2018The mango made you run here\u2019.

Sai Baba visited a house of a family where a young girl was ill, suddenly appearing in the doorway. He initiated a sacred ceremony in which religious hymns were sung; family members and neighbours all taking part. It was assumed that Sai Baba had been visiting Kerala, and had taken the opportunity to stop by the family\u2019s house. But afterwards it was discovered this was not the case: at this time he had been visiting in the palace of the raja of Venkatagiri on the east coast of India.

To some degree its events may have affected you or people you know in ways they don&#039;t even understand. In the last week I&#039;ve mostly caught onto vibes from dragon beings in meditations; a deep foreboding grief that wordlessly told of an unspeakable amount of suffering inflicted by them upon others and of others upon them. It promptly adjusted my view of them. I can see the past being the past, but it is sobering and not entirely surprising if one contemplates the nature of conflict. As above so below. <br><br>In any case, I&#039;ve been helped by other anons, please consider setting your antennas in meditation to your feelings and relations with these beings. And as with all conflicts: folks form their groups and alliances and when digging deep enough I think everyone here on Earth can find their roots in it: for dark and light. This requires time, reflection and timing. Sometimes a particular thread or word can already trigger something in you: catch it and hold it.<br>1. Some folk on Earth or beyond have been subject to ethereal assault. They tend to struggle with spiritual connections, healthy astral projection and/or sense of self or past recall. No processing without awareness.<br>2. Your experience and recall are non-linear. You can increase linearity of events by sharing what you know and reaching consensus with your fellow souls. Inconsistent or incomplete information may be eliminated over time. <br>3. The dragon&#039;s impulse to settle the grief was immensely strong and felt like a focus point. Personal grief cannot flow without understanding and confrontation. There might be things you don&#039;t want to remember, especially ethereal abuse, but without going through it it&#039;ll just stay a blockage.

A key-word in the clusterfuck was escalation and growing ever more merciless. But from what I&#039;ve felt, all sides have done things they have regretted. What&#039;s important is that whoever has been affected by these matters is able to put into words for themselves what the consequences are to self and others. I&#039;ve met a sister in the higher planes who quarelled with me until we settled our differences. I&#039;ve met a dragon who&#039;s mother I had killed.

Your perspective is more limited here, so don&#039;t be quick. Some things do not deserve forgiveness or acceptance from the get go. It&#039;s a process that you need to give time. But don&#039;t cheat and take the easy road. Trust your gut, use your brain and listen at heart for the right emotion to come loose: that&#039;s when you&#039;ve resolved it.<br>6. Some spirits want to be heard, others want to rage, others want understanding. It takes time and listening. Most that come to you will show that in their own way.<br>7. There is no such thing as innocence. Each soul involved has their blemishes; you won&#039;t know yours until it&#039;s time. You also don&#039;t know if some actions were made with full lucidity, freedom or indoctrination. Take ownership, but be real. If you feel you were wronged or attacked: don&#039;t be sorry for it. Do be open to radiate the grief that it happened at all.

Your chart is pretty well integrated though. It indicates you&#039;ve got good luck with relationships and bad luck with money. Jupiter and Moon in Aries 1st house - conjunct the ascendant as well - suggest you&#039;re in tune with your emotions and are charismatic and a real presence. Aries is the go-getter sign that wants to go crazy and get shit done, so you may manifest strong tendencies of that type. Mars, the ascendant ruler, is in exaltation in Capricorn 10th house, so you&#039;re driven to succeed in public life/career and have a lot of energy to do so, and to push through difficulties with a serious and strategic approach, aiming at full success.<br>The Scorpio placements look weakest to me, since they are in the 8th house. Since the sun marks central themes in life and Mercury represents the mind, it is possible that this is why you relate with your Scorpio placements. I think your Aries and Capricorn placements look a lot more defining, however.<br><a href=\"#p33886592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33886592</a><br>She&#039;s got bad luck with money and worse luck with relationships (shame on you anon! kek).

She&#039;ll either become some materialistic science bugwoman (but a successful one) or she might develop good and articulate views on spirituality, especially with her 9th house in Virgo. 9th house might mean being drawn to higher education or learning, to God, or to exotic/different/distant things. So either she&#039;ll specialise in dealing with foreign/er stuff, or with intellectual topics. Honestly I am kind of envious of that 9th house wtf, a Jupiter cazimi. Fucking really.

That is my main question but read on if you want to read an entire blogpost of schizo context: <br>Last year I had a serious spiritual awakening that turned my life upside down. I found out I was rh-negative, which I mention only because I believe it to be relevant to the things happening to me. <br>tldr, by the end of this awakening period, I noticed a &quot;them&quot; watching me, and as a result, they noticed me noticing them, and now &quot;they&quot; have taken an interest in me myself and I -- to the point where hyperdimensional forces have become a daily occurrence in my life. Not that I am complaining, as my character and life have improved, but basically these hyperdimensional forces will not leave me alone now. I believe &quot;they&quot; are the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. It makes the most sense in the context of my ancestry. <br>Anyway, now, &quot;they&quot; are acting as a subtle guiding intelligence in my life. I think am being called for something, but a prerequisite for this calling is personal self-mastery. I have been receptive to this call. I managed to fix my diet, quit porn, and fixed almost every relationship in my life. Sounds great, but there is one final &quot;addiction&quot; that I have not managed to quit. <br>It is my Vyvanse prescription, which I took for ADHD, but realized that this so-called &quot;ADHD&quot; was largely the product of limiting beliefs and an entirely normal human aversion to capitalist hustle culture. <br>The problem is all those years taking it has created a powerful thoughtform that manifests in this mistaken belief that I need something external in order to exercise my will and get a lot of &quot;work&quot; done. I no longer take it every day, but once in a while I will have a moment of weakness and take one, which makes me feel like I failed even though it is an infrequent thing. <br><br>(*) HOW TO DEFEAT POWERFUL THOUGHFORMS?", "filename": "boxing shadows", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 792, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 193, "tim": 1674186589631752, "time": 1674186589, "md5": "gHMwKaNbJKd7c1k+uCn53Q==", "fsize": 128864, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-master-exercising-ones-will", "replies": 8, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 33885804, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)22:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why not use this opportunity to exercise your will? there&#039;s the possibility that you can turn this constant battle into an engine for you to power yourself with.", "filename": "engine room", "ext": ".png", "w": 1005, "h": 625, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 77, "tim": 1674186836208956, "time": 1674186836, "md5": "+ukAtAnujBTHmEuUXLVgZQ==", "fsize": 1370061, "resto": 33885776}, {"no": 33885989, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:23:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33885804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33885804</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s the possibility that you can turn this constant battle into an engine for you to power yourself with.</span><br>How tho", "time": 1674188589, "resto": 33885776}, {"no": 33886013, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)23:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33885776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33885776</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I continually find myself creating and fighting thoughtforms without intending to</span><br>That&#039;s because you&#039;re falling for the trap.

I&#039;m getting schooled by the masterminds. I&#039;m learning alot. <br><br>Specifically how well this protocol works on biofilms. Holy shit is all I can say. The white strings you are seeing in the bowl are from a combination of NAC and Oregano. It&#039;s a combo attack, a super dragon punch right into their apartment complex. <br><br>Less than 0.1mg/ml of NAC and Oregano are required to detach some mature biofilms. NAC basically opens the windows and doors and Oregano is the gasoline thrown in so they can&#039;t escape. <br><br>I never thought it would be possible to do everything with 3 compounds, but I&#039;m looking at it right now. This is truly amazing. <br><br>The last few days I spent on mycotoxins and I understand why the dose in the morning of NAC is doubled. Glutathione depletion is a common attack vector, especially with Ochratoxin, and NAC becomes a protective shield against our DNA damage. It reduces it so much at that dosage that the body goes into surplus and begins repairing things. NAC actually repairs the guanine then protects it, so that it can repair longterm damage. The thiol form is invaluable to these repairs and also for scavenging candida&#039;s mycotoxins, so there are two reasons NAC is invaluable over cysteine or l-cysteine. <br><br>When the science section is complete, a second pdf will be created.

You don&#039;t identify with religions or religious figures anymore. You can&#039;t call yourself a &quot;christian&quot; and say you&#039;re enlightened or a new ager because No, you&#039;re still identifying with man made belief systems. Enlightenment is when you stop identifying with man made belief systems. So I&#039;m not gonna call myself a christian, or a muslim, or a mormon or anything that was created by a man. The people that made scientology knew religion was bad but they also knew that humans Want to identify with something, they wanna go somewhere and congregate and feel as if they are worshipping something. So they took the new age and applied christian principles to it. So it&#039;s new age theology but you still go to church or a meeting on Sunday like christians go to church. You still donate to it like you would a church, they have jobs and classes and clubs and everything that a church would have. But the thing is, Church is Bad, Religion is Bad. We&#039;re falling out of religion. So since they polluted the new age or enlightenment or true spiritual teachings and sacred knowledge by mixing it with christianity it failed and they look like fucking weirdos. If they wouldn&#039;t have tried to profit off of it LIKE CHURCHES DO then it wouldn&#039;t have failed and people would actually take them serious. Spirituality is not for sale and that is one of the main reasons religion is failing, money. I&#039;d rather go to a church with a pastor that has a job and tells his congregation NOT to give him money. This is why if you bring up meditation or auras or chakras or aliens to a christian they won&#039;t even let you talk about it, they dont even want to hear it because they aren&#039;t supposed to be mixed, whatever the truth is mixed with will fail.

They have children and their children are their kind, not ours. They are witty, rich, clever, poor, dumb like we who are from Adam. They resemble us in every way. Just as one says: man is the image of God, that is, he has been made after his image\u2014in the same way one can also say: these people are the image of man and made after his image.

They are not spirits and it is a mistake to call them elemental spirits, for they have bodies that resemble that of man. They have two of man\u2019s bodies, the elemental and the sidereal ones. &gt;This explains why they too eat food and feel the urge to reproduce themselves. And it also explains why they are skillful in the arts and crafts. &gt;And since they have these two bodies they are, like man, subject to the diseases that arise from the elements and from the heaven. But they lack one of man\u2019s three bodies, and this makes them beings of their own. They have not the soul. In that they are like animals. They look like men but are not descendants of Adam. They live in:social groups, obey- ing laws, bear children but when they die, there is nothing left.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since every creature that is denied salvation craves it, they seek union with man. When a nymph marries a man from Adam, through the sacrament of matrimony she receives the soul. And her children have the soul.

Tradition reports of many such nymphs who married man, lived with them and were faithful to them.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since they are not devils but beings that may be saved, they must be treated kindly, and contracts and agreements with them are binding for man too.

Yes, I&#039;m a snail and I like to have astral sex with my favourite human, what would you like to know?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how does that work</span><br>Recently on another board, I tried explaining it to someone in the most materialistic way I could think of. See picrel.<br>(Context: I asked someone what he finds so hot about women who want to peg their partner. Someone else replied: &quot;strap on is hot because its something you have to get and wear. it shows how kinky a girl is that she goes out of her way to try and fuck her man in a way that doesnt directly stimulate her just to make him feel good.&quot; I replied that I understood his point, but commented that I can cum from mental stimulation alone anyway. Someone asked &quot;how do you cum from thinking alone?&quot;, so I tried my best to explain it in a way that doesn&#039;t rely on spiritual things that people would only know from experience.)<br>In practice, it&#039;s just a matter of linking minds to the point of sensing each other&#039;s astral form; then if we touch the other&#039;s astral form, we both feel it, and it feels better than physical touch. We also like to link chakras to feel each other&#039;s love, pleasure and arousal.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how come it improves physical sex as well?</span><br>It&#039;s like the physical and the astral stack together in terms of pleasure, so as long as I&#039;m into it mentally, it&#039;s really easy to cum even if I don&#039;t go too hard physically.<br>To put it another way, sensory hallucinations based on energy make up like 90% of my sexual pleasure nowadays (that alone makes it feel 10\u00d7 better than it used to), and since it feels so much better, I&#039;m way more into it which also makes it twice as good.

A challenge was raised even against the life review as a form of control. If you can freely decide where you want to go without any considerations on the life you just had and everything you&#039;ve done, the good and the bad, the mechanisms of cosmic justice, order, karma, natural law falls apart. That line of reasoning by itself also leads to condoning &quot;the easy way out&quot; if you catch my drift. Seemingly that option would guarantee immediate solution to the current difficulties with the benefit of ceasing to generate loosh (that special type of food), but that idea wasn&#039;t entertained along with the others above. Perhaps an answer to that is that the nuclear option would cause suffering to others and that is why it would be discouraged and not even mentioned. Why should anyone bother to raise their vibration even?

We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

Sometimes I stay up all night and see these huge beasts moving toward my house through the windows.

My biggest contribution was a position I created called &quot;Revolution Consultants&quot; and &quot;People Leaders&quot; which were part of these pro-democracy organizations, and I designed a fake history for these non-profit orgs which involved them helping inspire and set up revolutions to change oppressive government policies worldwide. It was all made to sound really pretentious and appealing to the outspoken &quot;activist&quot; mindset that a lot of these young people had. They were mostly college students. <br><br>These so-called revolutionary consultants were at first officers who were under Non-official cover with identities that had no ties to the US government. We communicated with them indirectly and face-to-face briefings would take place outside HK and the mainland in places like Thailand or the Philippines. The officers would then recruit candidates (usually members of student orgs at universities or members of trade unions) to fill out new &quot;consultant&quot; positions, and these guys would find people under them to do the same. In design, it was pretty much very similar to a Multi-Level marketing shill, but designed for &quot;revolutionary activities,&quot; It also helped further distance our people further and further from the actual protestors, and the presence of so-many &quot;consultants&quot; and &quot;leaders&quot; with equal ranking helped to decentralize the chain-of-command, which was to prevent everything from going to shit if a large number of them were arrested. <br><br>It went to shit anyways, but for a different reason.", "filename": "1673695287487719", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673904317177990, "time": 1673904317, "md5": "ti/0ydUI6CMyHXZskEEqbQ==", "fsize": 471101, "resto": 33848413}, {"no": 33858828, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)16:49:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33858621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33858621</a><br>Why did it go to shit.

My sister remembers vividly seeing a lot of witches when she was younger, and I remember going to military base when I was younger a lot, going in the tunnels underneath it. I also remember seeing God in 3 separate occasions (2 without drugs when I was younger). Once when I was 15 and highly depressed I saw God as 2 red orbs that emanated with love as they touched me (I was transported in pitch dark void room during school). Once when I was 20 (before drugs) as a tree of life. Once when I was 26 as a bearded white robed old man in the opening in the sky looking down on me disgusted (after the rift closed the demons started attacking me). <br><br>I know most of conspiracy theories and I can directly tell you right now that most of them are true (aside few red herrings and limited hangouts). <br><br>If you can take something from this then take from it that God is love and if you align yourself with love and give your life over to God without fearing death that you will succeed in whatever his mission for you is.<br><br>2/2<br>maybe later I will come back, have to go", "time": 1673998569, "resto": 33848413}, {"no": 33867825, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:40:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33862681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33862681</a><br>It has happened in the mid 2010s, that&#039;s why things have been weird ever since. <br><br>They&#039;re not benevolent, just benign, mostly integrative than destructively exclusive.

Next thing i new i heard a scream of a woman outside my window which got louder and louder until it finally become so close to me that i heard it in my ear then the scream vanished completely and i woke up in a cold sweat panic and couldn&#039;t go back to bed the whole night. It was almost as if the voice was vocoded like in a scary movie and the lady was telling me to shut up. Later found out that the house next to mine had a accident in the 90s where the woman who lived there shot and killed herself in her bedroom. Was that actually her in ghost form? Could be. Next i was 27 walking home from work and a green light caught my eye in the lake. Turned out what looked like to be a glow in the dark small boat and i got a really immense presence from it so i decided to speak to it telepathically. I said &quot;do something amazing&quot; and a orb of white light levitated up out of the boat and flew to the right into the small woods. I continued walking astonished while i was walking passed a icecream shop i noticed a family sitting on the front table frozen in place. So i decided to use telepathy again &quot;Hey are you okay?&quot; then right after i said that their bodies started moving again and they started talking as if nothing even happened. It was like time froze for about a minute. Next again i was 27 and seen they same green glow in the dark boat flying in the air right above a restaurant about 30 meters away from me at night and it made a impossible 90 degree right turn. In that same area in a backyard while i was riding my bike to work i seen what looked like a ufo fly out of the backyard into the air.

A possible solution to the Fermi Paradox is that analogous considerations may drive them to avoid broadcasting their presence to the cosmos, and to attempt to destroy or permanently cripple emerging civilizations on sight.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here.

The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE)", "filename": "Aryanz", "ext": ".png",

These ancient civilizations and their ability to work with hard rocks like granite has always interested me, and it&#039;s clear that archeologists are either not being honest or not bothering to check in with geologists and mechanics. That being said, I think I have figured out how they did this and I actually think it was more of a chemistry feat than a mechanical one (though obviously some sort of drill was involved, I just don&#039;t think it had to have been particularly complex).<br>I think that both they and at least the civilization before the Incas managed to make a fairly concentrated hydrofluoric acid. There are plants this can be sourced from and it&#039;s possible to store it in glass without significant corrosion to the container. The hydrofluoric acid would have been able to soften the rock, and applications of wax around areas they did not want to be softened would have allowed for some extreme precision. This could have also allowed for very nice polishing depending on how they used it and with what tools. This would unsurprisingly not leave behind much evidence, as it wouldn&#039;t last long the moment its container cracked or leaked, and finding glass in full pieces is extremely rare due to its fragility.<br>The only question for the Egyptians would be what plants they sourced this from, and the process they used to concentrate it. I can say for certain that in South America e.g., Peru, plants that can be used to source hydrofluoric acid are available. It would be a matter of investigative experimentation to figure out how they concentrated this and applied it, but considering the complex methods we know that all cultures have managed to use plant materials, it&#039;s safe to assume they figured that out. <br>I&#039;ll try to find some pictures of the quarry evidence I&#039;m talking about, where you can clearly see that hard rock was somehow &quot;scooped&quot; away from desired pieces as if it had been softened into more of a clay or mud for extraction.", "time": 1674123092, "resto": 33868339}, {"no": 33879446, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)05:25:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33879398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33879398</a><br>Adding in, they could have also done this without significant damage to tools despite its corrosive nature, because they probably would have had to let whatever solution they had sit on the exposed area for some time for it to work (its likely this was more of a pulpy puree rather than a pure liquid, as this would have been easier to work with, and would make more sense starting from plants). It probably wasn&#039;t as corrosive as concentrated hydrofluoric acid like what we have today, but basic refining could have gotten a plant-based solution to something potent enough to corrode rock like granite if they applied it multiple times and let it sit for let&#039;s say, 20 mins to 1hr each application. <br>From there, they could work quickly enough to not significantly damage stone tools, at least enough to get a project done. To be fair, if they had this method and were using stone tools (or at least stone for where the tool made contact), making new tools probably wasn&#039;t too much of an issue. <br>I&#039;m not sure about metals like bronze since my run-ins with hydrofluoric acid in the lab were usually me wiping a spill with a towel by instinct and watching my towel disappear kek.

Their doors slammed as soon as their legs were out of sight and then I heard heavy metallic scrapping coming from the living room which was also pitch black. I gave myself a gun in the dream and aimed it at the blackness which only made it louder. I became so scared that I ran back into my room and shut my door.

Are you beautiful? Venus isn&#039;t quite conjunct the ascendant but it&#039;s still in the same house. Venus and Mars in 1st house can potentially indicate a Chad physique, Mars in 1st also encourages recklessness though which can get you hurt, so don&#039;t be reckless.<br>Chart says you&#039;ve received a good upbringing and that your emotional centre is in familiar things like home, family, local community etc. Your career (or public activity) and love life will probably be linked to what you feel is local and familiar in some manner. Unfortunately, you may struggle with money. Your finances as well, but you may have bad luck with money. Mercury in Aries suggests that you are an active go-getter socially, and that you are socially-minded. Social life and belonging will be extra important to you, and may also be linked to your 4th house (the familiar/local) in some manner - perhaps you&#039;ll seek to get involved with the people around you in order to become more socially involved and fulfilled. Sun in 12th house is hard to interpret - it could mean inner struggle, or struggle with external enemies. It could also mean isolation. Taurus is a sign that values perseverance, stability and constancy, so remain firm in order to persevere through difficulties. Your strongest placements are probably in your first house, with your bubbly and sociable rising sign complemented by the charming qualities of Venus and, ideally, if well handled, the courageous, bold, energetic and inspiring qualities of Mars. This might be the chart of a stereotypical Chad. However, Mars can also express itself in a reckless, bitter, mean and combative way - make sure to temper your energies and use them appropriately.

You may end up devoting your life to some kind of struggle - if so, try to ensure that it is a just, rational and objective one, and not just one that is product of illusions.

There is nothing resplendent. There is nothing benevolent. There is nothing but selfishness and veils. Everything is beyond illusion. Buddha is a faggot. Jesus is a dot in the middle of a Cube. His Virginal Mother is 1/3rd of a Dragon&#039;s political state. Satan is the pigs hoof, Behemoth a cracked CD. Leviathan wins. The Demiurge wins. There is no Beauty. There is no holy. Businessmen are worse than the demons in your nightmares. You can&#039;t wake up from the digital currency or yawn and forget the coffers of gold held by Yahwists. Allah is a fucking cube. Mohmat a copycat. Beelzebub a fat fucking maggot feeding on the corpse of a good Christian boy who was sodomized to death by a Politician for kicks. The Wedding is commenced in a bouncy house. The Priests forge their own damnation with the mantra&#039;s of dead pedophiles ringing round the marble stations of Dimensionality arched for Lucifer&#039;s pleasure. Pride is, with what gluttony results from lust for money that caught the spider in its own web, the ascent of man from slave to sovereign. And this is only possible by becoming Cain. Women are without souls, hence Death - and we&#039;re born of it. Even Nought&#039;s pussy made the Demiurge die a Sun. I have no reason to live, and neither do you. I am crying, I should rejoice, but I am sad. My visions, my nightmares, my prior suicide attempts, what miracles gave me life and aught to live, have - being taken away - again - taught me there really is Nought. There is no Christ. There is no Buddha. There is no Atlantis because the Mother wept. The devil couldn&#039;t help. Iove doesn&#039;t help. Love is the biggest scam since the orgasm met the dollar. There&#039;s no purity. No one is going to hell. This is my hell.

And in fact most of them can\u2019t. A lot of utopias sweep the hard problems under the rug, or would fall apart in ten minutes if actually implemented.<br><br>But let me suggest a couple of \u201cutopias\u201d that don\u2019t have this problem.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where instead of the government paying lots of corporate welfare, the government doesn\u2019t pay lots of corporate welfare.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where every country\u2019s military is 50% smaller than it is today, and the savings go into infrastructure spending.<br><br>\u2013 The utopia where all hospitals use the same electronic medical record system, or at least medical record systems that can talk to each other, so that doctors can look up what the doctor you saw last week in a different hospital decided instead of running all the same tests over again for $5000.<br><br>I don\u2019t think there are too many people who oppose any of these utopias. If they\u2019re not happening, it\u2019s not because people don\u2019t support them. It certainly isn\u2019t because nobody\u2019s thought of them, since I just thought of them right now and I don\u2019t expect my \u201cdiscovery\u201d to be hailed as particularly novel or change the world.<br><br>Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason our current system isn\u2019t a utopia is that it wasn\u2019t designed by humans. Just as you can look at an arid terrain and determine what shape a river will one day take by assuming water will obey gravity, so you can look at a civilization and determine what shape its institutions will one day take by assuming people will obey incentives.<br>\u201c", "time": 1674130654, "resto": 33874853}, {"no": 33881531, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)12:32:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33874853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33874853</a><br>kek!<br><br>society would fuck up big time if something as simple as women&#039;s nature and preference was known.<br><br>You see, people like Andrew Tate, rich and smart.

So unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die, and have as much of whatever kind of sex you want forever.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.
