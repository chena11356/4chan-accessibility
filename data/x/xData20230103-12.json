Public opinion can be manipulated, but in teaching the public how to ask for what it wants the manipulator is safeguarding the public against his own possible aggressiveness. The method of the experimental psychologist is not as effective in the study of public opinion in the broad sense as is that of introspective psychology. To create and to change public opinion it is necessary to understand human motives, to know what special interests are represented by a given population, and to realize the function and limitations of the physical organs of approach to the public, such as the radio, the platform, the movie, the letter, the newspaper, etc. If the general principles of swaying public opinion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific problem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitudes of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others. Group adherence is essential in changing the attitudes of the public. Authoritative and influential groups may become important channels of reaching the larger public. Ideas and situations must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span>", "time": 1672605878, "resto": 33734048}, {"no": 33740245, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)15:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33740220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33740220</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span><br><br>This is public:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The goal of the author in this chapter is to analyse through established psychological principles how torture-based mind control programming is installed and exerts continued control over victims.

No one can deny the Japanese stand alone among their fellow Asians with their prodigious and unrivaled cultural output and novel creative expression. Suffering and trauma, in individuals, often result in greater wisdom and spiritual understanding. Everything in this reality is scalar and fractal. It would actually make sense that the Japanese egregore and the psychic impact it received from two nuclear detonations, created the perfect conditions for a kind of spiritual sensitivity that grants some Japanese individuals the ability to more readily receive information from the future.

Human persons are not just our souls, our bodies define us as much as our soul. Most powers of my soul are intimately connected to the powers of the body. For example, when I think, I must think in terms of mental representations of words, which we can only conceptualize through hearing. Hearing is a power of the soul which depends on the body (at least in man) to operate. Another example would be identity, could there be a more clear demarcation of personal identity that a face (body)? Both the soul and the body are crucial aspects of personal identity. Part of what drew me to the ideal of Christianity was that Christians have a better grasp of human nature than pagans, Buddhists, occultists, ect. We are not just our bodies, but we are also not just our souls. We have a tripartite nature of body, soul and spirit. In short we are ensouled bodies.<br><br>Until the resurrection we will be in a state of peace and communion with God and the saints (God willing), but this state will be one of incompletion, or a temporary amputation of sorts. To aspire to a bodiless state is to aspire to be an amputee, forever. For my soul to inhabit a different body would not only involve a state of incompleteness, but an unnatural blending of things which do not belong together (even more so in the case of animals). Both our disembodied souls and our disensouled bodies will be reunited on the resurrection of the dead. Our new bodies will be as a seed is to a fully grown plant, complete, and perfected.

It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs.

I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

They introduce new concepts through all of this, they make it seem like you\u2019re figuring stuff on your own, but it\u2019s not really so, they left that stuff there on purpose. Some of the creators of this media, like wachowski brothers, just seem very weird. It makes me wonder if the consumption of their own poisons/indulging into such topics, is what caused them to go through gender change? Because if research into occult and demonology is what causes a persons moralities to corrupt or degenerate, maybe it\u2019s not such good idea putsuit these endeavours? But then again, if you don\u2019t dare to research what your enemy is doing, you can\u2019t know how to defend against it if there\u2019s an attack on you (vaccines? Being on obscure part of internet help pick information on side-effects that hasn\u2019t been published in MSM). Where does one draw the line? Because the concept of entities coming offering you \u201dwisdom\u201d, in echange of getting more foothold in your life, is something that\u2019s been discussed here often, that even if you don\u2019t sell your soul or make contract, being too much in contact with them directly or the info, will corrupt you.<br><br>You can say even recent Kanye West sheningans are probably also part of a psyop, you can tell from his entourage alone (almost all have weird sexual fetishes, or are also gay).

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind? That&#039;s too narrow, try to FEEL, like literally feel your whole body breathing, the breath fills your lungs only but it also moves your belly and your pelvic floor with its movements, your shoulder blades and clavicle may also move during inhalation/exhalation, feel your whole body sitting there and breathing.<br><br> - Speaking of the body, try to keep your head retracted (search about this head posture), also imagine a thread which is attached in the middle of your head pulling it lightly up, this head position helps with sleepiness.<br><br> - Again: Don&#039;t make a story about it, it&#039;s just you breathing, yes you will just sit there and feel yourself breathing, your mind will think &quot;What? Only that? That&#039;s too simple/stupid/whatever&quot;, but believe me: first achieving calmness and silence is the most important thing.<br><br>- And last: Coffee is not the only thing which may hinder your meditation practice, everyday cannabis smoking or regular pills may hinder it too.", "filename": "cantona-kick-kick-567223161", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 438, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672691017977960, "time": 1672691017, "md5": "gihIXsBjxxSx54w6mJG6DA==", "fsize": 72063, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746889, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FEEL, like literally feel</span><br>he means think about feeling", "time": 1672691075, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746915, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746889</a><br>Excuse me?

In regards to modern human brain morphology, Neanderthal admixture is positively correlated with an increase in sulcal depth for the right intraparietal sulcus and an increase in cortical complexity for the early visual cortex of the left hemisphere.

The roulette is arguably the easiest game to cheat using remote viewing. You just have to guess if the ball will go on red, black or green color. In my experience, in big casino roulette are always situated in the most noisy place, making it really difficult to concentrate. In las vegas there are always DJ playing near roulette game. also, the time to chose your color seems tailored to just not be enough to remote view. With enough training you can still get it to work. But there is the weird part. I personally can get consistently 8 good bet out of the 10 first before running out of stamina and going back to a 50% chance. But each time I start winning too much, the roulette &#039;cancel&#039; the game. It still spin, goes where I predicted but then it spin again and only the second spin count. And each time the second spin isn&#039;t my bet. I know I sound like a schizo addicted to gambling but if you tried it you&#039;ll get the same result as I do. Something really weird is going on.

I think because they have similar roles in their respective pantheon and are more or less major deities in their pantheon that they could be the same.</span><br>I think that&#039;s partially true. I&#039;ve come to understand it that a lot of the entities we interact with when communing with a deity tend to be more like &#039;titles&#039;, for lack of a better terminology, than individuals. Most gods tend to embody fundamental concepts and are woven into an egregor of persona by the observations of man, but that&#039;s simply all that we&#039;re observing, not necessarily the totality of the the entity we&#039;re interacting with. So that&#039;s to say, these entities we commune with are made up of &#039;multiple&#039; deities from various mythologies /pantheons because the inherent nature of what we&#039;ve collectively deified is a specific facet of them. That said, I suspect there&#039;s an affinity you could try and quantify an entity with as &#039;more Zerus than Ares&#039; or perhaps &#039;definitively Odin&#039; if an entity primarily (but not entirely) embraces that aspect of themselves. When viewed in this light, it also helps reconcile a lot of the seemingly schizophrenic behavior they exhibit in mythologies because there&#039;s more than one entity embodying that aspect in the story and the nature of conflating the deified title with the essence of being tends to lead to the appearance of a somewhat schizophrenic-looking behavior pattern. I also suspect many of them feel very misunderstood by this &#039;typecasting&#039;, but that likely varies on an individual basis. As a disclaimer, this is my current working understanding after a lot of work with a lot of &#039;gods&#039; but ultimately still filtering through my body&#039;s perception so not everything may be perfect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33728021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33728021</a><br>Young brunette woman with blue eyes.

Freyr was also young looking but you could tell as he grew up he was going to mature into an absolute stud -- very tall and bronze skinned with broad shoulders.

I asked why they were there, they looked puzzled and turned away.

I&#039;ve tried doing it by projecting energy in certain shapes, but I&#039;m unsure if that even counts as a transformation, and I can only maintain for about 5 minutes before getting tired. In my dreams, I can&#039;t manage to do it at all. I think I&#039;m just approaching it wrong.<br>And without intervention, my etheric body seems to be clearly female. That&#039;s, like, the whole reason I got so interested in spiritual sex: if dysphoria was like a phantom pain, then stimulating that area directly in my consciousness relieved it temporarily, as the lack of nerves in the right area wasn&#039;t an issue.<br>Since I was little, I was usually a girl in my dreams. The sexual dreams involving her were the exception. I&#039;m not sure how else to interpret it other than that she shapeshifted me during those dreams. Once, I even saw this change as it happened. If I wonder why she&#039;d do that, it comes to mind that she prefers male partners. A few days after I regained the memories that once made me feel suicidal, I vaguely sensed that I&#039;d had a sexual relationship with her before, and I asked if by any chance she wants something like that. I understood her response as: &quot;Only if you were more masculine spiritually.&quot;<br>Unlike Lilith, who said any decision I make on this is meaningless unless I decide it for myself, she wanted to prevent me from having surgery. Just as many humans have tried to &quot;save&quot; me against my will too. She tried everything she could to help me accept having a male form; it was insufficient.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I doubt you&#039;d tolerate the same thing happening to your daughter(male), or even your son</span><br>Of course not; I&#039;d intervene to protect my child.

Recently, he got a job for the first time since we met. On his first day, he texted me to express that he felt suicidal and wanted to quit. I sent a few texts to reassure him, then considered my options.<br>We&#039;re from neighbouring countries, and I&#039;m with him about half of the time. Financial stability is one of the requirements to marry, but I can&#039;t get a job in his country until we&#039;re married. I could only get an exemption if I spent 7 years saving up.<br>Delaying our marriage that much is unacceptable to me, so I used telepathy to overwrite his emotions with positive ones. An hour later, he texted me again to let me know he&#039;s feeling much better, and that he&#039;s starting to enjoy his job. He asked if I did something to him spiritually; I admitted that I did. He thanked me, and apologised for being so negative earlier. I said he shouldn&#039;t apologise, as his openness allowed me to help, and that I&#039;m just glad he&#039;s feeling better now. In the evening, I gave him a blowjob for good measure, and he fell asleep happily.

As she was saying her vows, a tsunami of love washed over my body and flooded my mind. Words cannot describe it.

She took me to a tropical island in Lilith&#039;s realm that she had already set up for us. The three succubi children we had already conceived were there. They were preteens now and they all gave me huge, super-warm hugs and they were overjoyed to see their daddy again and spend time with me. Additionally, I learned my new wife was pregnant with my first incubus son. Our house was a huge, open-air bungalow built out of bamboo and palm wood with palm leaves and dry grass as the roof. Selena&#039;s true form had red skin and black hair with red highlights. Our three daughters had more human skin but tinged with red in the cheeks and at joints.

It rained late at night but everything was dry again come noon the next day. Every night, the moon was full and bright.<br>Some days I would fish from the beach and Selena would sit next to me, both of us in camping chairs. She would bring me food and my favorite drinks. She also had a table nearby for the children to browse with all kinds of foods and drinks she made herself out of her own energy. The children would play on the beach or swim within sight.

Selena beamed so brightly, I thought it must hurt to smile that much. The children were very proud.<br><br>We went back home through something like a wormhole in the palace and Selena let me stay another three days. Then I said goodbye to my children.

I&#039;m sorry, perhaps my words came across as more ominous than I intended.<br><br>Last year, I spoke with a psychiatrist who helped me find a dosage of ADD medication that works well for me. I&#039;ve forgotten to use it since my surgery, but when I did use it, I took a low dosage and benefited without any side effects. As I&#039;m satisfied with those results, I didn&#039;t intend to continue seeing him.<br>However, last week I was unable to conceal my mental anguish properly, and my mum noticed while painting my nails, and was concerned about me. Unsure how to explain it, I asked her if she thinks nightmares can inflict trauma, or if they merely represent trauma that was already there. She said it&#039;s possible for nightmares to be traumatic if there is a disorder that disturbs the sleep, and that ADD could do that (she&#039;s a psychiatrist herself, so she would know). I mentioned I used to have nightmares that weighed on me heavily, and lately I&#039;m processing them as some repressed feelings are coming up.<br>She asked if I want to talk about the nightmares, but I declined, as I don&#039;t think it&#039;d help. Since then, she&#039;s asked me repeatedly to make an appointment with that psychiatrist to talk about it with him instead. Around the same time, he sent me an email saying it&#039;s been a while, and asking whether I&#039;d like to make an appointment or discontinue treatment. I was hesitant, but today I sent him an email asking whether he&#039;d be interested in discussing the topic of trauma from nightmares with me, &quot;as the memories from a recurring nightmare I used to have are interfering with my daily functioning lately.&quot;<br><br>I&#039;m not expecting him to be able to do anything, but I believe it&#039;s good to go into things with open expectations.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Succubi are really good at obscure references</span><br>Sounds like fishing for synchronicities.", "time": 1672695230, "resto": 33707252, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33747366, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:36:14", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746494</a> <a href=\"#p33747348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33747348</a><br>Anyway, as for what I meant:<br><br>I believe my ancestor spirit to be responsible for those nightmares, since her energy feels the same as that of the woman in those nightmares. After the incident 5 weeks ago, I also understood she might have some non-selfish motives for it. Even so, it wounded my mind too deeply for me to forgive her.<br>One of those motives is to provide me with sexual energy that I needed. I&#039;ve mentioned before that energy is formless, and only appears to have a form as it&#039;s interpreted by the mind. Thus, spiritual experiences tend to be heavily influenced by a person&#039;s biases. I didn&#039;t do any form of meditation at the time and knew nothing of the occult. Who is to say that what I experienced in those nightmares is also what she did from her perspective? This morning, an idea suddenly came to mind: all she did was direct sexual energy my way, and what I suffered was a manifestation of my own sexual issues at the time.<br><br>What if that were the case? It wouldn&#039;t change what I went through, nor that she&#039;s responsible. It only changes her intentions back then. Maybe she didn&#039;t understand my situation as well as she thought. Maybe she didn&#039;t mean for it to make me feel so deeply conflicted. Maybe that&#039;s enough for me to be able to trust her if she were to apologise to me. Maybe forgiving her will give me the inner peace I long for. I still love her. As twisted as my views on gender may have been due to my confusing childhood, she embodies everything I admire about women. Maybe she can heal the wounds she inflicted on my psyche.<br><br>I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m too scared to even talk to her again; it&#039;s a miracle that I mustered the courage last week.

I&#039;ll check those out too. I hadn&#039;t read through the thread yet when I made that comment. I took the NDE pill ~10 years ago after reading &quot;The Holographic University&quot; by Michael Talbot. So the only big question for me is if the experience is what it presents itself as, or is it some kind of deception or trap? I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;d be able to conclude either one with any degree of certainty though, so I&#039;m very curious what all the supporting evidence and logic is for the trap theory. I&#039;m also trying to keep my own biases in check as someone with trust issues and slightly anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic tendencies.<br><br>I&#039;m skeptical of anyone who asserts overly specific details like archons, greys, reptilians, loosh farming, ultra sci fi machines and what not for too many reasons to get into. However, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re wrong about the basic gist of things. I think most people just don&#039;t well enough understand the concept of symbolism within a holographic/fractal model of consciousness. What I mean is most people take what is experienced in altered states of mind far too literally.<br><br>What you experience when you astral project, remote view, dream, or have an NDE is almost never literally what is appears to be. Our basic 5 senses are stable and well developed. When we sense beyond that, our minds struggle to decode information into something coherent to present our awareness with, and we end up with highly subjective symbolism. This is why it&#039;s not always &quot;a light at the end of a tunnel&quot;, but often it&#039;ll be a bridge, a boat, or a trail through a forest even. It&#039;s your mind presenting an extremely in accurate and subjective approximation of reality to your awareness.<br><br>1/2 I guess", "time": 1672421250, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722852, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33721725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33721725</a><br>turns out your consciousness can do alot when it isn&#039;t bound to a body.", "time": 1672422234, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722886, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:47:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33722714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33722714</a><br>Because of this, it&#039;s also possible much of the &quot;trap&quot; theory is simply the result of subjective projections of common fears and uncertainties. Very understandable ones which I share. Who would ever choose to reincarnate in THIS timeline? Who would choose to be raped to death as a newborn? Is this much suffering really most ideal and efficient for learning and growth? What&#039;s the point, and how can we learn or progress, if we start with no memories each time? They&#039;re valid and important questions with no solid answers, and I think everyone promoting and drawn to the trap theory are likely motivated by similar questions. I know I am.<br><br>So I agree the more more common views on reincarnation simply don&#039;t add up. Though I think most of the more specific, literal, yet fantastical and sensationalist views which often read like sci-fi, while maybe not intentionally dishonest, definitely should not be taken too seriously or literally. Similar to montalk for those familiar. It&#039;s what happens when slightly dumb people are spiritually gifted. They perceive more then most, but aren&#039;t able to understand or process it effectively.<br><br>This is also why I&#039;m a bit skeptical about the &quot;net&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;. There very well may be a system in place serving similar functions, but I&#039;m suspicious of how accurate the net concept is. If one reads about said net, tends to be a slightly gullible person / open to suggestion (a trait universally required for one to be spiritually gifted) then what are they going to see when they astral project? Of course it&#039;ll be a net for them. <br><br>The astral is not the material, where we all more or less see the same apple, the same tree, the same Joe or Sue.

I&#039;ve had one experience that (for me personally) was complete confirmation that it really is possible for your consciousness to leave your body. The last time I tripped I tried meditating at the peak, and the trip instantly just &quot;turned off&quot;. The visuals, the trippy mindfuck headspace was gone, the body load, all of it stopped instantly. The only way that could happen to me is if my consciousness had separated from my physical, mushroom-addled brain and body. Instead of meditation enhancing the trip as one might expect, the psilocin seemed to help send me into a deeper state of meditation, and this completely overrode the trip. It&#039;s difficult to describe what the experience that replaced the trip felt like, but it was joyful yet very calm and peaceful, not ecstatic or overwhelming. It just felt like absolute stillness, and all my senses could perceive were a pale golden light and a steady drone. As soon as I willed myself back to reality, the trip instantly returned as if I had just returned to my body. <br><br>Weird shit, and I&#039;m hesitant to try and draw more conclusions about what I had experienced or attempt to explain it more. I want to go back though. It also reminds me of a story mentioned in the holographic universe book I mentioned in a previous post. Some Buddhist monk was given 900mcg of acid and all he had to say was &quot;this is nice, but meditation is better&quot;. Now I understand exactly what he meant. That&#039;s how he was able to basically just ignore 900mcg of LSD, that&#039;s why he claimed meditation is better. Deep meditation separates your consciousness from your body, or at least turns off your senses. Which is obvious in hindsight, this is why you&#039;re supposed to focus on a single subject to the exclusion of all else. It&#039;s training you to separate from your physical senses so you can experience pure consciousness directly.", "time": 1672424047, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33723133, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)13:19:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33722888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33722888</a><br>Checked but I&#039;m going to need some context.

Symbols can never perfectly represent something or have identical meaning to any two people, as each person&#039;s understanding of any given symbol is formed by unique life experiences, association, and pattern recognition. <br><br>The inherent inaccuracy of language leads to exponentially more complex language barriers as we try to create symbols for increasingly abstract concepts built upon previous symbols assumed to be understood. Similarly with perspective. It&#039;s like arguing over the color of a coin that&#039;s red on one side and blue on the other, because both parties are unwilling to look at the other side of the coin and see why the other&#039;s perspective makes sense to the other party. Now imagine an object with an infinite number of faces and an infinite number of observers. That&#039;s the nature of discussing spiritual concepts.<br><br>If I were wrong, the entire world would have formed a consensus on a single spiritual worldview a very long time ago.

You have not seen that the five khandas are totally impermanent and totally cease and so the only base for anything is the non base of nibbana.<br><br>If you think of nibbana as a &quot;state&quot; where there is no form,feeling,perception,sankhara,an<wbr>d sense consciousness, and don&#039;t really have the experiential meditative knowledge of that then it might sound similar to just end of experience and end of everything. But nibbana is much much much more subtle than that. It is neither this nor that. Neither being nor non being (meaning neither existence nor annihilation). Neither exists nor does not exist. Neither consciousness not unconsciousness. <br><br>I think it&#039;s easier to call it asankhata (unconditioned). It is the state of extinction into God. The self disappears. &quot;You&quot; cannot see the face of God. If you look, you vanish. Christian mystics describe the same thing. So do kabbalists (Ein Sof). It is the unmanifested side of God, with existence and the ten sefirot and four worlds being the manifested.", "filename": "83BE294C-0585-4652-83FD-305BCB960314", "ext": ".png", "w": 621, "h": 485, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1672579060149981, "time": 1672579060, "md5": "ZpR7+QdLcrMCD+18Y3eSdQ==", "fsize": 429098, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33737858, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)08:26:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33737823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33737823</a><br>Imagine it like this.

Nothing else exists. They cannot imagine a world outside the water. They probably don&#039;t even know they are in the water, they don&#039;t know that water exists. They are in it all the time.

Where were you?&quot; And the frog starts explaining to them that he was in the land. &quot;What is land?&quot; The frog explains that it is a place where there is no water, no swimming, no gills, you breathe through the air. <br><br>The fish don&#039;t believe the frog. To them, water, swimming, gills is all there is. So to describe a place outside of it is to describe something that isn&#039;t. They can&#039;t understand the frog and probably never will.

Another mental posture. <br><br>These 2 modes of reality or mental posture are called samsara and nirvana.<br><br>I hope you can see now that nibbana has nothing to do with atheistic death or anesthesia or lack of experience. The mind goes nowhere. It is always there (citta). The only thing is that the citta learns to see the world in a different way. Instead of craving and getting, it just sees things as already perfect. It sees the inherent peacefulness in every experience. It comes from &quot;nothing&quot; and returns to &quot;nothing&quot;. It is silent and peaceful and mysterious. And full of love and compassion.<br><br>If you want to experience first hand this second &quot;letting go&quot; way of reality, then practice jhana. In jhana you progressively let go of gross and subtle levels of activity (craving / formation). For example when you sit down to meditate you are quieting the gross bodily activity. Then when you enter 1st jhana you are quieting the five hindrances. When you enter 2nd jhana there are no more thoughts.

Make sure it&#039;s made out of a formula that works with your skin. I like Urban Decay Stay Naked for foundation. Learn color correcting for when you have break outs. Green over red, concealer, and powder followed by your foundation then powder and setting spray. Don&#039;t wear too much makeup though or else you&#039;ll look bad. Neutral colors are best for lips, eyes, and cheeks. Skip contouring unless you are good at it. Skip false lashes unless you&#039;re in full glam. Workout at least 3x a week, don&#039;t skimp out on either lifting or cardio, both are important. Make sure you stretch too. If you want gains, try slow cardio such as biking or stair stepping. For general weight loss take on a treadmill or elliptical. Don&#039;t fad diet, make lifestyle changes that you will actually stick to. Learn to dress for your body type and shape and make sure your clothes actually fit. Build a staple wardrobe and have accent pieces. Too many clashing patterns and colors will draw too much attention. For skincare, sometimes the harsher stuff makes your skin worse (i.e. tretinoin destroyed my skin.) I use Olay gentle cleanser and their classic moisturizer. If you have acne some 2.5% benzoyl peroxide is going to be your best friend. Apply that before your moisturizer at night. I usually alternate between the BP and witch hazel at night. If you&#039;re sensitive to witch hazel, try a moisturizing toner. Some nights, maybe 2x a week, I will slug with some Vaseline. Don&#039;t use too much shit on your face or else your skincare routine will backfire. Practice self care too.

Well, the plane was flying in a straight line, but since the earth is a globe the trajectory of any straight line starting at any given point on the globe, eventually has to leave the atmosphere and pierce out into space and beyond).<br><br>Obviously this does not sound like reality, intercontinental flights do not have to make constant vertical axis tilt adjusments just to keep a steady altitude.<br><br>Conclusion?

Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

So, in no particular order, and ABSOLUTELY not an exhaustive list of grievances, here&#039;s some thoughts:<br><br>- So aliens the government acknowledges will probably abduct people regardless of their position on the matter....need to be approached by aliens to do the thing they were always going to do? I don&#039;t make deals with the squirrels when I want to cut down a tree. I damn sure don&#039;t offer them reparations or wage squirrely propaganda wars with them. Bullshit.<br><br>- Aliens have a genetic problem...but they can make hybrids of two ENTIRELY DISTINCT SPECIES FROM ENTIRELY SEPARATE EVOLITIONARY PATHWAYS WHO BY DEFINITION WILL HAVE ZERO GENETIC SIMILARITY...k...nothing about that is batshit crazy at all, huh? No species who can do this needs either mankind, nor cows, to fix their genetic problems. That&#039;s not how any of this works. Bullshit.<br><br>- Aliens are a billion years more advanced than us...but they just magically crash saucers into Earth left an right. They navigated the cosmos but damnit, they just can&#039;t quite get the hang of making a U turn on Earth...<br><br>- Saucers buzzed Washington DC and they covered it up....HAHAHAHAHAHA no. We couldn&#039;t even keep our nuclear secrets out of the hands of the Soviets. Flying saucers FACTUALLY did not fly by the fleet-full over DC in the 50s. Bullshit.<br><br>- Aliens capable of cloning and who can travel here from another world, DIDN&#039;T take a breeding population of cows back to their homeworld where they could opperate with complete impunity...no...they made ENORMOUS underground kitchens in which they made people-beef cobbler which they soak in on cold mornings...Bull.

What is it with you conspiracy morons and hollywood? Satanist? HOLLYWOOD! Aliens? HOLLYWOOD! Q? HOLLYWOOD! You all are deranged. Yes, it&#039;s a sick town full of rich sociopaths. It&#039;s gross. And it&#039;s no different from any other place the rich and powerful have gathered in any period in human history. Ya&#039;ll need clozapine. Bullshit.<br><br>- A government entirely incapable of stopping aliens from doing...well, ANYTHING apparently, is somehow magically just holding 3 of them hostage and the alien collective just can&#039;t seem to do anything about it. K. Bullshit.<br><br>- Aliens made religions to disrupt traditional values... This is the same bullshit over and over again. WHY? Why would a species who apparently is so advanced they can operate amongst us with utter impunity go to such Machiavellian lengths to play these melodramatic games? This is logically unsound reasoning. Bullshit<br><br>- &quot;Aliens are devolving&quot;. Except that&#039;s literally not a thing. There is no such thing as de-evolution.

As most are already aware, biofilms are a major barrier to wound healing, and experiments have been done on wounds to see if the rate of recovery accelerated. Due to the bacterial colonies being disrupted by the colloidal silver and several other phenomena, it will of course accelerate the healing process. Refer to figure 7.<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/295<wbr>89095/<br><br>Cont.", "time": 1672700711, "resto": 33722000}, {"no": 33748197, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:24:18", "name": "Barggeist", "com": "<a href=\"#p33748051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33748051</a><br><br>Now, there&#039;s several problems with colloidal silver. The three topics are determining if it&#039;s colloidal silver, the marketing tactics that colloidal silver companies use, and lastly, why ingesting it in an uncontrolled environment is a bad idea.<br><br>The first problem is that a lot of them aren&#039;t even colloidal silver, so you must be careful on which products you choose. It&#039;s what I mean when I say it&#039;s &quot;hogwash&quot;, a lot of them are just actual scams. Roughly 70% of them in total that this article surveyed showed that the products contained no colloidal silver but contained ionic silver instead.<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/333<wbr>76330/<br><br>Second, in terms of it being hogwash, is that companies in Finland have also been caught using &quot;several scientifically unfounded claims&quot; in the product. There are also many records on their marketing tactics and shows how they dupe their customers, mostly by using their websites and social media. Facebook especially.<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/334<wbr>37653/<br><br>Third, is to do with the toxicity of silver. This link refers to experiments done in terms of the toxicity, both in animals and humans, and simply speaking, the findings show that silver remains in the body for years. If the dosage isn&#039;t controlled correctly, it will easily damage the GI tract, neurotransmitters, the liver, the heart, the reproductive system, and the immune system.

Amongst the people in attendence were: J. K. Rowling. Gordon Brown. David Miliband. Stephen Daldry. Stella Rimington (she was the Dr. Mengele of the organisation, organising the torture and murder of kidnapped children). Dr. Joanne Collie. Andrew Marr (he spent most of the time naked and screaming - off his head on some form of narcotic). John Scarlett (he was so drunk/drugged up that he had very little idea of what was going on around him). The Templars had captured a large amount of people whom they called the &#039;snakes&#039; i.e. slaves in a large dungeon underneath the castle. One brave person managed to set them free and the result in the neighbouring village of Mons and other places nearby, ensured that the British Army had to move in. Thus began the most incredible cover-up in recent European history. It was like WACO, Guyana. The British Army ordered those in the Castle to come out. They then sent a tank in to bulldoze the walls.

The &quot;real&quot; reality and this one aren&#039;t that different. The major difference is that in the real reality we&#039;re in the far distant future. Don&#039;t ask me how far, I really don&#039;t know. I do know that earth isn&#039;t doing so well. We had a few different space colonies and even managed intergalactic space travel. The issue we started to run into is that we evolution began to rapidly change us outside of Earth. So when we would be in contact with each other we had become so alien it was hard to fathom. A lot of the mythical creatures you see are merely just future versions of ourselves. Greys, bigfoot, dogmen etc. Genetic manipulation became very prevalent for us. But pure humans, ones untampered, are extremely rare and considered precious. The reason is, we can easily adapt to new environments. But there are only a few of us left. There&#039;s a &quot;second earth&quot; which is basically very similar to our earth and solar system we established on the Perseus Arm. It&#039;s basically a 1:1 replica of early earth pre 22nd Century (you&#039;re not there sorry) sometimes they take a few of these poor bastards and establish them here.<br><br>So where are we? We&#039;re in basically what is a Dyson sphere. I can&#039;t speak for all of you, but you probably were greatly injured to the point no amount of cybernetics, DNA manipulation (ironically because of your pure DNA that&#039;s a blessing), and/or any other tech could give you a comfortable life. They throw you into the sim which is also beneficial to them. Why? Because we&#039;re basically what humanity has been trying to build forever. The synthesis between A.I. and humanity, a god built in our image that is benevolent toward itself. You live out your sim over and over, feeling powerless with little control, but your true power is something you&#039;re completely unaware of. In the grand scheme, we unconsciously make big human choices behind the scenes.

Both times I stayed too long because of this feeling, putting up with someone who didn&#039;t really value me the way they should yet wouldn&#039;t let me go. <br><br>I wonder if you have a strong Neptune in your birth chart? I know that&#039;s kinda goofy but this is /x/. Myself, people I know and famous people I&#039;ve studied who have Neptune making a bunch of aspects with other planets in their chart tend to get wrapped up in spiritual feelings, prone to illusion and disillusion. <br><br>Knowing that you don&#039;t know is better than most people and actually a transcendent nature. It&#039;s a knowledge in itself, and knowledge tends to extract a price now and then. It&#039;s silly to let it eat you alive, because it&#039;s the nature of all people. Ask whatever it is that you believe in for wisdom and discernment. It will be freely given to you. Not that you won&#039;t have ups and downs, you&#039;ll just find more peace.", "time": 1672712399, "resto": 33748685}, {"no": 33749309, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33749198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33749198</a><br>Those kinds of feelings are the exact kinds of feelings I was referring to. A sense of devaju as if I&#039;ve met the person before, reliving a distant and fading memory. I&#039;m turning 22 in April, so I have my whole life ahead of me to figure things out better. The only thing that struck me as odd about the person I met who I referred to in my original reply was that she had been the first and only person that I got those feelings with. It was strange, and as much as I had socialized in high school and afterwards, I hadn&#039;t ever gotten that feeling from anyone else. It was a feeling that made me not even care about being close to her in an intimate way, but I just wanted to be close to her. Now, reality is different than we can perceive it to be at times, and we aren&#039;t going to be right about everything, even if we feel like we are. For me, the feeling of being hoodwinked and blindfolded makes everything feel so much worse than it should in the first place. I suffer from something thats eating away at my psyche, and it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve been able to get diagnosed for the 5+ years I&#039;ve been experiencing it. As much as I&#039;ve been able to handle this &quot;condition&quot; for lack of a better term, it is also getting worse. It isn&#039;t something physically wrong, as I&#039;ve had a CT scan done without any physical abnormalities. there are reasons I don&#039;t want to discuss which prevent me from going to a doctor and asking for an MRI. I can&#039;t say for sure that I&#039;ll be as cohesive with my words or as coordinated with my thoughts by the end of 2023. The future is... Uncertain.
