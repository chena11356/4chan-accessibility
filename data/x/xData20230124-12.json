I should love everyone but it is difficult when I feel like they don\u2019t care about suffering and when they feel simulated/alien to me. Capitalism seems like a lie.

I don\u2019t know anything about her and she did feel robotic and alien. All I know is that I will return to her and that I cried the truest tears I have ever cried in her presence. It could also be that good and evil come from the same mind: \u201cI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\u201d KJV Bible \u2013 Isaiah 45:7 I just like to separate it into God who is the devil and Goddess who is supreme bodhisattva. I am always in gnostic mode, thinking God is evil so I need someone to fall back on, some light to support me. And who better than someone who actually manifested herself to me? I haven\u2019t been thinking about her enough. There was an implied covenant in that experience but I forget all about it and I suffer. I won\u2019t pray to her because I don\u2019t think she\u2019s allowed to help me and because I still feel like an atheist \u2013 I just can\u2019t bring myself to pray. Someone told me that when you pray you don\u2019t ask for things, you just stay in silence. But I don\u2019t even meditate anymore.

You guys convinced me to just calm down and try to talk it out with the incubus. I don&#039;t know what his name is so I&#039;ll call him the incubus. I still don&#039;t think I over reacted. I really wish I could tell someone about all of this but unfortunately that would land me in the looney bin so all I have is this place. I did put some thought into everything that happened since I did the letter on my way back home. The incubus hasn&#039;t done anything malicious to me or anything that would make me feel unsafe. He seems to watch me from afar most of the time unless I sit down. When I got home I sat down on my couch with a beer again and said that I would talk to him. I felt the incubus come near me this time but could feel him a little better. It&#039;s like a cloud of energy that falls on my lap. I told him no sex only talking. Most of the questions were yes and no type since he can only talk to me in single words. He gave me some insight on lots of things I was wondering about but who knows if he&#039;s being truthful. What did stand out was when I asked him what he wanted from me and I got this sudden feeling within me of love coming from him it&#039;s like he injected me with his feelings or something. I told him not to do that again because it kinda freaked me out. We talked some more and in the end I agreed that he could stay for a while but I don&#039;t know if I want this as a permanent thing and he agreed.

The first technique for sex reassignment surgery wasn&#039;t even pioneered until half a century ago. Either way, I&#039;m glad I was able to get the help I needed.

Woke up a little earlier than usual before my alarm and headed to Denny&#039;s. Before I get into that last night I had a very vivid dream. I&#039;ve never had one like this. Never really had vivid dream before it almost felt like real life. I was in this parking lot. I could hear loud music from the building right next to me. Seemed like I was behind the building. There was this girl that was dressed like in this rave apparel crouched near my truck doing something to my tire. I hollered at her and she seemed to ignore me. I jogged over to my truck and grabbed her by her shoulder. She all of the sudden turned around got up and was all over me. She was actually a he and he looked absolutely gorgeous. Only a couple of things actually gave it away. One being his flat chest that I felt as he kept trying to get me to kiss him. At one point he said something like &quot;your so annoying&quot; and managed to kiss me. When I opened my eyes I was inside of a club in a sort of vip area. Things happened after that. I won&#039;t go into detail about it. I&#039;ve never actually been to a club as I don&#039;t live in the city and I did ask him to introduce himself to me in my dreams yesterday. We talked about the dream and I got a good bit of sense on his personality. He didn&#039;t give me a name so I just picked one for him. Kinda felt weird about it. I told him I wanted to take it slow and that I don&#039;t like that he follows me everywhere. I asked if he had a problem with religion and that people think he&#039;s a demon and evil and all sorts of questions like this. His perspective on things was not at all what I expected. I mean I can&#039;t really get much from him other than single word answers but it was enough. He asked for some things too. He wants me to share with him more, be a little nicer and to share the bed with me as in have his own side of the bed since I guess I&#039;ve just been hogging the damn thing to myself since the day he showed up.", "time": 1674523421, "resto": 33897034}, {"no": 33915025, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)20:31:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33914812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33914812</a><br>Seems to me you&#039;ve got a mommy wife now.

As you inhale, the energy goes up your spine, back down your front along the middle of your chest and returns to your LDT. This is done twice. <br><br>Next begin with the same method of inhaling except draw in your breath slower and it will help to feel like you&#039;re drawing in the surrounding air into every part of your body. Hold the breath after you can no longer inhale for 10 or more seconds then slowly exhale in the same manner and hold that for the same amount of time as the inhaled breath. As you do this, you should feel the blood rushing to your head. <br><br>Finally repeat the style of breathing without the breath holding 2 more times.<br><br>This gets easier the more your do it.

Among this is the dating of the fall of Atlantis as related to and from Plato, about 9k years before Solon&#039;s time (c9600 BC, 11,600kya). This coincides with meltwater pulse 1b of the roughly thousand year younger dryas climate catastrophe. Further the mass of ice that existed in North America alone would have been nearly equal to that of Antarctica before the younger dryas, a near equal mass was also over Europe. The geographic evidence of the younger dryas melt pulses points to mind bogglingly fast melting, previously thought to have been centuries or millennia has been revised down to months of years recently (in some studies, weeks). This rapid melting of such large masses of ice would have mostly drained into the Atlantic, it would change the thermocline and haloclines of the entire world ocean rapidly and immediately altered the climate. It would have also rapidly changed the isostasy of the Earth&#039;s crust under the Atlantic in particular and raised local sea levels much more rapidly than previously thought. These are merely results however, of a precursor event that triggered the massive melting and climate shift (whether caused from the sun, the Earth itself, or from a passing or impacting comet or asteroid or something else).<br><br>The evidence of catastrophism are all about us, in our sight daily.

If it&#039;s actual bigfoot as in like sasquatch they&#039;re probably primates and more likely to be omnivorous, so a wide spread couldn&#039;t hurt. I dunno about any specifics they&#039;d like as I have no real bigfoot experience myself. But food as peace offering has tons of precedence even outside of human interaction so it&#039;s likely to at least get the point across that you don&#039;t want trouble.

I&#039;ve been looking into AP a lot lately and I&#039;ve had some really intense experiences but it never gets to the point where I can actually see or feel anything beyond the point of shifting. It feels like my body is slowly shrinking inside itself and I hear noise that&#039;s getting louder and louder, even shaking of the whole body at some points but I always drift off and wake up. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me being excited although I try as hard to just put emotions to the side in the process or if I&#039;m doing something wrong. I&#039;ve been advised by some kind anons to refer to /succgen/ for a helping hand but I don&#039;t want a demon to fuck me in the arse or anything sex related. What I&#039;m looking for is an entity willing to offer a helping hand without getting into a wicked relationship with it. It sounds too good to be true but I&#039;m new to all of this although I&#039;ve been trying for quite some time and I don&#039;t know who to reach out to. I&#039;ve been listening to the HemiSync FLACs and doing meditation, I&#039;ve read through some literature regarding AP and tried multiple methods. What I&#039;m looking for in the Astral Plane is a mentor like entity that will teach me about the history of humanity and nature and help me get in touch with the spiritual plane in general.

God made them for a reason and there are probably clues as to that purpose strung about through history and civilization. My gut tells me that humans are not capable of civilization without some form of restraining force. Vampires fill that niche perfectly. They must have humans to survive, but due to their nature cannot dominate us completely (knowingly) without us revolting. So they are forced to shepherd us from the shadows, providing corrections to humanity&#039;s progress without us ever being aware. I&#039;ve known a number of the offspring of the elite in this country. Had the amazing opportunity to go to school with them and learn about the strategies these groups use to catapult themselves through the ages. I suspect there are forces in control of their actions that they are not entirely all aware of. I think some of them are aware of who their true masters are, but I think the vast majority of them are unaware of the complexity that pulls the string.

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

First, are we sure about Hell being an endless and unescapable nightmare? Maybe scripture doesn&#039;t exclude something like a more synchretical representation of hell, like hell could be being outside the kingdom of God, for another run in the wheel of reincarnation(for the one who say hell is here), maybe scripture doesn&#039;t exclude that the sacrifice of the lamb of God will save all humanity as He said forgive them because they don&#039;t know what they are doing? So, to summarize: does scripture allow a more benevolant understanding of hell. <br>Secondly: I understood that, even if you refuse to understand the goodness of God as omnibenevolance, you find less contradictory that God didn&#039;t pre-designed some of his creature for hell, (which is, I believe a basic islamic dogma, and also a protestant one ). So I understand that you are inclined to think that God made his creture at his own image hable to choose the good or the bad. Indeed, it&#039;s an interesting position, even if my experience makes me believe that someone needs a savior to be saved, so it appears that at the end, the election is in the hand of God. So, in the end, if you imagine an ifierno as wide as many Christians imagine it, how do you resolve this contradiction of a loving God creating a so easily corruptible creature doomed to hell.<br>Third: you refuse to see God as good understood as omnibenevolent, it make senses with the old testimony, your understanding of &quot;God is good&quot; as &quot;God is the good, following God saves, but its not God is a kind father saving all the souls forcefully, making them good&quot; is a beautiful way to understand the link between old and new testimony, and also maybe, the reality. But what about the dogma saying that God is love, doesn&#039;t it imply the omnibenevolance? doesn&#039;t it make the contradiction between a loving God and an eternal fire more irreconcilable?", "time": 1674516457, "resto": 33903660}, {"no": 33914088, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)18:42:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33903743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33903743</a><br>We are good (generally atleast) but we still put people in prison", "time": 1674517373, "resto": 33903660}, {"no": 33914328, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)19:09:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33903660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33903660</a><br>This is why your hateful God has to be put into a casket and buried extremely deep so he never arises again.

When a masculine planet is located in a feminine sign, its ability to act is slowed down, which might be a source of frustration or boredom. If a feminine planet is located in a masculine sign, it may feel pressured and rushed to act before it is ready, thus becoming a source of tension or fear.

I mean, it&#039;s common knowledge that we&#039;re made of around 80% water, and emerging knowledge most fungus and parasites do thrive in an acidic environment (see Dr. Simoncini&#039;s work &quot;Cancer is a fungus&quot;), yet there&#039;s little to no discussion on this thread about alkaline water, and it&#039;s even stronger evolution into &quot;kangen water&quot;. The latter is simply a hydrogen rich type of water, with very low ORP values, which means it has an anti-oxidative and rejuvenating effect on our body. Curiously enough, this type of water was popularized by non-other than Hiromi Shinya, an absolute pioneer of colonoscopy and related techs to remove intestinal parasites https://youtu.be/VcOz4WxH9iI?t=10 <br>The man himself performed somewhere around 400.000 colonoscopies and God knows how many demons pulled out of people&#039;s buttholes during his lifetime, so I feel he kinda deserves a place of honor in this thread as a side note.<br><br>Another unsung hero in the de-parasite&#039;s battle imho, is Dr. Robert Cassar, who devoted his last 35 years literally removing parasites from people all around the world. In the case for water, he advocates for pure (homemade) distilled water as a powerful detoxing and lymphatic cleansing agent. So I&#039;ve tried it, and after 3+ months I&#039;ve been drinking it, I can attest its cleansing benefits in the form of: a) more frequent urination, which I associate with faster and more efficient kidney&#039;s work, and b) a strong and unpleasant &quot;fishy&quot; smell at the beginning of NAC protocol (ammonia, thus candida?), alternating for some days with other kinds of unpleasant smells, some very &quot;fungus-like&quot;, until circa 3 weeks after the smell subsided. So my peasant&#039;s guess is that bad smelling stuff is better out of my system, and that wasn&#039;t happening before I introduced pure distilled water.", "time": 1674452673, "resto": 33895977}, {"no": 33908671, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)01:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33908522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33908522</a><br>Pure distilled water, despite being virtually clean from ALL contaminants, do tends to be acidic in nature, thus I started adding a little baking soda to it in order to bring it between a 7 to 9 ph.

Gnosticism down to etymology is just &quot;pursuit of wisdom&quot; gnosis = enlightenment, it&#039;s not a proper noun, it&#039;s a descriptor of an event, a revelation. The church has been compromised for milennia, OP is a fag who would burn people because they practiced fringe herbal medicine. In essence, OP hates and burns the scientist. The scientist appears evil because he deals what the average normie knows nothing about, so naturally the normie fears him who walks in a path of the unknown. The Bible is very obviously tampered with and doesn&#039;t represent Christian history in totality because books and manuscripts are missing. I prove the Bible can be tampered with by bringing up modern translations church share around and keep behind the chair for old ladies and newcomers to pick up. They remove verses. There is literally no argument. The Bible is easily tampered with, and if it wasnt possible to tamper with it, Revelations would not have included a warning in its final chapter warning against it. <br><br>Like so, there has always been hidden documents kept out of sight for fear of siege and destruction of said documents.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

One important thing for me was realizing that much of what we want in meditation are the results. But you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; results, instead you do things which bring results.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant.

According to the novel, the NYMZA is derived from an ancient word that means &quot;name that has been removed,&quot; and refers to a group of beings who were banished to an astral plane for their evil actions. These beings seek to escape their imprisonment and return to the material world, and use their powers to manipulate the minds of humans in order to do so.<br>There are stories of two groups of supernatural beings engaged in a war that results in the defeated party being banished to the bowels of the Earth. The Bible tells of the war in Heaven in which Lucifer recruits a third of the angels in a rebellion against God Almighty. For this, the scripture tells us, Lucifer and his fellow rebels are cast down into a pit within the Earth where they remain imprisoned to this day. Hmmm. Might said prison be under the sea? Might Lucifer and his rebellious buddies have merely been the losing side of a political struggle between two factions of an advanced civilization based on other worlds? How might this reflect upon the stories of Quetzalcoatl or Viracocha or Oannes? Could the \u2018fish men from the sea&#039; actually have been emissaries from the vanquished party seeking to build human civilization up to a standard of technology capable of taking on the victors? <br>There are similar connections between H.P.

In both cases, these sepulchers are associated with an abyss of the great deep.<br>Thirdly, both writers reference similar-sounding names - Tutulu and Cthulhu. Both are pronounced similarly, and both are connected to the same date and to the deep sea.<br>Fourthly, both writers reference black stones - Crowley describes a &quot;sorry stone&quot; of pure black marble associated with Tutulu and Typhon, while Lovecraft describes a black stone upon which sits the image of Cthulhu.<br>Fifthly, both writers reference earthquakes and tentacled beings - Crowley writes about an earthquake and a &quot;tentacled and old gnarled fish creature&quot; being a messenger of greater and elder gods, while Lovecraft writes about an earthquake that activates a psychic link to Cthulhu, a tentacled fish-like priest.", "time": 1674534055, "resto": 33915299}, {"no": 33916385, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)23:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33916378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33916378</a><br>Lastly, both writers reference the idea of the &quot;stars being right&quot; - in Lovecraft&#039;s case, this refers to an alignment of celestial bodies that will unlock the tomb of the abyss, while in Crowley&#039;s case it refers to the idea that &quot;every man and woman is a star&quot;.

It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured.

Sexual energy is the single closest manifestation of one&#039;s primal energy, pure from potential. This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there. You can literally consider your sexual proclivities as your &quot;energy signature,&quot; and yes, this is why when you go on nofap that signature signs brighter and women magically seem to notice you more.<br><br>In a kabbalastic representation, sexuality and sexual energy is often connected to Yesod, but the darker and fetishistic impulses are actually a dark, shadowy reflection closer to Daath and linked towards darker &quot;spheres,&quot; which is not bad in itself, but is seen in the signature because often such fetishes are more &quot;rooted&quot; in manifest things than higher ideals, thus linked more to lower planes than higher. Something like missionaries nebulous love for procreation is much more &quot;intangible&quot; and higher idealed than how dom-sub play would DEPEND on manifest acts and status (unlike missionary for procreation which is closer to ideals).<br><br>So each fetish...will just mean your energetic wiring is different and how you are seen by spirits in different planes may be different.

From my experience, it does not actually implicate something like servitude in itself as &quot;your destiny,&quot; but things like manifest or energetic transfer can be very &quot;direct&quot; for me, which symbolically makes sense.

No matter how high you ascend, you can always reach higher levels by just increasing the complexity of the system. At a certain point you have a breakthrough, and your complexity loops back around and all of the lower levels become relevant again because you&#039;ll need your *new experience* survival tools to guide you. <br><br>Now, as for this dimension, the place where humans exist in spacetime on a planet called Earth, there is a /kind of/ ultimate truth. Like, sorta ultimate truth. That is that dichotomy and duality are fundamental to life existing at all. That&#039;s it. We, as humans, need to understand that for geometry to exist (and by extension everything in spacetime) there must be two points of view. Whether you call it light or dark or up or down doesn&#039;t matter. The important part is realizing that all the beauty and complexity of life is only possible because of that duality. <br><br>This then leads us to understand that it&#039;s not good versus evil, but one point of view versus it&#039;s negative (-). The dichotomy is actually 2 sides of the same being. That being? It&#039;s you. You are the unity of light and dark.

I assume it&#039;s usually a being of goodness and a kind of messenger for God. In that sense, some humans are that type of &quot;Angel&quot; or at least angelic in their nature. <br><br>Then there are the different alien beings that are profoundly good and want to guide our species as much as they can. Again, I would say some of these beings are worthy of being called Angels. Thoth, Lucifer, Sekhmet, Enoch, even some of the Annunaki could all be considered angelic beings to some extent. They&#039;re messengers, regardless of the physical body they inhabit. <br><br>There&#039;s another kind of being that I&#039;ve heard of that seem to be angelic. These beings have left the cycle of reincarnation, and have elected to not possess 3-dimensional forms. While some beings &#039;quit&#039; reincarnating because they gave up their individuality to merge with a larger mass of souls, the beings I&#039;m talking about have simply stopped needing to progress through 3-dimensional reality. For some of them there aren&#039;t any new experiences for them just yet, so they wait for times of great change and upheaval before they&#039;ll reappear. There are still others who simply do not incarnate and never will; they exist solely in higher dimensions and descending to our level is like being covered in excrement to them. They were described to me as &#039;record-keepers&#039; who maintain the higher systems and mostly keep to themselves. Though they are clearly celestial beings of order, I actually kind of think of them as a little less angelic than the other kinds because they do not act as messengers directly. Instead they&#039;re more like curators. <br><br>There is a fourth type that I&#039;ve heard of, but absolutely have no experiences with and those would be the Archangels. They are not really beings, but manifestations of the emotions of God. These would be all of the &#039;-iel&#039; and &#039;-ael&#039; named entities.

The reader must question whether he could have been privy to the outcome of the Russian workers\u2019 movement before those workers themselves had ever heard of Marx or formed the movement to oppose their masters? And if he was, how could he have such foresight to suggest a World War could simply be brought about and that it could be controlled in such a manner to accomplish his goals? It\u2019s not only highly unlikely but there is nothing of substance to suggest it actually happened. No testimony from anybody else associated with Pike, no other correspondence or writings from Pike himself - literally nothing other than this alleged letter. It should also be noted that other than the general enlightenment movement the only &quot;Illuminati&quot; organization documented within decades of the time-frame of the letter was the Bavarian Illuminati which officially disbanded in 1785. Though conspiracy theories flourish to this day and the term is used in the abstract, serious accusations of the group\u2019s secret continuation had died out at least 50 years before the letter was allegedly written. Out of all the verified Pike literature, only Morals &amp; Dogma makes a fleeting and abstract use of the term Illuminati and this certainly ins\u2019t in he context of some all powerful secret society. So if Pike believed a war must take place for the Illuminati, who are they and what evidence is there to support that they existed and he was a member? Of course some irrational proponents of the &quot;letter&quot; will say they\u2019re a secret. But if they are such a well kept secret, how do (you) know they are/were real?

Terms like Fascism, Nazism and Zionism were never used in Pike&#039;s lifetime. Zionism as a word was coined in 1890 by Nathan Birnbaum and would not take root for several more years. There is no record of Pike knowing or meeting Birnbaum or having any connection to the Zionist movement. The ideological roots of Fascism were only in their infancy during Pike&#039;s final years, and the term was not used publicly until Mussolini took his position in the 1920s. The term Nazism did not emerge until the 1930s with the rise of Germany&#039;s National Socialist party.

During the ride along we got a call for an altered level of consciousness cancer patient. We got in after the medics, she looked sick, had no hair, pale etc, and she was fighting the NPA they were putting in as we walked through the door. The family was explaining that she had a DNR they couldnt find but without the document, it didnt matter. The odor of the house was very distinct, sort of like shit, but not exactly. Cancer smell. So we packed her up. At first I thought she was mad at me as I was trying to take her vitals but at some point I realized my presence there, as some meek and useless observer, taunted her. There I was, young, fit, in my white collared shirt, life ahead of me to do whatever I wanted, and here she was, getting ventilated despite having a DNR. We weren&#039;t even letting her die the way she wanted. She just locked eyes with me, with her big dilated pupils and dark brown eyes. Staring staring staring like black holes. I stared back into them for a while, just watching. I felt like there was some anger there, but there was an emptiness to her eyes as well, like looking into space. <br><br>I got a blood pressure of maybe 60 something over nothing, she had a pulse only in her carotid from what I could tell. The guys told me to stick around at the hospital so maybe I could do CPR on her and &quot;get to feel the bones crunch&quot; but she just laid there in the bed staring at me from 25 feet away. Her eyes boring holes into me from far across the room. Just fixated on me and me alone. <br><br>I mention this because after watching Hereditary I remembered the event very vividly, specifically the womans eyes. For an hour or so immediately after the film, I was somewhat disturbed. <br><br>I believe I went and had a beer and a cheeseburger and felt much better immediately, but yes, I distinctly remember this film bringing back a traumatic experience from my past to the forefront of my attention.

While I was looking at that, I started feeling the vibrations a second time, this time for a few minutes. After they stopped I stayed in that room a bit longer, until my friend came in with a spirit box and started asking the doll questions. I stayed with her for maybe 10 minutes of radio silence until I got bored and decided to leave the satanic area to check out any other exhibits I might have missed (again, not taking any holy water on the way out). I was gone for a few minutes looking at some other mildly interesting stuff, and I went back to see if they\u2019d heard anything over the spirit box. My friend said she could make out two things the doll said while I was gone<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dHide\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dHelp\u201d</span>", "time": 1674528489, "resto": 33915587}, {"no": 33915613, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "3/3<br>this doll is supposed to be possessed by multiple demons, which are supposed to be malevolent.

Although performing all kinds of actions, they are yogis and masters of all their actions. The enlightened sages call those persons wise, whose every action is free from the desire for material pleasures and who have burnt the reactions of work in the fire of divine knowledge. Such people, having given up attachment to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all. Free from expectations and the sense of ownership, with the mind and intellect fully controlled, they incur no sin even though performing actions by their body. Content with whatever gain comes of its own accord, and free from envy, they are beyond the dualities of life. Being equipoised in success and failure, they are not bound by their actions, even while performing all kinds of activities. They are released from the bondage of material attachments and their intellect is established in divine knowledge. Since they perform all actions as a sacrifice (to God), they are freed from all karmic reactions.&quot; BG-4:23. <br>Basically, if you are operating for God it cannot be sin even if its not necessarily going by what you might even personally believe is good or evil. <br>You can escape duality with proper lifestyle, reading a book may provide answers but the difference is is it just going to be sentiment or actually put to use?
