The same applies to religious texts like what I mentioned. The basics that you should remember are that God is the Creator, you are an extension of God and always connected to God (much like a sun ray to the Sun), and so you also have creative power. Your conscious mind is what impresses your subconscious mind, and your subconscious mind (which cannot make decisions, only takes in ideas from the conscious), so the practice of LoA is to control your conscious thoughts, to dictate your subconscious mind, which then influences your life in a loop by creating physical experiences.', 'time': 1670674327, 'resto': 33560642}]",1670674327,/LoA/ — Law of Assumption &amp; Manifestation General,0.0,0.0,

I think it was her period or something. <br><br>I passed out in this 2nd floor day room thing when she was down in the kitchen. You could walk out onto a balcony and there was this storage area in the room which was basically surrounded by one giant window. It was a sunny day. Around three in the afternoon-ish.

I mean just the nicest titties you ever seen. Kind of a tight ass but still thick. Had shape to it. She was wearing this egyptian necklace thing. You know that think they wear where it&#039;s this giant shoulder dress/bib thing with ornate images and gems. Thick lips. A soft, round nose. Grey pupils. <br><br>She smiled at me and then grabbed her tit and moaned. I couldn&#039;t move in the beginning but managed to put my arms on her hips almost against my will. At that point I woke up. <br><br>Wasn&#039;t even close to cumming but I gasped once and then just snapped back into consciousness. When I woke up I was alone on the mattress. It was about 4:30 now.

Does gravity work both ways? Wouldn&#039;t a hollow earth completely change the theory of gravity entirely? Seriously how do they stay on the inside of the walls of the ball? It makes as little sense as gravity does on the surface of a round earth but at least globetards have fake numbers that could work in theory, gravity is still a theory by the way.<br>Meanwhile if the earth is flat and stationary, a hollow earth works because you&#039;re just moving to another level. The north pole hole (and the others like the Tibetan hole, the Antarctica Hole, etc) is just a hole and you descend into Agartha,which is just another flat earth but below the surface, all with it&#039;s own light/heat source.<br>So if you believe hollow earth, you essentially have to accept FE because it simply doesn&#039;t work with a globe. Which is why they don&#039;t want you to question globe earth, because flat earth will only lead to the fact that there are more lands than what they pretend, that we can not only go past the ice wall, but that there are lands beneath us as well.",1668724021248564,.jpg,850,1252,169,250,1670552617677350,1670552617,3e5CCjgUoG6XEwcM1W5FEw==,258577,0,,agartha-only-works-with-flat-earth,63,23,58.0,21.0,"[{'no': 33574228, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:31:37', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33564714"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33564714</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net<wbr>/tierra_hueca/esp_tierra_hueca_9.ht<wbr>m</span><br>Stupidest pseudo-science so far.<br>Its no wonder uneducated christian children are so stupid.', 'time': 1670671897, 'resto': 33564282}, {'no': 33574246, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:36:21', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33564669"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33564669</a><br>kek', 'time': 1670672181, 'resto': 33564282}, {'no': 33574275, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:45:19', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33564282"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33564282</a><br>Agartha is more of a collection of cave systems that interconnect all continents both still above seafloor and those sunken in ancient times<br>A surface egg shell model indeed makes no sense', 'time': 1670672719, 'resto': 33564282}, {'no': 33574303, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:53:40', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33574137"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33574137</a><br><a href=""#p33574152"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33574152</a><br><a href=""#p33574178"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33574178</a><br><a href=""#p33574203"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33574203</a><br>Prove &quot;gravity&quot; is real and causes things to fall.

At one point a frantic caller called in seemingly very distraught said that there was multiple disasters coming to the Earth and that an earlier precursor to the space program had made contact with aliens, but they are not what they claim to be and instead of being extra-terrestrials, they are in fact extra-dimensional beings (fallen angels?) and that they had taken over large portions of the military establishment.

According to Fernando J. Corbató, who worked on Project MAC in 1963, his team was the first to use the term daemon, inspired by Maxwell&#039;s demon, an imaginary agent in physics and thermodynamics that helped to sort molecules, stating, &quot;We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes that worked tirelessly to perform system chores&quot;.[2] Unix systems inherited this terminology. Maxwell&#039;s demon is consistent with Greek mythology&#039;s interpretation of a daemon as a supernatural being working in the background.<br><br>In the general sense, daemon is an older form of the word &quot;demon&quot;, from the Greek δαίμων. In the Unix System Administration Handbook Evi Nemeth states the following about daemons:[3]<br><br> Many people equate the word &quot;daemon&quot; with the word &quot;demon&quot;, implying some kind of satanic connection between UNIX and the underworld. This is an egregious misunderstanding. &quot;Daemon&quot; is actually a much older form of &quot;demon&quot;; daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil, but rather serve to help define a person&#039;s character or personality. The ancient Greeks&#039; concept of a &quot;personal daemon&quot; was similar to the modern concept of a &quot;guardian angel&quot;—eudaemonia is the state of being helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons.<br><br>A further characterization of the mythological symbolism is that a daemon is something that is not visible yet is always present and working its will. In the Theages, attributed to Plato, Socrates describes his own personal daemon to be something like the modern concept of a moral conscience: &quot;The favour of the gods has given me a marvelous gift, which has never left me since my childhood. It is a voice that, when it makes itself heard, deters me from what I am about to do and never urges me on&quot;.[citation needed]', 'time': 1670652414, 'resto': 33572787}, {'no': 33573774, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)03:31:15', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33572787"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33572787</a><br>jews are in control of it, so to answer your question, yes', 'filename': '1654776319925', 'ext': '.jpg', 'w': 728, 'h': 728, 'tn_w': 125, 'tn_h': 125, 'tim': 1670661075343374, 'time': 1670661075, 'md5': '8NVfYVg/16yqySBmn2Mnzg==', 'fsize': 144931, 'resto': 33572787}, {'no': 33574165, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)05:53:25', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33572787"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33572787</a><br>The internet is literally a demon', 'time': 1670669605, 'resto': 33572787}, {'no': 33574177, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)06:01:21', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33574165"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33574165</a><br>And a honey pot.

Hence, we have a clear scriptural indication that the Mark will be a form of medicine delivered through something shaped like a pointed stake.<br><br>Furthermore, the vaccine is associated with &quot;Luciferase&quot;, which is obviously the name of the Beast.

In fact I’ve seen the evil salesman trope a lot and out of pure curiosity wondered if anyone else had a dream about a creepy ass salesman pursuing you and your family/friends over multiple dreams? In my specific dream it was a man with purple hair shaped not unlike Spamton’s, and a yellow plaid jacket and green plaid pants. The tie was like blue or something, also plaid. He would approach AGGRESSIVELY trying to sell a product, and when we turned him down he pulled out a needle and started stabbing at each of us. And we ran.

Google it and look at the various pages that go into how the Golden Ratio and Pi and Euler&#039;s number and the Fine Structure Constant are all built into it. Pyramid can be broken down into two words: pyr and mid, fire in the middle.

I believe it was used to create another universe. Hear me out.<br><br>So imagine planets are birthed from stars, grow old and die just like people. In the lifespan of our solar system we might have 1000 worlds birthed, grow old and die just like Earth. The whole of human history from beginning to end takes place on these worlds. Each world has a mission of creating another Great Pyramid and another universe below it. Time in that smaller universe will move more rapidly. It will see 1000 worlds, each tasked with creating another Great Pyramid and universe and so on, down the infinite multiverse we go. So using sacred geometry and the laws of nature, the gods (or God) creates a procession of universes chasing an infinitely smaller point. <br><br>The End of the age is timed to coincide with the birth of a new planet and the death of the old planet (Earth, in our case).

I will preface this saying I am not a Christian, but my recent deep dive into Kabbalah has made me start to consider the possibility of an occult interpretation of Christianity.<br>Jehovah seems to be very much bound by rules. In 2 Kings, the king of Moab sacrifices his son in order to win a battle, and it works, the Israelites, God&#039;s own chosen, have to back down because the blood magick was that potent. The Carthaginians would sacrifice the highest born, most beautiful, often firstborn boys in times of extreme trouble (which is why I don&#039;t agree with the pro-life comparison of abortion to child sacrifice since it&#039;s usually the lowest type of people who get them done), and although I know Crowley was trolling, his description of a highly intelligent young boy being the most ideal human sacrifice got my noggin-jogging. <br><span class=""quote"">&gt;What&#039;s a king to a god?</span><br>If a beautiful royal is the ideal human sacrifice, what about God, not a God, but the supreme god, in the form of a young royal, being offered as a sacrifice?

The concept of humans becoming gods, gaining in power, through the blood-sacrifice of God.

They have a natural negative chthonic field which can allow others to dowse them. They have sharp pointed incisor teeth which is distinct from most other individuals. They can see their own souls reflected in the æther, this appears as a red flame, smoke, mist for women and a blue flame, smoke, mist for men. They are more intelligent and vigorous than average. Most significant historical figures since the dawn of time were Vampires, they are the natural nobility of this world. Most Vampires don’t know that they are one due to a hundreds of years long conspiracy to eradicate and erase our people entirely, including the regular folk.<br><br>Thread theme:<br>https://youtu.be/VJhgwxSTHDs",41320031114_5c23d2efdf_b,.jpg,991,1024,241,250,1670626976060805,1670626976,6jE0fjJwivuTzAYmNa0rJw==,502891,0,,gv-genuine-vampirism-vi,20,3,15.0,3.0,"[{'no': 33571619, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)20:59:56', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33570756"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33570756</a><br>why do you vampires have extra pointed teeth if you don&#039;t drink blood? frankly, it sounds like the teeth are going to waste', 'time': 1670637596, 'resto': 33570578}, {'no': 33572012, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)22:02:00', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33571587"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33571587</a><br>what is dowsing.<br>how do i know if im a vampire tho, i got pretty pointy canines id say. but also i got a vamp vibe i think. goth vamp vibe sunken eyes sorta vibe', 'time': 1670641320, 'resto': 33570578}, {'no': 33573216, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)01:39:42', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33570578"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33570578</a><br>lol the vurries are back! you&#039;re worse than the oinkler on pol.', 'time': 1670654382, 'resto': 33570578}, {'no': 33573227, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)01:41:06', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33570578"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33570578</a><br>you know this only appeals to losers right? of course you do. you need a bunch of losers to distract people from real vampires.', 'time': 1670654466, 'resto': 33570578}, {'no': 33573240, 'now': '12/10/22(Sat)01:43:43', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p33570578"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;33570578</a><br>just a reminder there was a document dump on x about real vamps whe these larptards started coming out of the woodwork. this is inauthentic cringe astroturfing, and if it appeals to you, that is proof positive that you are a gullible tool.', 'time': 1670654623, 'resto': 33570578}]",1670654623,/GV/ Genuine Vampirism VI,0.0,0.0,

Over time your mind will start building a phosphorescent map of your body, and you will see a subtle glow in your vision that can be shaped into astral spells and various psychic constructs, some of which will be useful for interacting with spirits. To attract the attention of a spirit, think its name a lot, and try to feel in your heart a knowing of love and how the soul of that being relates to your own. The sort of soul energy from the heart is very beautiful attractive to many spirits, so be careful who you contact as they might not ever want to leave. That is perhaps, the reason the circle and banishing rituals are important. Shamans work with spirits and are possessed by them, but a magician is supposed to be in charge and to command the spirits to his bidding, so shouldn&#039;t default to forming such entanglements.
