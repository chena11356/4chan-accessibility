When I said the soul returns to God, I meant that the soul returns completely divested of the body, mind, and ego of the person that the soul or spirit had been instilled in. So &quot;we&quot; are not returning to God if condemned if you consider &quot;we&quot; as our bodies, our sense of self, and our egos. When the soul of a condemned person goes back, there is no more &quot;we&quot; with it. Everything of that person gets destroyed. I&#039;m not saying somehow we go to hell, get cleansed, then get to go to Heaven. <br><br>And, I&#039;d like to say that you are so fixated on these points, but that they are minor compared to the overall point that I was making, which I will repeat after this. And I mean they are minor in that we arehaving to connect dots, and they aren&#039;t our business, and that they don&#039;t effect how we need to carry ourselves or worship God now. God decides who goes to heaven or hell and how exactly that works. If He wanted to make it a &quot;place&quot;, I&#039;m sure He could. I just think Jesus indicated it was more an inner state that goes with us everywhere, as opposed to a place. The state of being in permanent and full communion with God is what sounds like Heaven to me, and this would make any place heaven, would it not? <br><br>The orginal post I responded to said how can we tolerate that our relatives will suffer in hell for eternity. My point was that, if someone does not even believe they have an eternal spirit, and that they mock even the existence of a Holy Spirit, then why should they (or we) care that they suffer eternally with no Holy Spirit within them? They didn&#039;t even believe in eternal life or a Holy spirit anyway. So they lost something they never wanted anyway. It&#039;s like if a child gets a gift and shows nothing but contempt over and over.

It must be a succubus but I just can feel that it&#039;s been Lilith. I&#039;m a very very depressed and lonely person, dont leave my apt, no friends, family, or gf but I swear that Succubus general changed me somehow. I believe I&#039;ve attracted the attention of Lilith. <br>Normally every day is fucking pain and misery but since I&#039;ve felt her presence I&#039;ve honestly been relatively happy for a long time.. was reeling over a bad breakup a year ago that still affected me and stuff like that but I feel as though whatever spirit attached itself (I believe to be Lilith or one of her daughters) to me has almost completely taken those feelings of sadness away. <br><br>In gratitude I&#039;ve been giving Lilith nightly offerings of chocolate and saying her Enn throughout the day. She is all I think about now, all day every day Lilith is in my mind and i just dont really think of much else. Nothing in particular I&#039;m thinking about her, just her. Please tell me anons, what&#039;s your take on my situation? This seems to have done an astonishing amount of good in such a short period of time.

I can count, but yesterday it was special<br><br>1) how I did it:<br>I lie down on my back , I put white noise on my earphones and put a scarf on my eyes to block any light, and I decided to move as little as possible without it being uncomfortable, for example I can scratch an itch and swallow and basically move just how I want if necessary, I just didn&#039;t turn around and stayed on my back, every few minutes I did that sleeping technique where you tense your entire body subsequently and then relax, one important thing I did was actively having a monologue about things that happened in the day, about random stuff I could speak about to myself, and nothing too exciting like philosophical questions or subjects that get me angry.<br>I was also breathing through my nose slowly to simulate sleep breathing.<br><br>For 30 mins, nothing interesting happened, I had some random semi-vivid images in my head that sometimes were moving like a video, and then few minutes later , I felt like I wasn&#039;t breathing well enough through so I wanted to open my mouth, and this is where it began<br><br>2) the experience:<br>My entire body was paralyzed, which is nothing new to me, but this time, I wasn&#039;t bombarded by loud explosions and strong sensations, instead the white noise on my earphones morphed into familiar voices and sounds of children laughing and playing around, I knew very well that I was hallucinating sounds, in fact, I&#039;ve never been this conscious in hypnogogia before, I knew very well what was happening to me, I knew how much time had passed, what I did in the day, what I was thinking about just a few minutes when I was awake, but one thing I forgot which is that my vision was blocked by that scarf, so I believed that I was actually seeing my

There&#039;s the common belief that cannabis enhances psychedelics, but I really don&#039;t think this is true anymore. It just clouds the experience. Taking acid or mushrooms almost allows you to be more clear-headed than you normally are when you&#039;re sober. That&#039;s why people call them mind expanding. Cannabis counteracts this but still infuses you with extra energy which can make things go awry. After I had my bad trip and subsequent psychotic break, I made sure to take acid again a year later, and since that bad trip I&#039;ve probably tripped 5-7 times. The one thing I have noticed upon reflecting back on these trips, as well as uncomfortable or weird trips (but not horrendously bad) before my really bad trip, was that things always started going wrong AFTER I smoked a lot of weed on the trip. I found that if I tripped and didn&#039;t smoke weed, I usually wouldn&#039;t descend into that paranoid state.

Let me take this time to first let you know I AM NOT AN EXPERT. There are many things I cannot do at all or consistently. But hopefully you can find some information that helps you.<br><br>I&#039;ll start with the concept of shutting yourself up to experience travel. Everyone does this although they may not realize it. Being able to do so completely and for a long duration of time will equate to more things you can do. What&#039;s most important is learning how to recognize Silence.<br><br>How do you know when you are Silent? Truthfully it&#039;s difficult and particular to you. I can only do so partially for a while without help. (We can talk about help, but I will say only ask if you can at least go partially Silent by yourself.) You know that voice in your head reminding you of dishes, laundry, that essay due in a week? That&#039;s part of it. That earworm song you just can&#039;t get out of your head? Also part of it. Scenes replaying in your head is also part of it. However this is hardly a complete list, and it may be different for you. I have two layers: the verbal (and learned) mind chatter and the symbolic (my innate) mind chatter. There are techniques that help get rid of these things, but it will take time and practice none the less.<br><br>Once you start actually shutting yourself up, you will notice weird colors around. They may swirl or billow -some sort of movement- and they may be dull or bright. If you see it at all, you are at least a little successful. Using glownigger speak, this is entering hypnogogia. This is always step one. From there, I just did and observed to get where I am.<br><br>Now some questions for you, Apanon:<br>1. How long ago have you noticed the caves?<br>2.
