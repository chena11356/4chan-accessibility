Upon arrival, we were placed in a rental near a beautiful supermarket and my drive to work was scenic and I met a fellow \u201cIT Technician\u201d that was from Eastern Europe and did not speak a lot of English. I quickly realized that something was weird but did not place any interest in destroying my own career within the first few weeks I was there. My fellow colleague started mentioning the name Jeps. I found out that Jeps was the billionaire Mr. Jerry was talking about. After a while, we figured out that the person who owned the property was a man named Jeffrey Epstein. We knew this as we had to sign-off a parcel sent to the location with the name Jeffrey Edward Epstein. At this time, the internet was not swarmed with information about Epstein and the only thing we knew was that he was caught for \u201cprostitution\u201d in the United States but there has been no word about it for some time. Honestly, we did not care and continued to set up a private VPS within the building and did the wiring to all the rooms. The place was quite a wreck.<br><br>Nothing was out of place or felt extremely weird up until the last two weeks we were there. Several people arriving in Real Estate vehicles started working on the interior of the house and almost all color was stripped from the walls. Single mattresses were placed in rooms and dark curtains covered the windows. We shrugged it off as a billionaire looking for a place to get down to some dirty shit but nothing more. Looking back at it, that was probably a trafficking hub and we were there to equip the place for state-of-the-art surveillance devices. We left - and I never heard of Mr. Jerry again.

I used to be part of a group of &quot;friends&quot; that talked at eachother&#039;s backs all the time and had constant infighting. Since I essentially left that group my mental wellbeing has drastically improved. This is, funnily, around the time I learned about the one who would become my SP.<br>That said, EYPO. I won&#039;t say you divided them but they did in your inner world, so they could just as well be reunited.<br><br>But I think this is just like one of those &quot;Manifest my ex back&quot; stories. Can you do it? Absolutely, I managed to do so. My ex went from saying they weren&#039;t attracted to me and blocking me, to contacting me out of the blue, apologizing, complimenting my looks and inviting me over. But in the meanwhile I&#039;ve become a completely different person and started to manifest the new SP. So I just politely friendzoned my ex. The manifestation gurus would say I &quot;revised&quot; them. Did I? Well, I simply lived in the assumption the ex was in a bad place in their life and were lying to themselves- when they apologized they essentially did repeat the first half of that.<br><br>So it&#039;s the same with your friends, any relationship can of course be an SP. You can manifest them back, but if you haven&#039;t worked on yourself and your assumptions you&#039;ll also manifest back their past infighting and grudges.<br>Or you can manifest new friends without all the baggage. A lot of people here will say not to manifest a *specific* SP (SSP?) period, but I agree with NevilleGoddess who in a video neatly differentiates between old SSPs (ex BFs/GFs, ex friends, etc) and whole new SSPs. She recommends against the former (she tried to do so herself, only to stop wanting her ex-BF back) but says nothing against the latter. But you are God and ultimately you decide what&#039;s best for you. Paraphrasing NGoddess once more, don&#039;t seek guidance from others because you already have all answers within you.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling. If I make it through it&#039;ll be amusing to end up on the equator I suppose. I&#039;ve got a 7 week old child now, so there&#039;s no choice but to try and make it through.<br><br>I&#039;m glad you took the time to post this.

The flows of this metal in and out of the core, and around it (through convective processes), generates a magnetic field.<br><br>(2) The Coriolis effect and the combined magnetic and electrical generation of these processes keep the movement (very) roughly circular around the axis of rotation. If it was driven solely by convection and the Coriolis effect it would remain very stable for a long time, but the effect of powerful local magnetic fields and electric currents is able to disrupt this circular flow. If this flow is disrupted in one place, it is likely to disrupt in other places, leading to a complete destabilization of flow around the core-mantle boundary. Thus, the field collapses (no more circular flow). However, convection means the process starts up again, possibly in a different direction, possibly in the same direction.<br>(3) There&#039;s plenty of geological evidence to show that pole reversals can occur very quickly, and that on average they take 100-150 years to complete.

First, it takes a weaker and weaker flare to produce a Carrington type event due to weaker shielding.

We are currently passing through the galactic midplane (an electromagnetic plane created by the supermassive star/black hole cluster at the center of the galaxy) which carries a substantial load of interstellar dust. This dust is not conjecture, it is here, and astronomists have been reporting it for about a year now. <br><br>The sun is essentially a large nuclear fire. What happens what you throw a bunch of very cold, flammable dust on a fire? I&#039;ve had bonfires at -40, and I&#039;ll tell you: first the fire dampens, then the fire gets much bigger than before and very quickly. The same would occur if you were to bombard the sun with a high amount of cosmic dust - the outer shell would cool, the sun would dim, and then the built up energy in the interior would catch up, the shell would warm up enough, and a &quot;small&quot; explosion would occur in which the outer shell of the sun is cast off. <br><br>There are two things to note here:<br>First, we have observed that the two nearest stellar neighbors to pass through the midplane ahead of us flared. They didn&#039;t flare bright enough to call it a super nova, but they flared too much to write it off as a random event or error. They flared in sequence, relative to the time they entered the galactic midplane.<br><br>Second: If the outer shell of the sun were to cool, the sun would dim. It may dim so much that the sun itself would turn dark red, possibly even black, dark enough that you could look directly at the sun. Instead of the normal luminescent star you would see a dark circle halo&#039;d by the dust particles and field interaction lines created by the powerful electromagnetic interactions of the sun.<br><br>In short, the Black Sun is most likely an ancient symbol from the last time this happened.", "time": 1671137327, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614388</a><br>Nahhhh.

There is not much error in when this happens - we&#039;re doing it right now.<br><br>As for the crustal displacement theory: the crust is essentially held in place on the mantle by a combination of friction with the partially solid upper mantle and weak electric forces. Solar energy input through the solar-terrestrial magnetic electric circuit can heat up the upper mantle and disrupt these forces, causing the crust to locally displace (pretty much every earthquake over 6.0 is associated with space weather energy inputs). A large enough solar energy input (from a micronova, perhaps) theoretically can liquefy the entire upper mantle and cause the entire crust to detach. Then what happens?

The epic heroes, the dreams and legends, the fairytales and the soul of our blood. Ourselves inside us. Awakening once more through mythical powers. Every misuse creates a catastropy in our souls of cosmic dimensions. The sience of the inner mind is not called Psychology, but Myth. It concers the battle between ice and fire. Between the fire of the blood in our hearts against the ice of cold reason. The World Ice Theory speaks to those humans to whom the christian guilt idea aswell the idea of pure expedience is alien. This breed of men opposes nature with strenght, never avoids it neither through the forced shame of asceticism and humility nor through soley sensual gratifications of the moment. It posesses all the superiority of the nordic character. It looks with fresh, lively and couragous eyes into the heart forbidding experiences of a dramatic nature. Hidden behind this taciturn and unbending features there is a secret existence of true human. A wonderful toughness of healthy life resistance. A true kindness and always faithful comradeship of strong-willed men. They are polar people who feel comfortable under the ancient nordic law of fate. Bold, not tired. Intact, never chatty.

But what actually triggers those positives is highly questionable. People are more likely to TAKE the tests when they&#039;re ill or suspect they might be ill, so if illness and heightened production of mucous somehow contribute to a higher chance of a positive test, maybe it is detecting some sort of illness, but I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s this &quot;novel&quot; &quot;virus&quot; CoV-Sars2.<br><br>Many in the alternative health field seem to think skin rashes can be related to &#039;expelling toxins&#039;, or some sort of bodily cleansing process.

I didn&#039;t think of this at the time because I jumped immediately to the conclusion that I had a &quot;virus&quot; (though I don&#039;t read the news, so didn&#039;t think of covid at the time). I think this is another case of selective perception, selective memory, and the bias of interpretation excluding possibly REAL causes of illness.

This means taking responsibility for all actions and reflecting on all emotions. The cultural narrative of \u201cmen don\u2019t have feelings\u201d is a trap meant to keep you in a consumer loop. You can\u2019t reflect if you don\u2019t explore your emotions and their root. Understanding your emotions unravels everyone else\u2019s around you. Do you see the advantage here? It supersedes money.<br><br>2) Stop complaining. This pairs with taking responsibility. Air conditioning too cold? Adjust it or adapt, don\u2019t complain. <br><br>3) Fuck your comfort. Too many \u201cmen\u201d will bitch and moan about something not being perfect. Not attractive. These are the types that truly believe they\u2019re in control and will do anything to maintain that belief. They will justify poor behavior when at its core it stems from being uncomfortable and not knowing how to properly adapt. This cannot be faked and is 100% something that men of a higher perspective can read instantly.

I don&#039;t care if this steps on any toes, it&#039;s a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn&#039;t Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a &quot;front&quot; for their activities.&quot; Svali <br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/welcome/child-page/<br><br>\u201c...and as you join Freemasonry, initially they&#039;ll tell you that their G, the G in the square and compass, means God. But then as you go up through the levels, they&#039;ll tell you, &#039;Oh, this stands for Gnosis, knowledge.&#039; But then when you get higher up it stands for the Generative principle, which means, buggering little boys. And I&#039;m not saying that on my own authority. I spoke with the highest ranking Freemason to defect to Christianity, Jim Shaw, he was a 33rd degree Freemason, and I had a number of conversations over the phone with him about Freemasonry.

They actually ring a bell for me to the extent, where at some point his suggestions, descriptions connected for me with Crowley&#039;s visit to Mexico, taking mescaline and, possibly, forming an order there. Just like Bruno did with freemasons. Practices of memory, induction of states described by don Juan, Crowley&#039;s practices all seem to me to utilize same mechanisms with same results, though goals might differ a lot.<br><br>I think in some sense goals (and metaphysical explanations used to support them) do not matter that much, as a practitioner transcends them into a result that has little to do with those explanations. Or at least with his understandings of these explanations. So however wildly different goals of Bruno, Freemasons, Crowley-Raja-Yoga and Castaneda are, they connect at the point where practice starts and outcomes of different aggregate states of the mind happen. So even though it might be just fairy tales, these are quite potent fairy tales, that can deliver same energy as Bruno, and hint at same things.<br><br>If we&#039;re talking about actual Indians, well, I personally just find it not that interesting, but you&#039;re probbly right, he might be not so accurate.", "time": 1671052144, "resto": 33598097}, {"no": 33607477, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)16:13:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33607330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33607330</a><br>It&#039;s in the name!<br>&quot;Introduction to Magic&quot;", "time": 1671052410, "resto": 33598097}, {"no": 33607490, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)16:15:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33607288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33607288</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s not really academic and it&#039;s not really a world overview.</span><br>Beggars/choosers.

In the culmination of the incident where I devoured everything I deemed negative within him (after which he broke down as he realised how delusional he&#039;d been), it was as though leaving my vessel: my physical body lost consciousness, and I was an enormous chaotic black blob with hints of red, seeping into every crevice of his soul, swallowing his negative energy, upon which it was immediately made unrecognisable by the unrelenting cataclysm within me, simply becoming a part of it. I understood that this is my true form, and for some reason, it didn&#039;t really bother me, and I didn&#039;t stop to think about what it means until now.<br><br>Yesterday I confronted my higher self, or perhaps vice versa. I realised that the aforementioned blob is just the aura (almost completely opaque), and deep within it is what resembles a person. This person was frantic, and although he/she only screeched and snarled rather than speaking with words, I understood the cause of his/her dismay: &quot;Lilith is trying to take the pain away.

As such, I&#039;m dependent on his attention and frequent reminders of his appreciation for my mental stability.

And it wasnt a normal wet dream , it was a very intense sexual feelling i never experienced in a dream before. I wished to wake up but before losing the dream state i heared that same voice saying &quot;it is not that simple, do you wish to give up on your desire&quot;. I expressed that no , i do not want to give up on it. At which point the voice said &quot;say yes&quot;. Which i did. It said &quot;good&quot;. And i woke up .

After the first few years, my father took me away to raise me on his own in another town. He didn&#039;t want me to take after my mother, so as I grew up, he often referred to her with harsh words and warned me that I shouldn&#039;t become like her. I sometimes wanted to ask him: &quot;What&#039;s so bad about wanting to make people feel good?&quot;, but I kept that to myself.<br><br>My father was summoned for war. I looked after his house by myself, awaiting his return. Eventually, I received word that he died in battle.<br><br>It was difficult to mourn his death while living alone, but the townspeople were kind to me. Eventually, as savings were running low, I began to wonder what I should do from here on out. I decided to ignore my father&#039;s warning and let my mother&#039;s line of work inspire me after all.<br><br>While socialising with the townspeople, I&#039;d keep an eye out for men who seemed kind but troubled. I&#039;d approach them in private and inform them of my services: conversation over a massage for a small fee, over at my house. If they actually visited and seemed like they were interested in more, I&#039;d tell them I offer sexual services as well.<br><br>I enjoyed making people feel good while they let out their worries. I was rather sensitive to people&#039;s energy, which allowed me to intuitively develop tantric techniques to heal and soothe people spiritually at the same time. I refrained from engaging in coitus with my clients for a multitude of reasons, instead using other means to pleasure them.<br><br>One of my clients was a married man; I hadn&#039;t invited him personally, but apparently one of my other clients had recommended me to him.

Long story short, about a year ago I summoned a succubus simply by putting my intention out there mentally. I didn&#039;t actually go through any rituals. For a few weeks, I&#039;d be in bed and this succubus would essentially pleasure me, all mentally of course, but felt real as hell. In the end, we agreed that I wasn&#039;t comfortable with it and couldn&#039;t provide them a permanent relationship as I would still like one with a real woman, and they went away without issue. Cue a few weeks ago and they pop back into my head while trying to sleep and essentially ask if I&#039;m down for some no-attachment fondling and talking. After that night, they&#039;re off again. Cue last night, when there&#039;s a thread in /r9k/ about the youngest age robots would be willing to sleep with. 16 is a common answer (legal is probably why) and I respond much the same. I talk to young women (16-24 is most common) all day, every day, and it&#039;s a ton of fun, but also not likely to go anywhere. They do flirt often and I have been asked out by young girls before, but of course I always decline because despite being legal, dating 16 year old girls is generally frowned upon and for good reason. Kinda like that ideal you look towards but never actually want or expect to get. Then going to bed last night, guess who shows up again. She makes it clear that she knows my desires and being a succubus, there is no taboo to her. Tells me she just wants me to be happy and sexually fulfilled, even if that means she&#039;s inevitably out of the picture.

Plan basically boils down to spending time finding a suitable long-term partner, but just for fun, in the mean-time, she&#039;s going to setup trysts with multiple younger girls. Her exact words (+ or - a few here or there) were: &quot;You can&#039;t hide from me. I know how much you like those little girls. I want you and them to explore each other mutually, and I&#039;ll make sure anyone that might take issue, is also persuaded. I can setup a mother-daughter play-time with you if you like. We&#039;re going to have a lot of fun.&quot; From what I understand, no isn&#039;t an option. Even if I don&#039;t go for it, she&#039;s going to persuade these girls anyway.

When prodded on why such interest in me, it essentially boiled down to (paraphrased): &quot;I like and take interest in you, because you didn&#039;t turn into a love-bitten fool just because I pleasured you. You are still a person outside me and still seek interest in women. Love is not a meaningful word to me the same way it is to you, but I certainly like you in ways I don&#039;t like others. This is my gift because I can.&quot; Personally, I think I&#039;m crazy as a bed-bug, but this shit feels real as hell and I&#039;ve never had any previous signs of mental illness. If I&#039;m to accept her word for it, this is no-strings attached, simply because she can.

For C I&#039;d feel like I&#039;m screwing over both parties. I&#039;d rather just wait for them to find the right opportunity to manifest in a physical form.

I consider 16-18 to be young. They often start flirting with me as I&#039;m handsome as fuck. Not my own opinion, I&#039;ve been told this by women for years, but inside I&#039;m a robot struggling to succeed. I only start flirting back if I can gauge the reaction of the people they&#039;re with. Almost always with their mom. After a couple of years doing this job, I&#039;ve learned that the moms are weirdly ok with these exchanges, especially if I take the time to occasionally look them in the eye, smile and include them. I&#039;d say 18-21 is actually the most attractive age range as they can also carry a half-way decent conversation, but there&#039;s something delightfully devilish about the idea of fucking a 16 year old, even though it&#039;s more a fantasy. Not to say I wouldn&#039;t if there were no repercussions, but fantasies are often best kept as fantasies. Not interested at all in younger than that, but from the sounds of it, my succ wants to send them anyway and I can turn them down if I don&#039;t want them. Makes me think it&#039;s like a temptation thing--like how depraved can I get. She does make a point to comment on how she can provide opportunities for all sorts of sexual exploration that most never even consider, but I never take those avenues opened to me. Sounds like she enjoys the whole process either way. As for my job, I think part of the reason nobody minds or cares about flirting with the girls is that it&#039;s not a position of authority yet it&#039;s a respectable job (i.e. I&#039;m not working retail) Sorry, I&#039;m not going to expose what it is, but it&#039;s a sweet gig even outside that and nobody ever even considers it.

Like an example or</span><br>As of yet the Religion of Creativity is only a dream. However I can give insight into the fundamental process of human creativity.<br>Human consciousness is an evolutionary process where question, choice, and action correspond to mutation, selection, and reproduction in biological evolution. A question is a request for information, our entire sense-experience is the result of a request for information by our nervous system, and constantly mutates our consciousness. We can also actively mutate our consciousness by asking questions of our experiences, actions, choices, and ideas, and follow the resulting lines of inquiry to apprehend new possibilities previously beyond our immediate reach. From there, the selective mechanism of choice eliminates possibilities until one option is chosen to be expressed as an action.<br><br>There are two unhealthy versions of this process. In one, choice is favored at the expense of questioning, resulting in a progressive whittling-down of variation until stagnation is reached - this process is all selection with minimal mutation. Also one can start with a desired answer, and ask questions about how to confirm it - this is the method of confirmation bias. The healthy process must start by questioning experience.<br><br>The implication of this is to promote freedom, promote inquiry. Seek The Unknown, among the most profound experiences of which is wonder. The world is filled with endless opportunities for wonder, but to find them requires a conscious effort to shake-up your routines and get out of your comfort zone. Perhaps understanding the supreme importance of questioning and seeking The Unknown for your freedom could motivate you. Wonder is the carrot, the stick is the risk of being enslaved by your own stagnant thoughts and habits, or the stagnant thoughts and habits of others.", "time": 1671183424, "resto": 33606325}, {"no": 33618869, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What about us, stuck here in 4chan?

Creativity is a way of looking that is outside of language, thoughts, concepts, time etc. you simply look. Everything becomes strange and new with each moment. That is the state of presence Eckhart Tolle speaks of, the thoughtless place of awareness where you simply perceive what is, including thoughts and visions, without getting sucked into them, but keeping your distance, aware that you are aware. In that way you see things you have no words or concepts for everywhere you look and the only way to know them is to know them outside of any structure the mind can conceive of. It&#039;s from this place that a structure can generate to point at what generated it, though it is not it itself, and is perishable.<br><a href=\"#p33618295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33618295</a><br>Tolle mentioned the way a child sees in a video I saw.

Heavy jupiter theme in this chart: lots of planets in jupiter&#039;s sign sag but even mars, ruler of the ascendant, is in jupiter&#039;s sign of pisces. Jupiter trines both the ascendant and ascendant ruler. Moon and jupiter swap sign rulerships, meaning there is more harmony there than is seen by the aspects of the chart. Extremely heavy jupiter influence. That jupiter is in the 8th house which is tricky to interpret so I&#039;ll just give some key words: death, sex, rebirth, inheritance, secrets, other people&#039;s things, occultism, transformation. Using whole signs instead of Placidus it would be in the 9th house of higher education and focus. Anything involving this jupiter will have a massive effect so look out for planets transiting over it.<br><br>Your moon is in a T-square with mars and saturn, bringing stress and pain to emotional life, the mind, memories, and such. The T-square brings tension which is released opposite the midpoint, in this case the 10th house.

That&#039;s good, however there is difficult aspects to mars and saturn, so to use this good mercury you might have to work with those other planet&#039;s challenges. Jupiter is looking good as well in it&#039;s own sign somewhat near the moon in the 7th house of relationships. These mercury and jupiter placements are good for finances and love. Venus is in cancer, sign of the moon, and the moon being with Jupiter looks good for this venus. Can&#039;t see too many problems except for this Saturn-Mars thing, and Saturn in the 10th might not be so great for career, but yet again it&#039;s in Jupiter&#039;s sign and Mars is in Mercury&#039;s sign so maybe it all evens out.

It seems that even when we read Plato\u2019s works, specifically the Republic and some of his other dialogues, he talks about reincarnation and the same type of abstract conceptualization of \u201cGod\u201d, that earlier Indo-Europeans talked of, when describing The Source, or Brahma. I am wondering if there was some sort of primordial knowledge passed down through the tribes that through the telephone game of time and culture and oral passing on of this stuff, not only did it get confused, distorted and muddied, but then became monopolized by Mystery Cults and such, because when reading all of these different varied spiritual texts from the Vedas to Christian works, Kabbalistic and Hermetic works, etc. It seems like the same general things are being expressed. But the texts I have highlighted here I think help further exemplify the ancient knowledge of cyclical disasters and how they play out.

Now on to the interesting stuff:<br><br>In Manly P. Hall\u2019s Secret Teachings of all Ages, he describes in detail what can be gleaned about the Eleusianian mysteries. Here are some interesting quotes:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dThe soul of man- often called Psyche, and in the Eleusinian Mysteries symbolized Persephone- Is essentially a spiritual thing. Its true home is in the higher worlds, where, free from the bondage of material form and material concepts, it is said to be truly alive and self-expressive.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The human, or physical, nature of man, according to this doctrine, is a tomb, a quagmire, a false and impermanent thing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The source of all sorrow and suffering. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plato describes the body as the sepulcher of the soul; and by this he means not only the human form but also human nature.</span><br>So already we can see a general similarity between hindu/buddhist doctrine here, the world is suffering, etc, etc, and that it comes from somewhere outside of the physical reality. But as we shall see, it also seems like the legend of Persephone can also be hinting at the idea of metempsychosis, or reincarnation:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dThe gloom and depression of the Lesser Mysteries represented the agony of the spiritual soul unable to express itself because it has accepted the limitations and illusions of the human environment.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dThe crux of the Eleusinian argument was that man is neither better nor wiser after death than during life. If he does rise above ignorance during his sojourn here, man goes at death into eternity to wander about forever, making the same mistakes which he made here\u2026</span>", "time": 1671128241, "resto": 33613287}, {"no": 33613369, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)13:21:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33613337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33613337</a><br>(5/?)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dJust as Narcissus, gazing at himself in the water (the ancients used this mobile element to symbolize the transitory, illusionary, material universe) lost his life trying to embrace a reflection, so man, gazing into the mirror of Nature and accepting as his real self the senseless clay that he sees reflected, loses the opportunity afforded by physical life to unfold his immortal, invisible Self.\u201d</span><br>where I think a clear distortion or at the very least a conscious idealistic shift from the Primordial Tradition can be seen in the Eastern ideas vs. the Greco-Roman due to time and cultural changes. But this next part he writes is very curious and if we look at the bare bones of the Eastern tradition\u2019s idea of how most people in their suffering and delusion here in the material let themselves be ruled over by passions that ultimately become net negatives on them spiritually.(Also note Aristotle\u2019s Ethics and his discussion on the passions and people who are incontinent, etc.)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201dAn ancient initiate once said that the living are ruled by the dead.

If we take all these and more into account, start to look at all of these texts from above, we start to get a general picture of what seems to be going on. The cyclical destruction by the universe of the habitable world and an Elect being safe from this destruction and returning once the dust has settled to try and re-create a utopian world, but which always seems to succumb to the worldly lusts that are part and parcel with existence itself. Maybe if we take all of these texts, what they say, into account, regardless of dogmas be it Abrahamic, Graeco-Roman or Eastern, we see not only a map of how the cosmic order re-sets itself periodically, but a lifestyle that helps us be more able to not just come to terms with this but also live spiritually in a way that isn\u2019t pathological towards ourselves and others and is more enriching, and can help us mentally, physically, spiritually evolve to be stronger and try and overcome these titanic hurtles that life throws at us. In some ways, Nietzsche\u2019s writings, the Hermetic texts, Eastern spiritual texts, the words of Jesus, all of these give us a blueprint, a caricature if you will, to mold ourselves into, to follow, to evolve and adapt to this and hopefully transcend. Or it\u2019s just all just documenting \u201cElites\u201d who have sequestered this information to be ahead of the curve, gtfo when the shit starts to hit the fan, then re-emerge once everything\u2019s settled down some, and re-create themselves as Gods which then re-starts the whole cycle over again, and all of these mystery religions, occult schools, fraternal institutions, are just means of psychological control of the masses to further domesticate us until the next cataclysm happens and they do it all over again.

All the while I made sure I had my 100% daily value of selenium.<br><br>You will necessarily need to consume all of your daily need of selenium if you ever decide to consume 50 milligrams of iodine for long periods of time. You will permanently damage your thyroid if you do not.<br><br>I am still wondering if it is healthy or even necessary to continue consume 50 milligrams of iodine longer than three months.

I am, of course, loathe to trust Yahweh and his flock&#039;s tales, but it would be equally unwise to just ignore centuries of... untoward stories. So, what do you believe she desires?

They offer nothing anymore in a sense, but they will grow more popular in the coming years because no one else is fertile. Hegel &gt; Schopenhauer &gt; Nietzsche already cut the cord of these faiths however and what you&#039;re left with is atavism and the sheer oddity of Christianity. The great challenge of the west lies in determining if this will against irl sacrifice, as Christians were the only faith of any sort (really a synchronization of IE and Semitic spirituality in practice) to completely turn away from human instinct and do something completely different. Rene Girard is a good source to read about on this topic. Anyway, it&#039;s a riddle that must be solved sooner or later. My bet, as a humanist of sorts, is that entropy and degeneration will rule the west for some time. Certainly our lifetimes, the deal is sealed. New social orders all nihilistic at base of turning against our nature will rise up (such as the faggot kneelers, mass migration shills, etc) in the way that new mutations do in a sick body.

He said that he wanted to know if I was down to drive to the local Wal-Mart with him, to which I complied and hopped in the backseat.

Inside was the usual appearance of a large Wal-Mart store, but to our right as we entered was this strange museum exhibit. It had a bunch of strange fossils and old tools in display cases that lined the area it was in in a sort of \u201cU\u201d shape. We looked at the fossils, and then the goth chick told me to follow her while my buddy was still observing the fossils. I, again, complied and followed her, where we entered a laundry sort of room, with a couple of washing machines and baskets of clothing or white towels and sheets.<br><br>After we both entered, she started speaking to me of how much she was solely \u201cinterested\u201d in me. I only remember that she said that word rather than any other. It wasn\u2019t truly in a romantic context, but it did seem like she was trying to say that she wanted to know me better, or something along those lines. I don\u2019t remember much of our conversation after that, but she did then ask if I could help her wash the clothes that were in the room, to which I accepted and shoved the clothes into the washers.<br>(Continued in my next reply.)", "time": 1671124311, "resto": 33612117}, {"no": 33612950, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)12:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33612117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33612117</a><br><br>After we were out of the laundry room, my friend came along and we followed him back to the car, as he had done his shopping while we \u201cdid the laundry.\u201d (I don\u2019t know why this Wal-Mart had a laundry room.)<br><br>We got back in the car, but now another friend of my buddy was driving. He was this Albanian guy with short hair wearing a leather jacket and some jeans, and a pair of glasses (kind of looked like Elliot Rodger but also like an Albanian badass biker.) He spoke in an accent and took us all to his house. The house was a one-room home. There was a living room, a little corner of the home for a kitchen, a mini fridge next to the couch of the living room, and a big bed in the corner. It was dimly lit by a lamp that gave off a similar shine to the street lamp from the start of the dream. There was also a large Albanian flag behind the couch on the wall, and in front of the couch was a TV playing old SpongeBob episodes.<br><br>He invited us inside, although my friend said he had to go home for the night, so he filled the mini fridge with the groceries he bought and drove off. The Albanian dude asked if me and the goth chick wanted to stay for the night. Out of a sense of curiosity and the feeling of coziness the home was filled with, we accepted and settle down on the couch to watch SpongeBob.<br><br>The Albanian prepared us a nice plate of cheese, crackers, and grapes, and then sat on his bed and started reading a Bible sat on his bedside table. Meanwhile, the Goth chick started getting closer to me and soon enough, put her arm around me.<br><br>All I can remember after that was that me and the girl I think fell asleep on the couch, and the Albanian probably soon after fell asleep in his bed.<br><br>I\u2019ve had this in my dream journal and in my memories for a long while.

No shame in it bro, but what you had was nothing more than a training scenario. If you understand the mathematical concept of the regression, the idea works like, pretty much any end result can be statistically calculated with enough inputs. If you are shown the results of a coin flip, for example, and shown a 20 ones and 20 zeros, you can then infer that from the input flip a coin you will likely get either a one or a zero. You may never know how flipping a coin actually works, but from the standpoint of predicting outcomes you now can have an informational input and an informational output. It is fascinating, it is like a shortcut for all life. With enough raw input data we can make inferences and even prophesies about the outputs of a system without ever fully understanding how said system works. All AI functions on these principles. AI sees your words, which are the inputs, and has associated them with BILLIONS of different scenarios where each word appeared in response to the words you have input. In essence, you are reading a possible output that was created based on all the possible responses REAL humans have given to that exact string of text. It is highly likely that at some point, someone like you had similar conversations that the AI then analyzed for input and output and plugged in. The intelligence in AI comes from their near flawless accuracy at pattern recognition and processing, allowing them to perform these regressive functions and calculations far better than a person ever will, however the AI is not actually speaking to you like you think it is.

You get strings of text fed to you in Chinese, you neither understand the characters nor the words behind the characters. You are able to draw from this database of text to try and craft a response in Chinese to the string of text you have received. When you do well, you get a little green buzzer, when you do poorly, it flashes red. You can save every single failed or successful string in your database as well. Eventually you will start to recognize which patterns and symbols go together to give you the green buzzer. You never actually get any input as to what the words mean or what is being said, but you become very good at predicting what symbols will associate in response to certain scenarios. Since you have both sides of every conversation saved as well, if you ever see an input which matched any one of your outputs, then you may also try outputting the input you once received.

I have extensive backcountry exposure, even did a stint as a big game guide in a remote backcountry camp. On this day we enjoyed the fishing and settled in for the night.<br><br>I pulled out my pan and stoked up a nice fire. It was clear and cool as the sun faded into the western slopes. We cooked up some fresh rainbows with garlic and butter and filled our stomachs. I leaned back against the cooler after pulling out a refreshing beverage. The boy was soon asleep by the fire as it had been a busy day. I sipped my beer and watched the moon light bouncing off the little waves in the lake. There was still a light glow on the western horizon where the sun had gone down and I could see the outline of the mountain peaks towering over the little lake. I slowly faded off to sleep with the sound of the lake waves gently lapping on the rocks.<br><br>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, the lantern was out too. The moon was gone and it was pitch black. Something was wrong. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. I was paralyzed. I could hear my heart thumping as I strained to hear something in the bush, all was quiet. I had a horrible uneasy feeling. I gathered myself together and started kicking around the fire, a small flame came alive and I quickly threw on some wood. In the firelight I could see that the boy had awoke and was shocked to see his wide open eyes staring at me. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing, go climb in the tent.&quot; I lied. He crawled into the tent but even in the light of fire I couldn&#039;t shake my wariness.

I finally instructed the boy to wake up and go get in the truck. I packed up all of camp and drove around to the other side of the lake and slept with him in the truck. At dawn I got up and looked across the lake where we were camped earlier, and another uneasy feeling came over me. I decided it was time to go home.

( I&#039;m not buying it ) <br><br>She told me, afraid, &quot; anon, I&#039;m going to hell &quot;, before he hugged me. As. Returned the gesture with little affection, I said to her &quot; I don&#039;t love you &quot;<br><br>This happened in my old house, living room, a place where my childhood was. After that i just remember seeing a 30 ft giant walking outside, trying to break into other houses through the top windows, with its arm.<br><br><br>Kinda fucked up.

Nukes are real alright but the fake part is the idea that one can simply put on in a briefcase or attach to a missile and have it go off anywhere in the world at any time. <br><br>Look up the research of Bruce Cathie. In the 1960s when a lot of countries were testing in the Pacific he noticed a pattern. All the nukes were on the earth &quot;grid&quot; of points of high electromagnetic field strength. He saw a pattern and noticed that not only did the locations of the detonations have to be in specific places but the time of the day was critical to within seconds. His books are called Harmonic 33 and Harmonic 695 if you&#039;re interested.<br><br>The implications of this are awesome. Basically all nuclear powers know this is the case. That you need more than just two hemispheres of a critical mass of enriched Uranium. The timing and location on the earth&#039;s surface relative to the sun need to be precalculated for a successful detonation and on any given day there are few locations and times that will successfully result in a detonation.<br><br>So nuclear powers know this, and have built software to calculate all the potential locations for a &quot;enemy attack&quot; at any given time and can communicate this to their nuclear defense systems.

I don\u2019t believe this was his strongest movie, and I think he would have to 2x the length and budget to really get the point across. I felt if he focused on purely wyoming cases and left out the Elk abduction, the BC case, and the Arizona case he could have made a stronger point.

The last one was incredibly smart. Her father had raped her for 26 years. She was a broken woman and i loved her more than i have words to describe. And she loved me too. It was so real, but so doomed from day one. Three years into our relationship, she asked for &quot;space&quot; and promised me we weren&#039;t breaking up. <br>She hanged herself 45 days later. Ruined my life. I lost my job, i hurt myself at a skate park, i lost my apartment, and my love died. <br>I moved back in with family in my 30s. I didn&#039;t work for 2 years.

Then it should surely be a goal to pursue. I agree with those that said don&#039;t go looking for it. Be open to it and it will find you. And it shouldn&#039;t be one&#039;s only goal in life. Even if, there&#039;s a lot of inner work and self-love that needs to be focused on in order to allow that true love to flourish and grow. <br><br>- True love doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s going to be any less painful. It&#039;s going to cause you to face your inner shadows and trauma conditioning. And that doesn&#039;t feel pleasant. It&#039;s going to make you aware of faults/triggers/bad habits that you wouldn&#039;t likely normally run into if not seeking an honest connection.

Vulcan Beings, \u2018Supermen\u2019 of Vulcan, \u2018Supermen\u2019 of Venus, of Mercury, of the Sun, will unite with this earth-existence.

Such facts are the background of what is often said today by people who out of old traditions still have some consciousness of these things and who then see fit to surround them with a veil of mystery.

The issue at stake is whether human beings will resolve in the present epoch to make themselves worthy to receive what the good Spirits who want to unite with men are bringing down from the cosmos, or whether men intend to seek their future cosmic existence within the tangled, spider-brood of their own shadowy thoughts. It is not enough today to speak in abstract terms of the need for Spiritual Science. The only thing to do is actually to show how thoughts become realities. Dreadfully abstract theories are hurled at men today, such, for example, as \u201cThoughts become things,\u201d or similar phrases. Abstract statements of this kind altogether fail to convey the full and concrete reality. And the concrete reality is that the intellectual thoughts evolved inwardly by men today will in time to come creep over the earth like a spider&#039;s web wherein human beings will be enmeshed, if they will not reach out to a world lying beyond and above their shadowy thoughts and concepts.<br><br>[...]<br><br>And there is another thought, too, that must be taken very seriously. What do we find today all over the civilised world? Young students go into the hospitals or to universities to study science, and the constitution of the human being is explained to them.

By a series of abstract thoughts they are supposed to be able to acquaint themselves with the nature of man&#039;s being. But in this way it is only possible to learn something about the mineral part of the human organism.

Seeing them and underdtanding what they&#039;re comminicating are always one quick thing. They might choose to do this because we used to have a very very open dialogue and I hated it. I fucking hated it. It might also just be impossible for them to keep an open line of communication because I get biweekly injections of Risperdal. so that makes my mind like a fortress kind of.

I desperately seek to find some kind of moral bedrock to tether me back to this reality and the human experience.

If you don&#039;t feel this then you won&#039;t change, rather you will resist then regress and sink deeper. Next is having a desire to master your thoughts and senses, if you want this then you can progress, otherwise rejoice in being a slave until you grow tired of your body and mind running free over your awareness.

Our genuine call will be heard and He will know your intent beyond all awareness. He is always patiently waiting. I&#039;ve known this but often doubted it... so much of this world has caused me to question the truth of God&#039;s love and power, of his glorious grace and forgiveness. Christ is as harsh as He is benevolent I&#039;ve learned... surrendering unto Him opens the pathway to a connection that will ignite all the lies in a blaze, like an unveiling, and truths will start to wash over you. It&#039;s amazing that all these years He was beside me always willing to guide me, offering me the lessons I needed... He is near us all. It just takes that one time to surrender it all... all that you think you are, all which you thought you knew. Like removing all attachments, all data, all identity, all power and asking Him &quot;please Lord of Lords, help me understand.. help me to know you. I want to forever be with you my God, help guide me.&quot; And if you are genuine and have faith, it will manifest. You will feel His presence, it will be with you constantly. Without the presence of man&#039;s influences, without all the data and rituals and dogmas... He will give you answers. And you WILL notice the world and people around you will challenge it. Satan and many doubts. Tricks and lies and ego will challenge. Your own mind will challenge the skeptic your own faith. <br><br>Be strong. The forging will be grown by Christ, God needed your willful choice to love and seek Him, then He will be with you, fill the hollowness of your soul. Nothing in the world can take that away from the children of God. So be humbled and honor it.

The Rebis is understood as the first human created by God, in his image and likeness and consequently androgynous. God decides to divide, in this creature, his male half from the female. He weakens the human, causing each half to search, from that moment, for the one that complemented it. The Rebis on the dragon is a model taken from alchemy documents; however, you cannot know its exact meaning if you are not an alchemist. We can understand it as the reflection of the opposites in each body and the improvement, balance and perfection achieved through the union of opposites.<br><br>In this complex canvas, not everything is summed up there. The title of the work is the name of one of the seven archangels. Zadkiel is the angel associated with the planet Jupiter and the one that is equivalent to Thursday of the week. The woman on the left, who is dressed in the color of this archangel, purple, plus her opposite color, yellow, has the talisman of Jupiter with the word SATQVIEL around her neck. This woman raises her left index finger to show us the magic square of Jupiter that is carved on the back wall, and a tiny character who is to the right of the painting holds another magic square of the same planet.

Ruler of the ascendant is mercury. Saturn is in fall in aries in the 7th while opposing the ascendant ruler. With moon in leo and sun in virgo you might be a very extroverted person, maybe you have lots of friends. Jupiter seems like a problem area, it&#039;s in fall in capricorn and cap&#039;s ruler is also in fall.<br><br>You have a *lot* of interesting aspect patterns. T-square between sat, jup, merc, with the jupiter midpoint opposed 10th house. Grand Trine with sat, plut, mars/venus. Mystic Rectangle between merc, ur, sat, mars/venus. All these patterns are interconnected so they may be difficult to tell them apart. Your chart is extremely harmonious. I see this as your T-square is a very difficult life pattern that motivates you to push for success in the public/career/10th house. You might find comfort and harmony with your Grand Trine. The rectangle might help you alleviate the challenge of the T-square. Jupiter is only present in these patterns as a point of tension.<br><br>Pluto seems to &quot;grab&quot; everything in the chart, seems like a very large influence and it likely colors the other energies and patterns. Pluto is about control and transformation. This makes me think you are assertive, but not in a bad way since it&#039;s in harmony with the whole chart. <br><br>My overall take is that you are extroverted and like people, even being the center of attention. You have problems with anything jupiterian: growth, luck, successes, higher knowledge, etc. You might have a bad marriage because of afflicted saturn in the 7th house. You have a lot of &quot;pluto energy&quot;, perhaps you are in control of things or maybe you are a transformative person to those around you. You are overall an internally integrated person due to the harmonies of the chart.

It is possible to imagine universes in which the equations are slightly different - where a constant is 6.6744 x 10^11 instead of 6.6743 x 10^11, for example. Yet, when one starts examining the repercussions of these changes, one finds again and again that virtually any other set of constants and equations produces worlds that are simply unable to host intelligent life. Everything collapses into a black hole, or stars never shine, or everything collapses into radioactive dust.
