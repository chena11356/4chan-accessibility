For example &quot;my feet are becoming extremely heavy&quot;. I notice the sensations in my entire body becoming more and more heavy</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4.

I&#039;ve read that for some people its useful to imagine or visualize being in an elevator and looking at the numbers of the elevator going towards zero and then arriving at the floor and the elevator door opening and stepping out into the subconscious.

My favourite time to drain is when my partner reaches orgasm, as the energy that accumulated in the sacral chakra is released all at once.

Since I got used to absorbing it, I&#039;m affected by the energy in his sacral chakra even as it accumulates, feeling his arousal in general, and his pleasure outside of my own body during sexual activity.

My dreaming got really bad too while I used to be able to journey at night just fine. <br>The vividness and otherworldliness can come from two sources: your visual cortex being active and there being an active psychic channel. Both can have independent issues. The observation I&#039;ve made is that f.e. I went from no idle visualisation and a very quiet mental voice to a much freer mental state in a single week or even a day. If that was purely neurological that couldn&#039;t be happening, so there&#039;s an unknown variable in the equation. I suspect that to be one&#039;s nonmaterial environment and health. Over the last 4 years somethings been in the air that made it worse.<br>The only thing I can advice to debug this stuff is sense your body during short 20m meditations for a tightness that doesn&#039;t feel right.

The ancients never described such a thing and it&#039;s not because their lack of understanding but because they actually knew what it was. This is why these people hear these antagonistic and violent voices and display deranged and strange behaviour which was always said and seen to be result of posession. I could go further into this in another post but for now I&#039;ll carry on with a pointed polemic. Modern psychiatry is filled to the brim with abhorrently arrogant, perpetually pompous, obviously opinionated, hubristic hacks who have no understanding of metaphysics and therefore default to epistimological or materialistic explanations of something which is essentially caused by things incorporeal and ontological in nature. You can&#039;t point to anything physical in the world and say &quot;that is my mind&quot; because it doesn&#039;t even exist on this plane of reality.

Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

I don&#039;t care if this steps on any toes, it&#039;s a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn&#039;t Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a &quot;front&quot; for their activities.&quot; Svali <br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/welcome/child-page/<br><br>\u201c...and as you join Freemasonry, initially they&#039;ll tell you that their G, the G in the square and compass, means God. But then as you go up through the levels, they&#039;ll tell you, &#039;Oh, this stands for Gnosis, knowledge.&#039; But then when you get higher up it stands for the Generative principle, which means, buggering little boys. And I&#039;m not saying that on my own authority. I spoke with the highest ranking Freemason to defect to Christianity, Jim Shaw, he was a 33rd degree Freemason, and I had a number of conversations over the phone with him about Freemasonry.

I had a chain of sad failed relationships with women who drew me with many charms. Some were very sexy, some were cool dude bro chicks, several were incredibly smart. The last one was incredibly smart. Her father had raped her for 26 years. She was a broken woman and i loved her more than i have words to describe. And she loved me too. It was so real, but so doomed from day one. Three years into our relationship, she asked for &quot;space&quot; and promised me we weren&#039;t breaking up. <br>She hanged herself 45 days later. Ruined my life. I lost my job, i hurt myself at a skate park, i lost my apartment, and my love died. <br>I moved back in with family in my 30s. I didn&#039;t work for 2 years. I just sat here on 4chan talking shit and trying to be good to others when i can. I played vidya, i stopped self caring, i just smoked a lot of weed ar grandma&#039;s house and gave up. <br><br>Throughout the past 5 years, a girl i knew in middle school started sending me facebook messages. One day about two months ago, she tells me she wants a child. She wants to move home 3000 miles and be with me. <br>Red flags galore. <br><br>She was a whore for 15 years. A stripper too. Smoked crack, did ice, all that crazy shit. <br><br>I said fuck it. Truth is, i was planning to just go die alone in the woods like the animal i had become. She packed her life into four suitcases and moved into my grandma&#039;s with me. No joke. <br><br>We&#039;re now deeply in love.

So the prospect of true love landing in one&#039;s lap isn&#039;t unlikely. But in my experience it requires effort. And no matter how easily it comes, it&#039;s going to take effort and humility. As it takes two to tango, it also requires mutual effort. There&#039;s always the option to go with convenience. Or to ignore companionship/love altogether.

Then it should surely be a goal to pursue. I agree with those that said don&#039;t go looking for it. Be open to it and it will find you. And it shouldn&#039;t be one&#039;s only goal in life. Even if, there&#039;s a lot of inner work and self-love that needs to be focused on in order to allow that true love to flourish and grow. <br><br>- True love doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s going to be any less painful. It&#039;s going to cause you to face your inner shadows and trauma conditioning. And that doesn&#039;t feel pleasant. It&#039;s going to make you aware of faults/triggers/bad habits that you wouldn&#039;t likely normally run into if not seeking an honest connection. And as far as I can tell, there&#039;s no end to it. It likely gets easier with both parties working through it together. But that also brings with it the awkward and uncomfortable feelings of being vulnerable, direct, and non-confrontational. <br><br>- Don&#039;t be afraid to show love.

I was at work one day and I was served with papers from my wife at the time. I was served with divorce papers and an order of protection. In one day I lost my kid, my house, and my life. My workplace was all I had left, and then even that got fucked up when they brought in a new management team that fucked up everything and made my workplace god awful. Not only did they change the culture of my workplace, but their changes directly effected me and my coworkers income. My marriage was miserable, but I never thought she would resort to trying to keep me from my kid. I moved back into my parents house at 30+ years old. Everything was fucked. Then I started talking to a girl more I had known for a while on an MMO. I got the weirdest sense of deja Vu when talking to her. It sounds cliche, but I&#039;ve dreamt of her my whole life. After reading some Jung last year, I&#039;ve come to realize that this has to do with my subconscious guiding me towards her. That&#039;s when my life transformed. I quit my job, and trusted my gut instinct and followed an old friend who was starting a new business in my field of work. I quickly became a manager, and I&#039;ve been here for years. I fought tooth and nail and won 50/50 custody of my kid. The girl from the MMO packed up her entire life and moved across the country to marry me, and live with me in my parents house. She got a job in her field real fast, and quickly got promoted to a management position, and since I did too, we moved into our own place. <br><br>Never give up on your dreams guys.

He believes in molecules, yet has he seen them for himself under a microscope? I say, &quot;NO&quot;. He was merely told this was the case from some book, or from some teacher.

It is a slower form of thinking that reinforces ego and linear thought spirals. It is like the difference between communicating through language vs. communicating through telepathy, except when you subvocalize you are just putting an unnecessary constraint on the communication and information transfer happening within your own mind. <br><br>People who do not subvocalize are thinking spatio-visually like <a href=\"#p33622728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33622728</a> mentioned, which is general &quot;faster&quot; and promotes lateral thinking. This style of thinking is superior imo but taken to the extreme it looks closer to schizophrenia. Notice how schizophrenics struggle to maintain a fixed identity? This is because they have no monologue reinforcing their ego. There are obviously more reasons but that is a big reason for developing schizophrenia imo.<br><br>Neither way of thinking is more correct, and an ego is not necessarily a bad thing, without ego we would have no reason to eat or piss or do anything necessary for basic survival. That said, people should be able to just switch between either mode of thinking. I am always surprised when people present this as a binary option. If you cannot think in either mode at will, it is probably because you have reinforced one way at the expense of the other. This can be fixed by just practicing visualization or subvocalization, depending on which one you lack. It has nothing to do with someone lacking a soul or being born an NPC. Most people become confuse their inner monologue with their soul/spirit because our culture reinforces types of thinking that promote narcissism and reward egoic behavior. <br><br>You really shouldn&#039;t call anyone an NPC or imply someone lacks a soul.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon.

As we grow older we learn the &#039;rules&#039; of the real world and subconsciously apply them to our creativity, which constrains it. For example a child can think of the wildest random shit that doesn&#039;t make any sense and doesn&#039;t follow real world situations or intuitions, but it&#039;s much harder as an adult. This isn&#039;t particularly a bad thing, since applying rules to creativity allows us to try and predict the future and apply creativity in a pragmatic sense. However, we must learn to turn off those rules or selectively only apply the ones that are useful.

Like an example or</span><br>As of yet the Religion of Creativity is only a dream. However I can give insight into the fundamental process of human creativity.<br>Human consciousness is an evolutionary process where question, choice, and action correspond to mutation, selection, and reproduction in biological evolution. A question is a request for information, our entire sense-experience is the result of a request for information by our nervous system, and constantly mutates our consciousness. We can also actively mutate our consciousness by asking questions of our experiences, actions, choices, and ideas, and follow the resulting lines of inquiry to apprehend new possibilities previously beyond our immediate reach. From there, the selective mechanism of choice eliminates possibilities until one option is chosen to be expressed as an action.<br><br>There are two unhealthy versions of this process. In one, choice is favored at the expense of questioning, resulting in a progressive whittling-down of variation until stagnation is reached - this process is all selection with minimal mutation. Also one can start with a desired answer, and ask questions about how to confirm it - this is the method of confirmation bias. The healthy process must start by questioning experience.<br><br>The implication of this is to promote freedom, promote inquiry. Seek The Unknown, among the most profound experiences of which is wonder. The world is filled with endless opportunities for wonder, but to find them requires a conscious effort to shake-up your routines and get out of your comfort zone. Perhaps understanding the supreme importance of questioning and seeking The Unknown for your freedom could motivate you. Wonder is the carrot, the stick is the risk of being enslaved by your own stagnant thoughts and habits, or the stagnant thoughts and habits of others.", "time": 1671183424, "resto": 33606325}, {"no": 33618869, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What about us, stuck here in 4chan?

Creativity is a way of looking that is outside of language, thoughts, concepts, time etc. you simply look. Everything becomes strange and new with each moment. That is the state of presence Eckhart Tolle speaks of, the thoughtless place of awareness where you simply perceive what is, including thoughts and visions, without getting sucked into them, but keeping your distance, aware that you are aware. In that way you see things you have no words or concepts for everywhere you look and the only way to know them is to know them outside of any structure the mind can conceive of. It&#039;s from this place that a structure can generate to point at what generated it, though it is not it itself, and is perishable.<br><a href=\"#p33618295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33618295</a><br>Tolle mentioned the way a child sees in a video I saw. Eyes wide like dinner plates. They look at everything and anything and it is all new and strange and awesome in the true sense.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling.

The flows of this metal in and out of the core, and around it (through convective processes), generates a magnetic field.<br><br>(2) The Coriolis effect and the combined magnetic and electrical generation of these processes keep the movement (very) roughly circular around the axis of rotation. If it was driven solely by convection and the Coriolis effect it would remain very stable for a long time, but the effect of powerful local magnetic fields and electric currents is able to disrupt this circular flow. If this flow is disrupted in one place, it is likely to disrupt in other places, leading to a complete destabilization of flow around the core-mantle boundary. Thus, the field collapses (no more circular flow). However, convection means the process starts up again, possibly in a different direction, possibly in the same direction.<br>(3) There&#039;s plenty of geological evidence to show that pole reversals can occur very quickly, and that on average they take 100-150 years to complete. The decay of our magnetic field began somewhere around 1900, and is accelerating. <br><br>As the field decays there will be several noticeable effects. First, it takes a weaker and weaker flare to produce a Carrington type event due to weaker shielding. Second, this weaker shielding results in more high energy particle bombardment in the upper atmosphere (the primary driver of short and long term changes in global climate [notably, most mass extinction events are associated with pole reversals]). <br><br>(4) How does electricity work?

We are currently passing through the galactic midplane (an electromagnetic plane created by the supermassive star/black hole cluster at the center of the galaxy) which carries a substantial load of interstellar dust. This dust is not conjecture, it is here, and astronomists have been reporting it for about a year now. <br><br>The sun is essentially a large nuclear fire. What happens what you throw a bunch of very cold, flammable dust on a fire? I&#039;ve had bonfires at -40, and I&#039;ll tell you: first the fire dampens, then the fire gets much bigger than before and very quickly. The same would occur if you were to bombard the sun with a high amount of cosmic dust - the outer shell would cool, the sun would dim, and then the built up energy in the interior would catch up, the shell would warm up enough, and a &quot;small&quot; explosion would occur in which the outer shell of the sun is cast off. <br><br>There are two things to note here:<br>First, we have observed that the two nearest stellar neighbors to pass through the midplane ahead of us flared. They didn&#039;t flare bright enough to call it a super nova, but they flared too much to write it off as a random event or error. They flared in sequence, relative to the time they entered the galactic midplane.<br><br>Second: If the outer shell of the sun were to cool, the sun would dim. It may dim so much that the sun itself would turn dark red, possibly even black, dark enough that you could look directly at the sun. Instead of the normal luminescent star you would see a dark circle halo&#039;d by the dust particles and field interaction lines created by the powerful electromagnetic interactions of the sun.<br><br>In short, the Black Sun is most likely an ancient symbol from the last time this happened.", "time": 1671137327, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614388</a><br>Nahhhh.

In short, it&#039;s easy. The magnetic field is weakening:<br>1900-2000: 5% loss<br>2000-2010: another 5% loss<br>2010 to present: we don&#039;t know, field strength data is no longer published<br><br>Additionally, the poles are moving. <a href=\"#p33596975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33596975</a> demonstrates the movement of the magnetic poles. This tells us we are in a pole shift event, that it will happen, and the end date can be roughly predicted by the rate of field decay. <br><br>Additionally there is enough evidence to surmise it does happen every 12,000 years, coinciding with the frequency at which we pass through the galactic midplane. There is not much error in when this happens - we&#039;re doing it right now.<br><br>As for the crustal displacement theory: the crust is essentially held in place on the mantle by a combination of friction with the partially solid upper mantle and weak electric forces. Solar energy input through the solar-terrestrial magnetic electric circuit can heat up the upper mantle and disrupt these forces, causing the crust to locally displace (pretty much every earthquake over 6.0 is associated with space weather energy inputs). A large enough solar energy input (from a micronova, perhaps) theoretically can liquefy the entire upper mantle and cause the entire crust to detach. Then what happens? The crust still has its momentum, but the most weight is on the poles of its axis of rotation. Spin a weighted ball - the weight comes to the outside of the rotation, and thus Greenland and Antarctica move to the equator.", "time": 1671137798, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614520, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:59:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614436</a><br>Two more weeks?", "time": 1671137973, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614529, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:00:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614520</a><br>Best guess I&#039;ve seen is anywhere from 2030-2045.

I say I am not a member only because I am the only person I know who follows his teachings. <br><br>Applewhite believed that an individual person&#039;s consciousness is &quot;implanted&quot; for lack of a better term, into their body at some point around the time of their birth. The process of implanting an individual&#039;s consciousness into the human body (which he describes as a &quot;vehicle&quot; for the consciousness or soul to operate in) is referred to as a &quot;Soul Deposit&quot;. This is not a new teaching or idea, and the earliest depiction of this is from early sumerian tablets (pic related). I cannot say for sure that pic rel. Depicts a being depositing a soul, but it is an image that gets the idea across. The human body is essentially a meat vehicle for the soul as I described earlier. <br><br>Applewhite also describes different kingdoms ruling over the universe and creation, those being the kingdom of earth and the kingdom of heaven. It is through God&#039;s agents that God carries out his will, as God does not directly interfere in earthly affairs himself. He describes the kingdom of heaven as being a physical place, which is also spiritual in nature. Essentially, the kingdom of heaven is not limited to only being spiritual, but is also physical, which differs from most people&#039;s understanding of heaven.<br><br>It is a misconception that Heavens gate was nothing more than a UFO cult. the imagery of aliens and UFOs was mostly used in order to describe the fundamental workings of the actors that participate in both the kingdoms of heaven and of earth.<br><br>I could go on and on forever, and I may not have been completely true to the teachings of Applewhite throughout all of my descriptions, but I think I did a decent rundown of Applewhites teachings.", "filename": "dilmuntoearth", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 366, "h": 543, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671229511556319, "time": 1671229511, "md5": "AL8TppSwyjKdG61AsQ0ptg==", "fsize": 16798, "resto": 33622008}, {"no": 33622520, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)17:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33622431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33622431</a><br>Well, this sounds pretty interesting.

Between the fire of the blood in our hearts against the ice of cold reason. The World Ice Theory speaks to those humans to whom the christian guilt idea aswell the idea of pure expedience is alien. This breed of men opposes nature with strenght, never avoids it neither through the forced shame of asceticism and humility nor through soley sensual gratifications of the moment. It posesses all the superiority of the nordic character. It looks with fresh, lively and couragous eyes into the heart forbidding experiences of a dramatic nature. Hidden behind this taciturn and unbending features there is a secret existence of true human. A wonderful toughness of healthy life resistance. A true kindness and always faithful comradeship of strong-willed men. They are polar people who feel comfortable under the ancient nordic law of fate. Bold, not tired. Intact, never chatty. Resoloute and wise. Self-assuard and audacious characters who are facing the dangers and tests of sacrifice. Upright, insurred dramatic beings who&#039;s heart is adventourus and steel.

This is obviously a position that sounds insane at first, as it sounded to me only two years ago, but that&#039;s the position I&#039;ve come to, and I think anyone who actually looks into this and is capable of questioning things can see the same.<br><br>You claim you had multiple shifting symptoms for example. Well the official position on covid is that it can seemingly cause practically any condition - but most generally it was thought to be defined by flu-like symptoms, literally all the symptoms point by point that you get with flu. In Wuhan the original panic started because they claimed there was &quot;atypical pneumonia&quot;, pneumonia being often a flu symptom or associated with flu... but since the original outbreak, the wider epidemiology shifted the definition so that there isn&#039;t really anything &#039;atypical&#039; about the pneumonia of those who experience covid.<br><br>You didn&#039;t catch a virus because viruses don&#039;t exist and aren&#039;t contagious. Now what actually causes your illness I don&#039;t know. In my own case I had a &#039;flu&#039; in Feb of 2020, and then the next illness I had was a short flu in 2022, with my new perspective I came to the conclusion that the probably triggering factor was a sudden drop in temperature (literally the entire state ran out of tissues over this week) during an antarctic blast (Australia), and the fact that i&#039;d experienced sleeping under a &#039;drafty&#039; window. This is just speculation though, I don&#039;t definitively know what actually causes &#039;flu&#039; now that I don&#039;t believe in viruses.", "time": 1671103348, "resto": 33597584}, {"no": 33611341, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:28:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33611293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33611293</a><br>I would add that the tests are essentially meaningless. In the first year of the &quot;pandemic&quot;, I talked to various nurses online, specifically went out of my way to track down real life nurses or care workers and ask them their experiences, and even at that point most would point out that the tests didn&#039;t help with anything, were unreliable, you&#039;d test someone and get a positive, then have to test three more times and basically go on the &#039;average&#039; of having multiple repeated positives. But what actually triggers those positives is highly questionable. People are more likely to TAKE the tests when they&#039;re ill or suspect they might be ill, so if illness and heightened production of mucous somehow contribute to a higher chance of a positive test, maybe it is detecting some sort of illness, but I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s this &quot;novel&quot; &quot;virus&quot; CoV-Sars2.<br><br>Many in the alternative health field seem to think skin rashes can be related to &#039;expelling toxins&#039;, or some sort of bodily cleansing process. Could be like that? Not sure. As I mentioned having flu in Feb of 2020, I later come to the conclusion that this was more likely caused by me having spend the previous two weeks cleaning up in my garage where there was lots of dirt and mould, and where I was using some strong chemical sprays without properly ventillating the place. I didn&#039;t think of this at the time because I jumped immediately to the conclusion that I had a &quot;virus&quot; (though I don&#039;t read the news, so didn&#039;t think of covid at the time). I think this is another case of selective perception, selective memory, and the bias of interpretation excluding possibly REAL causes of illness. I had probably inhaled a lot of shit during that cleanup week, and then I was probably producing more mucous or something like that to encapsulate and expel that material from my body, and I experienced that as &quot;flu&quot; symptoms.

From what I can remember, a black car like an SUV or van pulled up near me, the window rolled down, and I saw the face of a goth-looking chick in the passenger seat and a good friend of mine driving. He said that he wanted to know if I was down to drive to the local Wal-Mart with him, to which I complied and hopped in the backseat. (From what was implied, I think the goth chick was just his other friend and they weren\u2019t a couple or anything.)<br><br>So, we drove down to Wal-Mart, and entered it at what felt like around 9 to 10 pm at night. Inside was the usual appearance of a large Wal-Mart store, but to our right as we entered was this strange museum exhibit. It had a bunch of strange fossils and old tools in display cases that lined the area it was in in a sort of \u201cU\u201d shape. We looked at the fossils, and then the goth chick told me to follow her while my buddy was still observing the fossils. I, again, complied and followed her, where we entered a laundry sort of room, with a couple of washing machines and baskets of clothing or white towels and sheets.<br><br>After we both entered, she started speaking to me of how much she was solely \u201cinterested\u201d in me. I only remember that she said that word rather than any other. It wasn\u2019t truly in a romantic context, but it did seem like she was trying to say that she wanted to know me better, or something along those lines. I don\u2019t remember much of our conversation after that, but she did then ask if I could help her wash the clothes that were in the room, to which I accepted and shoved the clothes into the washers.<br>(Continued in my next reply.)", "time": 1671124311, "resto": 33612117}, {"no": 33612950, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)12:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33612117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33612117</a><br><br>After we were out of the laundry room, my friend came along and we followed him back to the car, as he had done his shopping while we \u201cdid the laundry.\u201d (I don\u2019t know why this Wal-Mart had a laundry room.)<br><br>We got back in the car, but now another friend of my buddy was driving. He was this Albanian guy with short hair wearing a leather jacket and some jeans, and a pair of glasses (kind of looked like Elliot Rodger but also like an Albanian badass biker.) He spoke in an accent and took us all to his house. The house was a one-room home. There was a living room, a little corner of the home for a kitchen, a mini fridge next to the couch of the living room, and a big bed in the corner. It was dimly lit by a lamp that gave off a similar shine to the street lamp from the start of the dream. There was also a large Albanian flag behind the couch on the wall, and in front of the couch was a TV playing old SpongeBob episodes.<br><br>He invited us inside, although my friend said he had to go home for the night, so he filled the mini fridge with the groceries he bought and drove off. The Albanian dude asked if me and the goth chick wanted to stay for the night. Out of a sense of curiosity and the feeling of coziness the home was filled with, we accepted and settle down on the couch to watch SpongeBob.<br><br>The Albanian prepared us a nice plate of cheese, crackers, and grapes, and then sat on his bed and started reading a Bible sat on his bedside table. Meanwhile, the Goth chick started getting closer to me and soon enough, put her arm around me.<br><br>All I can remember after that was that me and the girl I think fell asleep on the couch, and the Albanian probably soon after fell asleep in his bed.<br><br>I\u2019ve had this in my dream journal and in my memories for a long while.

Richard Tomlinson told me quite extensively about his dream of an &#039;ideal all-male society&#039;. However, his Master was Prince Philip and the Royal Family, so one can say that this particular &#039;dream&#039; originated in this sickest of all families. The incredibly sick and hetero-hostile Sat B&#039;hai Illuminati cult and the Royal Family have already started to create prototypes within the current UK population. Tomlinson was of the opinion that eventually the Illuminati cult would create a society of men who had wombs, to run their ideal &#039;Lord of the Flies&#039; warrior cult society of the Templars. Women would have already been eliminated. They didn&#039;t have the technology to actually create female human eggs from scratch (they had tried but failed), but could easily clone the large banks of female eggs at their disposal - therefore, this wasn&#039;t a problem. They now had enough eggs and enough technology to keep on cloning these eggs, to be then transplanted to the male womb. For some reason, the Illuminati scientists had found that it was far better for the child to grow in a manufactured male womb than from a test-tube basis, and they had managed to genetically engineer men with these wombs but not vaginas...hence the need for Caesarians. What is worse, is that Tomlinson then admitted that his own erstwhile son - Orlando Bloom - actually has one of these wombs - one of the earliest prototypes that was successful - whether the guy knows it &#039;consciously&#039; or not - I am sure that this is true. Tomlinson was matter-of-fact about it all - only a matter of time before they would take over. The whole project was already underway.&quot;<br>http://richardtomlinsonmi6.blogspot<wbr>.com/2006/12/richard-tomlinson-ex-m<wbr>i6-officer.html", "time": 1671247273, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33625472, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)05:36:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33620897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33620897</a><br>They perfected free energy in 1944", "time": 1671273404, "resto": 33620897}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33614782, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:30:49", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Roger Stone", "com": "We all know what he did but when will it all come to light?", "filename": "080602_r17440a_p646", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 646, "h": 924, "tn_w": 174, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671139849077496, "time": 1671139849, "md5": "uGwxapuN/+Ldn7PypQmbKg==", "fsize": 160317, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "roger-stone", "replies": 40, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 29}, {"no": 33614810, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614782</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/pol/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/pol/</a>", "time": 1671140043, "resto": 33614782}, {"no": 33615335, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)17:56:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614782</a><br>There is no proof that epstein driver thread was real", "time": 1671144995, "resto": 33614782}, {"no": 33615500, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:18:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33615335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33615335</a><br>The best proof it&#039;s real, glowie faggot, is you posting this.", "time": 1671146299, "resto": 33614782}, {"no": 33615535, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614782</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We all know </span><br>People who read the screencap know.

Heavy jupiter theme in this chart: lots of planets in jupiter&#039;s sign sag but even mars, ruler of the ascendant, is in jupiter&#039;s sign of pisces. Jupiter trines both the ascendant and ascendant ruler. Moon and jupiter swap sign rulerships, meaning there is more harmony there than is seen by the aspects of the chart. Extremely heavy jupiter influence. That jupiter is in the 8th house which is tricky to interpret so I&#039;ll just give some key words: death, sex, rebirth, inheritance, secrets, other people&#039;s things, occultism, transformation. Using whole signs instead of Placidus it would be in the 9th house of higher education and focus. Anything involving this jupiter will have a massive effect so look out for planets transiting over it.<br><br>Your moon is in a T-square with mars and saturn, bringing stress and pain to emotional life, the mind, memories, and such. The T-square brings tension which is released opposite the midpoint, in this case the 10th house.

That&#039;s good, however there is difficult aspects to mars and saturn, so to use this good mercury you might have to work with those other planet&#039;s challenges. Jupiter is looking good as well in it&#039;s own sign somewhat near the moon in the 7th house of relationships. These mercury and jupiter placements are good for finances and love. Venus is in cancer, sign of the moon, and the moon being with Jupiter looks good for this venus. Can&#039;t see too many problems except for this Saturn-Mars thing, and Saturn in the 10th might not be so great for career, but yet again it&#039;s in Jupiter&#039;s sign and Mars is in Mercury&#039;s sign so maybe it all evens out.

I don&#039;t know what happened that day myself but QRD is I forced myself to go to school stressed, famished and exhausted, at some point I got dizzy but I was like it&#039;s nothing carry on, and after getting embarrassed in front of the class by the teacher I was unable to stop my mind from replaying this event and I collapsed an hour later. Through this day and months before this event I was beating myself up constantly for not being accepted or normal like my classmates. What devastated me is my failure since I up to this point I was trying to work hard, do pushups every day and already was keeping a nofap streak an coldshowers for months, trying to be a good student and constantly feeling like shit despite being full of power and energy since I could not release it or get approval or feel happy. I pushed myself and bad talked myself for not working hard enough and despite giving my all and beyond I never gained recognition and was treated like shit. The day I collapsed I was never the same and I noticed I felt physically weak, power and depth in my voice was gone, my body was shaking internally as if in fear, working out or even listening to music became too stressful and I suffered through this state for two years. I was unable to smile, enjoy anything or do anything. Just existing every day became physically unbearable but I acted normal and never told anyone. At first I thought it was because I was famished and tired, later I thought it might be anxiety but I beat anxiety months ago ever since I started nofap, coldshower and pushups. It might have been that my nerves got fucked because two years later I stoped existing in this state after listening to healing binurals for a couple of months.

So, they made up stories about him telling his followers that they were going to Heaven because he died to cover their petty sins. He taught that His Kingdom was Within, so his followers declared that it was Outside themselves. He taught if there were enough people who had Faith and acted together, they could suspend ordinary reality and create their own Reality where seemly impossible events could take place. His later deluded followers declared such events to be witchcraft. He taught that, in most cases, only the poor, the sick, and the disenfranchised were desperate enough to suspend reality, but would be able to do things that would surpass even his miracles and enter into a greater Reality, so naturally his followers decided that only clergy would be able to use these &quot;powers&quot;. He taught that a poor woman who gave pennies had more faith than the wealthy donor; which transformed into the greed and larceny of the Prosperity gospel. He taught that if a man knew what he was doing, he could defy even the Law, but if he didn&#039;t know then he would be condemned; so his followers decided that the whole Law was obsolete. He taught that the rich couldn&#039;t buy their way into his Kingdom and that a rich man wouldn&#039;t be able to pass through the needle gate because his baggage wouldn&#039;t fit, so his followers decided that they could.

So, the Establishment made them &quot;legal&quot; and the alternative society soon was encroached by noxious Tares. When the Establishment stole it, they decided what the Doctrines should be, they forced their conceptions of what their church should be, they compiled the NT and silenced any opposition, they brought back the Roman castes with a vengeance and froze one&#039;s social position solid both in and outside the Church.

The &quot;witches&quot; of Europe were tortured, hanged, and burnt because the populace&#039;s Faith in their God to keep the Bad Ol&#039; Deb&#039;bil in check was non-existent, so there were massive witch hunts and burnings; and people confessed to anything they were told to, and repented for things they didn&#039;t do, to stop the torture! Coincidently, the areas of conflict over which church would prevail, Protestants or Catholics, in a country created the most witch hunts. England changed sects when a new sovereign took over. There was no scarcity of pious ignoramuses though. One place in the New World, Salem, had a witch scare because a Black servant foolishly told some young Puritan girls about some scary paranormal things. They soon began having fits and seizures, and the religious government stepped in, and the same tortures and rigged government trials came to New England. When it was over even they had to admit that Christian Insanity had taken over.

I\u2019m not sure if this happened before or after the garden of Eden incident. I also believe that Satan was meant to play the role that Jesus did, and did not want to do it and this was also a factor. I think Satan might have been one of the very first hosts created and thus the title \u201cmorning star\u201d which is also a spiritual governor. I don\u2019t exactly know what he was thinking trying to overthrow God, because he was a host after all and Gods overthrow would mean his own death, and my understanding is that God exists outside of all dimensions, even the ones that angels Elohim reside in. So I think me must have meant to overthrow the Holy Spirit which would just have been an emanation of God. And so he got cast down to earth here with us mortals who are actually higher than the angels and he was our adversary and accuser.

Also over time the cultures\\communities often become solidified, so you have some &quot;terminally online&quot; people who tend to set themselves up as OPS or channel owners on IRC to maintain a position of social status, and get stuck there, same thing happens on discord I guess.

On 4chan, porn posting ruined the NSFW boards for me, and I know it ruined them for others. The universality of porn also means you have far more people who are constantly running on low dopamine, so they have shorter attention spans, in many cases are probably posting with one hand while fapping furiously to porn with another, etc.<br><br>Commercialisation is another factor. I mentioned discord&#039;s cultural appropriation in my previous post - well pretty much all of 4chan type culture was appropriated and mainstreamised first by sides like Encyclopedia Dramatica, but later on tens of authors have written books, there have been movies (at least two movies about r9k culture specifically), and 4chan has been mentioned on mainstream movies and TV thousands of times, latest one I saw was the most recent &#039;Scream&#039; movie. All of this empties out the culture, and also creates a situation where most people are aware that anything they create will be appropriated by others, sometimes for nefarious purposes, it stifles discussion.<br><br>The internet has also become increasingly legislated and policed, which means it&#039;s more and more dangerous to express your opinion online, and we&#039;re all aware on some level that anything we post could be used against us in some way by spooks or others.<br><br>Just a bunch of factors that come to mind that can give this impression of the internet being &#039;dead&#039;.", "time": 1671172771, "resto": 33618011}, {"no": 33618445, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)02:33:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33618011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33618011</a><br>Yes<br>https://rumble.com/v1fs007-disturbi<wbr>ng-proof-theyre-quietly-deleting-th<wbr>e-internet....html<br>He also has another video right before this one showing that search results actually repeat.

It seems whoever\u2019s posting them sees fungi as their enemy, and their agenda seems to be the complete separation of man and fungi. But let\u2019s review some basic points:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fungi are an integral part of nature, vital for nutrient recycling within the soil. They are the bridge between death and new life in many ecosystems. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many fungi are at the root of ancient and modern medicines, used to cure everything from infections to cancer. Penicillin alone has helped save countless lives in the past century. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fungi are at the heart of human culture and food. The bread and wine of Jesus are yeasted foods. The holy cacao of the Mesoamericans and the coffee of the Sufis are also products that have undergone fermentation in order to fully harness their mystic properties. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ergot and Psilocybin mushrooms are prehistoric mind openers, which likely facilitated man\u2019s journey towards spirituality. They enable ordinary people to briefly see as the mystics see, and have helped countless people open their eyes to the divine nature of existence. </span><br>Now I\u2019m not saying that all fungus is good. People do die or suffer from fungal infections, and there are many mushrooms that are deadly if consumed. But we can say the same about any natural phenomena. They aren\u2019t wholly good or evil, they are a part of nature, the same divine nature which humans sprung from, and which modernity increasingly separates us from. So I\u2019m incredibly sceptical of anyone who insists that it is a good thing to purge this from our bodies. In recent years we have come to understand just how vital our gut bacteria is, not just for our digestion, but for our whole body and brain function as well. Perhaps one day we will find out the same thing about the fungus.

The key is concepts become anchors to sensory details. Image streaming is activating a lot of senses while rushing to fit it into rough descriptive concepts. It&#039;s very jank but that&#039;s probably the point. When I tell you to imagine lots of grass the idea itself can invoke a whole scene with sunlight on an open field with shadows from clouds, distant mountains, dew and bugs in the air, and maybe a few animals in the distance and the feeling of wind cooling you off. Etc. But all you thought was &quot;lots of grass&quot;. I think this connection is what image streaming is about and why it works surprisingly well. <br><br>I don&#039;t think you need a photographic memory but rather enough of an imagination that any blanks are filled in very clearly. It might be better to focus on polishing one scene or object until it&#039;s detail is second nature. Then with that neural pathway built the rest of your brain has a natural path towards clearer visuals. <br><br>I think with detailed clarity and constant focus the minds eye will slowly but surely become more vivid. I don&#039;t have a super vivid imagination myself. it will probably take stupid amounts of effort and consistency because adult brains don&#039;t like to change. If you drop it it might undo progress. I&#039;m sure if you spend 8 hours a day in your thoughts every single day your imagination will become extremely vivid after like half a year or so. Theoretically after 3 months of something your brain adapts a routine and for a lot of people with extremely vivid imaginations, using it constantly seems to be the daily habit. <br><br>Also, an interesting tidbit, if you look at any brain charts the limbic system seems like the most direct neural path from the prefrontal cortex to the visual cortex and other areas. I&#039;ve heard that emotional suppressants can completely kill imagination and LoA stuff says emotion is key.

On this day we enjoyed the fishing and settled in for the night.<br><br>I pulled out my pan and stoked up a nice fire. It was clear and cool as the sun faded into the western slopes. We cooked up some fresh rainbows with garlic and butter and filled our stomachs. I leaned back against the cooler after pulling out a refreshing beverage. The boy was soon asleep by the fire as it had been a busy day. I sipped my beer and watched the moon light bouncing off the little waves in the lake. There was still a light glow on the western horizon where the sun had gone down and I could see the outline of the mountain peaks towering over the little lake. I slowly faded off to sleep with the sound of the lake waves gently lapping on the rocks.<br><br>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, the lantern was out too. The moon was gone and it was pitch black. Something was wrong. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. I was paralyzed. I could hear my heart thumping as I strained to hear something in the bush, all was quiet. I had a horrible uneasy feeling. I gathered myself together and started kicking around the fire, a small flame came alive and I quickly threw on some wood. In the firelight I could see that the boy had awoke and was shocked to see his wide open eyes staring at me. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing, go climb in the tent.&quot; I lied.

I finally instructed the boy to wake up and go get in the truck. I packed up all of camp and drove around to the other side of the lake and slept with him in the truck. At dawn I got up and looked across the lake where we were camped earlier, and another uneasy feeling came over me. I decided it was time to go home.

Gently, the bushes rustled as the camera was repositioned, and it was sat directly in front of the house, the door centered in the view. Slowly, the camera zoomed in on the front door, the two windows at the front barely visible in the periphery. One of the windows opened, and some guy in baggy, white clothes climbed out. I could only see his side, but he seemed to be wearing streetwear of some kind, that&#039;s the best I can describe his clothes.

Slowly 6 men walked into the yard from the left and right of the camera&#039;s view, standing together, facing the house, and clasping hands.

This was before I started trying to do creepy shit as a bit, and it was more like prank calls. I found the account of some modder who seemed to be popular on the forums, who vanished sometime circa 2014. I asked about a mod he made, and said that the download was broken, and started preparing my web of lies for this. I hopped off my pc to go make myself some dinner because it was getting late and I hadn&#039;t eaten much all day, and to my delight after a night&#039;s rest, I woke up to a message back. Unfortunately, it was a little sad. There was an indicator in the message that it was originally sent as email, apparently the guy who owned the account passed away from some type of cancer and that the person managing his email (who I think was his wife or perhaps a co-worker) couldn&#039;t offer any help.

He had 1 post on his account which was literally just &quot;dwarf fortress cool.&quot; I don&#039;t know why that stuck with me all these years, I guess I found it funny. I decided to send him a stupid jumpscare video, sorta like picrel.

It&#039;s just like defining an elephant in a room though, it&#039;s probably already been done before we started feeling around for it. Hence it&#039;s the political concession of the dark which is living in the flesh which strives to diminish us. Or a shady game of cat and mouse to discourage us of the terror beneath, it&#039;s probably a loony with a comic sense of dressing up as himself to manipulate and slander himself. The fool.<br>But no one asks, is the fool really a fool? Or does the fool answer to a much greater cause than it&#039;s own bidding?", "filename": "orchidmantis", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 682, "h": 840, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671146574824696, "time": 1671146574, "md5": "LDWCHeK7fIRM+MxEjqP4qw==", "fsize": 56226, "resto": 33615118}, {"no": 33615710, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:46:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Purgatory until rebirth", "time": 1671147978, "resto": 33615118}, {"no": 33615724, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:48:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33615118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33615118</a><br>im pretty sure u get porta popped into actual hell<br><br>God wants useful servants and not a bunch of wimps", "time": 1671148090, "resto": 33615118}, {"no": 33615745, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:51:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33615529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33615529</a><br>What did any of that have to do with what I said besides the first line?

It is not enough today to speak in abstract terms of the need for Spiritual Science. The only thing to do is actually to show how thoughts become realities. Dreadfully abstract theories are hurled at men today, such, for example, as \u201cThoughts become things,\u201d or similar phrases. Abstract statements of this kind altogether fail to convey the full and concrete reality. And the concrete reality is that the intellectual thoughts evolved inwardly by men today will in time to come creep over the earth like a spider&#039;s web wherein human beings will be enmeshed, if they will not reach out to a world lying beyond and above their shadowy thoughts and concepts.<br><br>[...]<br><br>And there is another thought, too, that must be taken very seriously.

Essentially each book takes a step back from the previous book and reveals a bigger picture of what&#039;s really going on with Don Juan and his teachings. Whether fact or fiction, any literature that can consistently pull off the trick of adding new depth and perspective with each installment, revealing a more complex and interwoven world is great writing in my opinion. Carlos definitely pulls off this feat in my opinion. It&#039;s something that the reader has to experience for himself. Explaining ruins the consistent reveals of what&#039;s really going on with Don Juan and his teachings that regularly occur when reading the next book in the series.
