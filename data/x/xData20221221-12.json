Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth &#039;as if they all burned&#039; and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows.</span>", "filename": "Himmelserscheinung_u\u0308ber_Nu\u0308rnberg_vom_14._April_1561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 900, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671603815103334, "time": 1671603815, "md5": "E0GC9TVYHfVn4FBzbTGSWg==", "fsize": 365205, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33654995, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:28:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcj<wbr>l3js0ldE", "time": 1671604121, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33655010, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)01:31:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://youtu.be/yUFYnVXbLoY", "time": 1671604318, "resto": 33651686}, {"no": 33656487, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:50:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.congress.gov/117/meetin<wbr>g/house/114761/documents/HHRG-117-I<wbr>G05-20220517-SD001.pdf", "time": 1671627044, "resto": 33651686}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33654638, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)00:12:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Divination gen - Tabula and iching guy went insane edition", "com": "Welcome to Divination General!

The idea is that it assumes time is infinite.<br>So when you die, by probability alone, eventually, whatever makes you conscious in your brain, will eventually reform, exactly, so that you experience full continuity somewhere else in the Universe as a Boltzmann brain instance. When you die, you rise again, at another time and location, somewhere in existence. BEN is chosen as it contains three major aspects of existence for an intelligent species, let alone that it acts as a tag for individuals that quickly recognize it&#039;s content. The color blue, and blue-shift as a concept, moving towards other objects. Eisenhower, a name referring to individuality and the idea of another human being, in addition to being a reference to Iron Hewer/blacksmith work. Iron is the heaviest element that is produce in normal fusion inside of stars. A loose phonic reference to Iron Hour, referencing a time period of iron rich stars, which will eventually occur in our Universe. (A somewhat likely time for Boltzmann recurrences, if driven by higher Kardashev civilizations.) November is a time reference, and all time in this Universe is relative to space. Blue Eisenhower November works in many ways for a quick reference to determine if another consciousness you encounter during Boltzmann Brain jumps, is a human from Earth, during this time period. Assuming any of this works as expected, please assist any other individuals that you locate via Blue Eisenhower November with locating other humans from Earth in this time period. We can reform our community, and achieve greater things. Individuals who choose to remember Blue Eisenhower November, should try to memorize pulsar maps and other key indicators that would allow them to locate Earth itself.", "time": 1671612328, "resto": 33640437}, {"no": 33656485, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:50:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "you miss again op", "filename": "op is fag", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671627025080181, "time": 1671627025, "md5": "Fl5yWZq8Eyb910kwzI3iyQ==", "fsize": 112418, "resto": 33640437}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33655250, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)02:21:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why is our creator such a dickhead", "filename": "279", "ext": ".png", "w": 894, "h": 894, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671607301930330, "time": 1671607301, "md5": "6LKMKjqofeyEQoyryn9U5g==", "fsize": 102120, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-is-our-creator-such-a-dickhead", "replies": 18, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 33655303, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)02:38:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Becouse he is you.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

But Gobekli Tepe is the rare example where academia has actually been pretty receptive. It\u2019s not suppressed at all (I was taught several lectures about it in my first year alone) and people have been pretty open to debating what the discovery means for our preconceived notion that urbanism was a result of agriculture. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so frustrating when people accuse academics of trying to suppress it, or use it as proof of a continent spanning ancient civilisation (all current proof points to it being a settlement used by local semi-nomadic peoples only).<br><br>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?<wbr>hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=gobekli+tepe&amp;o<wbr>q=Gobekli+", "time": 1671524955, "resto": 33635580}, {"no": 33648093, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)04:14:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33647927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33647927</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schmidt</span><br>Ok that will work, thanks.

The eight is number of ambition and manifesting, having big dreams and wanting to bring them to world. The eight is ruled by Saturn. You&#039;ll face a lot of obstacles but you should have the fortitude to overcome them if you have courage. Eights can also be very materialistic, it would be wise to guard yourself from baser instincts like greed. <br><br>the personality number is how people perceive you. The personality number 3 is the number ruled by Jupiter. It&#039;s seen as the optimist number, the person who usually sees the positive in life. They&#039;re usually very keen on their appearance and appear very attractive to the opposite sex and can be quite the charmer. There are pitfalls of the three though. The three has the tendency of being carefree, not taking life seriously and potentially letting opportunity fly by. However, with your soul urge of 8, the number of determination and ambition, it probably shouldn&#039;t be an issue. The personality three would also help to iron out some of the harsher and aggressive aspects of your soul urge. <br><br>The expression number is the numeric value of your entire name and in a very basic sense, describes what sort of talents you have, how you would express them and what sort of short comings you need to be on the lookout for. The number 11, is considered a master number which is amplifies the root value of the number. In this case, the 11 will be more sensitive but more intuitive than a standard 2.

The purpose of the 16 when presented in our charts is to remove old remnants of our past selves, so we can achieve a greater level of consciousness. This typically has to do with one&#039;s ego. It&#039;s believed that you may have used your overinflated ego from previous lives to cause harm and now you must remove ego through humility and loss. There&#039;s a tendency of those represented by the 16 to be cynical at life and you will have to learn to combat these feelings. The placement of these karmic debts are more strongly felt when they&#039;re placed in different areas of your chart, unfortunately the lifepath is consider the most dominate number in our charts. Being born on the 13th also carries karmic debt of not fulfilling your responsibilities in previous lifetimes, so you must work and stay grounded this time or it will backfire. if the calculator on the site is correct, your soul urge is the 17/8, you&#039;re gonna face inner struggle in between your spiritual side and being grounded in the material world.

It&#039;s just a little bit at a time.<br><br>Film does not light on fire and explode because of a little radiation. Radiation = slow exposure, a fogging or contrast loss on the film. More radiation = more fogging. The radiation received by the Apollo film was roughly equivalent to storing film on Earth for 3-5 years and then shooting it. Most people would never even be able to tell that a picture came from 5yo film. It&#039;s usually around 10 years that the contrast loss becomes apparent, though still minor. That said, NASA developed test strips from each roll and altered development of the roll to compensate for any fogging, based on the test strip results.<br><br>The nuclear bomb films received more radiation than the Apollo films, and survived. There are film photographs made inside the room with the Elephant&#039;s Foot at Chernobyl. Heavily fogged and with other artifacts, but it still worked. That room is vastly more radioactive than anything the astronauts could have encountered. When those photographs were made the people inside were risking lethal acute radiation exposure in a couple minutes. I think the people who went in were nuts, but they did it and survived. One person did it repeatedly and lived to old age, though he did get cataracts at a fairly early age, as I recall.<br><br>The Apollo astronauts increased their lifetime cancer risk.

We live in an Apollonian age of numbers, results, capital, etc. and it is killing the side of ourselves that believes in anything - this naturally leads to nihilism and bleakness.

Fortunately, there are companies that specialize in outfitting people who want to go poke around in Antarctica -- they will handle the permitting (largely this entails you agreeing to carry back out everything that you take in, so that the continent does not become a trash-heap) and provide you with the gear you need to do whatever it is you want to do (cross country skies, sledges, mountaineering gear, whatever) and arranging to get you and your gear carried in and, importantly, back out. None of this is cheap -- Antarctica is remote, cold and dangerous. But it can be done -- dozens to hundreds of people go down there to explore every year. (This is not counting cruises and such where you just touch the edge of the continent and call it good.)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But i might never return, might even die from unknown dangers..</span><br>Don&#039;t invent trouble -- the known dangers are more than enough.<br>If you decide to do it, have fun!

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

Religion and Jesus were a vehicle that the nordic aliens who created the earth an humans used to introduce the christ consciousness to the planet. In the christ consciousness, the whole of space and everything in it belongs to you. When you cultivate this consciousness and therein understand that everything is yours, you will have no prejudices about race or color. It refers to a spiritually evolved state of being. When we observe the life and message of Jesus Christ, we can see the qualities of love, devotion, courage and surrender at the center of his teachings and example. The term \u2018Christ Consciousness,\u2019 refers to the embodiment of these qualities in our lives. It&#039;s about meeting the grit and grime of life through the heart of love, devotion, courage, and mystical surrender as Jesus did. Christ Consciousness is, therefore, another word or idea that points to the notion of spiritual integration; of learning to not only use the heart but also the mind. To embrace your flawed humanity and luminous divinity and of course, to recognize \u2018God\u2019 as both an immanent and transcendent force/source. In a nutshell, Christ Consciousness speaks about the awakening of the heart and the integration of opposites: the sacred union of spirit and flesh, inner and outer, light and dark \u2013 it\u2019s very non-dualistic and unifying.

I couldn&#039;t take him seriously anymore after that, but my parents still forced me to go once a week, so I spent an hour or so glaring at him each time and responded to his questions with questions to throw him off. He ended up taking a break from his job and I haven&#039;t seen him since.

Opposing medical advancement was also historically the church&#039;s agenda, so I despise such mentalities even when they come from occultists.

Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism. It was a popular belief system in ancient India.<br><br>One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.<br><br>In 8th century CE Jaina literature, Saddarsanasamuccaya by Haribhadra, Lokayata is stated to be the Hindu school where there is &quot;no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.&quot;<br><br>Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.<br><br>Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena.

There used to be a lot more interest in investigating these matters. Scientists today tend to investigate the kind of subject for which you can easily get funding, they are establishment whores and care little for actual truth. There have been rigorous scientific studies where phenomena like telepathy and telekinesis are proven true (I&#039;m talking p value &gt; 0.05), but these studies like so many facts today get solemnly buried and are never officially acknowledged. Try getting the study published in a respected scientific periodical and the peer-review bureaucracy will veto it. Try writing about it on Wikipedia and there&#039;s an army of apparatchiks ever ready to revert your edits and reprimand you on the Talk tab for being a snake oil salesman crook fraud peddling unsubstantiated claims and pseudoscience. <br><br>Everything that falls under the umbrella of &quot;science&quot; is subject to a materialist agenda, whether we&#039;re talking didactic textbooks, Discovery Channel documentaries, university curricula, scientific periodicals. There is a rule that the paranormal/spiritual/supernatural must never be acknowledged, even when there happens to be evidence for it. The big trick is how *respectability* is allocated when the subject is covered. In every TV report about exorcist priests, for instance, they will first interview the priest, who will tell the reporter that spirits exist and so forth, and then they will interview some anthropologist, sociologist or psychologist duly accredited by a respectable university who will proceed to say, in so much academese-ridden bilge, that it&#039;s all fake. <br><br>These specialists will never explain how it is that sometimes the possessed will fluently speak Latin or Greek even when they don&#039;t know a lick of these languages, and other paranormal phenomena that often accompany exorcism sessions.", "time": 1671474358, "resto": 33636172}, {"no": 33642430, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:27:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33640831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33640831</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aware and conscious individuals are allowed into Switzerland</span><br>I lived in Geneva for a year and it sucked bad.", "time": 1671474423, "resto": 33636172}, {"no": 33642548, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:39:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "2/2<br><br>The reason Daniel Dennett is still talking about Uri Geller decades later, ever with a tone of superlative scorn, is that Geller&#039;s psychic abilities were threatening the narrative.

If one day the NYT and Jon Stewart and some Netflix documentary start saying &quot;alright guys the paranormal is actually real we were wrong&quot; normies will readily change their convictions, but right now skepticism is the default &quot;normal&quot; stance so that&#039;s the stance most people adopt, people don&#039;t ground their convictions on actual evidence (lol), they just follow the stance widely regarded as normal.<br><br>I recently worked on an academic book, a collection of essays by different academics, rife with citations, and at least one third of the last names in there are irluminerty last names, someone even cites an academic paper penned by a Rothschild.

Magic, generally speaking, still does not recognize the ego-inflationary aspect of its own system - which is why there are so many casualties. If it would incorporate Reichian therapy into itself and make it a part of Magic, then it would have some kind of objective system to correct its ways and prevent its students from fouling up their own nests. Mere education in the phenomenon is no answer to this problem. Frater Achad, theoretically, was educated in the notion of \u201cdestroying the ego\u201d by crossing the Abyss, so-called, but it did not save him from inflationary activities of the ego such as asserting the equivalence of his own grade of Neophyte (1)=[10] with the supernal grade of Ipsissimus (10)=[1]. This is asinine from the ordinary point of view and doesn\u2019t make sense. It only becomes intelligible from the viewpoint that the very process of Magic puffs up the ego.

I had an unrestricted internet access, even though my parents thought that they were controlling me and my activities. During that period of time I stumbled upon one particular person who changed my entire childhood life and she and I developed a strong, friendly relationship that later became sexual in the process. While I was 9 years old and she was 19 years old, she introduced me to a large variety of porn of all sorts. She had been that kind of woman that wanted fresh feelings of her own, to try out something special in terms of sex, like meeting with some young boys like me and trying out something that is considered to be taboo in society. So there is no need to explain that she introduced to a lot of fetishes and general sexual stuff.<br>Because of her, now I have various fetishes about milfs, calling somebody &quot;mommy&quot; unironically and liking tall girls over short ones, because her influence on my development was huge enough to shape my interests and future fetishes.

First off let me say this, although I grew up christian also but am no longer a christian, I do still believe in the existence of Jesus and I don&#039;t feel people who still subscribe to religions are particularly wrong, I just do don&#039;t it anymore. I feel if you believe that Jesus died for you that&#039;s perfectly fine. You have the right to believe that and I respect your beliefs and I have the right to not believe it an I expect you to respect my beliefs. But the reason you feel conviction is simply because you&#039;re a christian. There&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with all the smut you saw, it&#039;s the world we live in. Everyone does some form of smutty shit. It&#039;s only wrong because you&#039;re told to think it&#039;s wrong. You see, the reason you have a life where you even are christian and watched such things is so you could learn how wrong what you were watching really is. If you&#039;d never been a christian, you&#039;d never really felt conviction for it &amp; would&#039;ve never learned the lesson. It&#039;s all a big lesson. You planned this life. You planned to be a christian, you planned to watch that stuff and you planned for it to happen the way it did so you would feel conviction for it an learn the lesson behind it. In all actuality, christianity isn&#039;t really real, it&#039;s completely fictional. That doesn&#039;t justify watching smut or the people making it but those people have life contracts where they make smut. That is there purpose, to learn the lessons that come with being a person who makes smut. Then they&#039;ll have a life where they learn a similar lesson as you. We&#039;re all just learning lessons, there&#039;s NEVER anything that you need to feel bad or guilty or conviction over. When you die you will judge yourself, no one else is going to judge you. You&#039;re human, you have sexual needs, there&#039;s nothing to feel disgusted about.", "time": 1671612817, "resto": 33649224}, {"no": 33655713, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)04:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33649224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33649224</a><br>I can relate to that OP, I managed to recover from it my self well mostly anyway I&#039;m just missing the key part that substitutes that self comfort and excitement but that will be fixed in the near future.<br><br>Since you mention spiritual agony please understand that sex is a part of life and it was a God given thing, meaning that you shouldn&#039;t feel bad about it but you should hate what brought you to that point.

Michael Heiser made a cool presentation about it, you should check it out on YouTube. Its called salvation is not based on correct doctrines, I will find later coz I&#039;m phone posting. Anyway the key here is that you must stop self pitying yourself too much, you&#039;re really missing the point and really I get that it feels like its hard to let go of that shame. But you must move on and become the person that you&#039;re meant to be, think about it if we were made in God&#039;s image do you really think we will be condemned by our past mistakes? What point would retribution have if not, of course that doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t have any sort of responsibility but we can make up for our actions, even if it was by mistake or ignorance.<br><br>Just quit all porn and resist any sort of urges, if you fail then atleast it wasn&#039;t because you watched porn again.

So a croc snaps at a zebra, zebra freaks and gets away, tremors, then goes back to grazing 1 min later like nothing ever happened. He also noticed that in 3rd world countries when in bomb shelters that after a bomb went off the kids would naturally shake, but the adults wouldn\u2019t. Because we have all been conditioned to think shaking is weakness. So the kids would shake and end up fine and the adults wouldn\u2019t and would go on to develop PTSD. <br><br>But we have a built in mechanism to tremor and shake to release all this pent up stress and trauma and reset our nervous systems.

This candle in particular with giving me some problems, but eventually I was able to light it. While staring into the flame, the flame itself becomes small, as if it was going to go out. But strangely enough, it stays alight as a small blue flame which almost looks like an orb. I then perceived my immediate ambiance to become &quot;misty&quot;, a sensation which I typically associate with the astral realm. I then state that I acknowledge the presence of my Holy Guardian Angel and begin to profess my dedication to it as an emissary of the divine. I think hear a creaking immediately behind me which made my heart beat rapidly. It wasn&#039;t scary as it much as it was impactful, as if there was a presence abiding with me.

It sucks. You&#039;re in pain, and life isn&#039;t fair. But this selfish lashing out at others and at God shows your mindset is wrong. Once you really get beaten down properly and begin to comprehend empathy for others, you&#039;ll begin to realize the most profound truth of life is genuine selfless compassion. You don&#039;t do it for yourself. You do it for people around you so they can feel less suffering. You don&#039;t help a drunk woman from being raped at a party because you want to fuck her yourself, you do it because even a drunk sorority girl is still human and likely deserving of love and decency at a base level. Being empathetic and selfless can be draining, and can feel lonely at times brcause others aren&#039;t often as selfless. But that&#039;s what it means to really be selfless. If you want to be selfish, do it. Being a truly good and upstanding person requires you to be in tune with yourself and to make sure your base needs/health are fulfilled first.

It started off with me being in some nice big house in a weird vidya where I had to avoid some ghost(?) Girl. After &quot;beating&quot; the game a few times and unlocking new endings, a multiplayer option came up. Now I&#039;m showing some guy through the game and we&#039;re having a blast together. After some time, we take a walk around the garden behind the house and this guy proposes to me. Obviously I say yes, and suddenly we&#039;re in some big cathedral on our wedding day. I&#039;m wearing a jacket, but after someone I evidently regard as a member of the wedding party convinces me I shouldn&#039;t wear it, I take it off to learn I&#039;m wearing a beautiful wedding dress. Queue a very long and detailed wedding ceremony where I feel absolutely in love with this guy and my family is all in attendance being supportive, along with a bunch of &quot;friends&quot; I supposedly met while going to drag shows or something as I explored my sexuality and crossdressing. The &quot;friends&quot; and my family gave toasts, and we spent a while doing odd games like you would expect from a bridal shower or something. In the end, everyone slowly left the reception and it was just me, my new husband, a few close friends, and my parents cleaning up after ourselves as priests walked around looking impatient. The dream ended with me suggesting we hold a 4th of July celebration at the very same old house from the beginning while feeling as if we (husband and I) lived there, being told it wasn&#039;t a good idea since it&#039;s old and flammable, and leaving the church arms linked with my husband, full of anticipation for our wedding night.<br><br>Am I a faggot?

I spoke to someone claiming to be Cassiel not long ago. They told me directly to believe a certain type of messenger when they arrive. I asked Cassiel to prove it was really him with some knowledge I could verify that I would not otherwise know. He did not really prove anything to me.

Yesterday I began reading more about energy too in a way very much like I read from Castaneda.
