The thing about the Psalms, is that it&#039;s &quot;easier&quot; than LoA. You don&#039;t deny anything in the 3D. You accept that you have problems, and you bring those problems to the wisdom of the Psalms to fix. Much easier to wrap your head around, in my opinion. They&#039;re also flexible, in that you can mix whatever process you want with them, like visualization of the end goal, or even just writing down what you want (preferably in past tense of having accomplished/received it).<br><br>Do you know about the Purification Psalms? They&#039;re a set of 7 Psalms - 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, and 143. You use them for when you have big problems in your life, and feel overwhelmed. As a personal testimony, whenever I use these Psalms, I become unfazed by anything. I feel practically bulletproof.

You don&#039;t need an actual book, you can read online, and whichever translation doesn&#039;t matter (I like KJV for the Psalm magic process since it&#039;s more poetic, but I also use NIV to study them as a hobby). Process is:<br>1) Pick any Psalm (if you pick Psalm 119, it counts as a bunch of Psalms, <br>2) Have a desire to fulfill, or a problem to fix<br>3) Read the Psalm out loud once without stopping<br>4) Read the Psalm again slowly, verse by verse. You can do this silently in your head. Try to decipher the hidden meanings within them, as to how they pertain to your mind, or your situation. For example, &quot;enemies&quot; would represent &quot;negative thoughts&quot;.<br>5) Repeat this process daily until you problem&#039;s fixed, or until you get a definite feeling that the Psalm worked.

She trains witches, procures succubi, and is believed to be the spirit who communicated magical secrets to Amemar, a fifth-century CE Jewish scholar. Agrat is allegedly more interested in human men than women, or at least they are the ones who are strongly cautioned against her. Men are traditionally advised not to be alone, sleep alone, or enter the water during the times of the week when Agrat is most powerful, lest they fall under her spell. Days: Agrat is at the peak of her power on Wednesday and Friday nights. At other times, Agrat inhabits places uninhabited by people (that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find her), but on those two nights she can go where she will and do as she likes. Once upon a time, Agrat was free to come and go as she pleased, wherever and whenever she wanted, but a compromise with Hanina ben Dosa, first-century Galilean rabbi, wonderworker, exorcist and general thorn-in-her-side restricted her powers. He agreed to halt his attempts to completely banish her, and she agreed to start keeping regular hours.</span>", "time": 1673300276, "resto": 33798426}, {"no": 33801116, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)18:04:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33799172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33799172</a><br>Honestly, I kinda dig that look for myself when I become a succ.<br>Kinda has an &quot;Easygoing sexpot&quot; vibe that I like.", "filename": "5a2a8c0c0c4e33b3f71cd0f469c514c4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3081, "h": 2803, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1673305488918182, "time": 1673305488, "md5": "fQel8vM03//uLlkW8q40Sw==", "fsize": 883483, "resto": 33798426}, {"no": 33801320, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)18:37:44", "name": "HWA Anon", "com": "It&#039;s very fascinating to me how Reinin can basically just reach into my body and touch my nerves, petting them and massaging them.

Human beings change all the time. It&#039;s also possible that you are still on the reserved side of things but have learnt how to manage that and how to set boundaries much better than in the past so you can also afford to be more open and outgoing. Many possibilities.<br>Also, one last thing I forgot to mention earlier is that some of your placements suggest that you are overly harsh on yourself, so you should try to approach yourself with more kindness and respect, and address practical problems without assigning blame to yourself - we all make mistakes.<br><a href=\"#p33797217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33797217</a><br>I am going to give you a lazy reading and I am going to pretend that your chart is in whole sign.<br>You are a normie (sun) who&#039;s witty and with a talent for languages (moon) from a good family background (Jupiter) and has poor luck with money (Saturn) and career (Mars).", "time": 1673260887, "resto": 33797048}, {"no": 33797487, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:44:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33797048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33797048</a><br>Aquarius Sun, Capricorn Moon, Capricorn Rising is an interesting combination I think, what would you expect from a person like that?", "time": 1673261087, "resto": 33797048}, {"no": 33797500, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)05:51:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;libra sun square capricorn moon</span><br>I&#039;m rather positive about it really. <a href=\"/x/thread/33781571#p33796551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33796551</a> is the opposite of my experience.

The Thomists [in response] say the fact that grace is not bestowed is not the cause of the omission of the salutary act. The omission is a defect that proceeds solely from our defectibility and by no means from God. It would proceed from Him only if He were bound, if He owed it to Himself, to keep us always in the performance of good which he does not. Thus it is not true to say that man resists or sins because he is deprived of efficacious grace. He resists by reason of his own defectibility, which God is not bound to remedy.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; t. based R\u00e9ginald Marie Garrigou-Lagrange</span><br><br>This guy in the last thread on this topic was the only one who got it right:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because He wants to [condemn most to hell].

I need to rethink my dosage, my supplement has 1 mg of it LOL.<br>A few things to talk about, I&#039;ll take some space here today. First of all, BPC.<br><br>Started taking it 3 days ago, took 1/3 of the full dose on day one, 2/3 next, full dose yesterday. Full dose has 1mg of BPC-157 and 750mg of phenibut in it, as well as some other less important ingredients in smaller quantities. Guess I&#039;ll scale back down to 1/3 or 2/3 if 0.1 mg is sufficient. Apparently, phenibut builds up tolerance real quick, so I plan on taking this supplement 3 or 4 days per week.<br>First impressions: it didn&#039;t knock me out at all, but sleep was deeper and more refreshing. Focus during the day is slightly better, the unpleasant feeling at the back of my head that was there for the last couple of months (while on oregano follow-up) is reduced. Muscle-brain connection felt much improved today at the gym, comparable to pre-workouts but without the agitation caused by stimulants. Physical performance up ~10%, subjectively.<br>No weird dreams or any anomalies. I can&#039;t remember my dreams again and was only able to do that on months 3-5 of the protocol. Guess I&#039;ll be taking galantamine in a couple of months or so.<br>One outstanding observation is that yesterday, after the full dose, I suddenly regained access to multiple childhood memories. Normally, I don&#039;t remember my childhood at all. I didn&#039;t have any psych trauma that could wipe memory out, I just never really cared for it and never exercised this non-pragmatic type of memory. I assume that&#039;s why it degraded. This time, memories had senses in them - smell, touch, taste, emotions. This is rare for me.<br><a href=\"#p33787740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33787740</a><br>Side note, had to take a break from Ormus. It improved my hearing so much that I could hear dogs barking 1 block away with my windows closed, interfered with my sleep. The sound also became almost constant. Will pace it a bit slower, maybe once every 2-3 weeks (was taking it 1-2 times per week in small pinhead-sized doses).", "time": 1673186146, "resto": 33787403, "trip": "!UNLEAVENS."}, {"no": 33790807, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)09:11:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33787740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33787740</a> brand names or links to ones you recommend?<br>bump", "time": 1673187063, "resto": 33787403}, {"no": 33790906, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)09:30:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33790735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33790735</a><br>Second, a few questions to the group.<br><br>1. Apparently, ibuprofen taken at high doses can lower T and increase LH? Is this a concern, or is it not that much of a problem at lower doses and shorter courses? Or did the side effects they observed come from actual die-off?<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC5789927/<br>I usually don&#039;t take it more than 5 days in a row and only take 100-400 per day, so not really concerned but still. Sorry if this was already discussed.<br><br>2. Need a second opinion here. The ONLY medication from my &quot;past life&quot; that I&#039;m still taking is allergen-specific immunotherapy (dust mite allergen). The region that I&#039;ll move to in a few months doesn&#039;t have med available, and even in my current place I have to get it from abroad, so I&#039;ll discontinue it soon. Thing is, when I was looking for the availability and alternatives, I finally read some detailed info on how this therapy works. Apparently, the sign that it&#039;s &quot;working&quot; is a significant increase in target IG4 levels.<br>Isn&#039;t that how T cell exhaustion or &quot;vax AIDS&quot; works? Am I actually killing my immune system for the sake of reducing allergy?<br><br>3. Another thing to note, also from digging around ASIT stuff. Apparently, oral mucosa exhibits extremely (if not the most) powerful immunomodulatory properties for the whole body. If I understand that correctly, fungus could modify your entire immune system just through the mouth. Sublingual supplements could be also much more serious that just &quot;LOL lozenges&quot;.<br>For example: https://www.jacionline.org/article/<wbr>S0091-6749(08)01185-8/fulltext", "time": 1673188243, "resto": 33787403, "trip": "!UNLEAVENS."}, {"no": 33791458, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)11:11:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33790807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33790807</a><br>Etsy is great for this stuff.", "time": 1673194314, "resto": 33787403}, {"no": 33792021, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)12:42:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "1 month into protocol and now i&#039;m starting to feel pain in the lymph node below my left ear.

Satan, the little devils that follow him charge us with twisting us more, and he is not worth it for the simple fact that we can see them, I urge you to stay true between fantasy, lies and deceit and their possible combinations, look for Jesus Christ king of peace and you will show them the truth of what these little devils have done, it is time for the reign of the demons to end, do it for the innocent who cannot defend themselves from these detestable demons who fuck and continue to fuck, the question is who fucks them to these ungrateful sinful demons that you no longer have salvation?!<br>AAH, it also goes to the pagan and derived witches who use and agree with demons to do harm to others, leave repenting of your sins and accepting the savior, because you are going to burn in the lake of fire for eternity and if it is who want their souls saved from Hell.<br>(remember the demons manipulate through the EGO)<br>SHAKE DEMONS SHAKE THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IS NEAR AND THE FLAMES OF HELL ARE CLOSE, SO THAT THEY WILL BE LAUNCHED FOR ETERNITY!!!, YOU WILL PAY FOR ALL THE SUFFERING THAT YOU HAVE CAUSED TO HUMANITY!!!<br>SATAN SHAKES (L E A M A S) SHAKES BECAUSE YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBED AND YOU ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs.

I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more.

I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

However, I discontinued my efforts after a few weeks, as it caused severe inflammation and pieces of dead skin falling off in a particular area. Not only was the pain becoming unbearable, but I realised what I was doing was highly dangerous, as it was becoming difficult to even urinate. After discontinuing my magick, which consisted of daily energy work in a deep trance, the symptoms subsided in just a day.<br><br>My conclusions are that it&#039;s far more efficient to change physical things by physical means, and spiritual things by spiritual means. Not only that, but it&#039;s dangerous to attempt to remove body parts with magick; it&#039;s no different from convincing those parts of your body to destroy themselves, with no guarantee of actually getting the results you want.

Arguments would be solved by wrestling, while stating the logical errors in each other&#039;s beliefs to try to make each other falter; only those with sound reason, or great discipline and true dedication to their convictions, could maintain the will to fight, which they would back up with their physical prowess. Superstition would succumb to the muscles of the wise, and any and all endeavours of humanity would be performed with utmost efficiency. Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them.

Islam doesn&#039;t allow drinking alcohol. Islam doesn&#039;t allow premarital sex. It also makes you focus on what food you eat. Things like that can be very good for some people. It&#039;s a way of life, so there really is no &quot;end&quot; to it. The religion teaches that you build up good deeds through your daily salat or prayer. You also do this by giving, which is called Zakat. That is to say giving money to support Islamic causes. Or support poor Muslims. There&#039;s also the discipline of fasting on the month of Ramadan, which is when the Quran was revealed to Muhammad. Muslims also tend to say things like &quot;alaihi salaam&quot; when mentioning a prophet and &quot;Sallahu alaihi wa sallam&quot; when mentioning Muhammad. Also &quot;Subhan wa Ta&#039;ala&quot; when they mention Allah.

Herodotus&#039;s Histories describe a Mount Atlas and a people known as Atlantes in the region of Tunisia or northeast Algeria.

We don&#039;t know if they were in the Phoenecian original or if they were added by the Greek translator. Sanchotheon&#039;s Atlas was a son of Ouranos whose brother Ilus (Cronos) imprisoned him under the Earth. It&#039;s a different Atlas. Sanchotheon&#039;s Poseidon was appointed by Cronos to rule over Berytus (Beirut). For him to be the same Poseidon, he would have to cross to the far side of the Mediterranean and not bother to tell the story.

They harnessed the power of certain magical stones, called Yada stones, which are said to protect from natural disasters, control the weather, heal sickness, and which were the reason for their great physical height. When the Great Flood swept over the world, Tartaria was hit by the debris and mud upheavaled by the flood. This great mudflood destroyed their civilization, burying it miles under heavy soil, thereby creating the Inner Asian steppes. The Tartarian race was forced to the brink of extinction, but a few managed to survive the mudflood by seeking refuge in the caves and valleys of the eastern mountains.

We feel like we are being watched when we pull up and park. A few minutes later, all we are doing is watching behind us (parked backwards to the woodline) and I see a pale white form standing out from the darkness. It&#039;s skin was like dry old dusty leather with varicose veins that are blue. I freak the fuck out and tell my friend to drive away. As we drive away me and him see the damn thing run across the road. It was incredibly fast and I saw it just barely long enough to make out its form. It was tall, had skinny arms and legs and a unusually small but round head (compared to its body). We drive away a few miles and it fucking follows us down the road, it kept up with the car.<br><br>We park at a lit parking lot that had cameras over it. It pops up a few hundred feet in front of us near some bushes and an unlit road. We take some pictures but they are of a quite shit quality for a multitude of reasons.

Anyway, there was a red one which I think was the leader, a blue one and a green one. For some reason I think they were a &quot;band&quot; or something.

I had a night light on and always had my radio on with the oldies channel on, so old boomer music from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s would be playing. So, I would awake in my racecar bed, which was facing the bedroom door and the only light would be from my night light, so pretty dim. I could see the hallway, the white walls were always a sorta nighttime blue hue and then blackness at the end of the hallway where the bathroom was with the stairs to the main floor off to the left. I would always be awake for a few moments and then I would hear voices coming from down stairs, like whispering voices, like mischievous they were up to no good. They would be talking coming to get me. Then I would hear running up the stairs and the three &quot;puppets&quot; from the show would come running from around the corner of the stairs into the hallway into my room to get me.

They always had paper white skin and these paper white jump suits with stripes going across from their mid arms and chest.

I was separated from my friends and family and fighting alongside a group of strangers. We had no uniforms, and there were women and unarmed people in our group. We looked like homeless people with guns. <br>Suddenly this huge, dark cloud of whirling flying machines comes over the horizon. It came up and over one of those big, steep hills like they have in San Francisco. Countless machines actually darkening the area with their shadows. They looked like the man hacks from Half Life 2. <br>There was so much fear and panic.<br>We started retreating inside this shitty looking building to hide. The windows were all boarded up and there were objects like mattresses and tables places against the walls and windows to make them thicker. <br>We understood somehow that the machines could see through walls and this was our crude effort to hide as deep inside the house as possible and avoid being seen. Walls bolstered by fucking mattresses and cardboard and whatever was there to sort of &quot;muffle&quot; their vision. <br>We put the women closest to center of the house and posted up with rifles behind over.

In Scandinavia, the Black Cat Klubbis is believed to have been tied to ritual offerings made in lakes, where slaves and animals were sacrificed. In Egyptian culture, the god of cats, Bastet, was often depicted as a woman with the head of a black cat. One of the most intriguing aspects of the Black Cat Klubbis is its ability to assist individuals during their dreams. It is said to be a powerful and ancient being, capable of protecting the sleeper or astral traveler from harm. The Black Cat Klubbis is also believed to have a mortal enemy in the form of the Hat Man, a fearsome shadow figure that is often associated with sleep paralysis. In addition to the Black Cat Klubbis and the Hat Man, there are other figures associated with sleep and the astral realm that have been largely forgotten. One such figure is Mothman, a mysterious entity whose true name has been lost to history. It is thought that discovering this one true name may be the key to unlocking strange abilities and accessing the otherworldly realm in which these entities dwell. Klubbis is a fascinating and enigmatic figure that continues to captivate the imagination of those interested in the mysteries of the unconscious mind and the spiritual world. Its complex origins and connections to ancient cultures only add to its allure, making it a subject worthy of further study and exploration.", "filename": "klubbo", "ext": ".png", "w": 681, "h": 909, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673328983600437, "time": 1673328983, "md5": "jQ/PiIaSwrO9OWJOMVKKnw==", "fsize": 269666, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-black-cat-klubbis-is-a-mysterious-entity-that", "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 33803903, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:48:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "NightCafe AI art gen-- &quot;the Black Cat Klubbis and the Hat Man, expressionism, neo-primitivism, twilight ominous fairycore golden ratio&quot;<br>He sees you.", "filename": "JOkWFYmoGy5yqgZ7sdK0--50--MV9FT", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673329693031526, "time": 1673329693, "md5": "gyTNvvVUjcNuYmsOYdLw+A==", "fsize": 72759, "resto": 33803836}, {"no": 33803949, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)00:55:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33803903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33803903</a><br>My black cat came to sit with me 2 minutes after posting this", "time": 1673330144, "resto": 33803836}, {"no": 33804555, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:29:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33803949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33803949</a><br>yeah its one of them thangs, black cats are superior supernatural beings", "time": 1673339342, "resto": 33803836}, {"no": 33805075, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)06:09:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804555</a><br>damn i noticed lots of dubs and trips when people talk about klubbis or black cats", "time": 1673348997, "resto": 33803836}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33800774, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:15:58", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Earth is hell", "com": "Stop denying it, you know deep down that your life on this world was purposed for suffering and all sorts of negativities which are perfectly controlled by all sorts vile entities who want nothing more than your misery, the society you live in was orchestrated by demons to make your life more oppressive and melancholic", "filename": "b235bcf4966668711730f4bc5410c397", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 563, "tn_w": 222, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673302558997642, "time": 1673302558, "md5": "1LFBge/RuB3prXbpE9ru6A==", "fsize": 71274, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "earth-is-hell", "replies": 21, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 33800780, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:17:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>earth isn&#039;t hell but satan is prince of this world so you&#039;re only half right", "time": 1673302634, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800815, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t deny it because you are right.", "time": 1673302897, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800862, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>sup demon, trying this same tired tactic again?", "time": 1673303336, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800911, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:35:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>You&#039;re in a simulation and it stinks", "time": 1673303718, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800927, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:37:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>normies and npcs are the vile entities, the elites are the demons", "time": 1673303833, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800936, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:38:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>it gets inexpressibly worse<br><br>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fY8dE<wbr>NdB620", "filename": "9DDEC272-B7B4-4387-B1F4-BAAEFB404071", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 273, "h": 253, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 115, "tim": 1673303901075471, "time": 1673303901, "md5": "9B1EAod2PMHp1wiNVlG7gQ==", "fsize": 11918, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800945, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:39:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He doesn&#039;t know</span>", "time": 1673303988, "resto": 33800774}, {"no": 33800954, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:41:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33800774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33800774</a><br>Hell for some.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared. While Trejo was being assisted, the same sound as before was heard. The next morning, 50 men searched the whole area but found no bullet casings or bullet holes. However, the Air Force concluded that the soldiers did fire their guns.&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVq<wbr>7gBH70WE<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C<wbr>3%B4nio_Vilas-Boas<br><br>https://www.tweaktown.com/news/8039<wbr>3/declassified-australian-ufo-repor<wbr>t-involves-cat-faced-dwarf-aliens/i<wbr>ndex.html<br><br>https://www.livescience.com/ufo-rep<wbr>ort-human-biological-injuries<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://astronomy.com/bonus/zeta</span>", "filename": "1673038777824657", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 276, "h": 400, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673318587598947, "time": 1673318587, "md5": "j8CZeMxhq2TDN0oyMU6yGA==", "fsize": 26341, "resto": 33802564}, {"no": 33802640, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:44:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33802564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33802564</a><br> damn op i think thats the real one too.", "time": 1673318681, "resto": 33802564}, {"no": 33802642, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:45:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33802633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33802633</a><br>dude, get over it, it&#039;s fucking over, look at every other human race btw.", "time": 1673318713, "resto": 33802564}, {"no": 33802659, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)21:47:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33802640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33802640</a><br>yes, doesn&#039;t look like a cgi to me, it makes me alerted.

The book from the thread gives instructions on how to achieve orgasm without loosing semen. One of it&#039;s main excercises (called the Cool Draw) consists of drawing the energy from the dick (lol) to the tailbone and then through the spine to the back of the head, circulating it there and finally putting it into &#039;storage&#039; around the belly.<br>I was interested, did the excercise a couple of times and it felt good. But I also found out that it shares a simillar feature with one Kundalini excercise I randomly stumbled upon browsing /x/ \u2013 drawing energy to the base of the head. The book&#039;s author doesn&#039;t go in-depth on what one&#039;s really doing with himself or it&#039;s side effects. I thought that it&#039;s not wise for me to continue doing something that I know very little about.<br>But, during the excercises I&#039;ve done, I could feel the tail bone get very warm. At first I thought it&#039;s just the energy I generated using sexual stimulation, but even now I can think about that spot and it&#039;s just getting warm by itself.<br><br><a href=\"#p33766613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766613</a><br>Hey, thanks for bumping :)", "filename": "12714", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 423, "h": 951, "tn_w": 55, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672932993220946, "time": 1672932993, "md5": "ZpRLbRuGTt/43IuPi0GzRA==", "fsize": 96122, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768645, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamp", "filename": "12823", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 486, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672950438361858, "time": 1672950438, "md5": "hLs5d4OM6Vsma2pgGFvfiA==", "fsize": 164378, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768753, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:54:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33766490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766490</a><br><a href=\"#p33767199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767199</a><br>I always visualized it as currents/fields flowing in/around me.

I am just like you, I also like planning and research in advance, but plan was basically useless to me beyond the most basic points of going into this or that tradition, practicing this or that meditation. So, make sure that you&#039;re not diverting all of your efforts into research in order to escape practice. Try to maintain a consistent meditation rule even if you have no idea where exactly you want to go next. Shamatha is a good start, since it is useful for basically everything.

A lot of people today awaken kundalini unintentionally, either spontaneously or as a result of a extreme emotional or trauma response. It can happen even without intentional intervention or preparation. You could also practice some kundalini awakening meditations without sufficient energetic awareness, which is why generally you&#039;ll see a warning on these techniques to make sure to wait a week or two before trying an awakening technique a second time. Now, releasing kundalini energy is kind of like peeling one petal of an infinite and immortal flower - when people without energetic awareness do this, they may not necessarily feel it, so they think &quot;oh huh, that didn&#039;t work, let&#039;s try again&quot;. So they do it ten more times, and then spend ten years in a psychiatric hospital because they&#039;re flooded their system with way more energy than it could reasonably handle, manage and use up, like flooding an electrical appliance with ten times the electricity it needs - it won&#039;t work &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot;, it&#039;ll just break down. Kundalini awakening is about purging, optimising and only gradually flowing stronger energy through your energy system. Kundalini will give you more than plenty for this purpose even without manually releasing petal after petal. Doing that would be like blowing up a dam and standing in the way of the rushing water.", "time": 1673061772, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33779692, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33777641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33777641</a><br><a href=\"#p33779600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779600</a><br>Some further advice I can give. First, I would recommend that you look through the Traditionalist school authors. They are very reliable people and if you understand their works you will have a frame of reference to distinguish sound knowledge on these subjects from bad info. Evola is also included, particularly his spiritual books, even though the wikipedia editors have excluded him for some reason. Not all of the stuff you see on kundalini will be the best, because there was nothing like the flow of information back then that we have now. The principles are perennial, however, and will help guide you.<br>Second, about energy. The terminology is kind of ambiguous and can have slightly different connotations, but generally, energy, chi and prana are loosely equivalent. For a breakdown on energy (specifically chi), you can check out Damo Mitchell&#039;s Intro to Daoist Nei Gong. He has a section on this that you may find useful. I think that&#039;s a book I can probably mention on /x/ with clear conscience. <br>As to the difference between energy-as-such and kundalini energy in particular, it comes down to this: the energetic level is a kind of subtler level of the physical (or the physical is a denser level of the energetic if you prefer). This energetic level is kind of superimposed on top of your body and you rely on it for a lot of your normal functioning. This applies to all people. Kundalini energy is a special energy - it is the transcendent force, and it has a purpose and a goal which, once awakened, it pursues without pause, even if you suddenly have second thoughts. This transcendent force aims to help you overcome your conditioned existence, purge your energy system (which involves a lot of emotional/trauma releasing since those are stored as energy, and it also involves kriyas), and finally, when the process is complete and it fully develops your 7th chakra, you receive a strong connection to the divine, and enlightenment.", "time": 1673062549, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33781143, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)02:37:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33779609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33779609</a><br>I also warned out not opening kundalini before being ready ITT but kundalini yoga is popular and it&#039;s very much about trying to bring the energy up, practiced by everyone as if it&#039;s a synonym for yoga.

The problem is that just giving this advice to people is not all that helpful because a total newbie will not be able to distinguish the legitimate teacher from the huckster. I narrowly avoided a life-ruining scam only thanks to a reliable guy who told me that the guru I was looking at was a fraudster - something I later confirmed for myself by spending ~20 hours researching him. I would not have trusted the reliable guy if I hadn&#039;t established his reliability prior to that thanks to the principles I learnt from the Traditionalists.

As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY.

The right is a being that is of earth and the underworld. In Christian symbolism shows clearly that the &#039;good guys&#039; are the rulers of the earth with the lead ruler of earth being Satan/Samyaza/Lucifer. The battle of heaven described in religion refers to the battle of the fallen angels against the dragons of heaven which had poison for blood. Dragons were sent down by the most high, Tiamat, as a punishment for Enki killing the vessel of Anu (Zeus and Saturn). Tiamat is the creator of our planet and created order out of chaos - she is thusly associated with chaos and initial creation. Tiamat also created the lesser deities and is the most high in heaven. Religion teaches you to worship her children - the fallen angels; rulers of earth.

Others are pious, some are misguided, some are sinful. You can get terrorized or possessed by a Jinn simply for angering it, since we sometimes interact with them without knowing it (throwing a rock that hits them for example).

She mixes the Jinn with other things and fabricates stories to make them look sensational and evil (one of the stories has to do with her secret agent friend who was on a secret mission to capture Jinn tech in Saudi Arabia to give you an idea of how credible she is). That&#039;s pretty standard Fortean grifter stuff, annoying but not surprising. What&#039;s really bad is that she simultaneously says she loves Islam, but always casts it in this weird new age light when she praises it, and includes a lot of anti-Islam lies and fabrications. Falsely says the Quran has 6666 verses, quotes some anti-Muslim priest as an Islamic scholar. And the one that&#039;s the worst to me because it proves she&#039;s malicious and not incompetent is this. In Bilal Philip&#039;s book on exorcism he at one point argues against the exorcism practice of putting the Quran in water and drinking it, saying that if we can do that then we could logically bake it into bread and eat it or create alphabet soup of the Quran. When Guilley describes use of the Quran Islamic exorcism practices, she lists drinking the Quran, baking it into bread and eating it, and making alphabet soup of it.

I love your thread topic. I have cited a verse from the book of Proverbs (8:12). I made up the title, Master-Workwoman, based off of the personification of Wisdom in Proverbs 8. In my poem, I was suggesting that sexual-union, which in this case - a spiritual one, could have many meanings, was the more direct route to Wisdom on the basis of Genesis - God joins the spirits. I took a bit of influence from the Yeats poem, Leda and the Swan, &quot;and being so caught up...did she put on his knowledge...before the indifferent beak let her drop? (cited from memory, so please forgive any errors)&quot; The idea, that a sexuo-spiritual union with Athena (Wisdom) is by nature Aphrodisian and Cupidian - in need of the blessings of Demeter (metaphorically), and would by its very nature erase every mortal woe like the erosion of a sandbank by a great river, was the core of my inspiration. The purpose of the quote, was to demand distinction between the fruit of Wisdom, and Wisdom herself, I suppose. I am a Christian, btw. For me, all these names are mere symbolism. Any being which takes on their representation is playing to our fantasies and for their own purposes. I only say this so you can know where I stand, not to judge anyone, yet the metaphysical dynamos of Wisdom is no less potent for the symbol.", "time": 1673339440, "resto": 33798413}, {"no": 33804572, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:31:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804532</a><br>Not even gleanings shall you have.

In any case, what Athena bears is a common symbol - Victory and The World, if I&#039;m not mistaken. It is no Newtonian apple (Newton, also a Christian, by the by). When I say the &quot;fruit&quot; of Wisdom, I mean, presuming one has gained any wisdom, it necessarily bears fruits of the kind I&#039;ve mentioned - Knowledge, Discernment, Insight, Prudence, etc. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever read Plato&#039;s Meno dialogue (a discussion on Virtue), but after reading it, actually before even finishing it, I came to the same conclusion as Socrates. Virtue comes from God. Additionally, I came to another realization: <br><br>Both Vice and Virtue are multiplicative and their growth exponential. That is, Vice invites Vice, and Virtue, Virute - they proliferate their own kind. To quote Scripture again (because in so doing we can see the Wisdom of Almighty God), &quot;each bearing seed according to its own kind.&quot; What appears to have been merely about biology we now see has spiritual application, so the first question becomes, &quot;What makes an attribute (a virtue or a vice) invite another?&quot; Thinking on it, I came to the conclusion the nature of them was to wax or wane into a related attribute. For instance, Temperance (a virtue), can invite Pride (a vice). The reason, that in ever-increasing success at retaining temperance, a person can begin to think themselves superior to those who do not. Just a simple example. Now the next question is, &quot;What allows a person to maintain the balance - to prevent a person from birthing an vice of a virtue, or to enable a man to pursue a virtue he does not possess?&quot; The obvious answer, is Wisdom. <br><br>God is the Father and giver of Virtue, and Wisdom could be called its nurse. She is the tender and keeper of all Virtues, and brings all necessities thereof - Knowledge and Understanding. <br><br>Peter broke many chains and formed none. He will outrank most in Heaven, and better not to speak of him as a slaver.", "time": 1673341632, "resto": 33798413}, {"no": 33804733, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)04:10:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804711</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whichever you prefer my friend</span>", "filename": "91KlMGuXqmL._SL1500_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673341856689144, "time": 1673341856, "md5": "O6ooH43sXJh28lybi16r2A==", "fsize": 361291, "resto": 33798413}, {"no": 33804742, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)04:13:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804733</a><br>I prefer each and every man in precisely what he is correct about, and nothing besides.

I walked away, and i saw the same beautiful girl sitting alone in the caffe near the courtroom, she wore black clothes But they looked so good on her, and she was smiling too. I approached her and sat with her in the caffe for some time. We talked about all sorts of stuff and we had great chemistry. Then i told her about my partner and she have me his phone number, she even offered to call him herself and ask him to pay me, i respectfully declined and wrote his phone number. I told her goodbye and exited the caffe. I called my partner and he agreed to pay me tommorow. All was good. My father then picked me up and started to drive me home, then i remebered that i didn&#039;t ask the beautiful girl for her phone number.

They all worship Lucifer (Satan) in various forms and under various names. They view him as the Sun, and the Sun is represented by Moloch, Ba\u2019al, Osiris, Horus, Bacchus, Appolo, etc. Moloch, Ba\u2019al, and Satan are variants or Saturn / Chronus. They also worship Baphomet, Lilith, Isis, and Ishtar / Inanna, and the generative properties (reproductive systems). All of that incorporates into sex magick.<br><br>The currency of these groups is acquired through the worldwide drug trade. Children are their main victims. The reason for this is due to the purity of children\u2019s souls. The older you get, the more of the world you\u2019re exposed to, and the less innocent / pure you are. They take adults, but newborns to teenagers are their preferred targets.<br><br>All of these groups hate Jesus Christ and view Him as an enemy, and a \u201cperversion\u201d / \u201cperverter\u201d of the Mysteries. This is why you see comparisons between Jesus and Osiris / Horus, and other pagan deities. It\u2019s all anti-Christ propaganda. As a means to cope, these groups maintain that the \u201cposition of Christ\u201d is an \u201coffice\u201d that anyone can achieve, which is bullshit. There is only One Christ, which is Jesus, Son of the Father and the Blessed Mother. If He wasn\u2019t so, all of the propaganda and spewn hatred against Him would be unnecessary.<br><br>These groups rule the world, and have since antiquity. Every royal family throughout history has been educated in the Mysteries in some way, shape, or form.

The planets? Giant balls of metal and gases. They either become suns, join suns, or orbit suns. Spores can live millions of years in the vacuum of space. We could be related by bacterial or fungal spore panspermia, amongst asteroid panspermia and other theories. Even if we came from vents on the bottom of the ocean, if life can only be created and evolve in one way, the Darwin model on earth, then we are basically de facto related.

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if such organisms were found in subterranean Mars, underneath the ice of Europa, and in the atmosphere of Venus. Life seems to be extremely persistent, adaptable, and essentially impossible to permanently eliminate once conceived.<br>I&#039;m expecting complex extraterrestrial life (things with bones) to be far less common, but not exactly rare. Animals might be a &quot;once per solar system&quot; kind of occurrence: only propagating on the most consistent climate-controlled kind of &quot;goldilocks&quot; planet in a given system. I don&#039;t agree with speculative biologists. At all. Alien animals will most likely be very similar to what we&#039;ve already witnessed with Earth animals.

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if such organisms were found in subterranean Mars, underneath the ice of Europa, and in the atmosphere of Venus. Life seems to be extremely persistent, adaptable, and essentially impossible to permanently eliminate once conceived.<br>I&#039;m expecting complex extraterrestrial life (things with bones) to be far less common, but not exactly rare. Animals might be a &quot;once per solar system&quot; kind of occurrence: only propagating on the most consistent climate-controlled kind of &quot;goldilocks&quot; planet in a given system. I don&#039;t agree with speculative biologists. At all. Alien animals will most likely be very similar to what we&#039;ve already witnessed with Earth animals. It&#039;s like how Dinosaurs all evolved from a different common ancestor to Mammals, but despite this Dinosaurs and Mammals still developed into very similar creatures because they still ultimately needed to do and survive the same conditions and some designs are just &quot;the meta&quot;. It is basically the whole concept of niches here on earth. Every animal fits into their environment. The only differences between us and other intelligent aliens would be bone structure and facial structure. Most likely, we would both still be bipedal. And it wouldn&#039;t be incredibly impossible to breed with them especially if you can believe in fungal or bacterial spore panspermia.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared. While Trejo was being assisted, the same sound as before was heard. The next morning, 50 men searched the whole area but found no bullet casings or bullet holes. However, the Air Force concluded that the soldiers did fire their guns. Spanish Army veteran Vicente Juan believes the soldiers suffered nothing but a hallucination strengthened by fear and confusion.&quot;<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manis<wbr>es_UFO_incident<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_<wbr>Tehran_UFO_incident<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8<wbr>5-tQ2lO_I </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.history.com/news/korea<wbr>n-war-us-army-ufo-attack-illness</span>", "filename": "1673331939478590", "ext": ".gif", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673333241498929, "time": 1673333241, "md5": "zEeo+PxQ9oaKI6BBujxebw==", "fsize": 1393705, "resto": 33784257}, {"no": 33804175, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:48:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804027</a><br><a href=\"#p33804104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804104</a><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV<wbr>q7gBH70WE </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://siberiantimes.com/other/ot<wbr>hers/features/f0077-aliens-and-ufos<wbr>-at-worlds-deepest-lake/</span><br><br>Accounts in history disproving the psyop theory: <br><br>Historical UFO encounters:<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_<wbr>celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg<wbr><br><br>https://www.history.com/news/americ<wbr>as-first-ufo-sighting<br><br>http://www.gfn.or.kr/bbs/board.php?<wbr>bo_table=special_aod_07&amp;wr_id=2<br><br>https://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2<wbr>012/06/ancient-flying-saucers.html", "filename": "700px-Himmelserscheinung_u\u0308ber_Nu\u0308rnberg_vom_14._April_1561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 788, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673333336426032, "time": 1673333336, "md5": "RBVyrQu0x48iuMVjDVNFbw==", "fsize": 177002, "resto": 33784257}, {"no": 33804185, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:51:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804027</a><br>I just tried to find the source for your map and there literally is no &quot;esri&quot; <br><br>Why are you lying about UFO sightings?", "filename": "1673038777824657", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 276, "h": 400, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673333471538283, "time": 1673333471, "md5": "j8CZeMxhq2TDN0oyMU6yGA==", "fsize": 26341, "resto": 33784257}, {"no": 33804193, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:53:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33801682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33801682</a><br>Nice find.

It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal.

He never actually argues that we should just meet our biological needs, in fact he argues the exact opposite. In Sapiens he argues that all belief is collective fiction designed to allow humans to organize in patterns which would be biologically impossible, which Harari actually claimed was mankinds greatest tool that allowed us to outcompete all other life forms including other forms of humans like Neanderthals. Harari assumes that all belief in things which are not traditionally considered material are beliefs in fictions, which again he also distinguished from a lie because a belief is something which is assumed to be true and can have an impact in our world despite it having no physical presence in our universe and only existing as information. My personal disagreement is that things people believe in that are not SCIENCE are collective fictions. He claims religion, human rights, law, magic, nations, ideologies, and essentially anything which is not SCIENCE is a collective fictions that impact our world because humans behave as if they do. I disagree that SCIENCE is the physical truth while our world of intellectual ideas is entirely fictional but real to only humanity.", "time": 1673298721, "resto": 33796084}, {"no": 33800376, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)16:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33796084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33796084</a><br>consciousness?<br>electromagnetic and quantum interactions with the hyperdimensional holographic consciousness field.<br>allows mind over matter physics.<br>astral projection, manifestation, telepathy, levitation.<br>this is how ufos work.<br>electromagnetic gravitics, electromagnetic zero-point energy extraction.<br>same with synthetic telepathy, it&#039;s all electromagnetic pulses.<br>demons are said to live in the consciousness field, and black projects and aliens travel in the consciousness field and conduct their interactions.", "filename": "gateway process anime", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1257, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673298776162507, "time": 1673298776, "md5": "StBAivkpeBE/HKnCsDx5kQ==", "fsize": 232003, "resto": 33796084}, {"no": 33800600, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)16:44:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33799638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33799638</a><br>Holy shit.

Ramana Maharshi is one exemplar but not the only exemplar of it. His own personal way was also the forcefully ascetic and self-denying way, in removal from society and a combination of fervent Bhakti yoga (religious devotion) as well as jnani yoga (intellectual self-inquiry, his famous question \u201cWho am I?\u201d). As <a href=\"#p33802155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33802155</a> this is fundamentally similar to the Indian sage and jnanayogi Nisargadatta Maharaj\u2019s teachings on self-inquiry, but comparing/contrasting the two and claiming Nisargadatta\u2019s was \u201csuperior,\u201d is something I\u2019m unsure of. Nisargadatta himself highly respected Ramana\u2019s state of being, claimed he would have loved to have met him, and kept a portrait of him in his house along with other spiritual figures he revered or respected (including, funnily enough, Jiddu Krishnamurti!). <br><br>Another reputed way of self-liberation, in distinction to the ascetic Vedantic path of Ramana Maharshi, is given out in the Tantric Agamas of Shiva and preserved as a tradition by tantric traditions like Kashmir Shaivism. In this way, one does not flee from the pleasures and struggles of ordinary life as a householder (the purusharthas or valid aims of human life mentioned in <a href=\"#p33802286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33802286</a>, of dharma (duty), kama (romantic love/sex/marriage), artha (wealth, career, economic prosperity) and moksha (liberation, enlightenment)), all of them being fused together and transmuted in the search for moksha, or the realization of Sat-Chit-Ananda (being-consciousness-bliss), transmuting the joys and pains of ordinary life into that same Bliss.

The first was when I was trying to sleep. I had been thinking of a technique I had read earlier about visualising an elevator that takes you down to your subconscious. It&#039;s nothing new, just a variation on a hypnotic induction, but I was trying it anyway. I wanted to be clear and vivid so I spent some time looking at where I was outside of the elevator, the ground, to my sides, where the elevator stood. I even tried to set myself right in terms of balance. As I was lying down I needed to change that perception to an equivalent of standing, and that was difficult. Anyway, at some point a man shouted my full name. I was awake when this happened, and the voice was audible, loud and clear. Though after he had shouted I did wonder, did I really hear my name? Suddenly the two words blurred together. Was it one word? Regardless, it was a noise that cut through every other thought I had. Naturally I was terrified.</span><br><br>Ghost Hands Hold Me Down and Try to Make Me Look Under the Bed<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second was a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night, terrified. I had been in bed and something was holding me down, trying to force my head to look at the floor, under my bed. I managed to get myself onto my forearms and raise myself up against its strong hands, but my arms felt so weak, it was as though my arms had been emptied out and filled with stuffing, or else the ghost that gripped me with his thousand ghost hands had the strength of the Earth itself. I woke, terrified. I did a search this morning, and saw there is an Arabic name for this. Kaboose, they call him; pressure. I have been visited twice now by this pressure of the night, this ghost that tumbles me in my sleep and holds me down. After waking I wondered, what was this all about? I was being forced to the floor. Perhaps I should have looked. I did praise my courage for struggling against it to get onto my forearms.</span><br><br>This dream triggered a pretty major emotional breakdown for me.", "time": 1672967303, "resto": 33768629}, {"no": 33770541, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:13:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33770492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33770492</a><br><br>Tell us about Kaboose.

I wanted him to not . . . his hand was pressing closer and I felt as though his hand was rising up my chest to my neck, and I almost leaned into it. My eyes became blurry.

I rolled onto my back and I shit you not I saw a shadowy pentagram filled with sigils or something on the ceiling above me. This was actually really shocking, it eventually faded away and I knew i was finally awake. but after it faded there was a faint red glowing light just hovering towards the top of the ceiling. I jumped up out of bed pointing at it while screaming &quot;HA ! HA! HA!&quot; (because I won) scared the absolute shit out of my girlfriend.

A way to develop the mind and body for meditative purposes.<br>2. An outlet for Panha (prana, qi, viriya, piti-sukha, winds, &#039;life energy&#039;, etc.) to be developed in.<br>3. Protection of monasteries and local regions guarded by the temple. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Function of qigong, tai chi, similar. </span><br>This is where the second purpose of buddhist martial arts comes in. When a meditator was good at what they were doing, they would develop piti-sukha (or &#039;qi&#039;). Without a place to direct the energy, it can be overwhelming for some, and can become a distraction when not balanced with the other dhyana factors. <br>As such, the second purpose of buddhist martial arts comes into play here. Qigong and taichi were an extension to the normal martial arts regimen, and specifically designed to help move the piti-sukha through the body and develop it for certain usages (psychic powers, the ability to change the bodies texture/temperature, and keep the body from injury and exhaustion.) The physical component of qigong had a place, but only to help direct the energy cultivated during the meditation. <br>When the meditator monk mastered the piti-sukha (chi) through meditation and qigong/tai chi, it allowed them to fully serve their role as a buddhist monastic.

Until you get more experience listening to truth, it can sometimes be hard to discern, but really it&#039;s pretty easy to realize when someone&#039;s full of shit. If you&#039;re doing self study, best way I&#039;ve found to grok the teachings is to find 3-5 sources all talking about the same thing, spend a week or three on each source, and between them you&#039;ll be able to internalize the canon. So if you want to develop ba duan jin, you&#039;d get &quot;instant health, shaolin qigong workout&quot; by shifu yan lei, you&#039;d go on youtube and watch shi heng yi&#039;s courses on the brocades, and so on, and you&#039;ll practice in front of a mirror and all that. But there are a lot of little details that these sources can&#039;t cover because of the nature of the medium. If you want to employ reverse abdominal breathing the right way during the sequence for example, you need to get the details and postural corrections in person, so you&#039;re hard-capped. For where you&#039;re at, it sounds like you want to develop a personal understanding of and ability to perceive qi. Neigong is where you should focus your efforts. The book &quot;comprehensive guide to daoist neigong&quot; is imo the best starting place for that.

Some were corrupted into banks, but there was still many which would have happily provided free room and board and food for people as they&#039;d been doing for thousands of years.

They only gained complete and total control during the &#039;cultural revolution&#039;. The bureaucrat class sees anything which cannot be controlled as a danger. Meditation and spirituality are two things which cannot be controlled, and as such needed to be completely removed. As long as they were in existence, nobody would be completely loyal to the state. This gets promoted in china as atheist secularism, similar to france and the global west. <br>3.
