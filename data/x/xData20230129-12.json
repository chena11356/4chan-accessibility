I&#039;ve had my own share of negative experiences in general with putting my trust in the wrong people, even including one where a parasitic entity pretended to be Lilith and used a promise I made to her in an attempt to manipulate me.

The reason the parasite I mentioned was able to affect me so deeply, is because it turned my own deep-seated insecurities that lingered from my adolescence against me. That&#039;s how parasitic entities work.

Rather than blaming her for the things I went through despite my faith, I appreciate that her warmth gave me the strength and courage to face myself, so that I could leave that sorrowful past behind me.

Are kitsune a different astral species entirely? Is there such a thing as &quot;multi-classing&quot; in this context? Just what in the world would the implications be?

Turn and do the same for the 2 corners behind you, meeting once more above your head. Envision now your waifu, doing chunni poses to close in the walls of the pyramid you have just created.

I always end up wrenching myself out of these experiences all of a sudden but with this one I literally had to tear myself away from the bed with every ounce of strength I could muster and I genuinely screamed whilst doing so.

When you wake up in the middle of the night, avoid going back to bed right away. Instead, get up and do something like walking around your room or getting a glass of water. When you go back to bed, focus on the sensation of your body falling asleep and try to be aware of the process. As you start to fall asleep, you may begin to feel a vibration throughout your body. At this point, it&#039;s important to stay calm and not get too excited as this could cause you to wake up. Remember, the key is to be calm and concentrated.

With the ability to control and manipulate dream scenarios, individuals can use this skill to enhance creativity, problem-solve, and even work through unresolved emotional issues.

Agree on many values, physical attraction is good, practical life (money, health, etc.) is going well. Been running into a major problem. I&#039;m fundamentally an artist (musician and other things), that&#039;s what I care most in the world about and it is a spiritual path for me that brings growth and depth to life. She is not an artist and doesn&#039;t place the same value on creativity as a spiritual path that I do, though she can intellectually understand it when we have a good conversation about why it&#039;s so important to me, she isn&#039;t participating in it. I&#039;ve been trying to get her involved in creativity somehow and she&#039;s not fundamentally opposed to the idea but she&#039;s so rigid and critical she immediately rejects small steps I try to introduce to at least try to start walking down the path. I feel I&#039;ll be severely limiting my life if I can&#039;t walk down this spiritual path with my partner. They don&#039;t need to be involved in my creative process and my creative world, but I feel if they had a creative process and world of their own, we could at least connect as two beings growing on parallel paths. <br><br>Related issue is she&#039;s not motivated to do things alone. My creative pursuits are solo and I&#039;m super motivated to work on them all the time. I think she actually does have the right perspective, essence, (I dunno the right words to describe it), to be very creative, but she requires me to be doing it with her or she won&#039;t do it. If this will never change then I don&#039;t know that I can invest the time to have to always be the starter for her path as well as mine.

When we place ourselves at Death&#039;s door, our survival instincts are called into question, and the core of ourselves which is our will to live is exposed and laid bare. It is of the id, the most primitive part of the human psyche, dictating the way in which we live our lives and experience the world.<br><br>Until we have put ourselves into that mentality, we live in many illusions and delusions as to what we value or believe.

And when one realizes that they would rather live than not, suddenly, they come to see too how they would rather live in a certain &quot;place&quot; so to speak than others---meaning, surrounded and immersed in an artificial world pleasing to their own senses. And it is one thing to accouter one&#039;s life with the adornments designed by others---but another thing to find this subtly dissatisfactory, and moved to create oneself.

You believe it is a necessity to be practical, calculating, judgmental but deep inside you have a kind and sensitive heart that is unable to discriminate. The natural drive of a fire Jupiter sign to lead, innovate, discover, to prove one&#039;s worthiness to the world is diminished by a natural tendency to be introverted and a deep preference to find meaningfulness instead in the service some greater personality or some grander goal. All of these conflicting natures combined are the source of personal drama and contribute to a highly turbulent state of mind. Unless you do the herculean effort to reconcile these natures, you will remain scatterbrained and directionless for life, unable to focus oneself onto a single goal. You have lots of useful talents, indeed you&#039;re a Jack-of-all-trades, yet a master of none. Water placements suggest a deep creative mind. You are probably TOO conservative with money. Your Saturn placement is hard to interpret. It indicates someone who is extremely stubborn to change, but being in the 9th house it may mean struggles with personal stagnation or that you are moving places all the time within a very small area. You really crave for very deep relationships. You have problems with being selective with friends and partners. You are prone to choosing the wrong kinds of people, you will commit one&#039;s self to someone who may not be able to live up to one&#039;s high expectations of a romantic partner or a friend and you may treat each other badly as a result.

But it&#039;s something to be careful with imo even if you&#039;re looking into a legit tariqa or listening to a legit sheikh. My advice is to disregard all Western sources on the topic and start with Imam al-Ghazali. He at least, and probably many Sufi greats, is much more focused on stuff like taqwa and dhikr than on uncovering secrets.<br><br>I&#039;m not gonna do tafsir on that passage and it&#039;s a very dangerous thing to do without knowledge, which I don&#039;t have. Just a warning in case it ever applies to you, al-Qurtubi said that it&#039;s kufr even if your interpretation is correct, at least for public interpretation. But yeah, I share your concerns. I think this attitude of beelining straight for mystic knowledge is really unhealthy, not that that&#039;s what all or even most Sufis do. It&#039;s intellectually gluttonous, the equivalent of only wanting to eat exciting food at every meal, health be damned. Which is why it shouldn&#039;t surprise us that it&#039;s the aspect of Islam that elicits the most interest and sympathy in the West, Western culture is gluttonous in every sense.<br><br>We should focus on doing the basics excellently, following the law and sunnah, purifying our hearts and drawing closer to God. If that ends with God giving us some hidden wisdom then so be it, icing on the cake.

But by allowing for the possibility that the measurement setting for one particle can retrocausally influence the behavior of the other particle, there is no need for action-at-a-distance\u2014only retrocausal influence.</span>", "time": 1674953119, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954396, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:49:11", "name": "A comfy vampire", "com": "Money flows to me.<br>I am a money magnet.<br>Money comes easy to me.<br>I like money.<br>I am wealthy.", "filename": "pepe_golden", "ext": ".gif", "w": 290, "h": 290, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674953351150573, "time": 1674953351, "md5": "MBf+xYMIAm/eaQ66C5APaw==", "fsize": 1741071, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954412, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33950188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33950188</a><br>Hol&#039; up<br><br>Are you sayin<br><br>I can manifest knocking up a streamer with thousands of viewers and a boyfriend?", "time": 1674953499, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954420, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:52:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I flow to the wealthy.<br>I AM attracted to the wealthy.<br>I go easily toward the wealthy.<br>I like the wealthy.<br>I AM money.", "time": 1674953545, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954430, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:54:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33950188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33950188</a><br>i own and live in this house. i bought it myself. i helped my family fight their demons and i reunited my family together. i have enough money to help those that helped me when i needed it and i always help my community and those i relied on in darker times.", "time": 1674953676, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954455, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:59:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33951653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33951653</a><br>basado", "time": 1674953955, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954480, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:02:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33951810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33951810</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F2<wbr>qjtwcMhA", "time": 1674954158, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954566, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:16:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33953829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33953829</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;plant seeds</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wait one hour</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;destroy the soil looking for fully formed plants</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;why is it not working?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;you fucking destroyed the soil and uprooted the seeds!&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;sounds like some hard cope&quot;</span>", "time": 1674955003, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954591, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33951647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33951647</a><br>fuck &#039;em", "time": 1674955316, "resto": 33950188}, {"no": 33954659, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:34:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33950445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33950445</a><br>http://www.winwenger.com/imstream.h<wbr>tm<br><br>https://photographyinsider.info/ima<wbr>ge-streaming-for-photographers/<br><br>both of these are the same method.

I practiced very hard for a couple years a learned a bunch but ultimately it was not well suited for my psychology. The technique gave me to much to do. I think some people might benefit from a task oriented meditation like that but for my psychology it just provided too much opportunity to distract and obstruct myself through analysis.

In my experience you can&#039;t really stop thoughts or have the mind become completely blank as some describe it (or maybe you can if you&#039;re way more advanced than I am), but you can realize that you are not your thoughts - the thoughts keep churning away, appearing, changing, running their course, in your mind, but you are separate from that.

Keep on trying to move your body. Works every time for me.<br>As for the worlds in my mind, it&#039;s pure imagination. If you have phantasia i.e. you can visualize the apple, you&#039;re already there. If you can see the apple in your mind, that is, its real. Open up your hand and look at it.

Now you can start building worlds. <br>For a frame of reference, imagine a world where the sky is purple. There are mountains in the distance. Maybe a river. If you can see it, congrats.

Sometimes it is best to learn, and teach if you can when you feel like you should. <br><br>For example, I do know OP&#039;s notes are not completely copied from something or the reading material itself. It is a synthesis of some material he likely found and his own conjectures. I do not recognize some of the foreign material (though see the cohesive picture), and likewise, there are some points I know (like how dark matter isn&#039;t a thing, and while the nordic &quot;ice&quot; element means a thing similar to void which OP does know he needs to include the concept of the black sun being what fuels an unilluminated astral world, the infernal world. As the hidden fire, and infernal abyss, is the nature of what the light of consciousness shines against, and the product seen by the light of consciousness upon the hidden fire is the astral world which is not the same thing as the hidden infernal and thus not the black sun which remains hidden even when viewing astrally). There is a profound relationship starting to form here in these drawings/writings of more I can&#039;t have the space to write, but I don&#039;t understand any of these names fully and the diagram relationships need to be mapped and etched across a grander structure to see the full picture. There is a material OP is synthesizing his knowledge with, and I want to find that material so I can synthesize. idk if OP sees the significance of the unearthing of energy he is hinting at or if he is just coy, but there is a means of cultivation possible from these roots if investigated further.<br><br><a href=\"#p33955240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955240</a><br>Nobody cares about neo stuff.", "time": 1674963960, "resto": 33954211, "filedeleted": 1}, {"no": 33955706, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:21:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33955178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955178</a><br>yo same...I am concerned for OP Tho", "time": 1674966076, "resto": 33954211}, {"no": 33955816, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:37:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33955706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955706</a><br>He\u2019ll be fine, there are plenty of functional schizos out there, and every now and then they come up with something genuinely groundbreaking.", "filename": "933EA233-0350-42BD-BA25-CF1F611777A7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1009, "h": 1096, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674967055745841, "time": 1674967055, "md5": "PFxJNiPgDRGZYY+ncDd0TA==", "fsize": 819294, "resto": 33954211}, {"no": 33955858, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:46:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33955475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955475</a><br>Mmmm interesting\u2026 what\u2019s your opinion on the meds you haven\u2019t taken today?", "time": 1674967587, "resto": 33954211}, {"no": 33955867, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:47:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33955706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955706</a><br><a href=\"#p33955178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33955178</a><br>You both need some pussy ASAP", "time": 1674967647, "resto": 33954211}, {"no": 33955895, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:51:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33954211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33954211</a><br>All paganism is a larp.

There are mysteries I want to know. They are real, even if generally evil and not &quot;cute anime girl!&quot; tier things. From what I know, there tends to be ritualistic initiation to cross from mere starting vampiric magic to actually turning into a vampire. Vampires, lycanthropes, berserker druids, all manner of things exist where people change into entirely different beings. But there has to be some sort of bridge which causes a genetic trigger. I want to know these things. It&#039;s not even just a human thing, certain ayy species also have genetic triggers to evolve certain classes of themselves into something else. There is a whole mystic mystery here that is kept guarded and spread through different traditions but so secretive that there is barely an inkling on piecing the initiation portion of the process down to trigger actual change. It is only feasible to find magic which emulates this stuff, or only half-steps before the initiatory process. But it isn&#039;t the ritual itself I want to know, but the actual triggers causes and reasons, which can only be investigated through knowing how the process is actualized.", "time": 1674867502, "resto": 33942200, "filedeleted": 1}, {"no": 33947168, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)19:59:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "was the Mona Lisa a vampire?<br>that would explain a lot", "filename": "Mona_Lisa", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1815, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674867595608608, "time": 1674867595, "md5": "4tRFQVlLwKdUXbxk8scxMg==", "fsize": 680243, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947196, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:05:32", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "vampire", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 2715, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674867932141935, "time": 1674867932, "md5": "VNKxxS5l6/cNOqA5+dmzFQ==", "fsize": 645695, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947209, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:06:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBC<wbr>aeMiriKI&amp;ab_channel=DuncBlair", "filename": "hqdefault", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674868005871306, "time": 1674868005, "md5": "ZpKI7gPAgO0A2hSGSTtwgg==", "fsize": 16147, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947313, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:25:41", "name": "S.L.M, Zeus.", "com": "No.33944822<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;venus 33 , death 44 and mercery 22</span><br><br>all of these are vampires except death.<br>yikes.<br><a href=\"#p33947132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33947132</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;33</span><br>we get it mason.<br><br>the redhead is able.<br>he bit so many people.<br><br>Op is an idoit.<br>they would just drink you dry unless there is something they want.", "time": 1674869141, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947329, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:29:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33942200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33942200</a><br>Hello OP, I&#039;ve come to suck your blood. whatsup?", "filename": "3fd510df-5a7c-4bb0-9d95-b820db5a20df", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674869367650674, "time": 1674869367, "md5": "dEAKAAJnlqAIp4EMrSLh5Q==", "fsize": 59264, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947336, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:30:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33947313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33947313</a><br>AI bot", "filename": "b60c96a8c85b8cdc15cd16fea263d528", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 564, "h": 564, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674869425059813, "time": 1674869425, "md5": "Rd9VuOpuZfl0q6VxUX+OkQ==", "fsize": 44997, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947347, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:32:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33947329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33947329</a><br>go ahead", "filename": "43ea5ec594ba82f619425b72633b2b97", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 564, "h": 699, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674869552088912, "time": 1674869552, "md5": "pOLGRd466RJciwSXnui1rw==", "fsize": 54959, "resto": 33942200}, {"no": 33947369, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)20:35:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life.

It&#039;s going to flip your approach upside and have you realize that trying to fix and mend the past is the wrong way to go about things and that the only thing affirming and reinforcing that past (which is almost always a distorted, relative and sometimes even false memory of what took place... just ask different people about an event or occurrence and see how differently each and everyone remembers it including yourself) is the feelings attached to those memories and so therefore to overcome all of that you literally just have to drop the emotional conditioning and programming and introduce a new one that ascend them.

The only footage that survived was this clip, as everything else was fried. After he exploded my wall, a huge flash blinded me for several minutes, which was why I backed up to the wall scared and confused. After reviewing this footage, he appeared to be conducting a mating ritual that most ayys do when sexually aroused. When he finally left several hours later, as I cowered in the corner, I saw that he had taken my pants with him. Looking out of the hole in my wall, they were hanging out of the door in his ship as he flew off. A couple hours later I found a homeless man wearing them, as he had scavenged them when they fell off the ship.

Whether they behaved good or bad or whether you did, it&#039;s up to you to pick up the pieces of your heart so you can move on.

That&#039;s a difficult approach but might be the healthier one if you can avoid overthinking the past. This doesn&#039;t mean actively seeking for a relationship with them even if just friendship but if you interact and you can keep that very strong mentality of trying to find an order to things, it can be done.

So here is where we find the contrast, your issue is how many things you want to balance at the same time and overthinking but by doing so you are ironically showing less commitment to each of them.

Meaning that wanting to do a lot can be less efficient than focusing on little by little. Try to narrow your sights focusing entirely on one thing at the time.

Not only that, but animals have senses today the environment that, for some reasons, humans just ignore or harness in technology (birds sense magnetism, sharks sense electricity; we use magnets, and we have recently domesticated electricity). Physics and science does a good job to explain \u201chow,\u201d while philosophy endeavors to explain \u201cwhy.\u201d But while we\u2019re thing to find out the rules of nature, we\u2019re being subjected to these forces on a daily basis; the most prominent being the collective unconscious, which doesn\u2019t even have a representation in the physical world. Sounds can be perceived within a certain range, but when they emulate the sound of a human voice, they get your brain to think about imaginary pictures and concepts, some of which are loaded with connotations and meanings- and these are all supplied to you from experience and evolution. There\u2019s no other world than what you can perceive, but there\u2019s channels and layers of this world that you cannot perceive: fourth dimensions and higher, for example. The ability to question these things is also what prevents you from finding the answer; just as thought and consciousness is recursive, so is asking \u201cwhy.\u201d Humans can really only perceive the past, and the \u201cpresent\u201d is an infinitesimal point that we always miss, because it\u2019s so incalculably small- it may as well not exist. So, not only is your perception of space distorted by your corporeal body, but so is your sense of time distorted by your incorporeal mind. <br>That is why the tree of knowledge had the forbidden fruit, because wisdom is knowing how much you don\u2019t know.

He taught an Elf how to create them, then he secretly created The One Ring that controlled all the others, and put much of his angelic soul into the Ring. He was responsible for the corruption of N\u00famenor (Atlantis) and its destruction by Eru. Sauron saw the Elves as a Problem because of their skepticism about their rings and they warred against him along with Dwarves and men in the 2nd Age.

We all get to know what is right and what is wrong. Sure some people lie about it, but societal truths are abound. You can not blame men for women being promiscuous, it is their Individual choice. You can not blame women for men being promiscuous it is their choice as individuals.<br><br>On another note. Saying race does not matter is factually wrong. Each race evolved with its own habits that on a genetic level help to create peace and harmony in their ecology. The key word is &quot;their.&quot; When you bring two species together fighting and even genocide is sadly almost assured.<br>To offer an Opinion I think without a quick separation we will see who truly is the best at society. It is only a matter of time. Though to say only one fight is on the front is untrue. Race is only a weapon being used, for what is going on.<br>This stuff is heavy... I do not like to talk about it.<br><br>Of course If I only thought about the physical I would assume only one route was to happen. But when I look at reality through another lens, so to say... Ideology, the end is obvious. I wonder if you have ever seen the end. One does not simply lay down and die. One does outlast.
