God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul.

Leadbeater from their book &quot;The Astral Plane \u2013 It\u2019s Scenery, Inhabitants and Phenomena&quot; to describe them as:<br><br>&quot;...a formulated, definite wish or thought instantly shapes subtle matter, moulding it into an independent being. This mental form lasts as long as the power given to the original thought or wish allows it to. The thoughts of many people are indecisive and evanescent, so that thought forms created by them do not last longer than some minutes or maybe hours. However, a powerful wish or an often-repeated wish or thought can give rise to a mental form lasting for days.<br><br>These thought-forms seem to have an instinct or tendency to preserve themselves as all living beings do have. People\u2019s thoughts mostly refer to themselves, so that the thought form will stay with them and, in this way, it will provoke a tendency to repeat the thought or wish from which it was created so as to gain power and prolong its own life. Such a thought-form nourished by often-repeated thougths is able to haunt a person for many years, gaining strength and influence, sometimes with very negative effects.&quot;<br><br>The 4 usually attributed types of Thoughtforms according to the Western Magickal Tradition are as follows: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tulpas</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Servitors</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Egregores</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Godforms</span><br><br>What are your experiences with these, /x/?

For example a couple weeks ago I wore a Mickey mouse hat because I couldn&#039;t find my other hat I usually wear. Couple days later 2 mice show up and I have no idea how they got in (unless maybe human hands helped) and my neighbor also got them as well and she lives all the way upstairs. Anyone know how a mouse that&#039;s not even full grown can make it up stairs? I&#039;m ground floor but I have stairs as well. I basically think it&#039;s the demiurge or satan aka mara influencing people. I definitely sense a evil spirit that appears ignorant often like a dumb animal. Stupid unthinking people are more susceptible because they are weak willed and easily manipulated. It coaxes them into gang stalking this guy because he was actually a pretty spiritual dude with good intentions and intelligence but he snapped. You know less intelligent people get really jealous and intimidated by anyone smart and they will go out of their way to try and hurt them it&#039;s really bizarre.

Again, evil is the best way i can describe it really. Just like, extremely negative, sometimes paranoid thoughts, like all my depressive/schizoid tendencies are amplified by a hundred fold. I&#039;ve been dealing with some issues with my throat/tonsils for a good few years now and it almost feels like that area is highlighted in hazardous, neon yellow - a really uncomfortable, almost burning sensation, which I don&#039;t get when I&#039;m sober or even smoking weed, although I do experience a lot of discomfort from it on a daily basis, it&#039;s totally impossible to ignore when under the influence of edibles, and leads to just impeccably horrible, feverishly anxious thought loops. What is it about edibles specifically that does this to me, when regular old smoked cannabis doesn&#039;t? I know it&#039;s not actually THC, it gets metabolised into some other thing when you eat it, so maybe I&#039;m just psychologically intolerant to that particular cannabinoid?

Grew up in a rural suburb and lived a comfortable and idyllic life as a child. Read a lot and was pretty nerdy in my youth (still am of course), but in particular I found myself gravitating towards math and especially geometry (partly, I think, because my father was an architect and partly because my visual sense of pleasure is acute). The beauty of geometry is unsurpassed for me and the pleasure of completing a geometrical proof or construction is one of the most satisfying things in the world (as I&#039;m sure some of you are aware).<br>Geometry has fascinated me as far back as I can remember but the real turning point for me was when, on my 8th birthday, I was gifted a leather-bound copy of Euclid&#039;s elements by my papa (along with a lego set and some toy cars). I can&#039;t tell you how many hours I spent reading that and bothering my dad over it (it was very fun, I encourage you guys to do the same with your kids).<br><br>Anyway, the point is I was privileged and had parents who encouraged me to get to where I am now: a math undergraduate at &quot;Ivy League University&quot;.<br><br>Curiously though, a professor of mine espied me having lunch alone one day and came over to sit with me. This made me very uncomfortable for two reasons: first, I didn&#039;t want company (much less from some professor) and second, I was drawing some geometrical construction (which is something that has addicted me much since I was a child) and I was embarrassed to be seen doing math like that around my professor (silly I guess but I&#039;m very self conscious).<br>The odd thing was that he just got close to me and said<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nice construction, I guess you&#039;re a Ganymede initiate, huh? you are [my father]&#039;s boy right?</span>", "filename": "DAb-7jPXgAA7vEl", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 208, "tim": 1669377034206315, "time": 1669377034, "md5": "p1BBM9hGhWbXNzKG/+Fhng==", "fsize": 199625, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hello-x", "replies": 21, "images": 5, "omitted_posts": 16, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 33457498, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)16:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "if it isn&#039;t freemasons or some such then it&#039;s definitely that he&#039;s surprised your father never offered up your boipussi to the crew", "time": 1669412015, "resto": 33454234}, {"no": 33457667, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)17:00:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33457498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33457498</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;freemasons</span><br>I think my family are involved with them in some way but I haven&#039;t been invited to the club, so to speak.

Big note: DO NOT WORSHIP THEM. No matter what aspect you use, Ishtar or Ashtaroth. The whole selling point is that you don&#039;t need to worship them, and can interact with them more like a respected mortal than a god.
