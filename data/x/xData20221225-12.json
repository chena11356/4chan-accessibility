And that&#039;s the thing, billionaires are very powerful individuals, but they are POWERLESS compared to the few individuals and groups they serve. There are people who practically don&#039;t exist in any &quot;official&quot; capacity, yet have TRILLIONS in wealth.

It is this higher civilization which led humanity, and became its Shepard. This same group which was and is humanity&#039;s shepherd is still in power today, in both the underworld and overworld.

Probably, I&#039;ve got so many ideas to make changes, and make it the way it should be, so that anybody that can share their story can do it and get millions of views with ease, the exposure, and the watchers easily can find others producing the same content. No struggle to be watched or to find the content you want, because there&#039;s nothing more frustrating that knowing it exists but the algorithm won&#039;t show it to you, this week I finally reached the bottom of the main page, I even thought infinite scroll meant new recommendations would keep appearing. But, no, I got to the bottom and never good anything worth watching recommended, I had to search it for myself, and there it was, but there&#039;s no possibility of Discovery anymore.<br>And then, there it was, my answer, manifested by another anon. I just want to feel content with what I have, I have way more, a lot more than what I used to have when I was a kid, including money for any thing, loved ones that care about me, access to what feels like unlimited entertainment.

The west does not uphold these commandments, and beyond that, most all people engage in Canaanite rituals, despite the fact that the entire point of the Cult of Yahweh, and the entire point of the Bible, was to explicitly prohibit Canaanite rituals. <br><br>The basis of the Abrahamic faith is not some random willy-nilly bullshit, the entire basis of all of the commandments after the first handful from Exodus shared with the other Canaanite religions is that God explicitly prohibits 100% of the rituals of the Canaanites. The backbone of the Abrahamic faith is ritual purity, as opposed to the backbone of the Canaanite faith being ritual mixing.

Those who resent their god given masters and superiors are doomed to be caste down.", "time": 1671735394, "resto": 33665442}, {"no": 33665533, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:59:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33665442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665442</a><br><a href=\"#p33665444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665444</a><br><a href=\"#p33665458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665458</a><br><a href=\"#p33665466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665466</a><br><a href=\"#p33665466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665466</a><br><a href=\"#p33665500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665500</a><br><a href=\"#p33665515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665515</a><br>(You) all are psyop&#039;d idiots.", "time": 1671735572, "resto": 33665442}, {"no": 33665535, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33665515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33665515</a><br>no retard you\u2019re thinking of /pol/", "time": 1671735598, "resto": 33665442}, {"no": 33665546, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)14:01:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Until Kanye West openly identifies as a slave who wishes only to be ruled over by God, the true master and ruler of all men, he will only be an uppity nigger.

They are evil geniuses who want to take over the world and will do it by any means necessary.

I&#039;ve never owned any of his clothes and never will, they look like some shit you&#039;d find in the dirt on mars. The last cool thing he did was the Graduation album. After his mom died, he went on a downward spiral that pretty much ended with him losing his mind, his wife, kids, business deals, and a bunch of mental health problems. He tries to use shock value to stay relevant but for him, all it does is confirm that he&#039;s a washed up sellout. For most of us it started with his open support of Trump. After that I lost all respect for him an never took him serious again.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade.

If a forest was cut down to plant a farm and hundreds of animals lost their home, am I evil for buying vegetables in the store that came from that farm?</span><br><br>Your question is flawed. Most vegans like myself don&#039;t even necessarily think in such simplistic moralistic terms like &quot;evil&quot;. In my case, I was someone who was raised in an omnivore culture and socialised into eating animal flesh in various forms without questioning it, and I enjoyed it. Because of modern mass industrial agriculture I&#039;d never even seen an animal raised for slaughter. At some stage I made a mental, logical, emotional connection between eating this meat and the reality of the experience of animals who die for that food. Then I told myself that those animals probably lived pretty decent happy lives on farms and so on until a sudden and pretty painless death. At some stage, though, I looked into it and found that this isn&#039;t true - it&#039;s much more awful than any of that. It&#039;s simple empathy. I don&#039;t want others hurting or enslaving me. I wouldn&#039;t like someone firing a bolt-pistol into my brains, and my flesh being used for someone elses pleasure. Most of us are aware that humans transitioning to a different diet would involve lots of changes, and that there are moral issues including issue relating to the suffering of animals displaced by farming or insects killed in the production of food, etc. What we&#039;re doing is the most simple first step possible - we&#039;re saying &quot;I won&#039;t eat any of this&quot;, sometimes we do this as I originally did, thinking that others would follow and that I&#039;d send &#039;signals&#039; through consumer culture so that the world would change - and this definitely did happen to some degree, many of us just want like the idea of participating in it, even if we feel things won&#039;t change. Many anti-vegan posters think they have a &#039;gotcha&#039; moment with these questions, as if we aren&#039;t aware of them.", "time": 1671960005, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684019, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684004</a><br>Continuing...<br><br>The vegan diet still impacts animals, there is no debating this, it impacts in many many ways. Even when vegan food items are shipped anywhere, animals end up being killed as roadkill by those delivery trucks. Animals are affected constantly, in every little way. But the simplest point is that if anything is going to change, stopping killing highly complex animals like cows, pigs, and so on - who are clearly capable of not just sentience but high levels of intelligence, emotion, affection, fear, etc. I personally try to avoid killing insects but I would consider it a significantly worse thing to willfully kill a pig than even maybe many insects. This involves judgement and knowledge about what sentient and experience is, and all sorts of factors we can&#039;t claim to definitively know, but for the same reason most people wouldn&#039;t want to kidnap a human child and kill them, we don&#039;t want cows or pigs or chickens being treated so brutally or killed for their flesh, especially when it&#039;s not necessary.", "time": 1671960327, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684027, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684019</a><br>The issue is mostly RELATIVE HARM. Humans have to survive, and we impact the environment and other animals. Is it so unreasonable to say that we should try to MINIMISE this harm and suffering? That&#039;s what vegans are doing. No matter what you argue - producing food for a vegan diet would never have to impact as many lives, and especially wouldn&#039;t have to affect highly complex animals capable of greater levels of suffering. Also most of these anti-vegan arguments like &quot;Oh rats and small animals are killed by harvesters producing plants for vegans!&quot; are just petty, fake attempts to spin the argument - vegans want to minimise harm, generally farmers kill animals in those ways because they were raised in this omnivore culture that thinks it&#039;s justifiable to do so to produce food for humans. If vegans had their way - all vegan food would also be produced in ways that animals aren&#039;t killed in the process. This is entirely POSSIBLE, it would just take more effort, and would &#039;cost&#039; more to the end consumer.

The simple reality is that the present system is incredibly brutal, but mostly concealed from the publics eyes. Sometimes the most innocent beings imaginable - like beautiful little calves or piglets, are torn from the security of their mothers and siblings, put in a terrifying situation like transported on a very noisy, shaking truck, and then killed without sympathy. It&#039;s also a statistical inevitability that even if you assume all parties involved are doing their utmost to make it painless (which they aren&#039;t), that many animals aren&#039;t killed instantly the way they&#039;re supposed to, and instead suffer significant head trauma and injuries, in other cases things are much worse - like chickens routinely being improperly beheaded, and then boiled alive. All of this takes place merely so that others can enjoy the pleasure of eating this flesh, and we know that it&#039;s not necessary - that we can get all of our nutritional needs without any of this. We can even eat very WELL without this. So the question is, do you want to participate in this? Can you use your imagination and put yourself in the place of these animals?

He could see it the whole time from where he sat. So he gets up and walks outside, confused.<br>He said between the time he saw the headlights and then walked around the front desk to the front door the parking lot was completely dark again. No lighyd. No cars. He said he got hit by a wave of goosebumps. Was almost afraid to move lol. Just stayed there with his head sticking out the door for a sec, watching the traffic on the freeway.

First off, we live in a world where there is television you know. And on these televisions there are ghost shows and we also have internet. So if you fucking kikes have so many goddamn questions about ghosts, and negative entities and what happens when you die, has it ever crossed your dull ass mind that if you turned the goddamn tv on an put it on one of those shows or looked at mediums an psychics on youtube or something you know, who actually do this shit, maybe you&#039;d find all the answers to these questions but since you&#039;re ignorant and can&#039;t do something as simple as turn the fucking tv on I&#039;ll break it down to you, for the 30th time. We live in a DUAL world meaning there is Positive and Negative. Everything falls under one of those two categories from emotions, to actions, to things we say, do, think. When a person dies, if they don&#039;t go into the light portal out of this plane, they become a ghost an get left on this DUAL plane of existence. Since they are still in this DUAL dimension, they still have to follow the rules of DUALITY. So the negative, earthly emotions that only exist here becomes like a food source that makes them more physical, alive. Like Chucky when he started to become more human the longer he stayed as a doll, well that&#039;s what happens when ghosts feed off negativity, fear, evil, it makes them more alive again, it makes them feel more physical and human because they are dead, they aren&#039;t physical beings anymore so they feel they need this. So when a ghost is in your house an you see a big monster, its really a helpless old lady, but she&#039;s making projections to make you emit fear so she can feed off of it.", "time": 1671912807, "resto": 33680136}, {"no": 33680384, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)15:14:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33680256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33680256</a><br>Some entities feed on attention.

The first instance was one of them landing on my left nipple. The fly wouldn&#039;t react to me moving and taking a photo of it which seemed weird because usually they fly away once I start moving in the slightest. This happened in a bath<br>Next time was me pouring out coffee in the bath and noticing a fly in it. I saved it and it wouldn&#039;t go away. It remained on my ring finger (right one. People in my country wear it on the right side) when I was thinking about my ex. When I asked it what to do, the fly would start rubbing it&#039;s two hands(?) in sort of a praying motion (when dogs bark like mad at me, I always ask where should I go and they point in a direction most of the time).<br>After this the flies would bombard me until I came to a realisation that I can&#039;t be thinking on the Swedish girl I met recently...then all flies stopped flying and relaxed. Later on I messaged my ex that I am burning the last of her stuff and that I have no idea if I am contributing to the world in a right way...she usually ignores my texts but this time she asked why the fuck am I burning it and sent a picture of an angel number 111 (the line ticket number in a post office) asking whether I have sent her a package (I did two months ago...I am quite doubtful that it two months for it to be delivered 800m).<br>Now again...upon thinking that I don&#039;t need her in my life and that she makes me mad every time she texts me, again...a fly lands on me and doesn&#039;t react to me taking it on my finger and does the praying motion again<br>What could it mean?

I don&#039;t think they ever had me drink anything but I also have trouble remembering. The speech therapy room was weird and mostly empty with no windows for sure, I remember it being strange but at the age didn&#039;t think much of it. What I remember of TAG however was more for group projects and presentations. They had us do a play about slavery. In the play I was a robot from the future that came back to tell the slave owners that slavery is wrong. It was stupid and I distinctly remember it being stupid, none of us kids were really into it but we played our parts anyway. I&#039;m a very empathetic person with genuine empath abilities (honestly I kinda hate them sometimes) that noticeably manifested themselves in my late 20s, though I think they&#039;ve been there since I was born. Emotions have always affected me physically to some degree. When I was really little and something would hurt my feelings it would become an indescribable discomfort in my throat. Late teens and early 20s were extreme drug and alcohol abuse. I ended up hooked on opiates for a few years. I broke free from that though, cold turkey with literally no outside support. Hard but not impossible.<br>Anyway, I bring up that TAG was for group projects, but this was a little later in elementary school, like 4th grade. I know for sure there was one on one time between me and the instructors but I 100% can&#039;t remember any of it. Closest I remember is walking down to the area where they did TAG stuff. I recall the TAG stuff wasn&#039;t in the windowless room, they used the library instead. But I can&#039;t remember a single fucking thing we did during TAG in those early years.

Be focused only on this, still have full intent. Now comes crucial part. Imagine what men(women) that girl(boy) likes. Again to the same very detailed image.

They were taught how to engage the outsider for several crucial minutes. If that ploy failed then they would alert the next perimeter where logs would then be positioned to block the roadway. Of the three-man security team, one would be responsible for alerting members while the other two executed delaying tactics if required. This security procedure was repeated at both the three mile and one mile perimeters, meaning members had to pass through a total of three checkpoints before arriving at the meeting. Often, on private property, indoor meetings or trainings would occur on large multi-acred estates appointed with securely fenced perimeters. The site would be located in a downstairs basement which could be closed-off from the rest of the house by a false wall. These estates usually had at least one private roadway at the rear and the customary security perimeters in place. As you may by now appreciate, it would be extremely difficult to \u2018crash a meeting\u2019 considering the security measures utilized by the group. Given that an outsider was able to discover the time and date of a meeting, he would then have to travel in a vehicle with approved plates.

Thus began the most incredible cover-up in recent European history. It was like WACO, Guyana. The British Army ordered those in the Castle to come out. They then sent a tank in to bulldoze the walls. Prince Philip and Prince William were in that Castle. Both of them had murdered countless tiny children in their rites. The British Army assembled watched as both walked out with large, dark, woven potato sacks over their heads. They were then bundled into a van and driven away.", "time": 1671931734, "resto": 33672963}, {"no": 33682060, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:29:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33682053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33682053</a><br>The British Army present at the time - may or may not have had any idea who they were but the SIS general there, certainly did.

Mons, the village just above Cagnes-Sur-Mer in Provence. Richard Tomlinson used to live in Cagnes-Sur-Mer and his friends used to joke that he was now a &#039;James Cagney&#039; rather than a James Bond. He was British Intelligence&#039;s &#039;ferryman&#039; who used to bring the kidnapped children in for their Illuminati rites. Rimington devised games along MKULTRA lines e.g. the assorted children at the Templar Castle were given the most evil-minded torture games to play, imaginable. Many were murdered in front of the other children to set an example: you must never ever talk about this cult or what we do or you will be murdered in a similar way. The parents who brought their own children with them (Richard and Judy were present) were terrorised into obedience. They had no choice.", "time": 1671931795, "resto": 33672963}, {"no": 33682068, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:30:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33682060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33682060</a><br>The McCanns were also present.

You have to, judging by the placements for the event under consideration, isolate the particular matters you are concerned about from both the chart and the real life situation, and then apprehend the particular manifestation of that matter in this instance and identify the features unique to it. You must both draw a commonality between this instance and other instances of the exact same placement, as well as rationally distinguish this kind of situation from other placements concerning the same sort of matter.<br><br>In the distant past long before astrology was &quot;settled&quot;, the planets presumably had no names, or at the very least not descriptive ones that denoted any symbolism to use. They looked up at the cosmos and charted what they saw without any inkling of what it meant. At some point, some people noticed that certain things happened when certain cosmological objects were in particular spots in space. They investigated the link between human psychology and cosmological placements and eventually were able to associate aspects of human behavior with influences astrological bodies were apparently exerting.<br><br>They deduced that the body known as Mercury seemed to be affecting the particular ways people rationally think and communicate; and looking at the zodiac signs, the influence seemed to come out most emblematically in Gemini, who are known for thinking and speaking miles ahead of everyone else, and who seem to find their life&#039;s fulfillment in these activities.<br><br>The system established early on that every astrological body around Earth must have an influence upon the beings upon it.

The exaltation is a placement where the planet is wielded by someone who has been trained and ordained to wield it most *effectively*, which specifically means not using it any old which way that it might lend itself to: the notion that just because something can do a thing doesn&#039;t mean it should do a thing.<br><br>See this example: Mars is full well capable of the nuclear option, so to speak, and Aries will find itself inclined to hit the button regularly. But Capricorn understands you ought not use nukes willy nilly and have to use them strategically, if at all. It has been disciplined in the art of Mars such that it can utilize the tools in its box for maximun effectiveness in its mission, and let alone the tools also in there that aren&#039;t optimal.<br><br><a href=\"#p33667846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33667846</a><br>most welcome", "time": 1671761518, "resto": 33663606}, {"no": 33668767, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:14:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33668749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33668749</a><br>*maximum effectiveness", "time": 1671761651, "resto": 33663606}, {"no": 33668774, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:14:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If anyone here can tell me anything about my chart I would appreciate it.

A videogame where the core gameplay loop involves no form of violence is considered a novelty.

His spirit spreads out (through Astral projection) and heals people (the lingua frenulum) which actually secures their death. I know that he destroyed the lives of the people who wrote it cause he got tired of everyone&#039;s bullshit (the exact same people btw) over all his incarnations. Basically Jesus got betrayed so much that he learned how to pull the reverse card on everyone&#039;s reality as many times as he wanted. They wrote the gospels to teach people morals but what they didn&#039;t know yet was they were writing about him through Astral projection and he wouldn&#039;t be alive for about 2000 more years. He is literally alive today, and he can literally die and come back to life as many times as he wants. The problem is that he came to fuck shit up for the people that kept betraying him, so his real story is kinda fucked up and not at all Sunday school friendly and so it&#039;ll be the greatest story never told.

had contacts, we could travel inside the park in our own car instead of cars/vans supplied by the park</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the beginning of our trip, we were told to keep clear of core areas by the forest ranger because it could pose danger to us</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A few hours into the trip, we were out in the savanna just watching animals do their

us, so we were really in a pickle</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We wanted to turn and go back, but David insisted we continue and assured us we&#039;d be fine</span><br><span

at him asking him to run because we have a tiger situation</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The tiger turns back and spots him</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Right then and there we knew he&#039;d be torn to pieces, but that didn&#039;t happen</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The tiger instead ran away</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We all were bewildered seeing all this

is a forest ranger, and he said no</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then he tells us that private vehicles are not allowed inside the park</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;David gets pissed off

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

Kropotkin took the same evolutionary mythology that social darwinists like Redbeard and Spencer were working with but used it to argue that nature shows us the value of increasingly complex forms of cooperation and mutual aid. All of those people and traditions knew/know that animals eat each other and that nature can be cruel. The difference is that they didn&#039;t mistake that cruelty for the point or revel in it or try to apply it to human society. This amoral, might makes right view of nature is absolutely not self-evident, you&#039;ve just heard it repeated so often that you believe it.", "time": 1671942956, "resto": 33674147}, {"no": 33682971, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)00:00:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33674147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33674147</a><br>There&#039;s a few good shorts (the one with the biker and the one with the SAS team come to mind) but otherwise it&#039;s edgelord trash", "time": 1671944411, "resto": 33674147}, {"no": 33683465, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)01:41:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33676561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33676561</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its not bad</span><br>It really is though.

I got over mine by getting so sick of it that eventually when it triggered, it didn&#039;t make me anxious, it just enraged me.

I exposed myself and she lightly tapped the radiator to signify approval, I then masturbated and felt her warm over me.<br>When I came for the first few seconds it looked like no sperm was coming out, then a little dribble of it came out. I usually cum buckets, so I realised that she had taken most of it for herself. She then left me in peace to sleep.<br>I\u2019m genuinely not larping, and am worried that I\u2019m inviting evil into my life. A pope admitted consorting with a succubus and receiving her help.
