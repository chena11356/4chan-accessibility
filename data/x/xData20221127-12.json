I feel great but I have to ask some questions tho. Most days I take 2g NAC, 1scoop with breakfast and 1 with dinner. Its more than recommended but I noticed that 2gram is the sweet spot for me. I can eat yeast sugar whatever and my mouth still feels clean througout the whole day. Ofcourse I try to avoid these foods but I love sharing foods with others. The niacin I take up to 3g per day. Especially if I ate sugar. I try to use it like a timed bomb to fuck with the fungus. The oregano oil I still use together with food, so any fungus has a harder time stealing my nutrients. I forget the the BSO most of the time but I put it on my face and on my dick and balls every night. My dick hangs cozy and warm since ive been doing this. Feels good man. <br>Now my question is, do I take to much of anything? I dont want to fuck shit up in the long term. Other than that the protocol is great, it helped me with alot of stuff.

It tells us that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah, and that a Scythian king named F\u00e9nius Farsaid (descendant of Noah&#039;s son Japheth) is the forebear of the Gaels. F\u00e9nius, a prince of Scythia, is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. His son Nel weds Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, and they have a son named Go\u00eddel Glas. Go\u00eddel crafts the Goidelic (Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. Go\u00eddel&#039;s offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt at the same time as the Israelites (the Exodus) and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years wandering the Earth, undergoing a series of trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites, who spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. Eventually, they reach Hispania by sea and conquer it. There, Go\u00eddel&#039;s descendant Breog\u00e1n founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son \u00cdth glimpses Ireland.[4] Brigantia refers to Corunna (then known as Brigantium) in modern-day Galicia in Spain,[5] and Breog\u00e1n&#039;s tower is likely to have been based on the Tower of Hercules, which was built at Corunna by the Romans.</span><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles<wbr>ians_%28Irish%29", "time": 1669562462, "resto": 33460225}, {"no": 33470607, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)10:36:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33470466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33470466</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;which led to a degenerate, self absorbed civilisation to emerge.

Albert Pike is a metonymic historical figure, a part of the whole that ties into a multitude of anonymous or semi-anonymous individuals organized into various clubs and schools of thought. Therefore, the real question is whether American Freemasonry founded the KKK. This question may seem absurd to many of our contemporaries, who, in stereotyping Masonic values as cosmopolitan, anti-racist, anti-nationalist, pro-NWO, etc., deem them opposite to the values expounded by the KKK. Theoretically, the KKK supports ethnic nationalism, or rooting one\u2019s identity in a land and race, whereas Freemasonry defends multiculturalism and the mixing of different national identities at the supranational level; but in reality, American Freemasonry is \u2013 like Janus \u2013 two-faced, contradictory, and certainly capable of closing in on populations and crushing them all at once from both the left and right, with a pair of pliers</span>", "filename": "1665283779225732", "ext": ".png", "w": 1114, "h": 614, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 68, "tim": 1669569847052890, "time": 1669569847, "md5": "fRRR6/l1o2OjmXpDshpmBw==", "fsize": 85523, "resto": 33471074}, {"no": 33471213, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:25:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Founding the Klan: 1865-1871</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the American Civil War, the Confederacy was a nest of Freemasons.

Indeed, the most widespread Masonic rite in the world, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, was launched in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1801. Exactly 60 years later, again in Charleston, the civil war started. Southerners created the KKK just after the war, in December 1865, as an extension of the Confederation, and it proved to be a landmark for Freemasons, too. As a result, Albert Pike is often credited for founding the KKK, which, in reality, he did not. That said, Pike maintained an unquestionable intellectual closeness to the KKK, as is evident from the words he published in 1868, in his own newspaper, The Memphis Daily Appeal, of which he was the editor:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If it were in our power, if it could be effected, we would unite every white man in the South, who is opposed to Negro suffrage, into one great Order of Southern Brotherhood, with an organization complete, active, vigorous, in which a few should execute the concentrated will of all, and whose very existence should be concealed from all but its members.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1455695473114", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 340, "h": 446, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1669569911281657, "time": 1669569911, "md5": "6Ngb77D2Z7wZCl6dipoaUA==", "fsize": 70944, "resto": 33471074}, {"no": 33471222, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:26:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pike\u2019s esotericism, coupled with his racial segregation approach, is in every respect consistent with the KKK\u2019s line of thought.

To find out, let us turn to the relationship between white supremacism and Jewish supremacism, especially during the period when the latter started to take on the characteristics of Jewish freemasonry (i.e., of the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith). One individual is at the crossroads of all these occult networks: Judah Philip Benjamin (1811-1884).

When you enter the light of the NDE world, you will have one exploding epiphany after another. So you will have beyond-enlightenment instantly when you die.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams.

So we don&#039;t really exist. The soul is purely immaterial, and so is thought, our souls and our words are made of the same substance. Therefore, with practice, we can alter the very souls of anyone we chose, including ourselves. If we form our thoughts to be strong, and easily digestible we can sway the masses to do anything, but people have already known this. They&#039;ve already been doing this, but we can fight back. Those in power constantly use this ability of memetic manipulation I&#039;ve spoken of, yet they convince us it isn&#039;t real and that we do not have the ability to do the same things they do, but we do.
