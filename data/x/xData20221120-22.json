Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers. Same for vague queries.<br>\u2022Making an AQ (air query) by not addressing a reader, in particular, is possible but doesn&#039;t guarantee an answer.<br>\u2022Avoid making the same query repeatedly and/or to different readers in a short period of time, as this may lead to more confusion.<br>\u2022Provide feedback when applicable and be considerate to the reader. We&#039;re a growing community, many readers are starting and need to know what they are doing right or wrong.

These destinies are all located within the three realms of existence (traidh\u0101tuka), which comprises the entirety of our universe (see also avacara; lokadh\u0101tu). ...By contrast, the human destiny is thought to be ideally suited for religious training, because it is the only bourne where both suffering and happiness can be readily experienced, allowing the adept to recognize more easily the true character of life as impermanent (anitya), suffering (duh\u0323kha), and nonself (an\u0101tman). Sam\u0323s\u0101ra is said to have no beginning and to come to end only for those individuals who achieve liberation from rebirth through the practice of the path (m\u0101rga) to nirv\u0101n\u0323a. Sam\u0323s\u0101ra is depicted iconographically as a \u201cwheel of existence\u201d (bhavacakra), which shows the six rebirth destinies, surrounding a pig, a rooster, and a snake, which symbolize ignorance (avidy\u0101), desire (lobha), and hatred (dves\u0323a), respectively. Around the edge of the wheel are scenes representing the twelve links of dependent origination (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da). The relation between sam\u0323s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101n\u0323a is discussed at length in Buddhist texts, with N\u0101g\u0101rjuna famously declaring that there is not the slightest difference between them, because the true nature of both is emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101).", "filename": "OIP", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 732, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668997570644015, "time": 1668997570, "md5": "N2V6Px3hYH2fJoXH44Sduw==", "fsize": 43026, "resto": 33417937}, {"no": 33418092, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)21:28:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33417937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33417937</a><br>Void is not the goal at least in Buddhism. Emptiness is a quality. There is a formless realm you can end up if you get lost in the expanse of the human mind though. It is called \u0101r\u016bpyadh\u0101tu. Here is an entry on it.<br><br>In Sanskrit, \u201cimmaterial\u201d or \u201cformless\u201d \u201crealm\u201d; the highest of the three realms of existence (traidh\u0101tuka) within sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, along with the sensuous realm (k\u0101madh\u0101tu) and the realm of subtle materiality (r\u016bpadh\u0101tu). The heavens of the immaterial realm are comprised of four classes of divinities (deva) whose existence is entirely mental, no longer requiring even a subtle material foundation for their ethereal states of mind: (1) the sphere of infinite space (\u0101k\u0101\u015b\u0101nanty\u0101yatana); (2) the sphere of infinite consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nanty\u0101yatana); (3) the sphere of nothing whatsoever or absolute nothingness (\u0101ki\u00f1cany\u0101yatana); (4) the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception (naivasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101yatana, see also bhav\u0101gra). Rebirth in these different spheres is based on mastery of the corresponding four immaterial meditative absorptions (\u0101r\u016bpy\u0101vacaradhy\u0101na) in previous lives. Because they have transcended all materiality, the beings here retain only the subtlest form of the last four aggregates (skandha). For a detailed description, see deva.

There was no single great global flood, but millennia worth of local deluges that entered ancestral memory as &quot;The Flood&quot;.<br>Generations passed, and humans settled the banks of the Euphrates River. One group of humans emerged onto a marshy plain consisting of fertile land like nothing any living person had ever experienced. There, they founded a civilization, which they dedicated to the Divine Principle - the Union of the Numen of the Storehouse with the Numen of Wild Nature. It represented a perfect contradiction, a synthesis which blessed human endeavour and caused abundance to multiply.<br>They called this civilization ki-en-gir, but we call it Sumer.<br>They were warned to keep the good order of the Universe, but some among their number were given over to greed, their sights set on conquest and humiliation. They overturned the balance of the Divine Principle and set out to fold the myriad divine facets (par\u0161\u016b) into one.<br>By about 3000 years ago, this universal, atemporal, immanent Divine manifested in Assyria, under the name A\u0161\u0161ur. The god was the nation, the nation was the god. It ripped the heart from the people, its iconography empty and invisible, constituting a death cult which would not be satisfied until it forced the whole world into submission to A\u0161\u0161ur.<br>The Assyrian death cult conquered the little nation of Israel. Israel, like its neighbours, had its own little henotheistic national cult, and set to wondering how such a thing was possible, if their god was truly all-powerful.<br>&quot;Aha,&quot; they thought. &quot;Assyria is nothing more than the rod of Yahweh&#039;s wrath, sent to purge Israel of its evil.&quot;<br>And so, they made prophecies of Assyria&#039;s fall.<br>Any idiot could do that, of course.<br><br>&quot;Where is the kingdom that lasts forever?

The priests sold to the people a narrative that they were not, in fact, the sons of Canaan that they truly were, but that ages ago, they had been marched to Egypt while some usurpers took their land.<br>This is an untruth. There never was an Exodus.<br>Nonetheless, it did the trick, and the Israelites set off on a spree of cultural vandalism and destruction in an attempt to wipe out any traces of their past.<br>(Has anyone had any experience with their descendants and their attempts to blot out history? How odd.)<br>And so it came to pass that Rome, like so many others before it, conquered the Levant. The Jews rose in rebellion and were defeated. In this tumult appeared a great many self-anointed &quot;Messiahs&quot; - the warrior leader who the Israelites believed would deliver them from Rome. One such &quot;Messiah&quot;, one Yeshua ben Yosef, was just as convinced as his fellow-travellers of the need to conquer the world for Yahweh, but the Romans executed him for sedition.<br>After his death, his followers gathered in a meeting-house. Wine and words flowed freely.<br>&quot;He was seen!&quot; boasted one. &quot;By five hundred witnesses!&quot;<br>Rumours do spread easily in such conditions.<br>Full of zeal, his followers dispersed amongst the Roman Empire - the world&#039;s first missionary faith.<br>They encountered Hellenistic Platonism, fused it with Hebrew thought, and now here we are - spiritually alienated, cut off from that Divine Numen.<br><br>The moral of the story?<br><br>Hebraic faiths.

At least in my long history as porn viewer since fifth grade 2005, it seems more of a thing.<br><br>On the other hand, I wonder if this is just the natural progression that technology has taken us.
