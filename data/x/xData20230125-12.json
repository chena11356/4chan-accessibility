If a feminine planet is located in a masculine sign, it may feel pressured and rushed to act before it is ready, thus becoming a source of tension or fear.

The Venus links can mean that you convert to some religion because of an illness (this is just a hypothetical example), and since Venus is also the ruler of the house of friendship, it means that when you convert, you may go to your place of worship (say, church) and make lots of friends at church.

This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there.

When i looked online for detox information a few weeks later, I found out that apparently when you detox, these bacteria or whatever is being removed will create endotoxins that shut off bile production and then release the toxins into the bloodstream and it produces all the symptoms I was experiencing. Apparently you can use bile salts prior to doing a detox to prevent these symptoms as the bile salts keep the production of bile flowing to remove the toxins. Would this work to prevent the die off symptoms you are all experiencing?? Just a thought I had anyway. <br><br>Sorry for the long text.

Afterwards, I spent an hour noting things down in my dream journal.<br><br>As I noted it down, I realised the &quot;ancestor spirit&quot; I remember from past incarnations, was me. There was no relative who joined me back then. In that past life was burned, became a vengeful spirit, was taught several things by Lilith, and ran away, as I didn&#039;t want to become so happy I&#039;d forget my grudges. When I was 13 this life, my fear of sexual inadequacy, as I felt confused in my gender and sexual role, attracted a parasite. This parasite compartmentalised things I admired or feared about myself, and used it to project illusions in nightmares that amplified my insecurities, while using my own latent abilities against me to manipulate me into becoming dependent on it. It acted up after being destabilised by the extreme catharsis I felt after my surgery 3 months ago. When I confronted my &#039;mirror image&#039; with love 10 days ago, the parasite was destroyed, and its image disappeared; now I can see myself as I am.<br><br>Perhaps one could say the inner turmoil I went through the past two months was a story about anima and shadow integration, hampered by a parasite that lingered from my adolescence. Lilith helped me see through it by healing my self-esteem, and chant anon by calling out the parasite&#039;s manipulation.<br><br>As for the dream I had during my nap: in the dream I talked with my fianc\u00e9, and he encouraged me to continue my research in my dreams, as it&#039;s clearly important to me even if it&#039;s obscure.

I joked that I&#039;m hibernating since it&#039;s winter. A woman with short purple hair and black wings appeared and commented on my rambling. I recognised her appearance from a dream I had 2 weeks ago. After some small talk, she explained in detail how my fears and insecurities as a young teenager attracted parasites, but now that I&#039;ve recently overcome that, she can approach me without confusion. It stood out to me that she spoke in full, clear sentences despite the complexity of the topic, and her answers rang true regarding several questions that had been on my mind lately. As she was talking, I thought I should note it down in my dream journal as soon as I woke up, indicating that keeping one has improved my awareness in dreams. <br><br>I got the impression she was there to teach me, and asked if she&#039;s a succubus, which she confirmed. I complained about my fatigue, then started thinking I want some of her energy, but remained quiet as I thought it was a selfish thing to ask. I realised I&#039;d been staring at her the whole time as I was thinking. She chuckled, and said she gets if gaining energy using tantra often felt like some sort of &#039;bounty hunt&#039; due to how the parasite had affected me, but that it doesn&#039;t have to be that way: sex can be positive and energising for both people involved, regardless of the details. This sparked my curiosity, and I asked her to touch me a bit, hoping it&#039;d energise me; but I was too sleepy to react much, and worried if I was being selfish by just lying there. I asked for permission to give head, and she got on her back. I closed my eyes and saw the energy currents in her body, then I wrapped my arms around her thighs as I planted my face in-between. I liked how warm she felt. I kept my eyes closed, and used the tip of my tongue to massage the energy currents.

I voiced my concern, and we repositioned to a 69 position. I felt her abdomen against my breasts and vice versa, her shoulders against the back of my thighs and calves, and her hand holding my left knee as I massaged her left thigh with my left hand. I tried to finger her with my other hand, but it was difficult to tell where the entrance was just from looking at the energy currents, so I rubbed her labia minora instead while focusing on her clit with my tongue. Among other things, I felt her finger circling my clit and her tongue moving inside me, but it wasn&#039;t so deep that I&#039;d consider it penetration, which I appreciated as I&#039;d have considered that as disloyalty to my partner. Notably, I felt everything physically, instead of just the energy.<br><br>I felt a heat gradually building up within both of us, then woke up feeling energised several minutes later, and her presence quickly faded.<br>Although I didn&#039;t cum, I noticed an unidentified, slightly sticky mystery fluid between my legs. It&#039;s not usually that much, even when I&#039;m aroused; could there be a deeper meaning to it? I&#039;m intrigued, and want to investigate more about the potential effects of energy on bodily secretions.<br><br>As I reflected later on her words, I realised I&#039;ve been conflating tantra with vampirism. I recently discovered that &quot;draining&quot; my partner&#039;s energy during sex can actually lift him up if I take good care of myself afterwards; and if I think back to the times others were negatively affected by me draining them, it was the case if I was at odds with them, or if I was in a bad place mentally myself and trying to use the other person as a crutch. It&#039;s all natural consequences of reconciling differences in the process of merging (in the tantric sense).<br><br>Anyway, I was wondering: is there a way to discern whether miss Succubus was just a character in my dream, or an actual entity?", "time": 1674609405, "resto": 33920584, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33923338, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:20:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I honestly had no idea there&#039;d be a blog post before this.

This may take some time but persist. Next, imagine having a conversation directly with your subconscious. Ask it questions and let the answers from your flow out of your mind. Give it some sort of form, let it arise naturally if you want. For example, I imagine mine as a female/feminine entity since the subconscious is seen as the feminine part of one\u2019s being in esoteric literature and whatnot. The conversation doesn\u2019t have to be in language, you can communicate through feeling, images, whatever. The choice is yours and should be based around what feels comfortable to you.<br><br>See this form of your subconscious not only as a very close friend but also like the other you that is directing the workings of your observable reality in the background. Feel the power that a being with such an ability would have, then realize that this power is yours as well, since your subconscious is a part of you that makes up your totality. <br><br>Doing this will help you trust not only in the process and perception of time delay with manifestations (you can ask question about manifestation status), but it\u2019ll also help you to trust yourself, conscious, subconscious and all other parts. Realize the power and divinity that you have. Give yourself the ability to do so. I hope you see what I\u2019m getting at and that this makes sense. The imagination is a very powerful thing. <br><br>this can help boost confidence in other areas of life, since when you begin to see the experiences you have in imagination as real, the perceived struggles of the world pale in comparison to the you in your imagination that has experienced what other worlds have to offer. <br><br>Don\u2019t give yourself psychosis btw, there is a method to the madness as so to speak.", "filename": "C5C91033-B86C-4DFB-BB71-CEC7FBFF4E46", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 485, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1674611381416685, "time": 1674611381, "md5": "iehHqsr7nxZR3VsT8bGSpg==", "fsize": 23708, "resto": 33917655}, {"no": 33923550, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:50:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33922708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33922708</a><br><a href=\"#p33923518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33923518</a><br>don&#039;t reply to him, he&#039;s a retard who shitted up the thread a couple of threads back.", "time": 1674611420, "resto": 33917655}, {"no": 33923590, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:56:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33922934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33922934</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t have free range chickens </span><br>Lol <br>Lmao <br><br>Also, fuck you for insinuating they&#039;re treated improperly.

If the air does not cling to the bottom of the chamber, then it certainly would not cling to the bottom of flat Earth. If the air does not leave any part of the chamber still in vacuum, then it certainly would not leave any part of flat Earth in vacuum. And if the air creates equal pressure at all points in the chamber, then certainly the air creates equal pressure at all points in the flat Earth dome.<br><br>Yet there is no denying that air thins as you climb in altitude.

With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

My gut tells me that humans are not capable of civilization without some form of restraining force. Vampires fill that niche perfectly. They must have humans to survive, but due to their nature cannot dominate us completely (knowingly) without us revolting. So they are forced to shepherd us from the shadows, providing corrections to humanity&#039;s progress without us ever being aware. I&#039;ve known a number of the offspring of the elite in this country. Had the amazing opportunity to go to school with them and learn about the strategies these groups use to catapult themselves through the ages. I suspect there are forces in control of their actions that they are not entirely all aware of. I think some of them are aware of who their true masters are, but I think the vast majority of them are unaware of the complexity that pulls the string. They all, in certain moments, will recount stories that suggest their families are recipients or vessels of some divine power. This is really code though... a way of rationalizing what they are really seeing. Their parents, usually a father figure in control of the finances, doing things that seem... out of character.

During the ride along we got a call for an altered level of consciousness cancer patient. We got in after the medics, she looked sick, had no hair, pale etc, and she was fighting the NPA they were putting in as we walked through the door. The family was explaining that she had a DNR they couldnt find but without the document, it didnt matter. The odor of the house was very distinct, sort of like shit, but not exactly. Cancer smell. So we packed her up. At first I thought she was mad at me as I was trying to take her vitals but at some point I realized my presence there, as some meek and useless observer, taunted her. There I was, young, fit, in my white collared shirt, life ahead of me to do whatever I wanted, and here she was, getting ventilated despite having a DNR. We weren&#039;t even letting her die the way she wanted. She just locked eyes with me, with her big dilated pupils and dark brown eyes. Staring staring staring like black holes. I stared back into them for a while, just watching. I felt like there was some anger there, but there was an emptiness to her eyes as well, like looking into space. <br><br>I got a blood pressure of maybe 60 something over nothing, she had a pulse only in her carotid from what I could tell. The guys told me to stick around at the hospital so maybe I could do CPR on her and &quot;get to feel the bones crunch&quot; but she just laid there in the bed staring at me from 25 feet away. Her eyes boring holes into me from far across the room. Just fixated on me and me alone. <br><br>I mention this because after watching Hereditary I remembered the event very vividly, specifically the womans eyes. For an hour or so immediately after the film, I was somewhat disturbed. <br><br>I believe I went and had a beer and a cheeseburger and felt much better immediately, but yes, I distinctly remember this film bringing back a traumatic experience from my past to the forefront of my attention.

I was still towards the innocent side, but had my dark side to show me what darkness and suffering are. I was an intellectual, like Hesse. I put a lot of effort into God, had my spiritual experiences, so the foundation become firmly rooted that God exists and He&#039;s the proper choice (Like the Buddha and his absolute goodness). <br><br>But I had to fall to know what the demons and evil represent. That started 12 years alter. During this time I wanted to say fuck it to God, and just live my life as an ego without spirituality. But it didn&#039;t work, once you know too much you&#039;re totally dependent on God and practice. We&#039;ll just use the example of praying for hours even though that&#039;s not what I did. I used a different technique for 20 years. I had to do this technique because I didn&#039;t feel well if I didn&#039;t, so daily I was called. <br><br>Long story short, the demons betrayed me. I didn&#039;t get what they promised me, to be this Goth type figure that still practices spirituality and shares an alternative path that&#039;s cooler than normal -spirituality but with edge. A good demon with profound insights! No, you have to be totally ignorant on spiritual matters to be that type of ego. If you know too much about God and the ego, it doesn&#039;t work out since God destroys the ego gradually. You have to be in a state of Atheism to have the ego rule your life, or it feels threatened and doesn&#039;t obey/help/align with you. Instead You fall, but without the gibs, then you have to return to God and continue what you started. I dissolved even my intellectual side, that had to go like everything else on the path to God.

I mean, it&#039;s common knowledge that we&#039;re made of around 80% water, and emerging knowledge most fungus and parasites do thrive in an acidic environment (see Dr. Simoncini&#039;s work &quot;Cancer is a fungus&quot;), yet there&#039;s little to no discussion on this thread about alkaline water, and it&#039;s even stronger evolution into &quot;kangen water&quot;. The latter is simply a hydrogen rich type of water, with very low ORP values, which means it has an anti-oxidative and rejuvenating effect on our body. Curiously enough, this type of water was popularized by non-other than Hiromi Shinya, an absolute pioneer of colonoscopy and related techs to remove intestinal parasites https://youtu.be/VcOz4WxH9iI?t=10 <br>The man himself performed somewhere around 400.000 colonoscopies and God knows how many demons pulled out of people&#039;s buttholes during his lifetime, so I feel he kinda deserves a place of honor in this thread as a side note.<br><br>Another unsung hero in the de-parasite&#039;s battle imho, is Dr. Robert Cassar, who devoted his last 35 years literally removing parasites from people all around the world. In the case for water, he advocates for pure (homemade) distilled water as a powerful detoxing and lymphatic cleansing agent.

They have a natural negative chthonic field which can allow others to dowse them. They have sharp pointed incisor teeth which is distinct from most other individuals. They can see their own souls reflected in the \u00e6ther, this appears as a red flame, smoke, mist for women and a blue flame, smoke, mist for men. Vampires can see this when they close their eyes. They are more intelligent and vigorous than average. Most significant historical figures since the dawn of time were Vampires, they are the natural nobility of this world.

Psychic vampirsm comprises those who employ various techniques and ploys in order to snatch energy from others. Genuine Vampires are simply born different from others with some unique genetic and spiritual markings. Such as the posession of fangs and the ability to see spirits as small flashes and their own soul rendered through the aether.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you have to drink blood / are you sanguinarian?</span><br>No again, there is a portion of genuine Vampires who consume flesh and drink blood but it is very far from the norm. This practice is because some recognize we are able to directly absorb a charge from the vicera of others though most have no idea of this or are repelled by it so therefore do not participate. It is directly comparable to how a recipient of an organ donation may receive memories and tendancies of the donor but however it is faster in it&#039;s progression. This is due to our natural chthonic, negative, current which flows throughout our bodies.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do you call this condition Vampirism?</span><br>Because there are many correlations to the traditional conception of what a vampire is and a genuine Vampire. We have fangs and we can drink blood as mentioned above and we also have longer lives on average. But we do not live forever or turn into bats or sleep in coffins or live exclusive nocturnal lifestyles. These are newer pop-cultural understandings of the subject matter and should be subjected to due criticism.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How common is this?</span><br>It isn&#039;t as uncommon as you may think, chances are you have or have had Vampire friends or acquaintances in the past.

I&#039;ve been looking into AP a lot lately and I&#039;ve had some really intense experiences but it never gets to the point where I can actually see or feel anything beyond the point of shifting. It feels like my body is slowly shrinking inside itself and I hear noise that&#039;s getting louder and louder, even shaking of the whole body at some points but I always drift off and wake up. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me being excited although I try as hard to just put emotions to the side in the process or if I&#039;m doing something wrong. I&#039;ve been advised by some kind anons to refer to /succgen/ for a helping hand but I don&#039;t want a demon to fuck me in the arse or anything sex related. What I&#039;m looking for is an entity willing to offer a helping hand without getting into a wicked relationship with it. It sounds too good to be true but I&#039;m new to all of this although I&#039;ve been trying for quite some time and I don&#039;t know who to reach out to.

Repetition. <a href=\"#p33921584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33921584</a> pointed out that paranormal discourse is the same shit over and over and that the people talking arent interested. This is all true. I think this problem can be broken down into even more problems problems:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A. There is a glut of content creators. Not necessarily bad, but bad due to the other factors.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B. They are generating a relatively small amount of new material. Most paranormal discussion focuses on the same topics. For every topic you can think of there are many videos, podcasts, and other media covering that topic. But they very rarely cover new information. Almost every piece of media uses the same sources and reports the same facts. Very little actual research is ever done. Which leads to</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C. Since the content is the same, creators must distinguish themselves in ways that are unrelated and do not add to the content. If you watch youtube for any length of time you will notice how the current algorithm promotes weird additions like inserted clips or distorted speech which add nothing to the conversation but vary the presentation in an attempt to keep your interest. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;D. Perverse incentives. all of these problems are due to the fact that content creation is algorithmically geared towards making money and does not promote people who </span><br>(a) Invest time in research of the paranormal, thereby delaying video production. <br>(b) Become an expert in a single subject thereby limiting their content. or<br>(c) Create content that is algorithmically divergent.", "time": 1674600132, "resto": 33921502}, {"no": 33922097, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)17:55:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "2/?<br><a href=\"#p33921613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33921613</a><br>2.

The secularization and profaning of the world leads most modern people to only value the paranormal as entertainment. It exists to give them a good scare and make money. But, at the end of the day, it is just another mundane topic with no real mysteries that can be fully understood by SCIENCE. Thus anyone discussing paranormal content falls into a few archetypes:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A. The Skeptic. This person exists to demonstrate that all things are reducible and quantifiable with Science and we should never question otherwise.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B. The chucklefuck. The chucklefuck agress with you that it certainly is interesting and fun to talk about the paranormal, but we don&#039;t really believe in that OK? Its all just fun nonsense.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C. The Stoner.

However, it was great for many reasons. <br>(a) the host was intelligent enough to hold a long conversation and ask penetrating questions AND was seemingly truly interested in what his guests had to say. <br>(b) The timing and scarcity of the show drove you to listen. You couldn&#039;t just pull the show up whenever you wanted and you couldn&#039;t re-listen without going to the trouble of making a tape copy or mailing in for one. Scarcity gave it value. <br>(c) The guests were often experts in their strange field and knowledgeable about their subjects.<br>(d) There was respect for the material and the show did not try to over-analyze or systematize it. One night it was demons, the next aliens and there was very little cross-talk between nights unless it was part of a series or a repeat guest.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The X-Files. While this was fiction, I think it was very influential in the paranormal world for its intelligent discussion of the paranormal and the people in the paranormal space. The writers clearly knew people who were invested in the paranormal and could write a fictional series focused on these people respectfully but intelligently.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sasquatch Chronicles podcast. This is a rare current podcast that gets it right. The hosts have actually spent the time to be experts on sasquatch and can discuss the topic deeply and intelligently. They feature real stories which are presented not to debunk or pick apart, but to consider.</span>", "time": 1674601926, "resto": 33921502}, {"no": 33922232, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:12:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33921502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33921502</a><br>just wait till the summer is over. <br>It cycles", "time": 1674601934, "resto": 33921502}, {"no": 33922290, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:19:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33921502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33921502</a><br><a href=\"#p33922232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33922232</a><br>But since you asked I wouldnt mind dropping some &quot;OC&quot;<br>Take your pick<br>These arent stories either I am something of a channeler<br><br>&lt;The question of life&gt;<br>&lt;The door&gt;<br>&lt;Mass-Communication via gut biomes&gt;", "time": 1674602389, "resto": 33921502}, {"no": 33922336, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:26:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33922290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33922290</a><br>the door", "time": 1674602769, "resto": 33921502}, {"no": 33922415, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:34:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33922336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33922336</a><br>The door refers to an inner portal that opens to infinite experiences.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in.

While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end. Sometimes we just get too self conscious about it (which is what the mindfulness industry seems to profit off of).", "time": 1673854756, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33854306, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841531</a><br>Exactly.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

One important thing for me was realizing that much of what we want in meditation are the results. But you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; results, instead you do things which bring results.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant.

and strange moments where it kicks on and suddenly you don&#039;t have the steering wheel. but it all goes perfect, better than you would&#039;ve done without the jade. also during computing, they can show you vital info that you wouldn&#039;t have otherwise known. they can reveal secrets, but don&#039;t expect a fat infodump. just occasional pointers as needed.<br>(i make a BIG DEAL abt privacy, so mine are trained for that. also i set them to compute other ppl&#039;s problems while remaining private. random temperature changes show it works)", "filename": "browns 22l 1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674631005197843, "time": 1674631005, "md5": "frq0Yjcx0XFtS398A4AHRg==", "fsize": 229753, "resto": 33918696}, {"no": 33925484, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33918696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33918696</a><br>The whole point of wishgranting is to test your humility, and to test your willingness to tear the fabric of reality just to get what you want.

For the past 12 years, every night there is banging on my roof, tapping on my windows, scraping noises on the walls outside. Sometimes huge crashing noises and bangs that make me just about shit myself, the whole house shakes. Sometimes I stay up all night and see these huge beasts moving toward my house through the windows. I&#039;ve managed to see their faces a few times, but they run lightning fast when I turn on the porch or yard lights or shine a flashlight, faster than Usain bolt. I tried leaving the lights on at night to keep them away but they throw rocks at the lights until they break if I do that. It&#039;s horrible because I can barely sleep and I&#039;m too poor to move. Sex with my wife gets interrupted by all the noise, sometimes she gets startled by the banging and farts while we&#039;re doing it which kills the mood. I&#039;m worried because it&#039;s gotten worse, I think they want to kill me. They seem like they&#039;ve started following me to work. If I work late I&#039;ll go out to my truck in the parking lot and sometimes see one messing around with my car. The muffler was torn off once. One broke a window and I briefly SAW IT with its arm reaching into the car through the broken window as I left work. The fuckers distract me at work by throwing pebbles at the windows if it&#039;s dark enough outside. They also started sending me telepathic messages about how they want me to leave, how I look tasty to them and how they eat humans they hate (think this explains Missing 411).

We call them ape men because they resemble apes because of how much hair they grow and how insanely powerful they are. Now its un clear how different they really are from us because these packs of people, if you can even call them that, have been around in their particular area living off the land for who knows how long. Now what do I mean by their particular area? To put it simply we suspect that they have been in their areas for thousands if not a bit over ten thousand years and have begun adapting to their environment hence the feral features. We also suspect they are the reason for why actual sasquatches are rarely seen because they kill and eat them. Hell, they&#039;ll kill each other if they were desperate enough but the reason they won&#039;t is because they&#039;re intelligent enough to understand that having a small group of yourselves is beneficial. Their groups are large enough to handle a group of hunters but small enough to evade detection. I personally suspect that they have mingled with eachother through incestuous breeding and with actual sasquatches creating a unique breed of human which supposedly creates giants.

I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;re still very active. Thanks again to you, and everyone else that helped me years ago when I first asked for help in finishing the tasks in Chumbley&#039;s One Grimoire.<br><br>I think I finally found the path where the Warden wanted me to take. I&#039;m still a bit mad about the whole I accidentally Chumbley&#039;s One Grimoire though. Anyway, how are you doing with your chod practice? <br><br>I really tried reading Chumbley&#039;s other books because they&#039;re interesting especially Azo\u00ebtia&#039;s dream work, I seem to fail in understanding them at a deeper level. It&#039;s Qutub and ONE where I can understand a bit and have spoopy happenings. The One Grimoire is dangerous af, and I would caution anyone wanting to do the ritual outlined unless they&#039;re mentally and physically prepared. Of course, there&#039;s this matter with compatibility to account for too. Is it just one Warden assigned per book or are they different ones guarding them?<br><br>Years later and I finally understood some of the inside jokes the Warden left in my dream meetings with him. Even my sojourn entries had memes thanks to my interest in other Asian cultures. icanteven (\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\ufe35 \u2501 <br><br>Moving on, if anyone else is suffering from nightmares, I find reciting Psalm 23, 91, 121 or the Verses of the Eight Noble Auspicious Ones, even just a page of either the Sutra of Golden Light, or Medicine Buddha Sutra helps. There&#039;s also Chenrezig&#039;s mantra, Green Tara, or the Vajra Guru mantra: OM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM. They&#039;re more effective combined with following the advice of a health professional/after taking a medical examination to check for any underlying causes just in case.<br><br>And hiya, Sevenleaf.

Lovecraft is not fiction, he was tapping into something real.<br>basically<br>The concept of the NYMZA is introduced as an ancient, powerful organization that seeks to control humanity. According to the novel, the NYMZA is derived from an ancient word that means &quot;name that has been removed,&quot; and refers to a group of beings who were banished to an astral plane for their evil actions. These beings seek to escape their imprisonment and return to the material world, and use their powers to manipulate the minds of humans in order to do so.<br>There are stories of two groups of supernatural beings engaged in a war that results in the defeated party being banished to the bowels of the Earth. The Bible tells of the war in Heaven in which Lucifer recruits a third of the angels in a rebellion against God Almighty. For this, the scripture tells us, Lucifer and his fellow rebels are cast down into a pit within the Earth where they remain imprisoned to this day. Hmmm. Might said prison be under the sea? Might Lucifer and his rebellious buddies have merely been the losing side of a political struggle between two factions of an advanced civilization based on other worlds? How might this reflect upon the stories of Quetzalcoatl or Viracocha or Oannes? Could the \u2018fish men from the sea&#039; actually have been emissaries from the vanquished party seeking to build human civilization up to a standard of technology capable of taking on the victors? <br>There are similar connections between H.P.

Lovecraft&#039;s writing and Aleister Crowley&#039;s. Both men wrote about extraterrestrial beings entombed at the bottom of the sea, and there are several similarities between their works. These include the same date of November 1st, 1907, references to an earthquake and a tentacled being, and the use of the same name, Tutulu/Cthulhu. The author suggests that these connections go beyond coincidence and that they may hint at a deeper connection between the two men and their writing.<br>Peter Levenda, in his book The Dark Lord, identifies six points of congruence between the two writers and their writings about this ancient arcane being.<br>Firstly, both writers reference the same date - Halloween night into November 1st, 1907. Lovecraft wrote about an event dedicated to Cthulhu on that date in his story The Call of Cthulhu, while Crowley wrote about Tutulu on the same night in his book Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli.<br>Secondly, both writers refer to sepulchers of the deep - Crowley in his book Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente, and Lovecraft in The Call of Cthulhu. In both cases, these sepulchers are associated with an abyss of the great deep.<br>Thirdly, both writers reference similar-sounding names - Tutulu and Cthulhu. Both are pronounced similarly, and both are connected to the same date and to the deep sea.<br>Fourthly, both writers reference black stones - Crowley describes a &quot;sorry stone&quot; of pure black marble associated with Tutulu and Typhon, while Lovecraft describes a black stone upon which sits the image of Cthulhu.<br>Fifthly, both writers reference earthquakes and tentacled beings - Crowley writes about an earthquake and a &quot;tentacled and old gnarled fish creature&quot; being a messenger of greater and elder gods, while Lovecraft writes about an earthquake that activates a psychic link to Cthulhu, a tentacled fish-like priest.", "time": 1674534055, "resto": 33915299}, {"no": 33916385, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)23:21:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33916378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33916378</a><br>Lastly, both writers reference the idea of the &quot;stars being right&quot; - in Lovecraft&#039;s case, this refers to an alignment of celestial bodies that will unlock the tomb of the abyss, while in Crowley&#039;s case it refers to the idea that &quot;every man and woman is a star&quot;.

It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.\u201d</span><br>\u2013 H. P.

Among this is the dating of the fall of Atlantis as related to and from Plato, about 9k years before Solon&#039;s time (c9600 BC, 11,600kya). This coincides with meltwater pulse 1b of the roughly thousand year younger dryas climate catastrophe. Further the mass of ice that existed in North America alone would have been nearly equal to that of Antarctica before the younger dryas, a near equal mass was also over Europe. The geographic evidence of the younger dryas melt pulses points to mind bogglingly fast melting, previously thought to have been centuries or millennia has been revised down to months of years recently (in some studies, weeks). This rapid melting of such large masses of ice would have mostly drained into the Atlantic, it would change the thermocline and haloclines of the entire world ocean rapidly and immediately altered the climate. It would have also rapidly changed the isostasy of the Earth&#039;s crust under the Atlantic in particular and raised local sea levels much more rapidly than previously thought. These are merely results however, of a precursor event that triggered the massive melting and climate shift (whether caused from the sun, the Earth itself, or from a passing or impacting comet or asteroid or something else).<br><br>The evidence of catastrophism are all about us, in our sight daily.

In your heliocentric paradigm you believe in galaxies tens of thousands of lightyears accross in size. So go ahead and Picture a merely-go-round the size of the Milky Way galaxy 50,000 lightyears across that\u2019s spinning. Do you honestly think that someone sitting 20 feet from the center of the roating galaxy sized merry-go-round is experiencing the same speed as the someone at the outer edge tens of thousands of lightyears away from the center?? Of course they\u2019re not. That\u2019s ludicrous! Obviously the person near the center would be traveling extremely slow compared to the person at the outer edge that would be traveling literally faster than the speed of light. This is where the trick lies in using angular speed. It\u2019s nonsense to claim that everyone on earth is experiencing the same speed just bc \u201cmuh maths\u201d said they are. They\u2019re not. Objectively angular speed is the wrong equation to use to determine if you would feel earth\u2019s spin.

Before you ask, no, it was definitely just a dream and felt like one, i just watched and read too much ufo shit lately.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

In the beginning there was God and the waters of chaos, Goodness and nothingness, but the Good itself is a kind of nothingness, it is a fullness, chaos is the emptiness. The baptism of Christ mirrors the Genesis 1 creation, the Spirit hovers over the waters, the Word is spoken, the Trinity is revealed. The Trinity rests on and in Christ, he is the Son, existing eternally in his Father&#039;s love, the Spirit, who exists in him, this is why Jesus told Philip that those who see him see the Father, he is the image of the Father, and they exist in another, distinct in person, united in reality.

These death races are mostly unrecorded in history like countless other heinous criminal activities but it is more than a rumour that Canada really went to the greatest extreme ever in every way with it. Countless deaths. A massacre unparalleled.<br><br>700 people went missing from Vancouver a couple years ago. <br><br>Some say another death race happened.<br><br>You look at how crazy all the world has been lately, would you really be so surprised.

Anyways, we stayed there around a week and half, one day while the sun was setting I walked up to the big wood fence that separated my great aunt&#039;s land from the forest, and as I was eating a slice of bread on the other side of the fence I saw a bird that looked like what would happen if you combined both a raven and a turkey.<br>It was entirely black except for three things, its eyes that were a really deep and intense shade of blue, its feet that were a shade of chalk blue, and a portion of its beak which was red. I had never seen a bird like that, so I started to throw pieces of bread to it so it would get closer to me, and it worked. It moved by making small jumps and it had a long neck that extended every time it picked up a piece of bread. Then the dogs started barking in the distance, and that scared the bird, and I saw it skipping away, each jump higher than the last, until it started to flap its wings and finally flew away, getting lost in the folliage of the trees. To this day I still have no idea what it was, I asked my family, the locals, my teachers back then in school, searched for it in books, then on the Internet, and even some of my college teachers who specialized in birds and fauna, but none of them had ever heard about a bird like that, so the only explanation I have is that I had an encounter with a species that remains undiscovered to this day.", "time": 1674629726, "resto": 33924558}, {"no": 33925450, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)02:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I swear to god, about two nights ago I looked out the window at 2.30 something a.m. and saw a shadow figure that I can only describe as a panther running at top speed.

Lincoln Electric used to be famous for their large bonuses, upwards of 50,60,70%+ of their salary. Big stuff, but demerits, and healthcare insurance and other stuff was taken out (this is a good thing, bonuses are taxed at a higher rate than salary). So most people wound up with a 10-15k bonus. Except that was high enough workers who missed out would kill themselves. Imagine killing yourself over 10k when you could clear 100k a year by not doing it. Psychs were brought in, fucking moron women claiming it was work conditions or anything else. But one manager knew the real truth. He cut up the bonuses so they were delivered regularly in smaller amounts. The suicides stopped. It\u2019s because NPCs can\u2019t see a truck, whether it\u2019s a Ford or a metaphysical one like being behind bills for an entire year because you were planning on a big payout and missing it. That\u2019s why many US manufacturing companies put large bonuses directly into 401ks, because NPCs are so retarded they can\u2019t be trained, overwatched or assisted in any way.

You can already see many versions taking hold of every part of society; and nobody is immune. Each disease is racing to be the first to be truly deadly, on a level unimagined by any person. It will replicate faster than any virus, and is incredibly more transmittable. It will completely control a person\u2019s entire range of thought, emotion, and action. It will delete agency in anyone who accepts it. It is like a computer virus for the human brain that kills and controls weak minds, and wounds strong minds. Nobody is ready for it.

For one person to be infected requires \u201cattacks\u201d from every angle; and infection is gradual, grouped, and overall very subtle. One day, millions will be infected, and nobody will be able to tell, because near everyone else will be half-infected.

Our purpose is simple: uphold beauty from the heavens in this world, like the golems who support Aphrodite&#039;s glorious bust. Through her worship we will set a heavenly standard of divine beauty that will create a powerful, all encompassing, beautifying energy forming the spiritual pillars of our temple.<br><br>A thread started in her name will commence the festival of Aphrodisia. The ways to demonstrate your worship are to write prayers, and bump the thread to keep the temple&#039;s beautifying energy alive as often as possible. All of Aphrodite\u2019s representations in art are welcome, whether it be drawn or real life art. The manifestation of our goddesses&#039; divine beauty in women is also allowed, and posting beautiful female specimens is encouraged as long as blue board rules are followed. The ideal is real natural female beauty as the goddess intended, with makeup allowed within limits, not unnatural artificial plastic surgery \u201cbeauty\u201d.<br><br>There is only one general rule for the temple: Aphrodite has graced us with natural love and pleasures. Any deviations away from this essence will result in expulsion from the temple.
