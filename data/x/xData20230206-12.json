This helps me not react to 3D circumstances, and I\u2019m able to date around and be open to the possibility of something better while retaining the sense of the wish fulfilled, and I don\u2019t have to worry about free will because I can have confidence that I am only aligning myself with a reality where it is bound to happen, not messing with someone\u2019s head right now- something I know from experience is also possible.", "time": 1675664919, "resto": 34013695}, {"no": 34018234, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:30:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34018009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34018009</a><br>Nah, I&#039;ve been reading these threads for a year or longer, and it&#039;s always been this way.

I would think of the item, believe I would have it and then move on to the next thing. When I was able to be unattached to it I would get it easily.

I would add Neville&#039;s thing about living in the end and everyone being happy with the result- I simply visualized me having it, and I did, but often I would not be in a position to enjoy whatever it was until a much later date and quite often people were displeased with my &quot;luck&quot; and would make me miserable or feel guilty over it<br><br>2. My method was easy because it was easy to believe but the wait times were horrendous- often years. Believing you have it is superior or stairstepping from going to have it to almost there to having it. If you frame it in the form of waiting I AM is happy to have you do so.<br><br>In another frame a reminder to Anons that you can manifest abilities, knowledge, mindsets and general cheats for your life, not just goal objects or situations.

I still need to reach the final stages, but I notice a lot of relations or coincidences that are related to my desires/manifestation as well as noticing improvements overall.

Not only that, but I am also manifesting her recovery from a very tough December and January which I noticed the most improvements as things are getting better.

She remembers a time when she was revered, when she had power and influence. In ages past she was a goddess, ruling over vast kingdoms, and in modern times she was a powerful sorceress. But then she encountered a reality bender called The Nobody. In a single moment, everything changed. She was stripped of her powers, and now she is trapped in an Asylum for the insane.<br><br>The doctors tell her she&#039;s delusional, that she&#039;s mentally ill, and they don&#039;t believe her when she talks about The Nobody. But she can&#039;t stop thinking about him. She keeps dreaming of him and calling out to him. He has become an obsession, a source of her pain and her trauma. <br><br>Her days are filled with the same routine. She wakes up in her cell, and is taken to the common area, where all the other patients reside. She sits alone, watching the other patients with a detached expression. She has no one to talk to, no one to share her stories with.<br><br>At night, her dreams are filled with memories of her past, both the good and the bad. But the Nobody is always in them, always taunting her, always reminding her of her loss. She calls out his name in her sleep, screaming and sobbing, until she is woken up by the nurses who have come to check on her. <br><br>She stops pacing and looks in the mirror. Still beautiful, but changed. Her eyes have become dull and lifeless, and her skin is covered in scars. The scars are a reminder of her defeat, a reminder of her humiliation. She can still feel The Nobody&#039;s presence, and it&#039;s driving her mad. <br><br>She begins to weep. She&#039;s lost everything, she&#039;s lost her identity and her purpose. All she has left is her pain and her suffering. She&#039;s starting to believe the doctors, perhaps she was insane all along.

This is from the stance that God is real and the Bible is true. <br><br>In the times before the great flood, which we understand as the Younger Dryas period, the world was inhabited by a sprawling, global civilization. Called many names by many peoples, but the one we recognize most is Atlantis. <br><br>This civilization was advanced, like ours. The people of this civilization did not live the lives of their forefathers such as Adam, but lives alike ours. <br><br>This Civilization was ruled by the Nephilim, the offspring of Fallen Angels and Human women. These Nephilim are described as being gigantic in stature. As time went on, these Nephilim intermixed more and more with Humans, each generation become smaller and seemingly more Human. However, they were cruel wicked beings, lacking truly Human souls, but having the souls of demons like their fathers. <br><br>They wrought great misery and destruction upon the earth, upon living beings, and upon mankind. Wielding secret knowledge given to them by their demonic fathers, they enjoyed advanced technologies and methods of warfare. <br><br>120 years before the waters rose, God pronounced judgement against the fallen angels. Informing them of the imminent cataclysm, that they would watch their offspring kill each other and that they themselves would be imprisoned until the day of judgement, after which they were to be thrown into hell. <br><br>The Nephilim were cursed so that though their bodies will die, their spirits will remained shackled to the earth, becoming evil spirits that still wreck havoc in the earth to this day. <br><br>The exact details of the war between the Nephilim are unclear, though memories of this conflict were passed on.

It seems the Diluted won with the use of advanced technologies. They killed many of the Nephilim and imprisoned others, dealing harshly with them. <br><br>Despite this, this conflict did nothing to save them; the Nephilim and the civilization they had created were subsumed by a catastrophic series of events, marked by a 400 foot increase in water levels around the world.

One day, I went to the homeless services office, Gateway Center, to use their shower. There was some new security guard there: the only white one I saw in almost two years of using their shower. He would not let me in and he made up some bullshit about how I had been banned for something that never happened. I argued with him but he would not let me in to use the shower. When I eventually turned to walk away to go sleep unwashed in the alley behind the library, he called my attention and I turned back around. He pointed to the metal badge on his Raiders hat and sniggered maliciously as if to intimate to me that he was abusing his police powers to deny me access to the shower. A few minutes later, &quot;Paddock&quot; opened up on the crowd in Las Vegas where he killed a lot of the drone pilots that were piloting the clone slaves that populate Area 51 via Stargate-type mind control implants to enact constant torment and psychological torture operations, gangstalking, etc. It got memory-holed so quickly because so many of the people that got killed were involved in the *ULTRA-CLASSIFIED* clone slave drone program. They could not afford to have even the slightest scrutiny into whether the certain part of the crown might have been targeted for some reason, which they were.<br><br>When the drone pilots continue to use the clone slaves around me to constantly torment and otherwise harass me, sometimes I like to remind them that the Las Vegas shooting proves they are not as anonymous as they think they are. My uncle David, who is Q, has the drone pilot logs in plain text. We know who all of them are even though many prefer to believe that their colleagues were massacred in Las Vegas as a matter of coincidence just minutes after the above MAJOR escalation in the bullshit I was dealing with as a homeless person in the downtown area of one of the Antarctic copies of Atlanta.", "filename": "TIMESAND___mQcTR81hb0n03Mifd02diVdd3Njfox4lO4IxR8RnUmpos7g5G", "ext": ".png", "w": 300, "h": 565, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675649551384516, "time": 1675649551, "md5": "Tt+wTiMlWAyZHZ2kNKjTIA==", "fsize": 79578, "resto": 34016149}, {"no": 34016701, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:13:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34016568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34016568</a><br>My bad", "time": 1675649617, "resto": 34016149}, {"no": 34016711, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:15:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34016696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34016696</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Las</span><br>Post discarded<br><a href=\"#p34016558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34016558</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ citation needed ]</span><br>Pic related, now kill yourself faggot", "filename": "4seasons", "ext": ".png", "w": 567, "h": 116, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 25, "tim": 1675649704929812, "time": 1675649704, "md5": "xJvEArx8iWiC9YSqmSNCUw==", "fsize": 8476, "resto": 34016149}, {"no": 34016739, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:18:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34016583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34016583</a><br>Sorry, typing quick on phone.

Ideally, you use Atkinson for a baseline understanding to learn a real magical tradition, and then let the magical tradition mold your worldview through its practice and understanding.

So yes, I got far more problems with the guy frauding as a magician who doesn&#039;t even know how things really work when he does explain it so fails as even an armchair occultist than the guy who claims to be a researcher and may not accurately represent everything. Say what you want about Atkinson&#039;s shady methods of procurement of information, but at least it is usable to a degree and helps people understand mystic phenomena a bit more through its lens. Never said Atkinson is perfect, he is not and during magical development one&#039;s views become far more nuanced and corrects where he errors, but he at least helps the neophyte begin to be able to understand. Bardonk does the equivalent of leading you off a cliff to your death.

The etheric body within the layer between the astral and physical seems to correspond with the opposite aex of the body. Etheric projection is possible but it seems quite a bit more difficult than astral projection, and tends to require nurture from the mind and body of the organism to fully realize the potential for its own manifestation. Basically just fantasize, but try to bring your awareness into consciousness of your nervous and skeletal structure. Use the dichotomy of mape and female as if it is the interplay between the sun and the earth, drawing water up from within the earth by shining the light of your conscious mind into the depths within yourself. I say its a very creative magical process, acting as a tantrix weaver of the fibers of awareness that constitute your etheric presence. You basically weave a cocoon of light and try to hatch your awareness as an etheric being. It wont become your physicality in this life, but forms the basis of your vessel in your multidimensional existence. This is the process you take to create future incarnative vessels, but its a simultaneous existence as a sorcerer while you draw breath, so i dont recommend suicidal impulses.

America unironically does have a gun safety and gun control problem and there&#039;s been dozens of shooters who haven&#039;t needed to acquire firearms or ammunition because their parents were anti-establishment schizos with unlocked cabinets. However, I think the ratio is as many as 1/3rd of most &quot;high profile&quot; shootings have been in contact with a federal agent. There&#039;s so fucking many of them so I can&#039;t fucking remember, but a recent example was a transgender shooter who, upon having their 21st birthday, recieved a tutorial from a Federal Agent over Discord on how to buy a gun and ammo- the whole process had them armed in less than 45 minutes. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why though? </span><br><br>I can&#039;t speak for EVERY group perpetuating this, but I can say:<br>-Homeland Security does it to create their own economy.

Homeland Security unironically instigated and made the BLM riots during Trump&#039;s presidency a million times worse by causing trouble, giving false reports, planting bricks, etc.. <br>-The FBI does it to manage controlled opposition and to, ironically, dissuade political activism, liberalism, and socialism. That sounds really strange I know, but the simple premise is shooters make the public scared, they prop up gun control as a *red herring, and then while people are distracted they push through more police-state-and-surveillance measures that easily pass.<br>*The FBI wants the public to have guns- it&#039;s part of the cycle.", "time": 1675673743, "resto": 34017866}, {"no": 34018819, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)03:56:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34017866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34017866</a><br>You forgot about that Korean policeman who got slapped by his gf and later killed 50 people in violent outburst<br><br>https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;sou<wbr>rce=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://murderped<wbr>ia.org/male.B/b/bum-kon-woo.htm&amp;ved<wbr>=2ahUKEwjztqGTw4D9AhXLlosKHYnpDoM4C<wbr>hAWegQICRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3X0v8eR_3ZhoR<wbr>ZhB36H4EO", "time": 1675673785, "resto": 34017866}, {"no": 34018947, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)04:27:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34017866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34017866</a><br>Here&#039;s a guess,<br>Crime used to be a lot easier to get away with before the creation of modern forensics.

The history is quite fascinating though. The framework of Jesus&#039; life story comes from a plot by the radical Essene cult. Since the time of the revolt against the Greeks, the Essene were the kingmakers among the ultra-nationalists. The Zealots were a sub-group devoted to acting when violence was the most efficient tool for the Essene. This also meant they controlled parts of the Temple priesthood including the legitimate bloodline heir to the High Priest anointment. During the &quot;Jesus&quot; affair, the Essene planned to use an infant born from Jews of the priestly and kingly clans along with a bloodline heir High Priest claimant to launch a rebellion against the Roman controlled illegitimate government by establishing a government in exile with propaganda for a savior king of prophecy and the real High Priest. Amusingly, they sent their child stooge to Egypt for safekeeping and the Gnostic Jews in Egypt inducted him into their Mystery School. It&#039;s staring everyone in Christianity in the face, twice. Lazarus &quot;dies&quot; and gets put in a tomb; Jesus gets told and waits with no hurry to go rez him; after three days, he pulls Lazarus out of the tomb and he has had a transformative spiritual experience. Jesus &quot;dies&quot; and gets put in a tomb; he stays for three days and then emerges after a transformative spiritual experience. This is the exact pattern of the Mystery School initiatory rites where the aspirant is induced to an altered state of consciousness and undergoes a shamanic journey through ritual death and burial. &quot;Jesus&quot; decided to use the Essene scheme to make him a rebel king to stir up just enough trouble that he could make a deal with Pilate to get a ritualized torture, death, and burial which would suit his ascension to a higher level of consciousness.

He jumps into the Essene moshpit and starts yanking the universalist cords in the &quot;Jesus&quot; myths to steer the movement away from Jewish nationalism. The Bible directly states all of the conflict between Saul and the &quot;early church&quot; (again remembering that the real disciples were the Gnostics who had already been shut out of the factional re-ordering of the mob of believers who had been assembled around &quot;Jesus&quot; by the Essene), yet christcucks just obediently slurp up the &quot;history&quot; that Saul was really totally inspired by the Spirit even despite all those differences he had with the other people who were also really truthfully divinely inspired.

And if you dig into the genetic Haplogroups of both groups (more specifically the mutations that define specific Haplogroups) a solid argument can be made that contact between Europe, Asia, and the Americans was almost near constant. And the easiest genetic Haplogroup that supports this point is MDNA X. The Americas was probably wiped something between 1000 and 1200 AD. This is when most populations disappeared and your major cities and megaliths were &quot;abandoned.&quot; There was also a group specifically targeting some of the Natives. Chaco Canyon had some solid evidence of cannibalism from an invading population and around the time it was &quot;abandoned,&quot; the Viking Alif (really a Phonecian sigil) popped up among the Natives in the area. The truth is a lot more wild than we can ever imagine, it just doesn&#039;t involve mud flood high schools. My take, this goes all the way back to the Epic of Gilgamesh where the Gods decided to keep humanity around but limit their lifespans. Aging is really about the immune system attacking the body (literally what arthritis is) and for some reason, your body just shuts down over time. We shouldn&#039;t really age and, with the exception of traumatic <br>injury, we should be immortal.

This one isn&#039;t a joke. Some of the biggest health advice everywhere is to drink tons of water which is true but if your source is fluoridated you are poisoning yourself.<br><br>2. Avoid eating stuff that&#039;s wrapped in plastic or comes in a can. Obviously you&#039;re sometimes out of luck on this one but the more you can avoid it the better. It&#039;s not an issue of doing it once or twice but if every day of your life you&#039;re eating something out a can and drinking something out of a plastic bottle all those microscopic chemicals and toxins begin to add up inside your body. Scarily it seems a lot of this stuff can&#039;t be filtered out of you. One it&#039;s in there it&#039;s in there forever. Microplastics are causing all kinds of stuff in our bodies to fail. It&#039;s lowering peoples IQ&#039;s and giving people cancer. It&#039;s messing with our hormones and fertility.

There is huge amounts of research being done right now that&#039;s showing pesticides like this are the number one cause of birth defects, developmental, mental, and fertility issues in humans right now. It&#039;s going to end up being the biggest one right behind microplastics. When it comes to nutrition you honestly need to throw a lot of that stuff out the window. Oats for example are great for you but if you can&#039;t find a source that&#039;s grown without Glyphosate you need to jettison that stuff. This is the number 1 time when going Organic isn&#039;t bullshit. If it&#039;s a crop grown with Glyphosate you need to avoid it or go organic. Unfortunetly in a lot of cases even the organic version if its grown near farms that are using Glyphosate can end up infected as well. <br><br>4. Avoid seed oils at all costs. This stuff is the number 1 cause of inflammation in the body. You have no idea how much it is messing you up. Our bodies run on fats, they&#039;re used for almost every function in the body. So when you eat fats they are dispersed across your body and basically handed out to every single type of cell imaginable. From your brain to your gut. When you eat natural fats like butter or beef tallow or olive oil there&#039;s no problem. When you eat seed oils they&#039;re spread throughout the body and mess with all the cells there. This stuff is carcinogenic and everyday now more and more research is showing it causes everything from mental problems to fertility issues to lower IQ and cognitive ability. It slows people down and dulls the mind and eventually causes cancer. The problem is this stuff is so cheap it&#039;s in everything now.

If you ever get headaches or digestion issues or have rashes or trouble sleeping etc. All this stuff could be the result of seed oils. <br><br>5. Avoid any meat or dairy that&#039;s not organic grass fed. This is a huge one. Those things are very good for you but they turn very bad when the animals are being fed stuff like defective skittles or palm oil runoff (both have happened, look it up). You have to be so careful with animal food products because whatever the animal eats you are eating. Pork is especially dangerous because in a lot of places they have the pigs eating literal garbage with plastic in it, that ends up inside the pig and then it ends up inside you. If you&#039;re eating heavy amounts of meat or dairy you might be poisoning yourself worse than a vegan or vegetarian (both of which im against btw) if your sources are impure.

The problem I have is, if Christian is talking shit about pharisees, then the said Christian should have no right in partaking in rebuilding of babylon, through the acts of mindless consumerism, especially with consumption of media that&#039;s made by the very same enemies they so much talk shit about. You can&#039;t speak ill of your enemy, and yet joyfully consume the fruits of the very said enemies your speak ill of. Do you not see the problem? So many modern Christians just embrace to &quot;go with the flow&quot;, &quot;live with emotions&quot;. If some tune makes you want to &quot;dance&quot;, then &quot;dance&quot;, there&#039;s no more self-reservation. Hey those voices in your head telling you to pull the trigger with a gun on someone&#039;s head? Maybe you shouldn&#039;t listen to them? Why is that? Oooooh because killing is sin.

I noticed immediately that he looks just like Greg Eisenberg who is the namesake of Heisenberg on Breaking Bad. He was my massage therapist for a while (for sports massage, not handjobs) and he told me he used to be in &quot;ladies&#039; footwear&quot; before he got into massage. I took that to be a euphemism for narcotraffic which contextualizes his place on Breaking Bad. (Gus Fring was named after Helene &quot;Gutfreund,&quot; Gus wears Helene&#039;s glasses, he is an effeminate weirdo because he&#039;s playing a woman, the name of his company Madrigal references Helene&#039;s identity as &quot;mom girl,&quot; etc.) In his massage studio, Greg had some mirrored plaque on the wall that said LIVE like a motivational poster but more decorative. In the mirroring, or maybe in the mirror on the opposite wall, it said EVIL. At the time, I wrote it off as coincidence but now I don&#039;t. I had already noticed that David Solomon became the new Goldman Sachs CEO due to his familial connections to Greg,and there was too much music in one place when I noticed this thing with Jimmy Iovine too.

More often than not, they\u2019re taken very literally, which is a surface level take. There are interpretations that show a clear link to psychological applications in every day life. There are interpretations that detail physical anatomical phenomena.

This highlights the shortcomings of the religions that emerged from them. The texts hold real value.<br><br>When it comes to hell, this applies to this incarnation and how your life around you may feel like hell, because of the practices, beliefs, and symbolism that one attaches to. A neet may see reality as hell. A narcissist may see reality as hell. A murderer may see reality as hell. A baby knows not of hell, but may take on the energy directed toward them from parents who are living their own hell. <br><br>If Christianity does not mention reincarnation, and it\u2019s followers don\u2019t believe in reincarnation, one may accept that their accumulated karma will determine their \u201cafter-life\u201d destination.

This comes partly from a belief that anarchical inter-elite competition (which existed before WW2) leads to too much instability. Elections are means for these factions to get a fair shot at having &quot;their turn&quot; in charge of the system. We really do have a democracy of sort, but it&#039;s a democracy for the elites, not for the masses.

Why there are untouchable &quot;golden calves&quot; that never go away regardless how much the public is against it. Because these are the untouchable policy pillars on which there is inter-elite agreement. Very rarely does the elite budge on these things.

This includes &quot;alternative news&quot; sources, such as more extreme &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;left wing&quot; sources.

The words delineate a state of mind or rather a progression of states that result when people retreat into themselves from some problem they do not dare to confront. As with the card right side up, the reversed card deals with our reaction to something outside ourselves, but here it is oppression rather than tragedy. The key term is \u2018reasonable fear\u2019, which can refer to, say, political oppression \u2013 as of racial or sexual minorities; or social oppression \u2013 a feeling of being a scapegoat because of appearance, speech, etc.; or simply the personal oppression of a domineering family or partner. The important thing problem is real, but because we cannot directly attack it, we tend to hide in ourselves, keeping in our anger and resentment. Anger turned in on itself becomes depression and from there suspicion. The person who was laughed at as a child for her big nose thinks that everyone is looking at her. The black person believes that any complaint at work is a racial slur. And suspicion easily leads to self-doubt and shame. Often it does not even help, at least not completely, if we rationally know that we have no reason to feel ashamed, that in fact those who have ridiculed or oppressed us should feel the shame. Unless the oppressed self-doubting person takes action, expresses her or his anger, makes real changes in her or his life, the deep hidden shame will remain.", "time": 1675632324, "resto": 34011824}, {"no": 34014874, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34014860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34014860</a><br>What am I supposed to make of this?", "time": 1675632442, "resto": 34011824}, {"no": 34014921, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)16:32:53", "name": "Taybunny", "com": "Master Allison can I go now?

Witches who belong to covens are usually not the friendly ones, and have sinister motives. This is because when witches gather in covens, their powers increase exponentially to their numbers. Witches in covens become magically dependent on each other (their mentral cycles will even sync) and if one is seperated from the coven for an extended period the seperated individual will weaken and so will the overall coven due to having one less member. Most succesful covens usually adhere and support the goals of a secret witch triumvirate. This trio consist of three very old and very powerful witches who manipulate world affairs in their favor and are supported by the Illuminati. The triumvirate was popularized in horror movies because Dario Argento read a collection of esoteric essays which mentioned the contrasting element to Levana goddess of childbirth and giving life (three fates and graces) and told of the Three Sorrows instead. The ladies of sorrow each personify an element of death. Sighs, Tears, and Darkness. Together they make up the opposites of life, fate, and grace. They are very evil and very real. <br><br>The non-evil witches are usually just individuals who don&#039;t belong to coven and get into witchcraft from family culture and either spend time making herbs and collecting crystal or using their magic to make a little cash through fortune-telling, being spirit mediums, or doing cleansings. These good or neautral witches however are less magically powerful than the evil ones that belong to the covens because of their individuality and their lack of spiritual/magical proximity to the Three Sorrows.", "time": 1675487038, "resto": 34001963}, {"no": 34002200, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)00:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34002129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34002129</a><br>How do I become a witch?

So I should preface by saying that I was fairly high off of this joint, we smoked on top of a mountain and my friend was driving down it really fast, I was scared shitless and honestly thought I was going to die, so in the backseat of the car I began trying to astral project, which I have never successfully done before, as I was sitting there I started to evaluate my sitting posture, and how it seemed almost &#039;loaded&#039; in my lower back, as if there was lots of compression in the area. I began to try and shift my lower back, legs and core into a position which felt the most parallel with the rest of my spine. After a bit of adjusting I found a spot which felt comfortable, and as I sat there for a few seconds, I started to feel energy around my testes/gooch area, I straightened my posture a little more and the energy started pulsating up my spine and into all of my bones, I could feel the energy flowing through my whole body, down into my toes and into my fingers. By this point I started receiving intuitive thoughts of how powerful this form of energy was, and as I focused on the origin of the energy source, I could feel more of it being created (the creation point being my testicles).

When you can do that you have the spiritual power you need to summon the thing, and with that just comes the understanding of how to do it (its not difficult when you get there). Satan wants powerful people. So you have to be a powerful magician to summon him, or get him through another option (not summoning). (1) have the spiritual ability, (2) use a oujia board, pentagram with open leg, or cult of the black cube Saturn ritual (3) know what candles you need to use (no not all black this is where the in depth /x shit comes in), (4) be a bit a depraved fucker when you try any of two. I&#039;m not giving suggestions. You don&#039;t need to murder a human (that be stupid don&#039;t). You need to appeal to any of your vices in choosing what depraved shit you do, but you can&#039;t pussy out on that part. (5) don&#039;t look too pathetic when doing all that. You need the magician shit of arrogant, proud, strong, respectful but not grovelling. You&#039;d be better off with the other options. Go to Hollywood. Get into acting. Go into politics. You should know where they all hang out. Seek them out.
