I started reading Carl Jung&#039;s &#039;The Undiscovered Self&#039; and just after the first 3 chapters something unlocked in my mind. It might&#039;ve been more than just the book that did it, but my way of thinking had become different. I began questioning a lot of things in my life and came up with theories that I had thankfully written down. I also began noticing symmetries in life and at that same time a certain James Webb telescope photo was posted online that just pushed me further into it. The galaxies were somewhat lined up in symmetrical patterns! *photo attached* <br>As of now, my mind isn&#039;t where it was then. I&#039;ve gone back to a somewhat normal thinking style while still attaining that knowledge. I had given up weed almost a month ago and as it was leaving my system I feel that sort of curious thinking style dissipate with it. Health wise its for the best, but perhaps I can return there with a sober mind. I just need to work towards that again. <br>In that short time though, I discovered important things about myself and realized which aspects belonged to my shadow self. With that particular knowledge I&#039;ve gained much more self control (which was my main goal). But aside from that, I&#039;ve developed theories about the power of perception, emotional energy, the importance of mental association, and personal truths. Most importantly out of all of this though, I&#039;ve begun to reconnect myself with God.<br>[ANYWAY] with all that said, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that each one of us has a personal truth that isn&#039;t true for anyone else. Each and every one of our individual lives are unique no matter how basic they may seem, and with that uniqueness is an equally unique truth. What is true to you isn&#039;t exactly true for somebody else even though there are similarities.

I don&#039;t care if this steps on any toes, it&#039;s a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn&#039;t Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a &quot;front&quot; for their activities.&quot; Svali <br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/welcome/child-page/<br><br>\u201c...and as you join Freemasonry, initially they&#039;ll tell you that their G, the G in the square and compass, means God. But then as you go up through the levels, they&#039;ll tell you, &#039;Oh, this stands for Gnosis, knowledge.&#039; But then when you get higher up it stands for the Generative principle, which means, buggering little boys. And I&#039;m not saying that on my own authority. I spoke with the highest ranking Freemason to defect to Christianity, Jim Shaw, he was a 33rd degree Freemason, and I had a number of conversations over the phone with him about Freemasonry. And you know, I got it from the horse&#039;s mouth.\u201d Fritz Springmeier", "time": 1670810367, "resto": 33580915}, {"no": 33587086, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)21:00:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33587075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33587075</a><br>Jesters connections to pedogate<br>https://steemit.com/pedogate/@artis<wbr>tiquejewels/royal-order-of-jesters-<wbr>connection-to-prostitution-and-pedo<wbr>gate-their-history-and-verified-fin<wbr>dings-concerning-their-activities<br><br>Epstein was headmaster of royal order of jesters<br>https://web.archive.org/web/2022032<wbr>7015853/https://www.saidit.net/s/co<wbr>nspiracy/comments/92mn/i_had_access<wbr>_to_classified_documents_about_the/<wbr><br><br>Royal Arch info<br>https://www.henrymakow.com/maltese-<wbr>paedophile-network.html<br><br>https://www.henrymakow.com/mi-6_mk_<wbr>ultra_a_uk_survivors_s.html<br><br>http://www.whale.to/b/mi5a.html<br><br>http://richardtomlinsonmi6.blogspot<wbr>.com/2006/12/richard-tomlinson-ex-m<wbr>i6-officer.html", "time": 1670810427, "resto": 33580915}, {"no": 33587092, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)21:01:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33587074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33587074</a><br>where&#039;d you get this picture of me", "time": 1670810482, "resto": 33580915}, {"no": 33587095, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)21:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33587042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33587042</a><br><a href=\"#p33587075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33587075</a><br><a href=\"#p33587086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33587086</a><br>What if I don&#039;t believe you?

Fear is better translated respect or reverence in proverbs 1:7. You know he could destroy you at any moment, but you know he loves you and sent Jesus to die for you, so you may have come to the lord in fear, but now you obey him because you love him. Proverbs 9:10 KJV<br>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.<br><br>Love is the completion of understanding. You should never lose your fear or reverence of God, but you should not stand in terror. Because you are supposed to approach his throne with boldness for his grace. I hope that clears things up. Those who are going to be judged should be in terror if they do not accept Jesus Christ. So what I am saying is that making Jesus lord of your life from a place of fear is an immature Christian.

It&#039;s honestly true. Any of us at ANY TIME can reach out and pray to Him, in all our authentic flaws will be evident to Him. Our genuine call will be heard and He will know your intent beyond all awareness. He is always patiently waiting. I&#039;ve known this but often doubted it... so much of this world has caused me to question the truth of God&#039;s love and power, of his glorious grace and forgiveness. Christ is as harsh as He is benevolent I&#039;ve learned... surrendering unto Him opens the pathway to a connection that will ignite all the lies in a blaze, like an unveiling, and truths will start to wash over you. It&#039;s amazing that all these years He was beside me always willing to guide me, offering me the lessons I needed... He is near us all. It just takes that one time to surrender it all... all that you think you are, all which you thought you knew. Like removing all attachments, all data, all identity, all power and asking Him &quot;please Lord of Lords, help me understand.. help me to know you. I want to forever be with you my God, help guide me.&quot; And if you are genuine and have faith, it will manifest. You will feel His presence, it will be with you constantly. Without the presence of man&#039;s influences, without all the data and rituals and dogmas... He will give you answers. And you WILL notice the world and people around you will challenge it. Satan and many doubts. Tricks and lies and ego will challenge. Your own mind will challenge the skeptic your own faith. <br><br>Be strong. The forging will be grown by Christ, God needed your willful choice to love and seek Him, then He will be with you, fill the hollowness of your soul. Nothing in the world can take that away from the children of God. So be humbled and honor it.

It was not to show miracles for the sake of convincing people to follow them or to create a religion. The resurrection, for example, was not a piece of theater to underline Jesus\u2019 unique stature as the son of god. He was not that. That was written in later. As his popularity grew, it was understood that Anu and Marduk could utilize Jesus to strengthen Anu\u2019s hold on human culture, and reposition himself as a loving God\u2014the father of great entities like Jesus. Avatars were generally considered an annoyance by Anu. Usually they were killed or locked up to wither and die. Stories would be created to either cement them to Anu\u2019s glorification, or they would be vilified and deemed to be of Satan. There was no middle ground with Avatars.

At least, that&#039;s a symptom of what I can do. By focusing in an area on the back of my neck, I can send a chill down my spine. Scientists cannot explain this, but they only see the symptom: goosebumps on command. I can focus this sensation, energy even, to different parts of my body. I can use it to accelerate my own healing, especially if the injury is fresh. Many of the times, if I get hurt, I forget in the heat of the moment and adrenaline. When I immediately focus this energy, the damage heals 2-4X quicker than it normally should. The longer between the tissue damage and my energy flow, the less effective it is. I have been able to successfully transfer this to other people. They do not feel the chill as I do, the pins and needles traveling down my body and into theirs, but I do. People with mild injuries (Rolled/sprained ankle, jammed finger, head blow, etc) have commented that after I lay hands on them and perform, the pain fades quickly and the injury leaves little mark. I rarely do this however, as they think me crazy and refuse, or their pathways are so incredibly blocked it does not complete a circuit. I can run out of this energy, but it also heavily depends on my mood and feeling. When I am angry or stressed and I try, it simply bounces back up towards my head as what I assume are my chakras become blocked. If I am in sleep paralysis or astrally projecting, I can do the same thing, but it feels more euphoric even. I have been focusing on directing this energy outside of my body, as it is much easier to practice while in a lucid dream or sleep paralysis. Air seems to be a terrible conductor for this, but other objects with significant sentimental meaning or certain crystal lattice structures are able to conduct this well. I can transfer it from the base of my neck, to one arm and hand, through said mediums, and into my other hand and back up to my neck.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling.

I was playing at my grandparents house, about to run into the back yard, when I got caught in a spider web. A huge spider started to approach me, and I called out to my grandparents who were sitting in the yard close by. There was some feeling of distance from them, like a veil or water between us, they couldn&#039;t hear me and they couldn&#039;t help. As I grew older I associated that spider with the abusive aspects of that side of the family, how mean my grandpa especially could be, how that spilled off on my Mom and later my siblings, getting caught in those cycles of being vicious to the people you&#039;re supposed to love the most. But this makes me reconsider the symbology, especially since I&#039;ve been able to let a lot of that shit go into adulthood and how I&#039;ve dodged those shitty attitudes a little better than some other people in my family. Maybe something scary was keeping me from fully integrating into something worse.<br><br>I ended up living in that house for a while after college.

That said, Jupiter is the ruler of Sun, Mars, and Saturn in the return chart, and he is angular and conjunct the MC, making a degree-based aspect to the ascendant, so they may very well bring romance to the table this year.<br><br>However, I don&#039;t like that Saturn rules the descendant and is in a cadent house in the solar return, I don&#039;t like that the natal seventh lord is in a cadent house in the solar return, I don&#039;t like that Venus is debilitated and in the twelfth house of the nativity, and given how intense some of these signs are, I think many of the indicators which could be saying &quot;love&quot; will be saying &quot;toil&quot; simply because of the reasons indicated previously.<br><br>Now, this isn&#039;t to say that I don&#039;t like your chances, I actually found more going for you than appeared for me at first glance once I gave it a second look, however there will be a lot going on for you during this period, and ultimately if there&#039;s just too much chaos for you to invest in a relationship, then that&#039;s just the way it is.

Then God will pick a messiah to separate &quot;his chosen people&quot; from the masses. <br>The usual rhetoric is &quot;they forgot who they were&quot; suggesting they were always &quot;chosen&quot;, and not just random people that a cult successfully recruited. <br><br>So in the New Testament. The jews were living under the Romans. They were not assimilating. In one sense, they didn&#039;t need to be separated. They wanted to print their own money. Stamp their own gold bullion. Live by their own standard. But in another sense, that&#039;s the kind of idol worship that always fucks them over. Again, the missing context here that most people today are missing was how the temples supported the economy.<br>Plus, outside of bible stories, when have the jews &quot;needed&quot; to be distinguished? Right? They&#039;re usually driven out because they refused to assimilate, or accused of subversive conspiracies. <br><br>The promise - the point - of God&#039;s covenant was to do away with that system centered on a geographical locations. Jesus in the New Testament, would talk to people (See: Woman at the Well) how some day people would be free to worship anywhere. They wouldn&#039;t suffer in some pyramid scheme. A kind of globalization - but again, there was no separation of church and state back then. Inheriting the Earth. More context to keep in mind. <br>Not long after Jesus died, the Romans destroyed THE temple. The religious bureaucracy, for a lack of a better term, had essentially tied it&#039;s own hands. They couldn&#039;t rebuild without a command of god, not to mention other ceremonial observations for ritual cleanliness that would make it a challenging task.

Now there&#039;s this part that say that the spilling of the seed is not permitted. Why is it not? You see, there was this guy called Onan who was in a levirate marriage and it allowed him to have sex with his deceased brother&#039;s wife until she got pregnant. But every single time he pulled out just so that he could always fuck someone if were he to become horny. Also, he pulled out for another reason. So that he would not have to give what he inverited from his deceased brother to the child. This way he could have two things: sex with a woman who didn&#039;t even like him whenever he wanted and a lot of fortune that he otherwise he would have needed to share with a child and its mother.<br><br>Onan&#039;s sin was that he pulled out so that according to the law a woman would need to become his bitch and he would inherit a lot of money, which this way he did. That&#039;s why the spilling of seed is forbidden. On another note, even Maimonides allowes one to relief their sexual desires, but masturbating without being horny first is a sin. So being a coomer and looking at porn is a sin, but jerking off just because one can&#039;t think about anything else but sex is okay.

I feel it with many people, though I see is sheltered or shunned in / by many as well. Every time I share my love, people seem to absorb it, but when I try to describe my beliefs - it gets a little difficult to keep people on board. That is fine, we&#039;re all on different levels here. I feel as if the duality can be made whole through us, all the aspects, the ends of the spectrum can collide, of chaos and peace, I feel it all balancing through us as beings.

I believe that Judaism as a religion is cool as fuck but most Jews belong to Rabbinical Judaism which I do hate a lot. Most of the rabbis and baal shem tovs (healers and such) would stab their community in the back if given enough in exchange for that. There was this guy who was a baal shem ra (master of the bad name). It was believed that a bad spirit got attached to him and he tried to exorcise it, but the spirit told him that, &quot;rabbi, there&#039;s no need to be afraid of me, truth comes through my wicked hands&quot;. and things like that. This guy, the baal shem ra, believed the same, that most rabbis and most baal shem tovs are frauds and if given enough money, they would harm the people who follow them.<br>I also tend to dislike the ultra-orthodox because they are quite the opposite of what a Jew should do in this life. They tend to think lowly of non-Jews and shit on converts. I mean, Moses was a convert too and so was the most known rabbi, Akiva and so was Onkelos, whose Targum (Torah translated into another language) is still studied today. So yeah, I tend to dislike those who follow their rabbis blindly and do hate those rabbis who only bring their followers down rather than lifting them up, but think of Non-rabbinical Judaism as a cool thing. Not that I don&#039;t study the writings of rabbis, but don&#039;t follow them blindly.<br><br>Cont.", "time": 1670970257, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33600693, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:25:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33600687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33600687</a><br>There were two monks washing their cloths in a river.

I read an indian account of the gods and their vimanas and they said that their craft were powered by the very spirit of the universe itself. Now I dont know what spirit they could be alluding too, but with modern context it feels like they&#039;re talking about some sort of electrical power source, independent of the craft itself. Another myth that piqued my interest was that of the men who flew without wings. They were said to hover or levitate in place because their bodies could somehow access/use the energy of the universe itself. I&#039;m completely lost as to what it means.

Turned out some sex offender was the only one with access to the house at the time and it had been empty ever since.

I had one arm under me buried and was getting it free when I felt dread and started yelling for help. I took a deep breath and smelled strong piss and figured it was a coyote pissing tree and needed to GTFO. I hugged the tree and pushed myself up enough to get one leg above the snow so it had a new air source. That&#039;s when I felt a hand or maybe two wrap around my leg like you would hold binoculars so much strength was in the grip I bruised that day from. After I got smashed in the face with snow and wiped it out. I noticed half the tree snow was gone as it fell on me and around me. The snow that smashed me in the face was from 4 feet above that and you could see a swipe in the snow like fingers dragged across it.

Its like going from having a wire for a nerve/muscle, to a fiber optic telepathic sensory organic vessel.<br>Its truly profound and wonderful. You can initiate yourself through rigorous yogic practice to rouse the kundalini energy, and tantric deity visualization or raja yoga on the forms of the chakras.<br>But really all you have to do is follow the will of your soul and spirit, and let god/goddess make love with each other within yourself and be the angel witness of creation coming to fruition.", "time": 1670903808, "resto": 33592835}, {"no": 33596169, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)02:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33592835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33592835</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Valentinian Gnostic Christians had five sacraments</span><br><br>Yes, Valentinian &quot;Gnostics&quot; are bestial Catholics.

People complimented me for my strong sense of justice, but I felt guilty about it, as I knew I really did it because the pain and emotions involved fulfilled me, and not because I actually cared whether or not it was &quot;right&quot;.

I first became aware of my higher self two years ago; most likely it was triggered by the reunion with someone I haunted in a past life (now my ex). In the culmination of the incident where I devoured everything I deemed negative within him (after which he broke down as he realised how delusional he&#039;d been), it was as though leaving my vessel: my physical body lost consciousness, and I was an enormous chaotic black blob with hints of red, seeping into every crevice of his soul, swallowing his negative energy, upon which it was immediately made unrecognisable by the unrelenting cataclysm within me, simply becoming a part of it. I understood that this is my true form, and for some reason, it didn&#039;t really bother me, and I didn&#039;t stop to think about what it means until now.<br><br>Yesterday I confronted my higher self, or perhaps vice versa. I realised that the aforementioned blob is just the aura (almost completely opaque), and deep within it is what resembles a person. This person was frantic, and although he/she only screeched and snarled rather than speaking with words, I understood the cause of his/her dismay: &quot;Lilith is trying to take the pain away. I don&#039;t know how to stop her.&quot; That person, that is to say &quot;I&quot;, looked so utterly defeated over this, that I began to cry, knowing that even if I hugged myself, that would just be belittling.<br><br>How did it end up like this?

As such, I&#039;m dependent on his attention and frequent reminders of his appreciation for my mental stability.

I have extensive backcountry exposure, even did a stint as a big game guide in a remote backcountry camp. On this day we enjoyed the fishing and settled in for the night.<br><br>I pulled out my pan and stoked up a nice fire. It was clear and cool as the sun faded into the western slopes. We cooked up some fresh rainbows with garlic and butter and filled our stomachs. I leaned back against the cooler after pulling out a refreshing beverage. The boy was soon asleep by the fire as it had been a busy day. I sipped my beer and watched the moon light bouncing off the little waves in the lake. There was still a light glow on the western horizon where the sun had gone down and I could see the outline of the mountain peaks towering over the little lake. I slowly faded off to sleep with the sound of the lake waves gently lapping on the rocks.<br><br>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, the lantern was out too. The moon was gone and it was pitch black. Something was wrong. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. I was paralyzed. I could hear my heart thumping as I strained to hear something in the bush, all was quiet. I had a horrible uneasy feeling. I gathered myself together and started kicking around the fire, a small flame came alive and I quickly threw on some wood. In the firelight I could see that the boy had awoke and was shocked to see his wide open eyes staring at me. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing, go climb in the tent.&quot; I lied. He crawled into the tent but even in the light of fire I couldn&#039;t shake my wariness.

I finally instructed the boy to wake up and go get in the truck. I packed up all of camp and drove around to the other side of the lake and slept with him in the truck. At dawn I got up and looked across the lake where we were camped earlier, and another uneasy feeling came over me. I decided it was time to go home.

Hades is \u201cSheol\u201d in Hebrew. Adamites have an eternal spirit so when they die, their bodies decay but their spirits abide in Hades/Sheol awaiting Christ\u2019s second coming. Peter explained that Hades is where Christ visited the \u201cspirits in prison\u201d during the three days between His death and resurrection when He preached the gospel \u201calso to them that are dead.\u201d<br>Here we see that an Adamite can turn to Christ after death, which is entirely opposite to the teachings of most modern churches. Christ states in Revelation that He will \u201cdestroy Hades and Death,\u201d and all Adamite spirits will be released and return to Him in heaven. There will no longer be death for Adamites. It\u2019s as simple and cut and dry as that.<br>There is no \u201chell.\u201d<br><br>So where do the other two terms fit into this? Gehenna is a compound Hebrew word. It refers to the \u201cvalley of Hinnom,\u201d the wicked place where in Jeremiah\u2019s time the Israelites sacrificed their children as burnt offerings to Baal.<br>When Christ used the word Gehenna, He was referring allegorically to the fiery trials in this life. This includes the chastisement Yahweh visits on the Israelites when they stray. As in the literal Gehenna, one\u2019s body may be allegorically burned during these fiery trials.<br>One\u2019s body may be punished or even destroyed in this life.

Their fate is then outlined: \u201cThese [goat nations] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous [sheep nations] into eternal life.\u201d Here \u201ceternal punishment\u201d should be translated as \u201clake of fire.\u201d This means they cease to exist completely and forever.<br><br>Churches teach that you could spend eternity in hell if you don\u2019t obey your priest and attend church.

Since Adamites have eternal life, Yahweh has good reason for punishing and chastising them in this life.

Gradually become disoriented, then a sensation of terror, I was surrounded by this force that seemed far more powerful than me, I felt like I was submerged in a sea of limbs, reaching through me, rummaging around in my head. Other shit where I would be trying to sleep and feel long limbs extending down from the sky, reaching through my skull. I would only feel some measure of what I suppose I&#039;d call safety, going to the basement and sitting on cement. Near the woodstove, as it would happen. For many years I felt threatened by vertical lines. A stove pipe, a broom leaning up in the corner, a string hanging from the ceiling. Circles as well, felt like I was looking at a ring but also inside of it. I remember building a framework for common memory between states. I created a river Lethe and a wonderland of sorts, using fragmentation and modularity. Lot of dreams, numbers, names.<br><br>Etc. This is just one small aspect. Experienced switching and all manner of other oddities. I was either set up, maimed, and pushed into, or simply made use of these internal systems and expanded them later.

After leaving the hospital I just had the idea I was a shaman and told my mother things about her mother that she never told me.

Between the fire of the blood in our hearts against the ice of cold reason. The World Ice Theory speaks to those humans to whom the christian guilt idea aswell the idea of pure expedience is alien. This breed of men opposes nature with strenght, never avoids it neither through the forced shame of asceticism and humility nor through soley sensual gratifications of the moment. It posesses all the superiority of the nordic character. It looks with fresh, lively and couragous eyes into the heart forbidding experiences of a dramatic nature. Hidden behind this taciturn and unbending features there is a secret existence of true human. A wonderful toughness of healthy life resistance. A true kindness and always faithful comradeship of strong-willed men. They are polar people who feel comfortable under the ancient nordic law of fate. Bold, not tired. Intact, never chatty. Resoloute and wise. Self-assuard and audacious characters who are facing the dangers and tests of sacrifice. Upright, insurred dramatic beings who&#039;s heart is adventourus and steel.
