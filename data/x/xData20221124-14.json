They were shapeshifters and could appear to you as &quot;mom&quot; or a &quot;friend&quot; whatever they could do to lure you out. Perhaps this dream was a warning.

At first I&#039;d stick my left hand in them and pump disruptive energy inside, then reabsorb their disrupted energy with my right hand to create a circuit, until they were gone. Well, eventually I dealt with one who was able to reflect some of the energy, and soon I could no longer feel my left arm - not even physically. So I tried using my left wing instead (astrally), but then I could no longer feel that either. I focused and was able to regenerate those using the energy I drained, upon which I got the sensation in my arm back. Noting that a destructive approach backfired, I instead expressed my sympathy for it, and recontextualised my animosity as a desire to become one, upon which it slowly and peacefully melted away into me.<br><br>It definitely freaked me out a bit not to feel my arm, at first. On the other hand, I began to feel less attached to my humanity. So when I could no longer contain my hatred towards my ex, this culminated in me turning into an amorphous blob in astral projection, entering his soul, and devouring everything I despised about him. Despite how disgusted I was with him, I did so with the intent to help: I wanted him to become a good person. When I spoke with him a few hours later, he started rambling that he realised what a horrible mistake he&#039;d made and that &quot;the Gods&quot; hate him, then cut contact with me and every mutual contact between us.

At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth &#039;as if they all burned&#039; and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke.

It&#039;s windy, but dead silent. Trees are moving in the wind, but I hear and feel nothing. One shape among the trees sticks out because it is motionless. I look at it. It&#039;s shaped like a human. Slender, roughly 15 feet tall, standing maybe 100 feet away. It&#039;s facing me, I feel it staring.
