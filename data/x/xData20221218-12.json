No- most people do not walk around every single day feeling like a zombie or questioning if the universe around them is the real universe, or what it even means to be &quot;real.&quot; It&#039;s okay to feel this way though, you&#039;re not a shizophrenic and you&#039;re not going crazy. <br>Step two is to start figuring out why you feel whatever way you feel. Stop focusing on why things don&#039;t feel real- ignore that feeling for a while and just focus on things. Are you unhappy with yourself, your life, your friends, your family? <br>Odds are you&#039;re not gonna like what you find. These kinds of feelings tend to come about when you don&#039;t want to accept whatever is making you upset - maybe you feel at fault for your own misery, maybe you feel like whatever is making you upset makes you a bad person, or maybe you don&#039;t want to give up whatever is ruining you. This is where step three comes in: accept the buried feelings you find. That doesn&#039;t mean you have to act on them or give in to them, but it means you need to accept them as a part of who you are / how you feel about life. No matter how irrational, whatever making you miserable isn&#039;t gonna stop just because you think it&#039;s stupid/degenerate/fake/whatever. If you need to change your lifestyle, distance yourself from people, or seek help with coping with or suppressing these feelings then do all of those things. Don&#039;t ignore it though. Be open-minded to different solutions, but don&#039;t let others tell you who you are. <br>Anon, whatever is hurting you, whoever you really are deep down, or whatever you&#039;re struggling with, things will get better. You can make them better. You deserve to be happy, you deserve the chance to make things right as best you can, and I know if you push yourself things someday will be better.", "filename": "deyiqly-b70e9e33-073f-4aed-92cb-705f049b0f29", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1165, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671327912175146, "time": 1671327912, "md5": "dLz8wLE0sVsnYsWX4A/NRw==", "fsize": 1336559, "resto": 33629044}, {"no": 33629830, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)20:46:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33629658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33629658</a><br>I just tried this for the first time and it does have an effect.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling.

The flows of this metal in and out of the core, and around it (through convective processes), generates a magnetic field.<br><br>(2) The Coriolis effect and the combined magnetic and electrical generation of these processes keep the movement (very) roughly circular around the axis of rotation. If it was driven solely by convection and the Coriolis effect it would remain very stable for a long time, but the effect of powerful local magnetic fields and electric currents is able to disrupt this circular flow. If this flow is disrupted in one place, it is likely to disrupt in other places, leading to a complete destabilization of flow around the core-mantle boundary. Thus, the field collapses (no more circular flow). However, convection means the process starts up again, possibly in a different direction, possibly in the same direction.<br>(3) There&#039;s plenty of geological evidence to show that pole reversals can occur very quickly, and that on average they take 100-150 years to complete.

We are currently passing through the galactic midplane (an electromagnetic plane created by the supermassive star/black hole cluster at the center of the galaxy) which carries a substantial load of interstellar dust. This dust is not conjecture, it is here, and astronomists have been reporting it for about a year now. <br><br>The sun is essentially a large nuclear fire. What happens what you throw a bunch of very cold, flammable dust on a fire? I&#039;ve had bonfires at -40, and I&#039;ll tell you: first the fire dampens, then the fire gets much bigger than before and very quickly. The same would occur if you were to bombard the sun with a high amount of cosmic dust - the outer shell would cool, the sun would dim, and then the built up energy in the interior would catch up, the shell would warm up enough, and a &quot;small&quot; explosion would occur in which the outer shell of the sun is cast off. <br><br>There are two things to note here:<br>First, we have observed that the two nearest stellar neighbors to pass through the midplane ahead of us flared. They didn&#039;t flare bright enough to call it a super nova, but they flared too much to write it off as a random event or error. They flared in sequence, relative to the time they entered the galactic midplane.<br><br>Second: If the outer shell of the sun were to cool, the sun would dim. It may dim so much that the sun itself would turn dark red, possibly even black, dark enough that you could look directly at the sun. Instead of the normal luminescent star you would see a dark circle halo&#039;d by the dust particles and field interaction lines created by the powerful electromagnetic interactions of the sun.<br><br>In short, the Black Sun is most likely an ancient symbol from the last time this happened.", "time": 1671137327, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614388</a><br>Nahhhh.

There is not much error in when this happens - we&#039;re doing it right now.<br><br>As for the crustal displacement theory: the crust is essentially held in place on the mantle by a combination of friction with the partially solid upper mantle and weak electric forces. Solar energy input through the solar-terrestrial magnetic electric circuit can heat up the upper mantle and disrupt these forces, causing the crust to locally displace (pretty much every earthquake over 6.0 is associated with space weather energy inputs). A large enough solar energy input (from a micronova, perhaps) theoretically can liquefy the entire upper mantle and cause the entire crust to detach. Then what happens?

Heavy jupiter theme in this chart: lots of planets in jupiter&#039;s sign sag but even mars, ruler of the ascendant, is in jupiter&#039;s sign of pisces. Jupiter trines both the ascendant and ascendant ruler. Moon and jupiter swap sign rulerships, meaning there is more harmony there than is seen by the aspects of the chart. Extremely heavy jupiter influence. That jupiter is in the 8th house which is tricky to interpret so I&#039;ll just give some key words: death, sex, rebirth, inheritance, secrets, other people&#039;s things, occultism, transformation. Using whole signs instead of Placidus it would be in the 9th house of higher education and focus. Anything involving this jupiter will have a massive effect so look out for planets transiting over it.<br><br>Your moon is in a T-square with mars and saturn, bringing stress and pain to emotional life, the mind, memories, and such. The T-square brings tension which is released opposite the midpoint, in this case the 10th house.

That&#039;s good, however there is difficult aspects to mars and saturn, so to use this good mercury you might have to work with those other planet&#039;s challenges. Jupiter is looking good as well in it&#039;s own sign somewhat near the moon in the 7th house of relationships. These mercury and jupiter placements are good for finances and love. Venus is in cancer, sign of the moon, and the moon being with Jupiter looks good for this venus. Can&#039;t see too many problems except for this Saturn-Mars thing, and Saturn in the 10th might not be so great for career, but yet again it&#039;s in Jupiter&#039;s sign and Mars is in Mercury&#039;s sign so maybe it all evens out.

I don&#039;t know what happened that day myself but QRD is I forced myself to go to school stressed, famished and exhausted, at some point I got dizzy but I was like it&#039;s nothing carry on, and after getting embarrassed in front of the class by the teacher I was unable to stop my mind from replaying this event and I collapsed an hour later. Through this day and months before this event I was beating myself up constantly for not being accepted or normal like my classmates. What devastated me is my failure since I up to this point I was trying to work hard, do pushups every day and already was keeping a nofap streak an coldshowers for months, trying to be a good student and constantly feeling like shit despite being full of power and energy since I could not release it or get approval or feel happy. I pushed myself and bad talked myself for not working hard enough and despite giving my all and beyond I never gained recognition and was treated like shit. The day I collapsed I was never the same and I noticed I felt physically weak, power and depth in my voice was gone, my body was shaking internally as if in fear, working out or even listening to music became too stressful and I suffered through this state for two years. I was unable to smile, enjoy anything or do anything. Just existing every day became physically unbearable but I acted normal and never told anyone. At first I thought it was because I was famished and tired, later I thought it might be anxiety but I beat anxiety months ago ever since I started nofap, coldshower and pushups. It might have been that my nerves got fucked because two years later I stoped existing in this state after listening to healing binurals for a couple of months.

With each cycle, the image becomes more vivid, until eventually it begins to act of its own accord. I&#039;ve used this technique for necromancy, evocation, manifestation, meditation, and as a kind of prayer, bringing the spirit of earthy, yielding voluptuousness closer towards me.

Modern psychiatry is filled to the brim with abhorrently arrogant, perpetually pompous, obviously opinionated, hubristic hacks who have no understanding of metaphysics and therefore default to epistimological or materialistic explanations of something which is essentially caused by things incorporeal and ontological in nature. You can&#039;t point to anything physical in the world and say &quot;that is my mind&quot; because it doesn&#039;t even exist on this plane of reality.

It seems whoever\u2019s posting them sees fungi as their enemy, and their agenda seems to be the complete separation of man and fungi. But let\u2019s review some basic points:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fungi are an integral part of nature, vital for nutrient recycling within the soil. They are the bridge between death and new life in many ecosystems. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many fungi are at the root of ancient and modern medicines, used to cure everything from infections to cancer. Penicillin alone has helped save countless lives in the past century. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fungi are at the heart of human culture and food. The bread and wine of Jesus are yeasted foods. The holy cacao of the Mesoamericans and the coffee of the Sufis are also products that have undergone fermentation in order to fully harness their mystic properties. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ergot and Psilocybin mushrooms are prehistoric mind openers, which likely facilitated man\u2019s journey towards spirituality. They enable ordinary people to briefly see as the mystics see, and have helped countless people open their eyes to the divine nature of existence. </span><br>Now I\u2019m not saying that all fungus is good. People do die or suffer from fungal infections, and there are many mushrooms that are deadly if consumed. But we can say the same about any natural phenomena. They aren\u2019t wholly good or evil, they are a part of nature, the same divine nature which humans sprung from, and which modernity increasingly separates us from. So I\u2019m incredibly sceptical of anyone who insists that it is a good thing to purge this from our bodies. In recent years we have come to understand just how vital our gut bacteria is, not just for our digestion, but for our whole body and brain function as well. Perhaps one day we will find out the same thing about the fungus.

I woke up after 4 hours of dreamless sleeping. I was then awake for another 4 hours. I had drunk a single can of coke to try to keep me awake, but I was feeling very tired and decided to go take a nap, as in not falling fully asleep and being in a state that&#039;s in between (I basically just think or have dreams in which I am dissociated and I see all as something out of my control, so it isn&#039;t lucid dreaming either).<br>I then had a dream in which I saw myself getting into a very old, ruined dark house, with a North American style (wooden outer walls and stuff, had a 1950&#039;s feel). I find a pristine, fresh out of the shop jug of bleach on the floor to the entrance and I pick it up. I then enter the house and get to the kitchen. I stand near the kitchen sink and begin using the bleach to clean some piece of clothing, can&#039;t remember which. I then look at the window in front of the sink, and reflected on it I see myself. On my t-shirt, I see pic related printed on it. I instantly begin to hear a very loud screech, I feel the most intense fear ever and my body begins to paralyze in real life (like I said, I am not properly sleeping and I can do stuff like move my toes and legs if they feel a bit uncomfortable). As the screech plays, the face stays motionless. I struggle to open my eyelids, but I eventually do it and regain control.

Don&#039;t like it? Seethe harder chuddies.<br>Tulpas are real, but that probably doesn&#039;t surprise you since you schizo retards think every fucking paranormal phenomenon is real. What might actually surprise you is this: Tulpas aren&#039;t paranormal. They&#039;re natural and mundane, and here&#039;s how they work.<br>Everything you think about is an actual physical process in your brain. Just because it&#039;s imaginary doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not real. It has substance and matter to it: specifically, your brain matter. The same matter that sustains your consciousness and defines your personality. If you think your mind itself is real, surely everything you imagine is at least somewhat real; after all, the simulation you conjure runs on the same wetware as your mind.<br>Notice I said &quot;at least somewhat real.&quot; How real something you imagine is, is something you can control. Not in some stupid manifest destiny or new-age quantum-manifest-destiny shit sense; no, imagining something can never magically manifest it outside your brain, except through the vector that is your deliberate and mechanical action to realize it. Rather, what you imagine is a simulation. The harder you think about it, the more neurological resources you allocate to the simulation. If you allocate enough, it may run at very high precision and detail. It&#039;s possible to even get it to run with greater reality than your very mind itself, but to do this you have to cannibalize your mind for resources.<br>Now suppose what you&#039;re imagining is another mind. Imagine you have a second mind. Talk to it. Now put lots of effort into thinking about what it would say back. Think about it as hard as you can. Really put yourself in that other mind&#039;s shoes.

It takes a lot of repetition or a very strong stimulus for a tulpa to achieve independent will. On the strong stimulus side we have things like trauma that can sometimes fracture a person&#039;s mind and create a tulpa to protect them. There are two variants of this: repressed memories or split personality, depending on whether the tulpa assumes complete or only partial control.

I will not go into detail on how I understand speech thinking to be staccato like, quantised in nature, opposite to dream non-speech spacial (to a certain point when it is not even spacial any more) mind, that is continuous, suffuce to say that they are to me. <br><br>So with these observations I came to a conclusion that he is describing phenomena from a valid, actually practical something, that he might have not fully understood, or didn&#039;t even think about as such, but nevertheless, somehow described.<br><br>And I was just interested in ideas that other people have about phenomena described in his books, people with experience in both what he described and other working systems.

I just came to a conclusion and belief that for me it, and also non-verbal awake dreaming states (I don&#039;t know how to better describe them without explaining a lot of other idiosyncratic stuff), are an axis of methodology used in raja yoga, ritual, and just accessing that particular state of mind that makes things (magick, attainment, contact) possible.<br><br>If we&#039;re talking about asana in raja yoga, I perceive it to be stillness of the body that achieves a very specific spacial feeling of the body. Same with pranayama, which (the way I understand it) joins asana in this spaciality as asana-in-motion. Pratyahara (also the way I understand it) is not absence of thoughts, but absence of identifying state of mind, and presence of mind that observes, but doesn&#039;t identify that which is observed. It is a prerequisite for dreaming (for any person every night), and both (pratyahara and dreaming) are much more easily achieved in the spacial awareness, thus proper asana and pranayama lead to pratyahara. Dharana is also much easier in the spacial awareness, because spacial perception doesn&#039;t require you to identify that place that you focus on, thus stilling attention is achieved much more easily.<br><br>Like I wrote earlier non-verbal (in a broad sense, as in a non-identifying) state is necessary to fall asleep at night and has a continuous nature (as opposed to interruptive identification of verbal state of mind), thus it makes continuous dharana (which, the way I understand it, in continuation becomes dhyana) possible. And if it is continuous for long enough becomes self-sustaining samadhi,which changes a human being.<br><br>Well, at least that&#039;s my idiosyncratic reasoning, conjectures and understating. <br><br>With this logic every human being experiences yoga and possibly samadhi every night.", "time": 1671291515, "resto": 33622372}, {"no": 33626470, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:38:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33626351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33626351</a><br>what kinda scrapings?", "filename": "relevant", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 391, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1671291534713301, "time": 1671291534, "md5": "qX3Xib4Fb4dkbAYYzj31hw==", "fsize": 43690, "resto": 33622372}, {"no": 33626474, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:39:20", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<a href=\"#p33626467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33626467</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It came to me in a dream.</span><br>Cool.<br><br><a href=\"#p33626461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33626461</a><br>Anon you want the nobody thread.", "time": 1671291560, "resto": 33622372, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 33626477, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)10:39:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33626474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33626474</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nobody thread</span><br>So they killed me basically?

They silence their mind throughout their waking life. Absolutely no internal dialogue whatsoever. One finds that it&#039;s actually possible. They compare those who are adept with it to enlightened people which are low level for them.<br>- Recapitulation. By imagining every memory we have of a person, breathing in, turning to the right, exhaling to the left, then turning the head right to left again with no breathing we regain energy those memories suck in and we lessen attachment to this world thus silencing the mind even more.<br>- Darkroom Practice. For beginners and intermediates they practice forcing silence three hours a day, stare at pitch black darkness, look for puffs (yes, those colorful things you see in the darkness), play with them, do Tensegrity (their yoga with every movement having different functions but its mostly to build an energy body that can navigate other worlds), and maybe meet entities and see other worlds in said puffs.

When i did that, i had a brief but intense vision which only lasted about a second or two. What I saw was in both first person and third person at the same time. I was up in the sky holding onto the outside of a craft or building of some sort. The way i looked was much bigger than how I look in real life. My face looked very different but i know it was me that i was seeing. I looked fierce, almost scary. I was really buff and stock and strong looking. I looked very large, probably like seven or eight feet tall if i had to guess. I remember that i was wearing a dark blue jacket. I think it might have been a uniform. A uniform for what, i don&#039;t know. Everything was crystal clear and very vibrant and had a depth, or thickness to it. The visuals of the entire experience were amazing but maybe visuals is the wrong word. It was beyond what i could ever see with my eyes in my human body. To say it looked otherworldly would be an understatement. It looked like what I imagine the graphics of the Playstation 45 might look like some day.", "time": 1671311882, "resto": 33627780}, {"no": 33628173, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)16:18:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33627780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33627780</a><br><a href=\"#p33628168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33628168</a><br>2/2<br>In this vision, i looked down and i saw the earth from way up in the sky, i think i was in space, or near the boundary of space.

It&#039;s like everything i was seeing was the culmination of what everything had been throughout all of time, me included. I was able to see myself and all around me at the same time. Then, my consciousness was sucked back down into my body and i was back on my couch laying on the side of my body that i flipped over to. I think i may have seen myself in a higher dimension or what some call beyond the veil. I honestly don&#039;t know what i experienced that day.

It is a slower form of thinking that reinforces ego and linear thought spirals. It is like the difference between communicating through language vs. communicating through telepathy, except when you subvocalize you are just putting an unnecessary constraint on the communication and information transfer happening within your own mind. <br><br>People who do not subvocalize are thinking spatio-visually like <a href=\"#p33622728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33622728</a> mentioned, which is general &quot;faster&quot; and promotes lateral thinking. This style of thinking is superior imo but taken to the extreme it looks closer to schizophrenia. Notice how schizophrenics struggle to maintain a fixed identity? This is because they have no monologue reinforcing their ego. There are obviously more reasons but that is a big reason for developing schizophrenia imo.<br><br>Neither way of thinking is more correct, and an ego is not necessarily a bad thing, without ego we would have no reason to eat or piss or do anything necessary for basic survival. That said, people should be able to just switch between either mode of thinking. I am always surprised when people present this as a binary option. If you cannot think in either mode at will, it is probably because you have reinforced one way at the expense of the other. This can be fixed by just practicing visualization or subvocalization, depending on which one you lack. It has nothing to do with someone lacking a soul or being born an NPC. Most people become confuse their inner monologue with their soul/spirit because our culture reinforces types of thinking that promote narcissism and reward egoic behavior. <br><br>You really shouldn&#039;t call anyone an NPC or imply someone lacks a soul.

I used a regular on IRC from about 1996 to 2014 or so, and in that time I saw lots of cultures thrive and fall, different servers, different channels, different people with different values coming together in different ways, all of this involves constant &#039;death&#039; and abandonment of previous cultures\\communities. Also over time the cultures\\communities often become solidified, so you have some &quot;terminally online&quot; people who tend to set themselves up as OPS or channel owners on IRC to maintain a position of social status, and get stuck there, same thing happens on discord I guess. So you actually have lots of communities that slow down to a snails pace where various individuals get &#039;stuck&#039; or become &#039;comfortable&#039; there, and then these people are essentially isolated from taking part in and creating OC in other online spaces.", "time": 1671172490, "resto": 33618011}, {"no": 33618153, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)01:39:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33618137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33618137</a><br><br>Another factor I&#039;ve observed is that porn use and posting ruined a lot of cultures on many levels.

On 4chan, porn posting ruined the NSFW boards for me, and I know it ruined them for others. The universality of porn also means you have far more people who are constantly running on low dopamine, so they have shorter attention spans, in many cases are probably posting with one hand while fapping furiously to porn with another, etc.<br><br>Commercialisation is another factor.

I told the dog to calm down and sit and when it did everyone was amazed for some odd reason. I felt like I was safe because the tall buildings were blocking most of the wind.

There was a Magi King. <br>The line of David was his birthright. <br>King Solomon. <br>The Wise. <br>While Hebrew, He was always chased on heel by his Zoroastrian heritage. He was prone to paganism, magic and the belief in The Old Gods. <br><br>Much like the tale of the two masters, whom one cannot serve fully while serving the other, He made his gravest mistake at the end of his life when He sported many temples for his wives many gods, instead of his optimus.<br> <br>He did however try to do good things. Some say the end of his life was due to this pact. <br>As it spurred the fury of demons and jinn, monsters and magic beings alike. <br>The Kings Pact. <br>A suppressionary magic that revolves around something not really magical at all. Pure logic. <br>Solomon attempted to write a seal. A seal so powerful that it would forever hold all magic at bay and prevent any future magic wielders from bringing hardship on his kingdoms or interference with their blights. <br>He would allow them to continue to exist among the realms of men, in exchange for them never being allowed to speak or see man and his image again. <br>However fate had other things in store. For that Magi King, being only a man had failed the foresight of their cunning. Thus they created ways to speak without speaking. (Written Language) and ways of seeing without seeing. (Iconography, Reflections, Descriptive Language)<br>Then they began their pursuit. Like a blind man in a cave with echo location. Monsters anon. Have never been known for complacency. Thus. The Kings Pact rings true throughout today. Even in the modern era. However it is faster now. The tool wielded against them has now become their weapon. <br>Musica. Mathematic.

Are any people here into philosophy besides the weird schizoconspiracy shit? I had some mystical insights reading philosophy myself.<br><br>At the start of philosophy was Plato, who believed in two realsm. There is the everyday realm, of bodies and objects which whither away, and then there is the timeless realm of the Ideas, which the trained philosopher can percieve with his mind&#039;s eye; one can compare this to a third eye of some sorts.<br><br>Deleuze believed philosophers created concepts out of the plane of immanence; a sort of undivided &quot;field&quot; of energies, forces, flows, without humans, without subjects, without consciousness. Life, death, and all dualities and dialectical relationships are non-existent on this plane.<br><br>Then Schopenhauer. He literally believed that the reality of individual objects in time and space; what he called &quot;the world as representation&quot;; is an illusion; all that exists is the fundamental unity of the Will. You are Will, I am Will, there are no humans, there aren&#039;t even beings. This is simply the veil of the Will covering your eyes.<br><br>Then Derrida, who believed that language is a completely empty system; that the idea of another person having written this message is an illusion stemming from a belief in &quot;logocentrism&quot;.<br><br>Berkeley thought all of reality is subjective idas; the only thing binding it together is the universal observer: God.<br><br>So, anyone into philosophy?

As we grow older we learn the &#039;rules&#039; of the real world and subconsciously apply them to our creativity, which constrains it. For example a child can think of the wildest random shit that doesn&#039;t make any sense and doesn&#039;t follow real world situations or intuitions, but it&#039;s much harder as an adult. This isn&#039;t particularly a bad thing, since applying rules to creativity allows us to try and predict the future and apply creativity in a pragmatic sense. However, we must learn to turn off those rules or selectively only apply the ones that are useful.

Like an example or</span><br>As of yet the Religion of Creativity is only a dream. However I can give insight into the fundamental process of human creativity.<br>Human consciousness is an evolutionary process where question, choice, and action correspond to mutation, selection, and reproduction in biological evolution. A question is a request for information, our entire sense-experience is the result of a request for information by our nervous system, and constantly mutates our consciousness. We can also actively mutate our consciousness by asking questions of our experiences, actions, choices, and ideas, and follow the resulting lines of inquiry to apprehend new possibilities previously beyond our immediate reach. From there, the selective mechanism of choice eliminates possibilities until one option is chosen to be expressed as an action.<br><br>There are two unhealthy versions of this process. In one, choice is favored at the expense of questioning, resulting in a progressive whittling-down of variation until stagnation is reached - this process is all selection with minimal mutation. Also one can start with a desired answer, and ask questions about how to confirm it - this is the method of confirmation bias. The healthy process must start by questioning experience.<br><br>The implication of this is to promote freedom, promote inquiry. Seek The Unknown, among the most profound experiences of which is wonder. The world is filled with endless opportunities for wonder, but to find them requires a conscious effort to shake-up your routines and get out of your comfort zone. Perhaps understanding the supreme importance of questioning and seeking The Unknown for your freedom could motivate you. Wonder is the carrot, the stick is the risk of being enslaved by your own stagnant thoughts and habits, or the stagnant thoughts and habits of others.", "time": 1671183424, "resto": 33606325}, {"no": 33618869, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:56:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What about us, stuck here in 4chan?

Creativity is a way of looking that is outside of language, thoughts, concepts, time etc. you simply look. Everything becomes strange and new with each moment. That is the state of presence Eckhart Tolle speaks of, the thoughtless place of awareness where you simply perceive what is, including thoughts and visions, without getting sucked into them, but keeping your distance, aware that you are aware. In that way you see things you have no words or concepts for everywhere you look and the only way to know them is to know them outside of any structure the mind can conceive of. It&#039;s from this place that a structure can generate to point at what generated it, though it is not it itself, and is perishable.<br><a href=\"#p33618295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33618295</a><br>Tolle mentioned the way a child sees in a video I saw. Eyes wide like dinner plates. They look at everything and anything and it is all new and strange and awesome in the true sense.

I had found an old forum dedicated to world of darkness (the franchise that vampire the masquerade is a part of), and I was giving it my preliminary examination. Or more simply, I was trying to find who I&#039;d troll, and what I should ask them. I found a profile of some dipshit who displayed a ton of his personal information, even had his phone number and PO box up, and this gave me an idea. I should mention that whenever I do make calls, I usually use the ancient landline in my home. I do have a cellular phone, but I try and only use it for my family and close friends. I wrote down the number, and I went into the guest bedroom, where the landline was for whatever reason. I felt my hands start shaking as I started dialing the number, the excitement of prank calling was making me jumpy.<br><br>The phone rang for a minute or two, and just as I was about to give up and hang up someone picked up. &quot;I told you not to fuckin&#039; call back here.&quot; It was a gruff, older man&#039;s voice, and were it not for his words, I wouldn&#039;t have known he was angry, his tone was very stoic and unemotive. &quot;You fucking whore, fucking die.&quot; I hardly got the chance to come up with a witty rebuttal or try and fuck with the guy before the call ended.

sometimes exaggerated tales of pagan orgy). people guided their ships this way. saturn is the master of this realm, the one who turns the millstone going around the polestar. he governs time, rising

Learning to love yourself can be hard when you have not been loved very much, but it&#039;s important. In the end you are the one person who can never leave you.

Some of it is psychological and some of it just RNG manipulation into causing the intended thing to happen at a much higher rate than it should. It&#039;s also why some people always seem to get their way and then others just attract increasingly bad luck and sitcom tier bad situations.<br>You probably have a powerful intuition or imprint on the world and thus why you keep having strange coincidences.

Richard Tomlinson told me quite extensively about his dream of an &#039;ideal all-male society&#039;. However, his Master was Prince Philip and the Royal Family, so one can say that this particular &#039;dream&#039; originated in this sickest of all families. The incredibly sick and hetero-hostile Sat B&#039;hai Illuminati cult and the Royal Family have already started to create prototypes within the current UK population. Tomlinson was of the opinion that eventually the Illuminati cult would create a society of men who had wombs, to run their ideal &#039;Lord of the Flies&#039; warrior cult society of the Templars. Women would have already been eliminated. They didn&#039;t have the technology to actually create female human eggs from scratch (they had tried but failed), but could easily clone the large banks of female eggs at their disposal - therefore, this wasn&#039;t a problem. They now had enough eggs and enough technology to keep on cloning these eggs, to be then transplanted to the male womb. For some reason, the Illuminati scientists had found that it was far better for the child to grow in a manufactured male womb than from a test-tube basis, and they had managed to genetically engineer men with these wombs but not vaginas...hence the need for Caesarians. What is worse, is that Tomlinson then admitted that his own erstwhile son - Orlando Bloom - actually has one of these wombs - one of the earliest prototypes that was successful - whether the guy knows it &#039;consciously&#039; or not - I am sure that this is true. Tomlinson was matter-of-fact about it all - only a matter of time before they would take over. The whole project was already underway.&quot;<br>http://richardtomlinsonmi6.blogspot<wbr>.com/2006/12/richard-tomlinson-ex-m<wbr>i6-officer.html", "time": 1671247273, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33625472, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)05:36:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33620897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33620897</a><br>They perfected free energy in 1944", "time": 1671273404, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33626902, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)12:00:30", "name": "Curious", "com": "<a href=\"#p33625472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33625472</a><br>Qwhy is that scary?", "time": 1671296430, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33627113, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)12:37:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33626902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33626902</a><br>Because you&#039;re still paying for electricity, heat, natural gas, and gasoline, retarded nigger.", "time": 1671298676, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33627168, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)12:47:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33621544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33621544</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STREETS LIKE A JUNGLE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SO CALL THE POLICE</span>", "filename": "0328740958", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671299279724301, "time": 1671299279, "md5": "QbLwGMTYBCrjp/ZADPgk6Q==", "fsize": 174558, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33627994, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)15:44:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33621544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33621544</a><br>This is incredibly based if true", "time": 1671309874, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33628016, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)15:51:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33620897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33620897</a><br>Things with a too small probability will never happen in the universe due to the temporal limit.<br>In other words, magic doesn&#039;t exist", "time": 1671310277, "resto": 33620897}, {"no": 33628033, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)15:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33628016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33628016</a><br>This is a bait post.

If your attention has been drawn to seeing the same number pop up over and over and over that is God trying to get your attention to wake up. One title of Jesus Christ which appears in the Book of Daniel is &quot;Palmoni&quot; the Numberer of Secrets. 42 was the number of wanderings Israel went on in the desert before being allowed to enter into the rest of the Promised Land because of their sins. 42 was the number of generations from Abraham to Jesus. 42 is the number of months Antichrist will be given power over the whole Earth. This is detailed in both Daniel and Revelation. 42 is the number dealing with the period of trial testing and tribulation we must endure before reaching the light on the other side of the tunnel. The joke about 42 being the answer to life, the universe, and everything in that shitty british book is because the antichrist is the son of Satan, death incarnate, and because the answer to life is death. Entropy. So if you&#039;re being targeted with that number specifically it&#039;s a warning. Satan roams like a lion seeking whom he may devour and evidently has his sights on you.

Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.
