Below is a good dharma talk on compassion in relation to our relationships.

Most traditions of Buddhism will hold that you should treat the existence of those things as a working hypothesis discovered through practice. It is worth noting the ontology of those things can differ between traditions. So they may be conventionally real but not utlitamtely real and what conventionally refers to can differ. Some traditions like Tendai/Tiantai actually prefer to focus with views like iniansanqian or Japanese ichinensanzen, which means something like: \u201cOne Moment of Experience as Three Thousand Worlds\u201d that every realm is present in every other realm and and in some not ontologically existent by themselves. Some strands of Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism may hold that they are realms that exist in this realm but may hold we lack the perception because of our ignorance caused by delusion, hatred and ignorance.<br><br>I would recommend reading an academic book on Buddhism, pic related, and maybe practicing one tradition and seeing if it works and helps end your mental and physical suffering. If it does then treat other beliefs as working hypothesis. If you don&#039;t want to try that, you can always just practice mindfulness and stuff. If you want something a bit meatier than that but not actual full Buddhism, try S.N. Goenka meditation centers.

Can you provide more about when the feeling comes on? Is it inside your house or outside, at particular times, after certain activities? Also when did it start? Do you recall doing/reading/thinking about anything unusual, or going somewhere strange when this began? This can be a sigh either that you\u2019ve attracted something dangerous, or that you\u2019re glowing like a beacon to dangerous entities (ie, by stumbling on an infohazard or similar) - determining which it is, is important.
