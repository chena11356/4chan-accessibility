Anything goes, the wackier the better. I&#039;ll start us off with a theory that&#039;s super cool to me since I&#039;ve actually written a short novel on it in the past. I call it the &#039;God Above Theory&#039;. Feel free to discuss, add your own theories, and include as little or as much proof as wanted/possible!<br><br>God Above Theory: Perhaps my favorite theory as it holds a special place in my heart since I&#039;ve written sci-fi about it, this theory is that there&#039;s no such thing as &#039;God&#039;. At least not a supernatural God. Instead earth was either colonized/experimented on by a highly advanced alien society. There&#039;s many versions of this theory yet the one in my short story was as follows. Humans were created by an alien race who&#039;s leader felt the universe were too empty, unlike what /we/ like to believe that there are aliens - They actually managed to explore galaxies and found they were truly alone. So they began bioengineering races that were made to fit the planets they&#039;d be left on as safely as possible.<br><br>Humans were made for earth, and instead of the concept of a &#039;soul&#039; our brains and CNS were able to somewhat communicate with the flagship of this alien race through electrical impulse. Yet eventually the humans rebelled against our creators, and were no longer worth their time and effort. This was determined by them roughly two thousand years ago when they sent one of their own down to our world as a kind of ambassador to try to make one last attempt to reconnect with their creation. This being healed our sick, fed our hungry, and showed us the incredible technology they had which made them almost appear to walk on water. Yet out of fear this alien was killed, thus resulting in our creators cutting off all ties between us and the Flagship. Essentially making &#039;prayer&#039; pointless, because they&#039;ve abandoned their violent creation.", "filename": "theories", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 864, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668821115031098, "time": 1668821115, "md5": "irSK9uAW+WI7/oNp8vqfjw==", "fsize": 672511, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "theories-and-conspiracies", "replies": 5, "images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 33401980, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:36:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wanna say it&#039;s refreshing to see someone talk about an idea of theirs as a &quot;theory&quot; instead of coming and posting like it&#039;s an obvious and abject fact that we aren&#039;t even expected to question.

It was normal when I was a kid, but as I got older the deja vu started containing the deja vu itself. I wouldn&#039;t simply remember being someplace before, I&#039;d remember being there with deja vu. At first I thought this was just me remembering having deja vu in a similar scenario, but as I got older, it kept gaining more layers. There was no way I had been in all these exact situations countless times before each time remembering the last and all that came before. Eventually it started becoming fully recursive and it reached the point where any time I got deja vu I&#039;d end up a bit confused/disoriented and with the slightest of headaches(more like brain tickles than hurts). <br>Anyways, about two days ago I had deja vu again(it doesn&#039;t happen that often for me, maybe once every few months?) but this time was different. Aside from not getting the normal amount of recursive confusion, it also showed me what happened next...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I had a deja vu that showed me the future</span><br><br>Granted, it was no more than 10 seconds, just enough to find what I was looking for, but it was still one hell of an experience and I really want to see if I can cause it on purpose. I&#039;m sure It&#039;ll eventually happen again if I wait, but I&#039;m inpatient and this sounds like too much fun to sit on. I had always heard deja vu was just your brain processing something in two separate parts with a bit of a delay between, but maybe some of you have better theories.<br>It&#039;s weird, remembering the future is slightly more confusing than I would have expected.

The air smelled sulfuric, but it eventually dissipated. Something told me to turn on my bedroom light, so I did. As soon as the light flicked on, I saw what looked like tiny worms floating around. Everywhere I looked, I saw the worms. But when I closed my eyes, they were gone. I began quickly turning on as many lights as I could, and as soon as they were on, I saw them. They followed me out into the hallway, and into the bathroom where I locked myself for a good 30 minutes trying to figure out what was going on. No one was answering my calls, which is to be expected at 3 am. But I desperately needed help. I started to realize that no one would believe me anyway. I hyperventilated on the bathroom floor and opened the door again, and I saw this massive translucent worm that would not escape from my sight. I wanted to rip my eyes out just so I wouldn\u2019t have to see them. It was like an invasion. And I still do not know if they are supernatural beings or alien life of some sort. I will not give my exact location, but I will mention that I live somewhere that is full of mountains and wildlife and many cryptic things do happen. I batted at the air, but they would not move. I was so panicked that I eventually simply blacked out and do not remember much of what happened, but I will say that I woke up from a fetal position in the living room floor. I do not see the worm-like beings anymore, but I have been on-edge all damn day because of this. Someone please tell me I am not alone in this.

But the thing is, the best most effective state for contacting entities is in the holotropic state. Note that the word &quot;holotropic&quot; basically means &quot;moving towards wholeness.&quot; When doing psychedelics or exploring alternative states of consciousness, think of yourself as being one with the universe. The universe is an ocean of consciousness, and your are not a droplet in that ocean, you&#039;re the ocean in the droplet, you&#039;re a wave in the ocean.... It&#039;ll make more sense while high. Don&#039;t overthink it. When you&#039;re high meditate on Oneness, contemplate that the universe is like a hologram, you are in god and god is in you. You are god and the universe experiencing itself. Time doesn&#039;t exist, the only real thing is the present moment. Feel that the universe is made of love and everything is all right.<br>But I do see entities sometimes. I find its best to not worry about whether they are technically &quot;separate&quot; or not, instead focus on being curious and having fun. Talk to it and see how it responds, notice how it presents itself, or if you can modify how you perceive it. Compliment its appearance. If an entity appears hostile I tell it &quot;you&#039;d better be nice!&quot; like it&#039;s a naughty child and I have power over it. <br>Or if it seems demonic I roleplay I&#039;m like an exorcist and I have the power to send the &quot;demon&quot; to the light of heaven, or I&#039;m channeling Jesus and I forgive it for its sins. Roleplay whatever religion you like, whatever fits your beliefs. Or pretend you are at a party and you are mingling and getting to know new people. Play around instead of being analytical and reading pretentious books. Believe in your own ability to see and intuit things for yourself.<br><br><a href=\"#p33398703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33398703</a><br>No that doesn&#039;t work at all.

The most simple and effective way to connect with God and the Holy Spirit, a completely natural thing humans have been doing since our conception (which Jesus did as well), but somehow convince themselves they&#039;re &quot;better&quot; than it and go through a series of mental gymnastics before (if ever) trying it. I know people who have done drugs and heavy psychedelics (which don&#039;t work) before even bothering sitting down on their ass and just chilling out. Then there are other people who will worship the bible (or any other &quot;holy&quot; book) and obsess over scripture instead of actually practicing connecting with the holy spirit &amp; Jesus directly. Do you know how many people from (((Church))) I&#039;ve met who&#039;ve never meditated or spoken with God/Jesus?

After manwhoring with prostitutes, tinder hookups, etc I broke down one night and begged for forgiveness from God for the first time in my life. Also note that I&#039;ve been masturbating non stop to Porn since I was 15, I&#039;m in my late 20&#039;s now. I finally have seem to have broken this tormented cycle of lust for the most part. Something has just snapped in me. Right now I&#039;m in a month+ of semen retention, I&#039;m not really counting the days. I have no desire to jerk off, no desire to look at porn. I try my absolute best to avoid contact with women. I even try to avoid making eye contact with them in the street. This is especially getting difficult since the amount of attention I&#039;m getting from women (stares, opening conversations with me) has increased substantially. But at the same time it&#039;s a freeing fleeing not giving a shit about women.

It&#039;s more then just Semen Retention. I guess this is more of a question for Christians but most Christians are fakes and insufferable Judeo-Christian cuckold retards. I&#039;m having trouble grasping this new reality because my entire life I&#039;ve been a cooming vidya gaming retard that has wasted so much.
