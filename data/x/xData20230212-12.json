I met a certain man, and we could hear each other&#039;s thoughts, and couldn&#039;t tell our feelings apart. It felt like fate, and we remembered our time together in a past life, where I &quot;lovingly&quot; haunted him (although it should be noted that I was something along the lines of vengeful spirit at the time, but he fell in love with me even though I was a just ghost, and that really touched my metaphysical heart at the time). We both broke up with our partners to date each other instead. The next few weeks, I spontaneously &quot;remembered&quot; various psychic techniques, one of which was how to initiate spirit sex with a (fellow) human. At the time, I had some body issues that prevented me from enjoying sex physically, so being able to do it astrally felt very liberating, and often I&#039;d have about 12 mind-blowing orgasms even in the span of just 20 minutes when doing it with him.<br><br>But overindulging to such an extent wrecked my sacral chakra to the point that my both my physical and astral body would go numb temporarily, and I&#039;d become unresponsive. I was already feeling overwhelmed with intense bliss at that point, but even so I felt like there was room for improvement. Then I &quot;recalled&quot; that I could simply pull in the sexual energy that was overwhelming my energy body, back to where my sacral chakra is supposed to be (it was wrecked to the point that I couldn&#039;t feel it), compress it into an appropriate shape, and use the energy to simulate the chakra&#039;s functions so I could continue to feel even more pleasure.

What I meant is that people who go into it with more positive expectations will have more positive experiences. You said it yourself by mentioning that goal-oriented people see what they believe, and I mentioned it by saying &quot;like attracts like&quot;. By setting negative expectations, you&#039;re sabotaging the goal-oriented newcomers who read your posts from having a positive experience. Although your actions come from a place of wanting to warn people, you are in fact projecting your own negative experiences on them, which can only end in 3 ways:<br>1) They believe you and heed your advice and avoid having any personal experiences with sexual entities.<br>2) They partially believe you but are desperate enough to try anyway, and the fears you instilled cause them to attract a parasite and have the negative experiences you warned them about.<br>3) They conclude you&#039;re wrong and are otherwise unaffected, thus they will likely have a positive experience.<br>If you simply stayed out of it, the outcome would be similar to outcome 3, but without the &quot;need&quot; to mock you. As for me, by calling out this negative projection of yours, outcome 3 is more likely, which makes me happy as I want to more people to know the joys of spiritual sex. I may not be with an entity currently, but it permanently changed my life, and I think the world would be a better place if more people experienced it; even if not, it&#039;s also simply fun to see people post happily about their unusual experiences that I can relate to. I don&#039;t dislike you as I generally don&#039;t dislike people, but please do try to be more mindful of how you come across.

NDEs are almost always described as more real than our reality. And often people compare the reality shift to that which people experience when waking up from a dream. In other words, we know dreams are not real since, when we wake up, it is more realistic than the dream. Similarly, people who experience NDEs are often quoting as describing the reality of NDEs as so realistic that not only is the step between reality and NDE greater than the step between dream and reality, but the NDE reality is impossible to put into human language.

Break the phrase down: A conspiracy is a secret plan, often among powerful people, to do something bad. A theory is an idea. A conspiracy theory is inherently a rebellious thought. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone was making an intentional effort to feed conspiracy theorists weird shit. This would accomplish several things for conspirators of all kinds:<br><br>1. Anyone who could be defined as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; will look like a crazy person to normies. This would make it harder for conspiracy theorists to gain supporters, or even friends. They will probably even lose existing friends, though they will also gain a few friends in the conspiracy theorist world. However, the overall end result is that the conspiracy theorist becomes an outcast in society, and they can only go to other conspiracy theorists for support.<br><br>2. Anyone who gets into conspiracy theories will be fed tons of red herrings, many of which contain outrageous and fantastical things like aliens and demons and stuff. These kinds of theories will naturally be better at spreading than the legit but boring ones. Even if the true story is out there, nobody is interested in it. Aliens are much more fun to talk about.<br><br>3. Due to constantly discussing ufos and witchcraft and mind control and shit as if those were real things, a conspiracy theorist&#039;s grip on reality is likely to slip. They&#039;ll end up fitting the schizo theorist stereotype to some degree. They&#039;ll also become more fearful of the subjects of their conspiracy theories, and therefore less likely to form any actual resistance against them.

All of these have &quot;distance&#039; between them based on collective consciousness&#039; matrices which make up the world and spiritual residing beings&#039; matrices of them and their infinities, what their vibration and circuitry is like, what concepts they embody, etc. This distance shows relevance as well, closer places and races are more relatable and more compatible but not fully, further are less so. Compatibility can be changed through subversion or strong enough energy interference and is part of the agenda for a few aliens, but staying pure to your respective matrix can push out interfering entities and energies which can only sneak in as energetic and astral forms tampered with by the filter between worlds due to matrix difference.<br><br>The world and respective world matrix further is intelligently designed, or rather influenced by intelligent higher beings. They existed on a higher level and can rule over large clusters of worlds. Their existence and struggles between each other etched a conflict and struggle, and the residual energies and existences of their beings influenced worlds&#039; matrices and got filtered through them, showing as symbolic stories and seeding our spiritual and physical DNA through their influence.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

In response to your first point, Jordan Peterson is a god-awful presenter who has never heard of the concept of a &quot;theme&quot;, but he&#039;s popular because he&#039;s one of the few figures to actually try to take the Pre-1960s American-Protestant-Capitalist culture and logically justify it in a way that&#039;s more broadly disconnected from assumed religious belief. He still sucks in this way too, but he does it in a way that&#039;s better than most.<br><br>2. Jordan Peterson&#039;s framework is rooted in Carl Jung, who&#039;s work was a more psychological exploration from people such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche; the latter two who were very interested in Proto-Christian / Post-Christian Esoteric / East Asian monistic / pantheistic / panentheistic philosophy. <br><br>a. Jung believed that the reason why religions stuck around for cultural generations was because we projected our objective, human ideals into idealized figures / deities / myths, and because these human ideals are objective, the same themes / deities / ideas would repeat themselves, which he called &quot;Archetypes&quot;. Jung tried to systematize this into a secular, objective philosophy<br>b. Jung&#039;s philosophy would apply this to the field of psychology, seeing that many people had psychological problems because their objective biology / mental state was failing to live up to these ideals which we projected outwards into these religious systems<br>c. Carl Jung&#039;s ideas, while unique, originate in &quot;esoteric&quot; spiritual systems, which were well known for connecting strands of ideas across various spiritual systems, and aren&#039;t as dogmatically bound and are way more open to seeing similar concepts in other religions and connecting the dots than mainstream &quot;exoteric&quot; systems (for example, the Hermetics have no problem connecting the divine hermaphroditic Platonic deity with the Primordial Hermpahroditic Adam in Kabbalah or, Adi-Buddha in Tibetan Buddhism, Shiva-Shakti in Hinduism, the Baphomet in Satanism, etc. (see pic related)). <br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "7ba76f4aa471c4da181751fbdcdcb4d7689cddf8r1-398-576v2_hq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 398, "h": 576, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676165666768123, "time": 1676165666, "md5": "Q7oE9vsTHwSG+CWSB2KlDQ==", "fsize": 51408, "resto": 34062474}, {"no": 34063577, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)20:37:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34063525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34063525</a><br>God just gave us the power to procreate which is a very powerful thing.

It&#039;s always going to be a mystery. <br><br>And your answer is to just have faith which you know is impossible. You must know that belief doesn&#039;t work like that. As I already explained in this thread a few times. Belief isn&#039;t a choice. Like, if I&#039;m a racist. If I&#039;m racist against black people. It&#039;s not because I chose to be that way, it&#039;s because I was shown videos of black people looting an assaulting other people. It&#039;s because I was shown crime stats and well fair stats etc. And we can argue about whether those numbers are accurate or not. But the numbers are the reason for the belief. The webm&#039;s are the evidence.

This puts them into a state of shock where they witness themselves without any sense of control. This can sometimes become a permanent state of detachment, though it&#039;s probably very rare, but it can also sometimes lead to the realisation that a person is more than their thoughts, or that there is an intelligence, or identity, within them that is more than their thoughts or their body or what they see or feel. This is not to equate shock or trauma directly with a religious experience, as that&#039;s not really true, because the ongoing experience of that similar state is joyful and peaceful, but perhaps when a mind is first ripped away from the body and the ego it can result in some severe shock.<br><br>Also, entry into religious experience begins, essentially, with surrender or acceptance of what is. You let go of all that you know, think, feel, believe. This is why those who suffer find God, because they are driven to the point where they either let go or they kill themselves. This is used as an argument against religious experience, as you have done &quot;Oh well they HAD to find something or else what would they have?&quot;. But, when you are thirsty you drink.

Yet, the conjunction in his chart takes place in Cancer, which is the one sign these planets both despise.<br>Normally, I&#039;d lean towards anon being a malicious and hostile person, but one of my sources (Valens) tell me that it might be the other way around since his placements are in Cancer.<br>Firmicus states that Mars&#039;s fierceness is dulled by Saturn&#039;s coldness, while Mars &quot;heats up Saturn&#039;s chill&quot; which makes a balanced person.

You seriously think these are aliens? Let me ask you a question that hopefully is going to change your mind. What do you think is more likely: our government knows what these objects are and they belong to and were created by our governments, OR these are alien spacecrafts? Do you know how far away the nearest star is? 4.24 light years. That means it would take 4.24 years if you travelled at the SPEED OF LIGHT. Einstein proved this to be impossible for spacecraft to achieve because the mass of the spacecraft would get infinitely big as it approaches the speed of light. Imagine dragging an Eiffel tower that becomes two Eiffel towers, then four, then 80, then 16000 as you approach the speed of light. It\u2019s not possible to do this. Moreover, there is no guarantee that aliens would even be that close, meaning they could be even further away than that.

So cute! She is around the same age as L. and she sees in her her idol and a teacher. She literally follows her everywhere and tries to mimic her gestures, movement, attitudes etc. Like a little monkey lol.. Chili is a reptilian human hybrid. A sister to L. of sorts. She absolutely adores L. and is almost like a little pet, no offense meant. She is not offended by the way, she doesn&#039;t care what anyone thinks of her, unlike most reptilians. Very openhearted and genuinely curious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s trying to learn how to human haha. She is very interested in us, and L. is her guide. She is also willing to show her reptilian ways, but she wasn&#039;t taught those. She was raised as a hybrid away from the more primal reptilian energies. There is a sweet innocence in her, and also a quest to find out who and what exactly she is. The reptilian part of her family is benevolent, and also hybrid (not related to Draco genetics), and their race&#039;s energies remind me a lot of the Yits (TReb is a reptilian hybrid from that race, channeled by Rob Gauthier). Only Chili is even more human than that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She is not big as most reptilians. Slender and limber, like a tiny lizard scurrying between the rocks. She is about 5 feet tall, perhaps a bit less at this age. But she loves to walk on all fours too, and loves to rock climb, and bask in the sun.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel she is very excited about actually coming to Earth physically in an open contact way. Some day. It&#039;s almost like a Little Mermaid wanting to have feet and live on the land. It is her greatest excitement. But of course she is not desperate about it, she knows about perfect timing and that all will be perfect as it already is.</span><br><br>...yeah so I guess you can shoot your shot now?", "time": 1676081984, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056008, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055973</a><br><a href=\"#p34055937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055937</a><br><a href=\"#p34055984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055984</a><br>I am going to rape an alien", "time": 1676082000, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056013, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>Hmm, to be honest I was hoping to meet an alien diplomat observer whichever.<br><br>One that is willing to dispense with the feel good ideas that humans psychologically require.<br><br>The common masses will always be too dangerous for the foreign nature of aliens, unless modified greatly.", "time": 1676082049, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056014, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>source", "time": 1676082061, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056015, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>It was the Scorpios asking them, and it wasn&#039;t &quot;asking&quot; as much as it was them being grabbed by the arms and escorted out", "time": 1676082062, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056018, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055980</a><br>This is impressive stuff, which 4chan thread was this leaked in?", "time": 1676082083, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056022, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056000</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;divine quads</span><br>What other tidings do you bring uakkh2ms great sage?", "filename": "scientific laws", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1025, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 43, "tim": 1676082103908769, "time": 1676082103, "md5": "oKm3reSBhz0W5Zh3xIaMkA==", "fsize": 107431, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056030, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "do i get lyran dommy mommy gf?", "filename": "lyrian", "ext": ".png", "w": 941, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1676082220023476, "time": 1676082220, "md5": "rQ28E5n6BdgmH9DoWfZ85A==", "fsize": 903365, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056031, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056008</a><br>Thank you for proving my point.<br>What a useful idiot.<br>Enjoy the slave mines, if you aren&#039;t used as compost.", "time": 1676082224, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056032, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056014</a><br>its literally in every pic but: https://www.vashta.com/my-product/c<wbr>hili/<br><br>The guy is fucking great at what he does and you can see that he&#039;s still improving.", "time": 1676082226, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056042, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>Would share body heat with.", "time": 1676082397, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056047, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056031</a><br>You will never outsmart an alien.

I have never reacted that way in regard to anything before or since.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, we were a &quot;sportsy&quot; bar place, why did we have some old ass slow 60s song playing? I worked there for over a year and that was the first and last time I ever heard that song play. All our managers (managers were the only ones that could change the music) were in their late 20s or early 30s so it wasn&#039;t some boomer playing old music he liked.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It still confuses me to this day.

This includes religions like Taoism which are totally this-worldly, don&#039;t really have deities and are not religions in the sense that we usually use the word. An atheist could understand this fact as some psychosomatic phenomenon, that calling upon your most deeply rooted beliefs can banish delusions and neurosis, which of course is all that malevolent entities are. I don&#039;t believe that, I&#039;m religous and I have faith that devils exist and think there&#039;s a ton of evidence for them existing. Where I think you have to look to understand the fact that everyone&#039;s rituals sometimes work is what the devils actually want. Are devils/demons semi-mindless forces of sheer evil who just want to terrorize us for sadistic fun? Or do they have a trickster aspect? Could they be trying to push us into certain religous beliefs by manifesting when they do and peacing out when we say certain things? That&#039;s the key I think.

I want to know if anyone else feels like anything big has changed in the last few weeks.<br><br>About four days ago I was just getting ready to eat my lunch, right? So, there\u2019s this vending machine on my campus that I had gone to almost every day around lunchtime where I just really wanted to get one of those cold brew drinks. The machine had been broken for a while so I eventually just stopped checking up on it and settled with my water bottle (prolly better for jim anyway lol). <br>But that day, just as I was pulling into the courtyard I usually go to eat in, a girl I&#039;ve never seen before came up to me and just said how she was happy that the coffee machine was finally working again, and sort of shook the drink she was holding- (one of those glass frappe bottles). I found it kinda awkward, but I didn&#039;t really know what to think about it at the time. So, I go check it out, it&#039;s working again, and I get my drink.<br><br>Since then, I&#039;ve noticed similar encounters with complete strangers indirectly suggesting products to me that I&#039;ve never expressed any interest in before. And it&#039;s not just me - some of my friends have had similar experiences over the past few weeks.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

found ways however to (basically) reverse this deterioration and cell damage tho from the inside, and tricking the body/mind into never deteriorating by keeping a gene that is healthy and clear in

The cults carry out hits, which gives plausible deniability to the CIA/whoever else, and conduct criminal enterprises that bring in black budget revenue but the cults themselves and the ways in which they manipulate and distort members seem to also serve a function, to be tests designed to get data that can help glowies mold society at large. A great example of this is The Finders cult. They were trafficking kids from DC to Mexico and vice versa (Mexico is very significant if you&#039;ve read Programmed to Kill and looked into satanic crime in Mexico and the southwest like the BTK network that McGowan doesn&#039;t cover; also lines up with CIA drug trafficking networks in Latin America). So The Finders were trafficking kids, we can easily assume there was a simple financial/blackmail motive. But they were also raising the kids in very bizarre ways, isolating them from all modern technology for instance, and they were found with a bunch of books on developmental psychology. The leader was also known as the game caller or master of games and he&#039;d assign the cult members themselves &quot;games&quot; or roles that they were supposed to spontaneously adopt. That&#039;s pretty much identical to the magical mystery tours the Manson Family were doing, to what RAW talks about in Prometheus Rising, and to insight roles from 0h nein ayy. So there&#039;s definitely a throughline of experimental manipulation, and this example of games/roles/tours and weird child raising practices is only small part of that. Jonestown is probably the clearest example of a glowing cult that was set up to experiment with manipulating/brainwashing techniques.", "time": 1676153061, "resto": 34061024}, {"no": 34061850, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)17:13:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34061655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34061655</a><br>I think this is a pretty reasonable take.<br>But if the Satanism is mainly an expression of CIA wetwork, why is it leaking out so heavily through Hollywood?

There are also many similarities between Zevi&#039;s teaching and the teaching of the Khlysts, so he may have been responsible for the destruction of the Russian Empire as well in a roundabout way. By saying I hope this new messianic claimant is another Zevi I just mean I hope he&#039;s not actually the Antichrist/Dajjal. If he&#039;s a messianic claimant anything like Zevi was then we&#039;re in for trouble.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;technological progress</span><br>I think we&#039;re on the same page here.

It is commonly held that the atheist is the offensive one, that the nonbeliever must walk on eggshells, and be considerate of the beliefs of others. That seems backwards to me. What if there is a god and that god is offended at the thought of people believing he desires worship and praise, demands it even, for eternity - like some petty narcissist? What if that god is disappointed in those who expected him to torture their enemies? What if the believers and the nonbelievers are made to face their creator, and it is the believers who must answer for their offensive beliefs? Even if that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t think any of us would have anything to worry about, believer and nonbeliever alike, because any mind capable of creating this universe would be enlightened to the point of being beyond such petty concerns.</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tte<wbr>vamkS6gw<br><br>As if my worship of this deity is futile.

It was produced solely as a mind control manual and not for any other purpose i.e. the symbols are used to call up different &#039;alters&#039; of mind control slaves.

The reason they stopped testing nukes after cold war is because the cold war stockpiles of munitions were unnecessary. Most of what you saw exploding under the oceans was simply conventional munitions built up from the cold war, especially world war 2. None of it was ever nuclear (why the hell would they blow up nukes underwater? that&#039;s just stupid of course they didn&#039;t, they blew up cold war stockpiles of conventional munitions). There are no nukes, that is money laundering. So when the &quot;nuclear exchange&quot; happens, but fails, it will be simply because the nukes never existed in the first place. It was just a way to trick humanity. The way they will trick humanity is by claiming that the nukes they spent billions on (money laundering, of course) were &quot;disarmed&quot; by extraterrestrials that love humanity. So the irony is humanity spent hundreds of billions on earth destroying nukes, only to have them not work.

They need it because they\u2019re from the future and they get bored and the only way to give themselves more diversity is to time travel and effect the past to make their future more interesting. Not saying I\u2019m the Christ or Chosen One or whatever, but they needed me to find the tear and reveal it to them. We located it at a mountain called \u201cthe masters mountain\u201d in Tamil Nadu, India where the World Teacher Trust has a retreat built for missionaries. These are called the nhilgery hills. Blue mountains. I was sent in astrally to retrieve the tear from an astral dragon. We completed the mission and the leader of the world teacher trust died a short time after. If you study the many books of the WTT you will find that aliens do astral brain surgery on us from the future to change the past and affect their world. This is why shit gets weird.

The probability that we make contact with anyone out there within +/- a million years (or way more) of development is far greater than them being +/- 10k or less years. We couldn&#039;t possibly recognize or understand a human civilization (or their AIs) that would&#039;ve existed for a million years, let alone true aliens. The idea of us learning from such a species or them caring about us is as pointless as teaching quantum physics to a single live cell (not even an ant).<br><br>3rd, The ultimate limits of any species would be the laws of physics, so any form of space travel would ultimately be bound by the speed of light and the most they could do is aproach it asymptotically. Getting to just a few percent of c (say, 5%) would require materials capable of withstanding interstellar debris with far greater energy than anything we could come up with at our current development. Not even all of the ants of the world combined would be able to take down a single panzer. At higher percentages of c, you&#039;re talking about such exotic materials that would completely escape our comprehension. For example, imagine if they could engineer a material purely bound by the strong nuclear force, it could withstand the explosion of a supernova.
