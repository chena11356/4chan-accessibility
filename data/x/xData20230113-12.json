I was unsatisfied with the die off explanation from other anonymous as I&#039;ve had considerable die off through antifungals before without increase in any epilepsy symptoms. I found out through research that it&#039;s likely it wasn&#039;t the NAC that causes any shakiness for me, but the black seed oil. I just started taking it a couple days ago. After some research, I found out that it causes serotonin to accumulate. Meaning, it doesn&#039;t seem to increase serotonin but rather prevents it from breaking down.

That study you linked is studying a rat model, but epilepsy varies wildly by patients and many times MRIs and EEGs don&#039;t find the direct causes of it in JME. My theory stand that although BSO may alleviate tremor in *some people* through increase in GABA, the increase in serotonin &amp; acetylchline, and decrease in blood sugar probably negates this benefit for me. In my case, seems low blood sugar increases seizure threshold, but that doesn&#039;t hold true for everyone. My experience with herbs like st johns wort which increases serotonin and the racetams similarly seemed to increase shakes (very much less so with racetams).

And if the air creates equal pressure at all points in the chamber, then certainly the air creates equal pressure at all points in the flat Earth dome.<br><br>Yet there is no denying that air thins as you climb in altitude.

I mean, there&#039;s gotta be a catch right ? If i was a spirit wanting to &quot;prey&quot; on humans, love and sex would probably be my go to options, as a huge portion of people feel lonely, want to be loved, and obviously want to have easy sex. I understand that those are &quot;human&quot; reflexions, and that entities may have way more alien things that drives their actions, but then again, how can we trust something so foreign and much more powerful that we are ? <br>I&#039;ve not seen a lot of people being careful about those questions, and found only one testimony about the &quot;true form&quot; of a succubus before they morph to suit their human (source: the succubuslove.wordpress by &quot;Ryan&quot;, when speaking about a black mirror method of invocation).<br><br>Second, if succubus are real, then it surely means a lot of other spirits/entities are also real.

Then how would you protect yourself once you become closer to the other side and strengthen your connection with your spirit lover ? We are talking about a being that knows everything about you, can take any shape that suits you and will never leave your side, if that&#039;s a nice entity, i cannot begin to imagine what a bad one would be able to do to me, and how my weak and limited human spirit would have a chance to survive.<br><br>Third, and probably my main concern; kinda related to the first point: what do succubus/entities have to gain in a loving relationship with humans ?<br>I&#039;ve read a lot of comments around here, and a lot of people seem to be on the receiving end of the love and pleasure. Are succubus just platonic beings that find fulfillment in providing joy to humans ? Can you even give pleasure to a succubus partner ? Can you give something meaningfull to them that justifies what they bring to you ? Or is the relation is by essence unbalanced by the very nature of you being a human ?<br>Personally, i would want to give a lot of love and care to any of my partners, it&#039;s 50% of the joy in a relationship, but i refuse to sacrifice an important part of me in the process. If a good and balanced human couple is about sharing, caring, and the compatibility between the lovers, I would expect spirit love to be all of that but better to even be considerated as an option. I don&#039;t think feeling amazing orgasms and warmth is enough to be happy for my whole life, there must be something more, something mutual, intimate, a trust shared between two loving beings, some hardships that you overcome in tandem, some grey days that leave place to the sun from time to time.<br><br>I&#039;m not certain that a spirit can provide that kind of love and relation, but i&#039;m more than ready to be proven wrong.

In Scandinavia, the Black Cat Klubbis is believed to have been tied to ritual offerings made in lakes, where slaves and animals were sacrificed. In Egyptian culture, the god of cats, Bastet, was often depicted as a woman with the head of a black cat. One of the most intriguing aspects of the Black Cat Klubbis is its ability to assist individuals during their dreams. It is said to be a powerful and ancient being, capable of protecting the sleeper or astral traveler from harm. The Black Cat Klubbis is also believed to have a mortal enemy in the form of the Hat Man, a fearsome shadow figure that is often associated with sleep paralysis. In addition to the Black Cat Klubbis and the Hat Man, there are other figures associated with sleep and the astral realm that have been largely forgotten. One such figure is Mothman, a mysterious entity whose true name has been lost to history. It is thought that discovering this one true name may be the key to unlocking strange abilities and accessing the otherworldly realm in which these entities dwell. Klubbis is a fascinating and enigmatic figure that continues to captivate the imagination of those interested in the mysteries of the unconscious mind and the spiritual world. Its complex origins and connections to ancient cultures only add to its allure, making it a subject worthy of further study and exploration.", "filename": "forC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1332, "h": 850, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1673584841758586, "time": 1673584841, "md5": "w7LAKxA9AzsjOE8tL4mqMA==", "fsize": 146095, "resto": 33826892}, {"no": 33826963, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)23:45:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33826892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33826892</a><br>In times of old, there was a being known as the Black Cat Klubbis, both a physical entity and a dream entity.

What fascinates me is that the CIA appeared to believe that they were &#039;untouched&#039; i.e. that they were not put through the same hideous mind control programming regime, and that even those like Cheney believed that Illuminati programming was reserved for those from families, where incestuous multigenerational abuse had occurred, but from my experience, none of this was true. They had all been abused and programmed in the same way, yet those groomed for high office were made to believe that they hadn&#039;t been put through the same program.

Personally, I would see this high incidence level of paedophilia as mind control programming. They had all been highly programmed but didn&#039;t know it. They ignorantly abused &#039;slaves&#039; like Cathy, unaware that they were also slaves. Alternatively, one can say that they had all come from incestuous, multigenerational abuse families but had severely repressed all memories.

The civilised world depends upon &#039;farming&#039; communities to civilise it and NOT warrior cults -such as the mythical Atlanteans, opposed to the Lemurians. The Illuminati cult is an Atlantean Templar cult. It will destroy the world if higher consciousness is not reached. Islam and Christianity hid the fact that at their heart, was the secret knowledge of mind control. The Templars hid this successfully for centuries - whilst experimenting with creating &#039;sons of God&#039; i.e. the Nephilim. The Templars teach that both Jesus and Mohammed were Nephilim. Christianity and Islam have a close correllation to slavery historically. They spread their religions all over the globe and wherever they exported these religions - slavery followed in different ways. That is because the heart of these religions hides the fact of mind control. Theta brainwave level is the lowest level of human consciousness which the Templars use to create mind control slaves. They implant their sea god and goddess visualisations into the minds of their slaves, at this level (as well as the &#039;figure of 8&#039; the Octopus of the MI6 carousel programming to defend these evil idols of the cult).

But things are not based on nothing, everything is based on consciousness, we can be sure of this because our own existence is the only thing we can know for sure, everything else might be an illusion but an &quot;I&quot; must exist. We may disagree on the definition of consciousness of course, but at the end of the day it must be conceded that there is some kind of awareness that exists.

Chicken and pigs store polyunsaturated fats due to how they are fed, if you&#039;re getting your meat from a farm where the animals are fed well, then there&#039;s no problem but if you&#039;re getting your meat from a market then you should go for leaner cuts.<br>My diet is focused on having as little inflammation as possible and keeping the metabolism running at full speed at all times.<br>Your condition is very unfortunate and the best option indeed seems to be to get rid of all inflammatory foods. You need to drop all seed oils immediately. All plant oils except olive oil and coconut oil are toxic, sunflower is one of the worst. Seeds are all toxic, they are the most defended part of a plant, they offer no nutrition at all and can even be deadly sometimes (cyanide). <br>The evil of these oils can&#039;t possibly be summed up in one post but here are some reasons. <br>They are bad because they are polyunsaturated. They slow down your metabolism, promote fat storage and unsaturate your overall fat composition. PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) cause free radicals to form in your body, think of it like a wave of fire consuming your cells and using them as fuel to spread further throughout your entire body, the inflammation caused by free radicals is directly responsible for atherosclerosis. Heart disease would decrease by 99% if humans stopped consuming PUFAs.<br>You should use saturated fats for cooking, animal fats like butter, tallow, ghee etc. Coconut fat is saturated and is very good for the metabolism. You can use olive oil to cook but try to keep the temperature as low as possible. <br>I&#039;m perfectly confident the diet advice I&#039;ve given so far is correct and I&#039;d definitely put my children on such a diet. <br>Wellbeing isn&#039;t all about diet, yes but diet is the foundation everything else is built upon, as long as your diet sucks, you&#039;ll come crashing down eventually.", "time": 1673472444, "resto": 33808289}, {"no": 33816524, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:28:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33815997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33815997</a><br><a href=\"#p33816513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33816513</a><br>Here&#039;s what I usually eat in a day to give you an idea:<br><br>-6 eggs, fermented sausage, white cheese, coffee and honey for breakfast<br>Orange juice and carrot salad in between meals<br>-100mg of magnesium, some milk and honey before work out<br>-Around 100g of honey mid work out<br>-1-2 litres of milk after work out<br>-Some healthy dessert, I&#039;ve been having lots of coconut cookies lately<br>-A cup of coffee and some honey <br>-700g of red meat, usually fatty ground beef, 500g of baked potatoes, carrot salad, orange juice and dessert for dinner OR a big serving of an organ meat like liver instead of ground beef.

But if there&#039;s too much to eat then your cells end up storing too much but your body keeps sending signals for insulin whenever you eat. This leads to your cells getting resistant to insulin, after a point, it&#039;s almost impossible to get your cells to eat more which means your blood sugar stays high. <br>Some things like PUFA and corn syrup PROMOTE insulin resistance, normally if a cell can&#039;t eat, the food is sent back so in the end all your cells are fed but PUFA and corn syrup get around that, they end up getting stored anyway, I can get deeper into the mechanism of why this happens if you&#039;re interested. <br>Saturates fat and sugar works perfectly with your body so you don&#039;t get insulin resistant as long as you&#039;re not eating an absolute inhuman level of food, it&#039;s virtually impossible to get diabetes if you ate naturally.

I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY.

The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE).", "filename": "Aryanz", "ext": ".png", "w": 1342, "h": 663, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1673568628719450, "time": 1673568628, "md5": "Jx+4b7MF1+uaFfB0thfMyA==", "fsize": 771815, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825354, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825346</a><br>lurk more", "time": 1673568655, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825358, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:11:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a>", "filename": "Rapebabieggers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3238, "h": 3898, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673568693230058, "time": 1673568693, "md5": "ScwbbCyJi6+0Au7xXGff/w==", "fsize": 1655755, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825365, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:12:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a><br>The original Proto-Indo-European Proto-Pajeet", "filename": "fwlcap78rw871", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1962, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673568762091914, "time": 1673568762, "md5": "zi2fMEw/XJ2ZR8l0x6ukSw==", "fsize": 303092, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825371, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:13:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a><br>Pajeet rape baby with the light skin stare.

I personally found out that what I thought was depression was actually a parasite feeding on me. Years of therapy and medication didn&#039;t help me but listening to /x/ schizos did. If you started to awaken your kundalini you should have more energy now and thus made yourself more of a target for parasites. Also notice where you get attacked/ notice which chakras they go for and try to close those. There&#039;s decent documentation on how to do that in the jos power meditation pdfs. I imagine turning the chakra around, stopping its spin and pushing it together in a single motion and that usually helps for a few hours although not perfectly. What stopped the attacks was attacking it back so make of that what you will. Also im not sure you can stop the kundalini once it started to awaken and doing nothing can lead to uncontrolled spill of its energy and that can seriously fuck you up.

The authors theorize that the image on the Shroud of Turin is in fact that of the last Grand Master of the order, Jacques de Molay, who was tortured some months before his execution in 1307. The image on the shroud certainly does fit the description of de Molay as depicted in medieval woodcuts, a long nose, hair shoulder length and parted in the center, a full beard that forked at its base, not to mention the six-foot frame. De Molay was said to be quite tall.&#039;", "time": 1673541519, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822429, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)11:47:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The shroud was 3d printed lol", "time": 1673542034, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822523, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)11:57:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33822343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33822343</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stop posting my shit back to me faggot</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s there for me to see</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;idc which order you reply to me in</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you have to make points</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you fail to do so</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you look at the sentence construct and attempt to pick it apart</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but you can&#039;t to me you stupid piece of shit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I tl:dr most your shit and you analyse my shit with a magnifying glass looking for anything</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an anomaly or sorts</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I&#039;m an enigma : a riddle for you</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jesus is the anti-christ</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get mad for no reason.</span><br>lol. k", "time": 1673542664, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822582, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)12:04:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33794509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33794509</a><br><a href=\"#p33794494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33794494</a><br><a href=\"#p33794575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33794575</a><br><a href=\"#p33799230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33799230</a><br><a href=\"#p33818182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33818182</a><br>none of these are actual counterpoints or logical responses. you&#039;re all extremely delusional and sad. seek genuine assistance for your brains. especially <a href=\"#p33818182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33818182</a> you&#039;re like the most retarded out of all christfags<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i believe in god</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and he says i should go onto anime websites for several hours of the day and tell people to kill themselves</span><br>this is what christfags actually believe lmao", "filename": "12096264_1643571622549995_5760692461945308238_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 540, "h": 431, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 99, "tim": 1673543052622537, "time": 1673543052, "md5": "KeXc0VyXq627+2UJ0oUpEw==", "fsize": 27417, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822698, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)12:20:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33797784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33797784</a><br> They mistakenly carbon dated a piece of the repair job that was expertly weaved in Around the 13th century", "time": 1673544031, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822743, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)12:26:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33822523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33822523</a><br>it&#039;s just very jewish of you really<br>you look like a redditor looking to score points<br>whereas I&#039;m here waking people up ;)", "time": 1673544398, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822769, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)12:30:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33822743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33822743</a><br>Have no jewish blood to my current knowledge .<br>Again you prove yourself wrong and paranoid", "time": 1673544602, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33822854, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)12:44:16", "name": "Anonymouse", "com": "<a href=\"#p33794345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33794345</a><br>The shroud does not show the image of Jmmanuel (alias Jesus Christ), but that of a merchant from Turin/Italy, called Caesar Canova.<br>The shroud was made by the brother of the deceased, Luciano Canova, an alchemist.<br><br>The process took place on 7 June 1324 and lasted until 10 June, i.e. 4 days.<br>During this, the procedure was not such that the shroud was placed on the deceased and the latter was rubbed with chemicals, as is often claimed, but it was a very early form of photography, whereby the corpse was placed vertically in front of a large glass lens, through which the image was then projected for four days through an effect of sunlight onto a large fabric surface soaked in chemicals in a dark room, after which the shroud was then treated with silver nitrate and the image became in that way visible and retained.<br><br>The earthly scientists will solve many other old mysteries and lift secrets.", "filename": "solved", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 374, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673545456447890, "time": 1673545456, "md5": "NldphU/YBpStQ6KUrutlQw==", "fsize": 518460, "resto": 33794345}, {"no": 33823114, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)13:37:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33794489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33794489</a><br>Yeah, reading more about it, this thing seems more demonic than religious.

I live in one of the largest cities in America. In this world everything was crunched down into a small town. What would take me an entire day and a half of walking I can do in 10 minutes. I tried to map it out in Minecraft once so I could explain it but no matter how I tried to do it nothing made sense geographically. Neither did the time line. I could be a 8 year old in one and then a 18 year old in the next.<br> One dream I had and really liked was were these &quot;aliens&quot; from an alternate dimensions came to us.

I looked out at the most beautfil thing ever. It was the destruction of man kind but I couldnt help but smile.<br> The entire city was on fire which lit up the night sky, This gorgoues Green gas was swirling around the streets and these large zepplin blimps were what the aliens were using to travel and they covered the sky. They were the size of small cities each of them and they had ropes dangling from them.<br> In that same dream with some help I was able to cross the barrier into the other dimension to save my brother. The thing about the aliens is that they would fill the half of the universe missing with themselves shape shiffiting. So you could think it was your mom you were talking to but your real mom was in the other universe and your talking to an alien.<br> I saved my brother and his mom my step mom and our grandma was there. But I knew she was an alien and when she tried to call the &quot;Control?&quot; On me I thrust my arm back and cracked open one of their skulls like a fucking grape and sent their green blood and gray skin everywhere. I caved in the others skull to so they must have been phyuscially weak when shape shifting because as aliens nothing hurt them. <br> The dream went nowhere really. Millions of years passed and we were trapped in our never decaying or aging bodies. They farmed humans until eventually another universe came in with tech equal to theirs and they had an epic battle I got to help out in via sabotage in the main human farm.<br> I have a few more so if anyone is interested I&#039;ll post more tomorrow if work Is slow. <br> I need to go to bed right now since I&#039;m gonna be waking up in 7 hours.", "time": 1673511213, "resto": 33813965}, {"no": 33820337, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)03:18:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A ship with the silhouette the shape of the bottom of the space shuttle flew over my house and then I was tied to a table and a grey asked me why I was wearing a hat<br><br>That&#039;s all I remember", "time": 1673511502, "resto": 33813965}, {"no": 33820384, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)03:26:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33819930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33819930</a><br>That is actually one of the scariest dreams in this thread.

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

She was young though I don&#039;t remember her exact age. My mom had me at 20 and she had my mom at a super young age too. I saw the murder but didn&#039;t really understand what happened - it was dark outside and my grandma was taking out the trash when he ambushed her. She was in the hospital for I think 2 days or so before finally dying. My mom always tells me about how I pointed out a woman in a red dress in her room at the hospital so I know this isn&#039;t just a weird memory I made up to cope with her dying. We weren&#039;t allowed in the room, so we were looking through a window at her last moments. For a few years before we moved out of the apartment, I&#039;d experience weird things like feeling something grab my shoulders or touching my hair. I was a sensitive kid physically, I&#039;d cry at like everything, and I remember really getting the shit scared out of me and screaming for my parents because some entity grabbed me. Fast forward to my teenage years and adulthood, and not sure if this has anything to do with my experience as a child, but I&#039;d regularly predict illness and death in the family. One moment I remember in particular was when I was around 15 years old and my aunt had cancer... I had a horrible feeling all day, knowing it happened, and came home to news about her death. She was not the only family member I have accurately guessed their death the day it happens. As an adult, I think about these things less so I don&#039;t really have any recent experiences like this. I am also very desensitized to death at this point in my life, perhaps that has a lot to do with these premonitions fading away, despite death occurring more regularly due to age. Every year in October around when my grandma died, I believe it was the 18th, or 19th - I dont remember and don&#039;t wanna ask my mom, crows like to hang out in her garden, but otherwise they never stop there for anything.", "time": 1673511092, "resto": 33815237}, {"no": 33820311, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)03:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33820305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33820305</a><br>How long have you been alive?

Wow, that&#039;s a lot. I say you have 2 options, which aren&#039;t any crazy incantations, chants, rituals, spells, Ouija boards, etc. <br><br>1. Meditate. Meditate, and become the watcher. The watcher is your (our) spirit. You watch your mind from a distance. When you feel scared, know that you are watching your mind feel scared from a safe distance. Don&#039;t overthink meditation either- Sit up, attentive and powerful, and don&#039;t think about anything. Hear the silence or whatever small noises around you. When you catch your mind drifting off and thinking about something, catch it, observe the thought, and then let it go like a butterfly. And then continue to be a watcher. She will either continue to come to you until she &quot;arrives&quot;, and when she does, I preict that she will attempt to communicate with you, maybe try to give you information about where her body is. I wouldn&#039;t recommend going to the cabin in the woods until you develop more spiritual strength. <br><br>2. My second recommendation, and this is the opposite of the first one- yell. scream. Yell what is inside of you at her. Tell her to stop terrorizing you. Or, ask what she wants. <br><br>don&#039;t use a Ouija board, that&#039;s retarded and it will keep more of a ghost rather than helping her. <br><br>I wouldn&#039;t recommend leaving out a pen and paper for her to write on, she may not have the strength to get her full message out. <br><br>The last thing I would advise against is talking about this outside of people where it&#039;s necessary.
