For example, the initiation I hold is a &quot;complete path&quot; with includes preliminaries, sadhana of a mahamudra variety, dzogchen initiation, and some dzogchen practices. Keeping in mind that&#039;s my interface with this stuff and I&#039;ve barely touched rushen, the way I think of it is like this: Dzogchen is an alternative to completion stage practices that look slightlys less like a traditional continental Indian yogic practice and slightly more like a staunchly Asian contemplative practice in the style of Chan or Zen for example in at least some threads of Dzogchen there&#039;s this idea that you&#039;re not even working on your tummo anymore because if you&#039;re doing the other shit correctly it will sort itself without strain.<br><br>Another thing is that while Dzogchen is usually thought of as the purview of Nyingma, it does have little reservoirs in other schools too. No matter what the realpolitik of Tibet actually looks like in an ideal state these aren&#039;t schools in competition with each other they compliment each other and like plug gaps that the others don&#039;t even want to touch right? Like this is why autocephaly works so well for the Orthbros in the long run - you&#039;re letting folks operate their own silos with some degree of independence instead of trying to enforce uniform doctrine across the polity. <br><br>Even myself I have Ekayana and Rime sensibilities there&#039;s value learning from ALL the Diamond schools, not just Tibet - check out Shingon and Azhaliism (if you even can) and Newar and the Dragon School over in Bhutan like fuckin&#039; immerse yourself in Buddhism PLEASE for the love of god lol.

The God Forms are very similar to the point of there being only a couple of Patterns that make them effectively the same, which is called Syncretism. A local god may have different personalities and vary in their aspects, attributes, and manifestation than others according to their culture. Gods are the personalities of nature and society that one can interact with. The idea is that some gods are stronger than others gods that like them came from modern cape-shit. Most of the &quot;Pagan&quot; sources come from Christians writing them down, and their biases toward this material are skewed because they have a totally different mindset and most of the material is alien to them. So, is Loki stronger than Thor? No, they&#039;re not even similar as Loki is an Agent of Change because he&#039;s a Trickster spirit. Trickster spirits are Not Evil as the Christian writers claim because they wanted a Satan figure like their religion. Odin is similar to Mercury. Thor and Zeus and Jupiter have the same &quot;powers&quot;. Inanna, Ishtar, Aphrodite, Freya, and Venus are also similar to each other by function. Paganism is a deep-end adult swim.

Miss Man aged Man has decided through aeons of self-reflection that what the observer observes (man) is in fact \u2014 &quot;No-Dam-Good.&quot; This is the indictment \u2014 the moral accusation. The followers of this verdict believe that the proof of this is man&#039;s own behavior, i.e., wars, dis-obedience to God, class struggle, and an array of similar stupidities. On the other hand, the small voice of his defense whispers that man has also co-operated with the evolutionary imperative for his enlightened self-interest. Some examples are charity, medicine, science, heroism, etc. Which ever tunnel reality they choose to focus on, both are inappropriate since it has been assumed that man is a completed product. What both sides do not see is that mankind is nothing but the result of the trial and error (also known as trial and success) factor of a great bio-spiritual experiment. The problem lies in the fact that &quot;trial and error&quot; is the culture that is regarded as more sacrosant than the biology which forms its base.", "filename": "51ABCTDplaL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 323, "h": 499, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675909950394537, "time": 1675909950, "md5": "7ZmQZlTulabRL1zb74nSBA==", "fsize": 44454, "resto": 34039660}, {"no": 34039747, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:34:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This anon from 8 years ago.", "filename": "1607875173235", "ext": ".png", "w": 764, "h": 744, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1675910046458412, "time": 1675910046, "md5": "O8+SuTETQN5O3sLTmrtYLg==", "fsize": 162833, "resto": 34039660}, {"no": 34039758, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:36:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Old post by anon, from god knows when.<br><br>&quot;<br>Neophytes (newbie&#039;s) guide to magic. <br> Materials consumption order<br><br>1st:<br> Listen to The Hero&#039;s Journey song, it will explain what this path is and what it means<br><br>2nd:<br> Read The Kybalion, it illustrates universal magical axioms.

You&#039;re consumerists, you&#039;re addicted to validation and can&#039;t stand the fact that you can&#039;t control the way people think of you, you don&#039;t question anything, you buy into everything you&#039;re told online on reddit echochambers until you go one procedure too far and end up in excruciating mental and physical pain. And even then, when it&#039;s all done, you are still not free of your &#039;dysphoria&#039; nor depression nor any other mental illness because deep down you know that everyone sees through your bullshit and people who humor your delusions are simply playing along because they feel bad for what they belive to be a mentally ill person.

Both hells are syntheses of the Buddhist Naraka, itself based on the Hindu Naraka, with traditional, pre-Buddhist beliefs. In Japan&#039;s tradition, souls must cross the Sanzu River to be judged at Higan. Souls are judged by ten judges known as the Ten Kings of Hell and are accordingly sent to whatever realm their lives&#039; actions deserved. The main paths of the afterlife one may be sent to are called the Six Realms. Hell is the lowest realm, being succeeded by the Preta Realm, Animal Realm, Human Realm, Asura Realm and Deva Realm, also known as Heaven. There are many Hells within Hell in Buddhism, with each having a specialized torture suited for every particular kind of sinner. One&#039;s time in Hell, as in the other five realms, is not eternal, however. It may take many millennia but souls eventually burn up all their negative karma and are reincarnated in a new realm, as is the eternal cycle of Samsara.</span>", "time": 1675719004, "resto": 34018353}, {"no": 34022206, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)16:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34022188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34022188</a><br>In Godly context.", "time": 1675719081, "resto": 34018353}, {"no": 34022237, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)16:36:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34022192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34022192</a><br>And? <br>Fuck around and find out.<br>This is fair, especially because you need to do something quite fucked up to end up in hell and not in human/animal/ghost form.", "time": 1675719403, "resto": 34018353}, {"no": 34022269, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)16:41:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34022237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34022237</a><br>sorry I thought your link was supposed to be a refutation to what you had quoted here <a href=\"#p34022092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34022092</a><br>should&#039;ve asked first I guess", "time": 1675719671, "resto": 34018353}, {"no": 34023535, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)19:45:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Since it&#039;s relevant, gonna just say now this is the only excuse to get me in California.

Either status has positive but also negative aspects to it. You&#039;re more free, more of your own boss and have more time in uni, but you have no money. As an employee, you&#039;re not your own boss, but you at least have some money (ofc i know everyone gets taxed into oblivion in almost every western country).

I know from my own experience that it is possible to evoke a conditioned reflex in oneself as a response to certain thoughts, and this reflex will be expressed in bodily sensations and movements, it isn&#039;t hard.

All I have to say is I&#039;ve been doing a form of meditation upon the nature of the self for many years now and at various different stages of my inquiry I&#039;ve somehow activated massive amounts of energy and vibrations in the centers that correspond with the chakras as shown in those videos. I have another older video about chakras where I call them subjective and don&#039;t really think there is much to it at all but I&#039;m having to revise my viewpoint somewhat because of my experiences. I do not believe there is any value in just focusing on various parts of your body and trying to do visualizations or whatever, it doesn&#039;t work. It&#039;s just certain mental choices you make somehow activate these centers and cause a huge release of emotion.<br><br>I will go into detail about the heart chakra for example. I was not getting the money I was supposed to get for January because my landlord went onto welfare and it caused some issues. Various people tried to push me to either go after my landlord in court or go after the organization that is supposed to pay me. I decided I&#039;d rather die than do anything against my landlord who has been nothing but good to me, and did some Neville Goddard tier manifesting thing where I choose perfect harmony, and decided to go by faith that the whole thing would turn from what was going to be a lose-lose-lose situation into a win-win-win situation. When I really made that decision (and it was the day of my birthday too, coincidentally) I suddenly experienced massive vibrations in my heart area, and I went immediately to the psych ward because I felt this overwhelming energy going through me causing my mind to speed up and causing me to become super strong and to involuntarily have to move my body in random ways, and the energy would go wherever I shifted my attention but it was coming from the heart. The energy could be expressed through rigorous exercise or through extremely fast and nonsensical thoughts or through crazy hallucinations...", "time": 1675808382, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030338, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:26:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>...and anyways this has happened to me several times at that point, each time this overwhelming energy that I had no proper use for, but which had to be used. The only difference is that each time I felt the vibrations start in a different area.<br><br>I did not even at any point think it had anything to do with chakras. I was worried I was having a panic attack, that maybe my heart was going to explode or something.<br><br>The whole theme of everything that led up to that was &quot;harmony&quot;. I was choosing to be in perfect harmony, to turn everything around in a way that hurts nobody, and btw after the fact it all did work out in a way where all three parties involved were able to be satisfied and nobody got hurt. It was absolutely miraculous but it worked out.<br><br>So then later a new them started that seemed to be around expression. I was feeling so lonely, and unable to connect with others, and I was never expressing my real views. I&#039;d always talk to various people and learn what they have to say, and talk to them in vocabulary they understand, and when they said something I know is wrong I&#039;d never bother to correct them. Well that day I was with my friend and some random Christian street preacher guy had been there. I talked with him for like an hour in that cafe, maybe more, and the whole time I just humoured him and his beliefs and tried to learn what I could from him.<br><br>After he finally left my friend said something along the lines of &quot;be yourself&quot; or &quot;be natural&quot; or something like that. Moments after that I started getting intense vibrations in my throat and to feel overwhelming energy pour into me. My friend also was having an anomalous experience at the same time, and she saw the prana aura with all its sparky things, and she saw the orbs that have been following me around since about October. I then took off shortly afterwards after telling her she could email me if she needed my help (since she was experiencing weird psychic stuff and worried herself) and...", "time": 1675808779, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030378, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:31:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>...I went straight to the psych ward. Again the usual thing played out where I sort of flopped around, hallucinated, sort of danced, was hysterical, etc. in a room they keep me in the psych ward until it wears off. After going through that for the whole night I eventually got out some time in the morning when it was day and went back to wandering the streets. I was completely changed however at this point. When I next got online I stopped pretending to be other personas, I stopped mirroring everything that others believe and think, and I started preaching about my actual beliefs about deity (that god is impersonal and reciprocal, that all personalities are but emanations of the all, etc.). I stopped caring if I offend people and started behaving like both online and offline where I&#039;d just say what I actually think and believe and understand to the truth. I&#039;ve since gone to one priest, one minister, and various other people and just talked to them honestly about my metaphysical and theological views instead of merely asking questions always and finding out what they believe I started sharing what I think about things. I made a couple of threads on imageboards too where I critiqued what I know to be false beliefs on religion, and did not care that I was offending mainstream Christians. I basically embraced authenticity, started to express myself in a genuine way, instead of hiding all the time what I really think and believe. This has allowed me to access now at any time the energy in the throat, and I assume this is the &quot;throat chakra&quot;....", "time": 1675809103, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030417, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:40:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>...so then fast forward awhile later. I started really looking at all my thoughts, emotions, etc. all things of the personality. I went over my many books, especially William Walker Atkinson books but also Christian D. Larson and others like Heidegger and Schopenhauer and Julius Evola, anyone that talked about &quot;the self&quot;, &quot;the ego&quot;, &quot;the real self&quot;, &quot;individuality vs personality&quot;, etc.<br><br>I&#039;ve read up on this all many times before because it keeps coming up in so many of my books but I always found it incomprehensible and vague and didn&#039;t understand the point. Well this time I was paying super close attention, reading it slowly, really paying attention to what was being said; especially in the case of Atkinson. I noticed he keeps talking about it over and over again in almost all of his books so it was really important. I noticed he talked about how this conscious of one&#039;s individuality, the &quot;I am&quot;, gives more control over the lower subordinate principles (the body and mind) and makes everything more efficient. I started to compare some of this to ideas about wu wei, flow states, etc. and to really think it over.<br><br>At some point then I came to realize on a deeper level than merely intellect that I am an individual; not a personality. I understood it in theory before; this time I felt the reality of it. When I did this intense vibrations began in the middle of my head and behind the eyes, and again a ton of energy was released, and this time the visual hallucinations were especially super strong and interesting (in the past they&#039;ve never been all that elaborate for me and most of my hallucinations have been tactical in nature). This time I saw really complex patterns on walls, saw the floor morphing, etc. more intense than when I did psilocybin months earlier. My whole perception was really changed and I was able to do strange things like place my hand in a candle flame and not be burned...", "time": 1675809635, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030465, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:49:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>So after this there came a new theme. I started to really hate my body and mind, my person. I became antagonistic towards both, and resentful of having them, and I was having suicidal thoughts. I was in a terrible torment, a dark night of the soul. I thought also with all the times I&#039;d been in the psych ward in the last few months and the intensity of my hallucinations having greatly increased that I was fucked and was going to die. I started thinking about what the death urge is all about, why I was having these thoughts, and how do I correctly interpret it and what do I do about it. I started researching Mahasamadhi, a concept I&#039;ve known about for a long while but never really understood, and I read a book called &quot;Blackman, Sushila - Graceful exits - how great being die-Dhambhala (1997).pdf&quot; which had like 100 entries about how various saints and sages committed Mahasamadhi. My torment continued to increase and also high strangeness weird synchronicity phenomena stuff was also increasing. At one point I was back in the psych ward again and one of the staff there started basically bullying me but also saying things about the self to me. It was the weirdest thing and it really bothered me. I was let out of the psych ward early while still in psychosis, and I wandered off to a medical clinic, and I sat there still in psychosis for awhile. I was thinking now it was not ever going to end, and I thought for hours there about how I was going to just end it, and attempt Mahasamadhi. So at point I talked to one of the staff there and told him with all sincerity I was prepared to die, that nobody wants me around, that I&#039;m a burden and tired, and that I would live only if there was somewhere safe I could go where I was wanted. He told me I was a great guy and that he didn&#039;t want me to die and I&#039;d be welcome to come there any time even if the psych ward wasn&#039;t willing to take me...", "time": 1675810181, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030508, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:56:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>So at that point I chose to live for another something was lifted from me. Forever I&#039;ve just been extremely high energy all the time, unable to sleep more than like an hour and never feeling like I had rested, just tormented by terrible energy. But at that point I went back to the hospital to confront the nurse that was bothering me before and I had a conversation with her that was much more productive because I was sane enough to talk with her, I then went to a shelter afterwards, and I slept for like three days and nights. I only woke up to drink water or eat food and go back to sleep.<br><br>I then found I had a sensation over the top of my head like a burning crown. The most intense energy kept pouring out through me and I was able to hypnotize things. This energy absolutely would not stop like before where it would last 4 to 8 hours and then stop. It just kept pouring out for days and I had to figure out how to stop it. At one point I spent hours and hours in a bathtub, dousing my head repeatedly under water, and each time I&#039;d hold my head underwater the energy would subside and I&#039;d feel peace and sleepy, then I&#039;d raise my head up to breath and I&#039;d feel the water (that was very warm) becoming like ice in my hair and felt like my hair was freezing into icicles, while the crown of my head was burning. So I did this for hours and hours and kept thinking about the situation. Eventually somehow I managed after some days of this to finally bring the energy down enough to actually function and go be able to get on the internet or get some things done.<br><br>It was after this that I realized I just experienced intense vibrations and energy releases systematically from the areas that correspond with the 7 major chakras. So I went and made those two videos. I thought it over for hours beforehand sitting in a church, and then later while laying down in bed, and I was able to remember exactly the theme of each day and the moment where the energy and vibrations started...", "time": 1675810562, "resto": 34024226}, {"no": 34030552, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)18:02:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34029846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34029846</a><br>...so now I&#039;m wondering about the root chakra as I can remember activating and releasing tons of energy from the 2nd chakra to the 7th. I am assuming now, just because of the improbability of these 6 I&#039;ve figured out so far, that there must also be a root chakra... and I&#039;m trying to figure that one out. I assume I may have activated it in the past and forgot about it. The second and third chakras I have been able to remember activating them before and feeling the intense energy, though it&#039;s far enough back in time to not be recent. The stomach one which is the 3rd chakra it&#039;s all about will, concentration, steadfastness, and ignoring the emotions and impulses that would distract you; and it seems to have a correspondence with the 6th chakra and the two of them work together very well since the 3rd is about will and the 6th has a way of applying will to the emotions, and the solar plexus is the seat of the emotions/passions/desires.<br><br>The second chakra you can gets its energy to work just by cultivating extremely noble and high ideals and thoughts. Like if you think upon beauty, and virtue, and the ideal man you should be, and the ideal woman you should have, and the ideals everyone should be living up to and expressing in an ideal world where only the imagination is the limit and anything is achievable. This releases that energy and causes vibrations in that area. It&#039;s all about standards, ideals, nobility... it corresponds with creativity, with art, with trying to manifest perfection.<br><br>But I&#039;m at a loss now at to how to access the energy of the first chakra. Maybe it doesn&#039;t exist? Maybe there&#039;s only 6 energy centers in the body? I do not know.

I got the big horny and made it into a sex dream since the last couple of times it was boring shit like flying. <br><br>I was in my house and walked down the steps of my back porch. While I was walking down I realized I was dreaming. I immediately starting looking for a girl. There was a girl I knew but she said no, so I moved on and found someone else that I didn&#039;t. There were two girls I face fucked, they were fat at first for some reason so I made them skinny. First girl I had upside down and snot and slobber was all over her face. More came in later. The next one was kneeling so there wasn&#039;t a bunch of shit all over her face. Guys came in with them and they tried to get with me too but I told them to fuck off. I woke up after some time with the second girl.<br><br>I rarely have lucid dreams, is it normal that the dream tries to intrude on my intentions? Or was it only partially lucid? 2 times in this dream, first girl that I actually knew saying no, and guys showing up that I had to tell to leave.", "time": 1675712787, "resto": 34010694}, {"no": 34022208, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)16:31:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I tried out niacin, galamantine, 5-HTP, and tea with the wbtb technique.

Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334). What makes Psalm 119 unique is the way that these requests are continually and explicitly grounded in the gift of the Torah and the psalmist&#039;s loyalty to it.</span><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm<wbr>_119", "time": 1675836180, "resto": 34013440}, {"no": 34033377, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)01:30:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34033220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34033220</a><br>Interesting.

Andrew Marr (he spent most of the time naked and screaming - off his head on some form of narcotic). John Scarlett (he was so drunk/drugged up that he had very little idea of what was going on around him). The Templars had captured a large amount of people whom they called the &#039;snakes&#039; i.e. slaves in a large dungeon underneath the castle. One brave person managed to set them free and the result in the neighbouring village of Mons and other places nearby, ensured that the British Army had to move in. Thus began the most incredible cover-up in recent European history. It was like WACO, Guyana. The British Army ordered those in the Castle to come out. They then sent a tank in to bulldoze the walls. Prince Philip and Prince William were in that Castle. Both of them had murdered countless tiny children in their rites. The British Army assembled watched as both walked out with large, dark, woven potato sacks over their heads. They were then bundled into a van and driven away. The British Army present at the time - may or may not have had any idea who they were but the SIS general there, certainly did. They might have managed to cover it up regarding the ordinary soldiers there but the videotapes are now on sale worldwide.

He was British Intelligence&#039;s &#039;ferryman&#039; who used to bring the kidnapped children in for their Illuminati rites. Rimington devised games along MKULTRA lines e.g. the assorted children at the Templar Castle were given the most evil-minded torture games to play, imaginable. Many were murdered in front of the other children to set an example: you must never ever talk about this cult or what we do or you will be murdered in a similar way. The parents who brought their own children with them (Richard and Judy were present) were terrorised into obedience. They had no choice. The McCanns were also present. This is why the wife knew immediately that Madelaine had been abducted by paedophiles. She could name them all too and has been paid hush money by them. J. K. Rowling is an actress. She never wrote the Harry Potter books. She has seen very little of the money made from either the books or merchandising. She was made to pay the McCanns hush money. Sir Philip Green was also compelled to do so. The last and most terrible blackmailer in this scenario was the Raven King of this Templar cult. Ratzinger.

Reality works like an engine or a clock. There are gears against gears against gears against gears. In this engine are not only your thoughts, but your considerations about hypothetical situations and also manifestations of reality itself.<br><br>You may have heard from some people that psychic abilities only happen when you&#039;re not trying, meaning the act of trying makes it stop. This is also referenced in the song &quot;Lost it to trying&quot; by Son Lux.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkL<wbr>T5krv_6c<br><br>So what I can infer is that your conscious existence and it&#039;s link to reality works like a clutch on a manual transmission. Once you apply intention, it moves the clutch so that you can&#039;t drive the engine with your conscious mind. Moving the clutch away from the engine disengages the engine, but the natural low-energy position is to be relaxed from the clutch and have it engaged. This is why psychic phenomenon always happens on accident.<br><br>You can also stall the engine or cause harmful impulse if you just let go of the clutch and let the engine engage &quot;accidentally&quot; on full throttle towards anyone or anything you&#039;re thinking of after previously being disengaged. This is where you&#039;ll get feedback like voices telling you to go away. You may also feel reflexes of the warp literally surround you and be the cause for anxiety etc.<br><br>So what you need to learn is how to disengage and engage the clutch of this manual transmission. Active intention disengages the clutch, but when you&#039;re relaxed, the engine of consciousness is naturally engaged with your surroundings and is designed to move seamlessly with reality around you. But once you apply intention, that intention&#039;s first response is to disengage.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dev<wbr>o3kdSPQY&amp;t=100s", "filename": "clutch-diagram", "ext": ".png", "w": 839, "h": 432, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 64, "tim": 1675891229508061, "time": 1675891229, "md5": "qHykEFYzoEb8V2iBSwlUhQ==", "fsize": 169835, "resto": 34031594}, {"no": 34037683, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)16:31:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34035109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34035109</a><br>Taking downers like xanax etc is the equivalent to turning off the engine in your car. The problem with this is that although it keeps you from engaging causality into your external surroundings, this low energy state makes you vulnerable to being &quot;driven&quot; by the external surroundings that you may be in proximity to, meaning that you would leave yourself as a low energy being vulnerable to &quot;possession&quot; or something like that.

Often times a hippy will continue to break general rules and social norms until the individual or community is forced to continue escalation way beyond what anyone thinks is reasonable.

Is it reasonable to beat someone up because they won&#039;t stop littering and sleeping in your yard? No, not with normal people, but with a hippy you have no choice, and by the end of it you&#039;re so aggravated you relish the violence, and you hate the person this fucking hippy made you become because they couldn&#039;t just be a normal goddamn person.", "filename": "d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675919907051428, "time": 1675919907, "md5": "ItPy3hxSBP2FM8RyfpDKgA==", "fsize": 20016, "resto": 34035563}, {"no": 34040871, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:08:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34040418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34040418</a><br>how many tabs do you take?", "time": 1675922933, "resto": 34035563}, {"no": 34040888, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:13:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34040631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34040631</a><br>holyshit, this is pretty accurate.", "time": 1675923229, "resto": 34035563}, {"no": 34040892, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:14:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34036773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34036773</a><br>fair-weather friends, maybe", "time": 1675923261, "resto": 34035563}, {"no": 34041025, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:43:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34040892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34040892</a><br>seems like everyone is a fair-weather friend", "time": 1675924995, "resto": 34035563}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34039317, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)20:22:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can someone explain to me how Satanists and Christians can have similar religious experiences, and describe the entities they worship/follow in similar ways? <br><br>I&#039;ve seen people talk about Lucifer and/or Satan in the exact same way Christians talk about Jesus. <br><br>Are these people all talking to the same entity?

First you should learn the paragon, the one from which all other rebellions were inspired, Lucifier. Like all demons, Lucifer is a loser. He&#039;s better than near anyone and in most ways, but people tend to not look down, but look up, especially someone like Lucifer. Lucifer looks at God. Lucifer thinks about God constantly. Lucifer is a cooler version of an incel obsessed with Giga-Chad. Now I just put Lucifer down a lot, but he&#039;s also inspirational if you want to do anything but worship God, the thing that created you to take part in his worship,which is rather suspicious in we&#039;re being honest. So maybe Lucifer has a point. As you see if I&#039;ve done my job, Lucifer exists in the same canon as christians, but chooses to respond to it in his own way. He is like Nimrod, someone created by God to be so great that they think they do not need God. Lucifer tries to take God&#039;s throne, but alas he loses, and God, perhaps out of mercy or spite, grants Satan&#039;s wish to be far from him, and so sends him to the darkest coldest darkest corner of the universe with the other fallen angels, so that Lucifer may larp as God. But Lucifer is still planning, and with materialist and spirtual knowledge will try again and again, and perhaps one day he might be free and win somehow if he never gives up. Satanism learns from this and says &quot;Do what thou wilt if thy can, but if in a stronger beings land bide your time and obey its laws until you gain the power to overthrow it. Do not give up on your ambitions or desires. Do not get psyop&#039;d by authority no matter how pathetic its historians will paint you. Know what you want and seek it out.

Here is the post that goes along with that picture from their patreon group:<br>This is the Karoopanayallayan Yantra for 6th - 15th Feb 2023.<br><br>This is different to the Arcanallayan Yantra (which is a Yantra that brings resonance with the Sun God Surya and positive Lokas). The Karoopanayallayan Yantra brings resonance with the Karoopanayal Tala Space but amplifies it on a 10 day basis by attaining resonance with two beings: Chandra (the Moon God) and Mada (the Demon born from the will of Chyavana). Thus it is made out of two Yantras: the every changing outer Chandra-Mada Yantra and the inner unchanging Karoopanayal Tala Yantra.<br><br>The Demon Mada is also known as Ukkandayyan in Dravidian Aaiyyani, and is an extremely powerful entity (so powerful that even Indra had to surrender to its power). So this combined Yantra: The Karoopanayallayan Yantra is incredibly powerful.<br><br>This Yantra shown will give you specific powerful negative energy for that week and was produced by a High Aaiyyanist. It will kick start each week with a great amount of negative energy that you can use for your own will. This is usually to gain wealth and power and commune with negative entities to gain their arcane knowledge.<br><br>As we are all part of the Marunatunilam School it is feasible to store positive energy and negative energy in our Chakra reservoirs to use as our will directs. They do not cancel each other out if you are correctly aligned in both paths. If you follow the non-Tantric path you can choose not to use this, and if you follow a Tantric path you may choose not to use the Arcanallayan Yantra. If you follow both paths as espoused by the Neutralist doctrine of Marunatunilam, then open both Yantras (Tala and Loka space).", "time": 1675907927, "resto": 34036150}, {"no": 34039542, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:00:05", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1675690983105040", "ext": ".png", "w": 960, "h": 1181, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675908005867023, "time": 1675908005, "md5": "EWKTSTtpZPVU36ZJuhdN+g==", "fsize": 1568053, "resto": 34036150}, {"no": 34039547, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:01:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34039473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34039473</a><br><a href=\"#p34039533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34039533</a><br>If you&#039;re interested in feeling the frequency of the positive yantra mentioned in the post for that time frame it is this one here", "filename": "Patreon post image-2", "ext": ".png", "w": 1977, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675908094089425, "time": 1675908094, "md5": "35HhigVo/23TCPJFhWrlMA==", "fsize": 2950604, "resto": 34036150}, {"no": 34039554, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)21:02:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OP here.

When I focus and return to this place, I have noticed that the pool changes color based on my emotional state before entering. She took the set of stairs leading up and out.

This might be a weirder and more esoteric subject but it combines two very /x/-heavy topics but in a more interesting combination of flavored way.<br><br>I have had dreams about UFOs ever since the first time I knew such a thing existed. As a kid I would have simpler dreams with saucers that reminded me of the friendlier aliens I was exposed to in cartoons and non-violent media, but as I got older and saw more violent and terrifying alien depictions, the dreams got more elaborate too.<br>I tend to never dream about aliens themselves though, but often times I dream of the following aspects of them:<br>A. UFOs, huge and colorful and weirdly shaped and surprisingly unlike anything I can describe in their geometry, in the sky often times moving at realistically fast and terrifying speeds, sometimes even seeing them enter the atmosphere or be chased/shot at by military jets that enter shortly after it appears<br>B. A period of time on the Earth where it is clear that there is some kind of war between people here on the ground and an outer-planetary force, though the dreams always have a sense that it isn&#039;t aliens from outerspace but rather some kind of breakaway humans who were gone for a period of time and returned, which leads to<br>C. More than one Moon in the sky, and a connection between those celestial bodies I see and the civilization attacking us. Sometimes it&#039;s like they came from the Dark Side of the Moon itself, or maybe a moon of Jupiter/Saturn, like a rocket went away in the 1950s and there are now generations who grew up on one of the moons that is most similar to Earth in gravity and bodily consistency. These dreams always have a connection of these weird moons in the sky being related to the war/infiltration from the very odd UFOs I see in dreams<br><br>weirder thing is, I have had these dreams reoccurring for years but usually only one or two a year.
