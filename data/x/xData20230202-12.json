Both the Devas and Asuras worship Shiva, and actually Devas were called Asuras also at one point. But the Asuras are mad at Vishnu and Indra, long story. They are all actually afraid of Shiva because when not with his gf he hangs out in graveyards dancing and smoking soma with his Cobra and ghost retinue, or just meditates on mountain peaks, instead of going to their god parties, then will suddenly destroy smite something or destroy the all the worlds even, so only Kali is of similar destruction power. So anyways about Lucifer, he is super white and shiny and his Robes, reflect all the colors, I don&#039;t know why in popular culture he often is depicted like Mehrunes Dagon, that is incorrect. He is a Wizard and a musician.I know it may shock you but that is because everyone is going crazy in Kali Yuga, so they are to afraid to accept it. Btw Kali Yuga has nothing to do with the Goddess Kali, it is pronounced different and is the name of a male demon. But their are no coincidences, and so tamas destruction energy is boosted so she gets even more buffed, but she&#039;s good, not bad. And the reason people incarnate in Kali yuga is because they want to.

That&#039;s because Yama is Remus and actually the brother of Manu who is Romulus, and is the substitute king of death, Shiva being the real Death God. Hades is of course an aspect of Zeus and Odin is a Death God too. And not only Death, but he also is the timespace continuum, as Kaal and Akasha. Of course the timespace continuum is \u00e6ther the 5th element, and Einstein was debunked when it was shown that the speed of light changes due to the influence the heavenly spheres, and with latitude. But Einstein just ignored it saying the effect of latitude wasn&#039;t big enough, but literally just ignored that sidereal time aka astrology correlated perfectly with the fluctuations. Anyways Shiva controls \u00e6ther, the materia prima, which is all mind and is time. Time destroys everything. Shakti his wife rules the infinite energy of the Chaos, the void yeinseits \u00e6ther.

But in my mind, I can&#039;t consider them more than acquaintances, as they only like what I&#039;ve shown them.

It was such an unfamiliar feeling, and I wondered if perhaps what I feel for her is friendship, so I asked her, and she said it is. It&#039;s such a rare and precious thing.

I haven\u2019t made out a letter or done anything else I would consider overt to court an entity.

I\u2019ve had morning wood each time I\u2019ve gotten up, whether from a short nap or deep sleep - I\u2019m 35 and that shit doesn\u2019t happen like it did when I was younger. I\u2019ve felt more flushed and warm - especially when I\u2019m by myself. My resting heart rate is normal over it\u2019s baseline but my average blood pressure has increased over 10 points systolic - I\u2019m normally a fairly healthy guy. I\u2019ve also been more easily aroused at small things. This I could all write off as simple psychosomatic responses (even though there\u2019s no other external cause of them). What I CANT describe is when I went to sleep today, while lying on my back, relaxed, I felt a definite pressure at the base of my penis - tightening gradually. Not unpleasant at all - just surprising. I wanted to let myself relax more mentally but after a few minutes I got up, after which the feeling stopped. What\u2019s more, after waking up from sleep, I get absolutely drained. I slept a good seven hours and felt like I barely slept at all. My wife said I was restless the entire time, talking in my sleep and moving all over. I\u2019m always a very quiet, still sleeper - again there hasn\u2019t been any other abrupt changes in my lifestyle to spark this. <br>Still trying to explain parts of this to myself in a logical way.

Eating sugar can feed the bacteria in your mouth that feeds on it and, along with tarter, becomes a film called plaque. The plaque will eat away at your enamel and irritate your gums, leading to oral problems down the line. While plaque may sound scary, everyone will deal with it in life. <br><br>Even healthy foods that are a part of a balanced diet, such as fruits and grains, contain sugar that affects bacteria and acid in your mouth. However, if you\u2019re following a keto diet, you cut out almost all foods that contain enough sugar to feed bacteria. Carbs are mostly responsible for all of the sugars in your bloodstream and mouth. You\u2019ll experience much less tooth erosion and decay if you aren\u2019t eating sugars. Of course, you still need to brush and floss regularly to keep your mouth healthy, but it\u2019s never wrong to reduce the factors that can harm you. <br><br>Less plaque also means fewer cavities. Sugars that stay on your teeth lead to dental decay. The bacteria that causes decay thrives in a sweet environment. Avoiding dietary sugars can reduce the likelihood of developing dental cavities.

In November 2007, a DailyMail journalist visited Kashmir and conducted an interview with the famous protester.<br><br>Despite being nicknamed a &quot;boy,&quot; Shakeel Ahmad Bhat is a 31 year-old bachelor living with his family in Kashmir, India. As a child, he grew up amidst the bloody turmoil of territorial conflict between India and Pakistan in the late 1980s. At age of thirteen, Bhat joined a local anti-Indian insurgency after witnessing his sister&#039;s death during a raid conducted by the Indian police forces. Eventually, he was captured by the Indian military and spent three years in prison. Though Bhat claims to have put his militant years behind him, he remains dedicated to political activism; he has demonstrated against the Pope&#039;s comments about Islam, against the sexual exploitation of Kashmiri girls, against police violence and against the controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammed. When he was shown the &quot;photoshopped images&quot;: of Islamic Rage Boy, he responded:<br><br>&quot;I surely get hurt when I see these pictures. This is terrorism for me.

Nowadays, there&#039;s probably a lot of competition for selling your soul. It seems like you can&#039;t sell your soul for a record deal or a successful career without already having the potential to do so by yourself. If you&#039;re some poor person with no connections, no family, no friends, no career and works a wage slave job, the devil couldn&#039;t care less about buying your soul, because he probably knows your going to hell anyways.

A fun question. One I do actually have a partial answer to.<br><br>Okay, so the whole lake of fire thing where you burn forever is just some nonsense that came about as a simple and metaphorical way to get the point across: it\u2019s bad.<br>There\u2019s no lake of fire and no million mansions with streets of gold. That\u2019s a Sunday school concept that\u2019s not at all an accurate representation of reality. What happens is that your body will die and your soul will move on. Where it goes doesn\u2019t depend on some \u2018naughty or nice\u2019 list that God has up in Heaven. It\u2019s dependent on the vibrational frequency of your soul. Either positive or negative.<br>You see, that\u2019s what we are all here to do. To choose our frequency, which we do every second of every day with our choices. It\u2019s vaguely like what people call karma, but not in the My Name Is Earl sense. The more bad you do, the more it weighs on your soul negatively.<br>So, you do enough bad, the frequency of your soul becomes negative. Then when you die, your soul moves to the next world. Either a positive one or a negative one. Positive ones house positive entities and negative ones house negative entities.<br>Now, there\u2019s a bunch more semantics and finer details about how it all works and various exceptions to the rules, but that is the gist of it. I don\u2019t know what the next worlds hold. Only speculation and theory, but I know it\u2019s not what every little tyke was told in church.<br><br>So don\u2019t worry about burning forever.

Insider Here. The US government has predicted war with China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia by 2025. This is known. What&#039;s not known is that the US government also predicts a general internal collapse in the US caused by an ongoing covert war between the various factions in the intelligence community and military. This in an ongoing, internal conflict that has been waged since WW2 without anyone&#039;s knowledge. They have given me intel that says the US will eventually either be invaded or collapse internally because of the US-Israel alliance. This dates back to a secret Masonic-Judaeo agreement conducted in 1782 at the congress of Willhelmsbald. Because I know this I have been subjected in the last week to a highly sophisticated psychological weapons system that operates through synthetic telepathy. This is actually a real program and not conjecture. I am writing this message to tell you that you need to leave America if you are aware of the NWO because the DOJ has put everyone&#039;s name in a case management system and has a perpetually rotation ranking system of all high value targets who do not go along with the mainline US foreign policy. If you are on this website it&#039;s a high likelihood you are in this database. Everyone needs to get long-term, paid visas to Asia and escape before any of these potential wars or collapses happen. They will put you on a no-fly list and this system has about a 1-2 month lead-time based on models of you behavior that have been made using predictive behavior analysis.

They are mainly just an intelligence gathering agency that gathers and analyzes signals intelligence from communication and electronic devices. iirc the NSA does have its own police force, but they usually defer the intelligence to other intel or law enforcement agencies who are designed to conduct action and countermeasures against whatever threats. As for the CIA, while we have the resources to conduct covert action, the Agency is limited by the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act in which conducting any espionage or &quot;psyops&quot; like you say would be a federal crime, since many of the people on 4chan are US citizens. I&#039;m not gonna say we do or don&#039;t, I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s technically very illegal and there have been people who have gone to prison for that. The NSA is actually supposed to get a FISA warrant just to be able to put a US citizen under surveillance but after 9/11 the president said fuck the warrants they can spy on whenever they want whenever they want. <br><br>IF AND IF there is a type of psyops being conducted on American citizens, whether it be gaslighting or whatever, my theory is that there&#039;s a completely off-the-books agency that isn&#039;t public knowledge like the rest of the alphabet orgs that do it.

I&#039;m being serious if someone fears you then they&#039;re only going to tell you what they think is enough to satisfy you and guarantee their safety. If however you get them to think they are safer with you then you can get them to willingly tell you things and even do things for you like infiltrate targeted circles (this is called &quot;running an agent&quot;) and I&#039;m very good at talking to people and playing to their sympathies and directing their goals to where they end up wanting to tell me everything and do for me whatever it takes to guarantee them whatever it is they want in return (unfortunately i cant always come through for the compensation but i always try to) Other operations include discovering hidden production sites in Jordan to where IED parts like initiators, ignition switches were put together and explosive precursors like ammonium nitrate were stored <br>cont.", "filename": "435235234532", "ext": ".gif", "w": 220, "h": 201, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 114, "tim": 1675335477466530, "time": 1675335477, "md5": "0jM5YfwPu/PdI80oBW69wQ==", "fsize": 157771, "resto": 33982031}, {"no": 33987893, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:58:41", "name": "Secret Smile", "com": "<a href=\"#p33982031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33982031</a><br>There was a reason i was born into the united states.

I learned a lot about IEDs and different ways they can be made! There are different kinds of IEDS with different delivery systems ranging from ghetto-rigged projectile types to improvised anti-personnel mines. Usually the ignition method was either tethered or times. Tethered means like there&#039;s some kind of connection like a cord/wire to the operator and they&#039;ll make it go boom when they want to.

Air Force sergeant Jonathan Lovette was assisting Major William Cunningham on a mission to recover scattered debris from a recent rocket test. The two military personnel ventured into the desert to search for the debris. Major Cunningham was shocked when he suddenly heard a loud scream. Assuming Lovette had been bitten by a snake, Cunningham crossed the dune to aid Lovette where he witnessed an unfathomable sight.<br><br>Instead of finding Lovette tending to a snake bite, Cunningham watched as the soldier was being dragged by a long serpentine arm wrapped around his legs, connected to a silver disk hovering in the air 15 to 20 feet away. The major found himself unable to move during the encounter, in a state of paralysis, Cunningham was only able to watch in horror until Lovette was pulled inside the craft which then took off with astonishing speed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/co<wbr>mments/qqw2o9/the_disturbing_human_<wbr>mutilation_of_jonathan_p/</span><br><br>So... no fucking wonder some of the aliens abduct cows.", "filename": "Babe the big blue ox", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 468, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1674997659908010, "time": 1674997659, "md5": "x2SikFAa2bRADTe+B0uvWQ==", "fsize": 95050, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958021, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661715401198", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997718916627, "time": 1674997718, "md5": "+/gEalFfMbmUCJ/utXuzvA==", "fsize": 972796, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958022, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958010</a><br><a href=\"#p33958004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958004</a><br><a href=\"#p33958001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958001</a><br> Absolutely not, you mongloid cointelpro wannabe faggot fucking glow bitches.<br><br>https://www.theblackvault.com/casef<wbr>iles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-tre<wbr>pang-ssn-674-march-1971/", "filename": "glowerers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674997720784313, "time": 1674997720, "md5": "Lw+IqQaf11hXYkKWpri9pw==", "fsize": 48878, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958026, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673795875791611", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674997780642169, "time": 1674997780, "md5": "vhgu+iA0fsrWX4sXqlblhw==", "fsize": 868389, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958033, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1668161218895432", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1674997844067726, "time": 1674997844, "md5": "hnG5MXJG+uK2CzCyfpjwrw==", "fsize": 1468817, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958039, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:11:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661881458144", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997906502974, "time": 1674997906, "md5": "sq5Q7rkavj2v9PUMw2rHfw==", "fsize": 784756, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958046, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958033</a><br>unironically i spent about 4 hours a few weeks ago looking into this and its the real deal.

I am trained as a physicist and I am confident in my experimental procedure. The precession I observed in about six consecutive experiments with different pendula was always in the counterclockwise direction indicating that I was actually in the southern hemisphere somewhere. I think it must be Antarctica, I believe I am still in Antarctica, and so are all the other posters in this thread.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul.

To understand pole shearing, you have to understand the basic geometry of a field. Fields are important because all observable physical phenomena adhere to the same rules as the field. <br>The shape of a field is toroidal as you likely already know; the donut shape with an infinitely small hole in the center. This donut shape comes about due to the behavior of the poles. The poles are acceleration vectors spinning in toward the center point. These poles define the function of gravity (being a total lack of a given magnitude of force) and the gravity &quot;action&quot; is what drives literally everything else. <br>The two poles (North, South) of any field spin opposite of each other in toward the center, but they do not stop at the center. The remnant of the motion is cast out the other side as magnetism, that meaning expansion. So the southern pole of any field is what pushes out the northern hemisphere of the expansion of that same field. The opposing pole directly mutes this effect, causing net interference between the inward acceleration that eventually defines the field shape. This shape is not an absolute thing though, but rather has a gradient of possible configurations. What determines these configurations is the power of the poles. By increasing spin, the power of the pole increases (power has nothing DIRECTLY to do with energy, as the poles lack appreciable energy in their magnitude/tier). As the pole&#039;s power grows, the expansion from the other side is further muted down. This causes a spinning mass to inevitably assume a ring shape as all the magnitude (where lesser fields can propagate) is squashed out toward the equator.<br>Take a look at the Sombrero galaxy for example, or Hoag&#039;s Object.

Perhaps some of the luminescence is light from the Sun that is bent, carried along the &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;bands&quot; of the magnetic field, and trapped in the interior center (functionally a zero-point). This miniature false sun would function somewhat similarly to a lower magnitude of black hole, only operating on energetic levels, rather than massive levels; slowly leaking trapped light and electromagnetism back out as dull illumination and jettisoning more from the poles.

As I was heading to the house I noticed these lights above me. There were 3 distinct lights that what I interpreted as an upside down tail of a helicopter.

The high school bits seem like your brain playing a &quot;what could have been&quot; idea on repeat so the way you interact with them, as parts you go through in a larger dream, is good, lingering on hypotheticals is bad for the mind so props to you. Likewise, the wandering bits make me think that your mind is encouraging you to get out more as our brains are made for the active lives of hunter-gatherers. Also, I&#039;m no psychologist, but your experiences in high school, the anxieties and overthinking, match pretty well with the effects of child neglect, so it&#039;s natural for your dreams to be influenced by that. And honestly mate, I would encourage you to just go out to the nearest park and just wander about. You could listen to music or something while doing that but just get out of your house more and be in motion. As for the whole &quot;being social and getting a gf&quot; part, that&#039;s better left to you and time, but know 2 things, that there is beauty and contentment to be found in solitude, and that the former idea doesn&#039;t stop you from striving for love in its many forms.

I continue following along a trail. There\u2019s a large bundle of lumber blocking the road I had to move and skirt arond, and I\u2019m one side of the road drops down into a steep valley. Eventually I hit on a point in the trail where a series of lions and tigers start walking towards me. at this point I\u2019m male, and me, again, and I have a knife in my hand, but I sit very still against the wall on the opposite side of the trail to the valley and hope they pass me by. Some do, some seem like they\u2019re gonna harm me, then pass by, two don\u2019t, and they fade from lions and tigers to two punk troublermaking humans, and then they start making moves to hurt me, and I realize that they\u2019re not lions and tigers but a berserkir and ulfhednar. They start changing into their wolf and bear forms but I use the knife and in a bloody fight I eviscerate both of them. Then I realize that I\u2019m also a berserkir and had partially changed to my bear form in the fight.

My father died when I was 10, but even before then he was away a lot and also he had aspergers so my relationship with him was mixed. After he died my relationship with my mother became extremely poor, she just took all her stresses and anxieties (she&#039;s an almost unbelievably anxious person) out on me, and my response was just to mentally shut down and take it. I started obsessively studying theology and philosophy to understand why I was so depressed. Then in my sophomore year of high school I discovered 4chan and it helped me to realize what I had been missing in life. My relationship with my mother got better over time but the scars from that period run so deep I&#039;m not sure they&#039;ll ever fully heal.

This probably represents my attempts to escape through theological and philosophical studies.

Vitamin E from food sources is listed as &quot;d-alpha- tocopherol&quot; on food packaging and supplement labels. Synthetic (laboratory-made) vitamin E is listed as &quot;dl-alpha-tocopherol&quot;. Some food-sourced vitamin E supplements provide other forms that are vitamin E-related, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. They constitute the vitamin E complex. All of those must be present to utilize vitamin E efficiently to accomplish the many things that our bodies perform with it. Some people take large doses because they believe or hope that doing so will keep them healthy or lower their risk of certain diseases.<br><br>The myth is that we have to derive vitamin E from food or supplemental sources. The truth is that our bodies create vitamin E from completely raw natural fats through healthy natural bacterial processing during digestion. If digestion is healthy and uncontaminated, during digestion, our bodies&#039; intestinal bacteria not only fractionate food molecules but redesign them, including the production of vitamin E. Cooking, processing and chemically treating food destroys creative bacteria in our intestines, causing massive deficiencies such as vitamin E.

Most food manufacturers sell waste as animal feed that will grow inferior and diseased animals for meat, diary and eggs. All animals have grown and been vital on their natural raw diets, disease-free for millions of years. As Hippocrates stated, let food be your medicine and medicine be your food. Processed chemicallized fodder is not a natural diet to any creature.<br><br>In &quot;natural&quot; supplement-manufacturing what actually happens is, a well-meaning person representing a company approaches representatives at laboratories and asks for bids or estimates for cost of producing an &quot;all natural&quot; vitamin supplement.

Something truly extraordinary and special happened to me when I was a young boy, but few people believe me when I say it. I want to tell you all here because this board is dedicated to the paranormal and what I have to say is patently paranormal, nonetheless some of you may not believe it. A few years ago in the early half of 2020 I experienced a strange episode of recollection of a paranormal experience that happened to me when I was 13, this event in my life began with me receiving a text message from my mother&#039;s cell phone number that read &quot;all my life I have struggled with correct behaviors.&quot;, then I started to remember what happened to me. In short, I think that in my past when I was a young boy I became telepathic and I communicated with cosmic entities, communicated with God and extraterrestrials. I was kneeling by my bed praying to God as a Christian when I became psychic and a voice answered my prayers and they explained to me they are the galaxy we inhabit. The galaxy is a living non-corporeal entity.

Last year I went out to lunch with my friend and he ordered a strawberry shake. When the shake arrived, I knew something was very wrong. I looked at the shake top to bottom, it was a high fidelity caramel shake! I asked my friend if he ordered a caramel shake by mistake. He said, no it&#039;s a strawberry shake. I did a double take and sure enough it was a strawberry shake with a cherry on top. That was possibly one of the strangest moments of my life and the only time I&#039;ve seen something like that happen. <br><br>So to this day I&#039;m convinced that the universe is made up of ideas that are competing for expression on a physical canvas.<br><br>When you step back and look at unadulterated nature and that which hasn&#039;t been cultivated by humans, human craft and technology looks very strange. To get even more absurd, the idea of one thing truly being another or appearing/vanishing completely seems very human. Nature flows and circles back on itself. But humanity is full of straight lines, edges and axises. <br><br>My grander point is even though we are very different from animals we are still a part of nature cosmically. Like photographs for instance capture light waves. And when we see those pictures it triggers things in our brain. So is reality housing the truth or are our brains?

I.e. sloth is sinful because it&#039;s embracing a lesser base good (resting, for instance) over a superior higher good (say, giving alms to the poor). What defines an evil act is when a person does an act that is embracing a lesser good over a greater good. To use an example a friend gave, if you are angry at someone and hit them then that is a sin because you&#039;re placing your personal sense of justice (and seeking justice is inherently a good thing, it is good to be just) over a greater good (reconciliation and forgiveness, or brotherly correction). This is important to understanding Hell, as we understand that committing evil acts disposes us to seek lesser goods over higher goods.<br><br>Secondly, what is Heaven? Heaven is the beatific vision. It is seeing the truth for what it is. It is seeing God directly and being in His presence. To the just man this is a fount of joy as the just man loves God and seeks to be in His presence. The just man is the man who has disposed himself to seeking the higher goods over the lesser goods: he avoids lust as a base, lower good in favor of prayer or earnest human companionship. He eschews gluttony in favor of restrained eating, so that he can have more to help others or to save so that he can raise a family (which in turn, fulfills another good: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply&quot; as the birth of more just ones gives glory to God and increases good in the world through *their* works). He seeks to serve God recognizing that our God is the highest good in Whom nothing is lacking and in Whom all good is plentiful. Who is goodness Himself. Thus the soul of a good disposition will flee to God&#039;s love even if he must at first go through purification of his minor sins (what we call Purgatory).", "time": 1675289438, "resto": 33966021}, {"no": 33983988, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)17:11:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33983980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33983980</a><br>Then what is Hell? Hell is the absence of God&#039;s grace. Are there punishments in Hell? Certainly, the withdrawal of God&#039;s grace, in absence of which a person cannot rise to do higher goods. There are punishments that vary based on sins and such and such. But understand this: Hell is chosen. The soul that is condemned to Hell chooses his place in Hell. He sees God in his final moments and even with the graces bestowed by our Lord at moment of death willingly jumps into the (essentially metaphorical) flames of Hell. The hardened sinner who chooses this is the person who has not disposed himself to seeking out greater goods. He has sought out lust over any other use of time. He has avoided Mass in favor of watching pornography. He has not seeked to serve God but to enjoy base pleasures of the material kind to their utmost. He therefore has chosen to avoid the highest good in favor of the least of goods. Why would a man who has for all his life seeked to separate himself from God now seek Him after death? He would have to give up his sin. He would have to accept God&#039;s Love over what he has chosen to love. He would have to finally give up all those little habits he has learned to seek over the very epitome of Beauty in front of him. Thus, he decides at moment of death to continue in his depravity, and that is what God grants him. Separation from Him and punishment, just as the hardened sinner would choose over the love and presence of our God.", "time": 1675289500, "resto": 33966021}, {"no": 33985390, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:53:31", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Limbo", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3072, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675302811128890, "time": 1675302811, "md5": "bFdwAdtwblmNDVX70I1IQA==", "fsize": 1945822, "resto": 33966021}, {"no": 33987602, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)03:59:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33985390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33985390</a><br>Hmm", "time": 1675328387, "resto": 33966021}, {"no": 33987633, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)04:09:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33983988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33983988</a><br>I dont think anyone wants to go to hell.

He had planned to stay over the weekend so he could watch the Dallas Cowboys, his favorite team, play in Super Bowl XXVII, their first appearance in the National Football League&#039;s championship game in 14 years.

Lewis was not home, but they found the VCR was still recording the telecast, and had begun doing so before the game started.[4] In the refrigerator there were two turkey sandwiches, and laundry had been left in the washing machine. His wedding ring and watch were on the kitchen counter.[2] Karen Lewis assumed her husband had been watching the game, perhaps at a friend&#039;s house, and returned to work afterwards.[4]<br><br>The next day, February 1, a Dallas taxi driver later recalled taking a man looking like Lewis from a hotel to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS.

If, as Evola puts it, divine war is ordained and justified bc \u201cGod was called as a witness and would bestow his favor upon the victor\u201d then why not call God as a witness to a divinely ordained coin flip, and avoid the gruesome and pointless violence and bloodshed of war? The answer of course is because a rock paper scissors match or a coin flip would not appease the corrupted man\u2019s need for senseless violence to inflate their overgrown egos. and if it was a bloody battle that these brothers desired, could they not have fought it amongst themselves rather than sending thousands of men into battle to kill one another under the justification of settling the dispute for them?? absolutely ridicoulous that Evola fails to see the hypocrisy and senselessness of it all.<br><br>Although Evola does credit the terms of this specific battle as being more civil and humane than most, since they agreed to not loot and pillage, and also they agreed to care for wounded soldiers; the problem is that he begins with the faulty axiom that men must do war in the first place, so therefor it\u2019s best that they do war in the spirit of the Gods. Why not strive for a higher ideal of man and society tho?

The reason for the drastic change in man and woman&#039;s collective choices is directly related to the fact that according to the modern scientific consensus, GOD IS DEAD; and the reason the modern scientific consensus is that &quot;God is dead&quot; is bc those at the helm steering the social trends and views have used their immense power and influence to purposefully deceived men into accepting such a paradigm. for example:", "filename": "breaking out of platos cave ", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1232, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1675160194822965, "time": 1675160194, "md5": "0/GpodKqfe24Nzq86m9wog==", "fsize": 1230892, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33972677, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)05:18:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33972671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33972671</a><br>Even mainstream science communicators like Bill Nye push the idea that the model should make people feel insignificant:<br>https://youtu.be/_jyLGoVtd5s<br><br>They want you to feel that way.

Your entire write-up is built on an erroneous foundation anyways: the idea of the &quot;Holy War&quot;, or that there is metaphysical meaning in martial prowess, did not originate with Evola or any of the traditionalists. First off, a warrior &quot;creed&quot; that abided by a higher law was central to the warrior caste in every traditional civilization. Samurai, Knights Templar, Teutonic Order, The Kshatriyas, I could go on and on. Secondly, this phenomenon was not the result of the ruling classes propaganda like you are claiming, as if the kings in these societies made up a bunch of wacky spiritual stuff to justify war. To these men, combat was something that resembled a spiritual experience: overcoming fear of death and all human instincts of self-preservation. Aligning oneself with an &quot;unshakable courage&quot; that is the foundation of illumination as the Buddhists said. Combat was a &quot;contest&quot; in the highest stakes game known to man.

The air pressure will then be the same at every point in the chamber. It will be the same at the top, bottom, middle, and at all sides. Just like the air pressure in your car tires or a balloon or a SCUBA tank.<br><br>This thought experiment debunks the entire flat Earth model.

Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?).

Violence IS NOT prohibited by the Golden Rule. Treating others how I want to be treated completely allows for the justification of a well-deserved asswooping. If someone were to infringe on my personal boundaries or physically assault me or my loved ones, it is in their best interest that i stand up for myself and do everything in my power to take control of the situation and teach them that there are consequences to violating the Golden Rule themselves. if I were to be unjustly transgressing on someone else&#039;s wellbeing, it is in MY best interest that i be taught a lesson, be that thru physical or social consequences for my shitty behavior. <br><br>When you choose the golden rule as your highest virtue, you intrinsically develop a sense of right/wrong that is not able to be manipulated by the trends of the times. what is best for your wellbeing is to respect others in the same way you expect to be respected. if you dont want another person to force their worldview upon you by means of manipulation and/or physical force, youre not going force your worldview on them by means of manipulation and/or physical force. As soon as the Golden Rule is violated by either party, the transgressor has immediately opened themselves up to whatever consequences are necessary to correct that specific behavior, and as long as those consequences themselves do not violate the Golden Rule, they are justified.<br><br>obviously there are subtle nuances to the Golden Rule, and its not always quite as black and white as the examples i provided above, but the paradigm IS robust enough as a guiding principle of one&#039;s life to act as compass pointing them towards the kingdom of heaven.", "filename": "the golden rule", "ext": ".gif", "w": 780, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675205268706338, "time": 1675205268, "md5": "wLWrl/qL403PHBgBzUi9lQ==", "fsize": 121461, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33976826, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:52:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33975973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33975973</a><br>Look dude, I don&#039;t have the time or patience to respond in several successive posts to everything you said.

You seem to focus a lot on hypothetical circumstances where the ruling class is corrupted and feeding out lies to its military for its own purposes. While I would never claim that this has never happened, such an attitude of the royalty represents a deviation from the primordial &quot;soul&quot; that animates a civilization during its apex, its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, or when it can be truly considered &quot;traditional&quot; from the point of view of the perennialists. When this happens, it represents a decline in the quality of that civilization. In a type of civilization that is more aligned to this primordial purity (which is absolutely a real thing, the only thing might I add that can be said to bestow legitimate power onto a being or entity, being itself ultimately synonymous with God), war has an entirely different character than what you&#039;re describing, and is not embarked on recklessly in pursuit of material gain, for desire of material wealth already represents the decline of royalty.<br><br>There are certain peoples that are by their inherent nature more prone to violence and martial action.

In mass panic, everyone flocked to the ocean to prevent themselves from being closer to it. <br><br>In waves people slowly but surely succumbed to staring into it, and when they did, they would either show horror or pure bliss and sink to the bottom of the ocean. <br><br>Numerous black hole suns began to approach from all angles of the sky until there was nowhere to look but down. <br><br>My companion during our floating in the ocean finally looked into the black sun and her face lit up with pure glee. I asked her to explain what was happening and she simply moaned and went underneath the water.<br><br>Ahead of me a large school of orca whales began to form, and I thought their black and white skin was reflections of the black suns off of the water. As the suns grew closer, the orcas themselves all stared into the black suns and they themselves sank to the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>Thinking I would be the last living thing left alive, I too then stared into the black sun. Immediately I felt an incredibly powerful sensation as pure white light overtook my entire field of view and I saw a short flash of two elder men. In this millisecond they explained that life on earth was over and it was now time for all consciousness to escalate into their domain. Every living creature was to be judged by their actions. <br><br>I received a neutral judgement but the creatures informed me this was still not blessings, and that I would be cast out of \u201cGod\u2019s\u201d light but that it would not be eternal torment.<br><br>I woke up at this point drenched in sweat", "filename": "77A2FA82-D04F-43DA-9C6B-76C3EA62ECA5", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 699, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675291676373253, "time": 1675291676, "md5": "qdTsL9K8Z6SvzCUQH5d8uQ==", "fsize": 765631, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-my-dream-just-now-there-was-a-woman-outside", "replies": 15, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 33984238, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)17:49:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In another reality your dream is reality.", "time": 1675291782, "resto": 33984223}, {"no": 33984278, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)17:54:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019m hoping someone can help make sense of the dream, it was incredibly intense", "time": 1675292049, "resto": 33984223}, {"no": 33984382, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)18:04:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pls reply with dream interpretations, thnx", "filename": "DF870E91-FE68-4BA7-BBE1-3745C87117B7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 259, "h": 194, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675292663573139, "time": 1675292663, "md5": "5Hi+UtghZ6uM2I4nufhUgg==", "fsize": 6868, "resto": 33984223}, {"no": 33984470, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)18:13:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33984223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33984223</a><br>Welcome to earth.

YHWH and &#039;Jesus&#039; waited 4000 years to provide &quot;salvation&quot; to the poor goyim wretches who believed they could obtain it, yet the narrow path says that only a few will find it. This narrow path has expanded to an 8-lane freeway - and somebody is going to be very, very disappointed! God is allegedly &quot;Love&quot;, but in Jesus&#039; mind that means &quot;Obedience&quot;. Therefore, your God loathes Humanity and only rewards those who hate Humanity along with him. This supernatural so-called &quot;Love&quot;, is only unquestioning Obedience to Him and His repugnance for a disgusting Humanity. Faith means blindly accepting doctrines that have no basis in reality at all, worshipping a clock-making God of absolute Order. The Solar System and the Universe are not Orderly, they are only depleted Chaos. Only one man said that His salvation is for everyone who believes, yet Jesus tells a woman that he doesn&#039;t mean Samaritans and they aren&#039;t welcome and was embarrassed by her reply. He was amazed that the goyim centurion Cornelius had any faith at all! The only witnesses to His Resurrection were the 3 Marys. The only person that went to preach to the goyim was &quot;st&#039;&quot; Paul! Paul also gave a man and his wife over to &#039;Satan&#039; for having &#039;seller&#039;s&#039; remorse over some land they said they would give his church.<br>If Jesus&#039; blood covers your &quot;sin&quot; then you haven&#039;t been forgiven by the Father for being imperfect. He just magically can&#039;t see it anymore, just like in the OT with animal sacrifices! The Christian God is therefore a schizo in the worst way!

These were collected in the 4th century, by Lobon of Argos, an orator, but his collection has disappeared.

I know where we are and I know how easy is to &quot;see signs&quot;, oh believe me i do. Maybe you are indeed supsetible or you two are fated or what have you, but even if thats the case, it&#039;s always good to consider how emotionally charged these &quot;signs&quot; are. Essentially ask yourself if you are in a position where you can be unbiased as to how you recognize them. If they feel too tailored to your situation, too frequent whilst being emotionally overwhelming then my advise is to lean on the factual and what you know about the situation instead of ethereal signs. Their reactions and their words should always take precedence over dreams or coincidences. Otherwise when does this stops? If you needed information by the divine, you already had it, if you keep seeing it, then maybe it&#039;s you. <br><br>God I know it&#039;s difficult, I have made my own shows of paranoia here very recently because of how many &quot;signs&quot; I saw or felt all over the place, too much on my nose if you ask me and maybe a bit of trolling in some cases but If a situation is weird enough for me to question it then I know i am not being unbiased in my perception. <br><br><br>Anyways, enough /adv/ from my part.

I realize these things intuitively (serving others and spreading positivity) and have learned how important they are over the years but I rarely implement them. (I&#039;m not certain why exactly, I think it&#039;s my health making things very difficult to do.) I view generosity though as the easiest and best way to go combat evil and negativity in this world, that and finding, understanding, and sharing the truth. <br><br>I&#039;ve put myself in extremely negative situations before intentionally and unintentionally and it feels like my suffering is what has always given me the most power and energy and ability to change and create and transform. From being put into a psych ward (multiple times, the first:) because of my mother lying to the government. Being in jail because of using benzos and blacking out, and while in jail having extreme pain for days and almost losing a part of my body and being unable to even sleep. Almost dying due to cutting my arm open, when I think about it still it hurts my soul. There were many odd circumstances around that event, such as someone trying to give me a ride that I didn&#039;t recgonize and knowing my name. There&#039;s a lot. Being homeless, etc.<br><br>In the same vein as this I&#039;ve been wondering if doing negative things to myself or going into the depths of depravity is worth it simply to experience these things, but even then I don&#039;t have the energy to even do that. <br><br>What do you mean be aware of my breathing? Is there a proper way to breathe you&#039;ve been taught? Or do you just mean be aware of the feeling itself? <br><br>I am serious about the psychic and spiritual path because I don&#039;t want to waste what I&#039;ve been given, it is unique and powerful, and I can use it to help others and improve their lives in many ways. It is the same reason why I want to cultivate my creativity, I want to give others what I have.

When you&#039;re enjoying life, you don&#039;t ask questions like why am I here, what am I doing here, what&#039;s the purpose of Life? You just live it, enjoy it, and die.

This differs from what you hear in Western Buddhism, which is that you get to jhana through focusing meditation practices and eventually randomly enter jhana. Those meditation practices are the opposite of abandonment, because you&#039;re actively chasing novel experiences. <br>You basically can enter jhana by being bored, and sustaining that until the mind &#039;dries up&#039; from the water of sensuality. Then once the mind is free of sensual obsession, the mind enters jhana. This is how I understand his teachings and was able to enter the first jhana once as a layperson for about 10-15 seconds on account of this, and a video about entering the first jhana by Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero.

Once that happens, if someone were to drag him to that same pit of embers he used to be addicted to, he&#039;d be fighting to get away, because now that pit of embers would be exclusively painful.<br>Senuality is the same way. People just cover up that fundamental lack of ease/lack of comfort/dukkha/whatever with sensual pleasures.<br>Jhana is a temporary liberation from this.

to get rid of that puts us in a place where we are constantly distracting ourselves or running away from what&#039;s right in front of us.<br><br>It&#039;s also quite informative to understand that the body is ultimately not satisfactory The mind is ultimately not satisfactory so we don&#039;t cling to these experiences but rather we can continue our practice of doing good deeds doing acts of

Can you advise what this means or how I should deal with this?<br>Do you know of any other illusions that someone would experience after meditating?<br>Also: sometimes during meditation I get significant bursts of ANGER which completely disrupt my meditation. I also get irritations: sensitivity to noises, itching, other things. It&#039;s also possible that several persistent illness-problems have occurred in association with my meditation.

Could you please elaborate?</span><br>So, this is very controversial in these threads, but Neville&#039;s ultimate advice regarding anything is to go to the end without devising the means. When it comes to love, he considers determining WHO you&#039;re with in the end, as devising the means. So if you want to be married or whatever, he says to focus on the feeling of being happily married, and you will be guided to end up in a happy marriage.<br><br>The thing is, doing things this way might (emphasis on might, not guaranteed) make you end up with a different person than what you had in mind. So I totally understand that people stray from this advice, whether because of sentimentality, or just being afraid in general of going this route.<br><br>A different teacher I read basically laid out similar advice by explaining it like this: If that person&#039;s really your soulmate, then nothing can take them from you. If they&#039;re not, then you should do this anyways so that you can both find your soulmates.<br>So after reading that, my point of view is that anyone that doesn&#039;t do things this way, doesn&#039;t have real faith that they&#039;re with the right person.
