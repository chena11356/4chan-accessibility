Last year my girlfriend broke up with me. I was a mess, just a complete wreck. Constantly fighting back tears and crying myself to sleep at night, I had negative thoughts pretty much 24/7 and was badly depressed. We eventually started talking to eachother again after about a week, but that was because I reached out. She was cold and completely uninterested in talking to me. I came from a place of lack and put so much weight and importance on every conversation we had. I felt the need to make her laugh or fall for me again, make every interaction enjoyable for her. Every time we interacted it felt like do or die for me. Anything she needed, I was there. Constantly checking my phone, constantly checking her social media. Eventually after a month of talking we got back together after she said she still loved me. For all intents and purposes I shouldn&#039;t have gotten her back. What did I do or what happened exactly? I remember being so obsessive, I even kept a journal tracking every little interaction with her so I could compare how interested in me she was as the days went by. I think I also recall writing down affirmations. I knew of LoA but not to the extent I know now. If anything I was more following Law of Attraction. I was still a mess. I bought crystals and when I would meditate I didn&#039;t even really know what I was doing.<br><br>Now fast forward a year, around the exact date 1/29 and she broke up with me again.

This time around is much worse though as there&#039;s a 3P involved. So, obviously this event occurred due to my insecurities and doubts in myself. We had a nasty breakup, we&#039;re talking again but she&#039;s being the most cold and uninterested I&#039;ve ever seen her.

They exist there. Mankind lost its link. I don&#039;t have prior knowledge of them. I have to look them up when I wake up.<br><br>These beings I meet seem to like me enough to teach me to become better as an individual, one for personal gain, and the other because I tend to spread these habits to other people.<br><br>I&#039;m very convinced that despite falling out of practice for a year, something, someone, has a clear intention for me to return to that practice and works hard to make this intent known. I know this because things are somehow falling into place where they normally should not. The causal probabilities should not be possible. There are too many factors out of my control that have to not only fall into place, but fall into place early and exactly when I need it. Never early, never late. Always exact. By all means I should be six weeks late and too late to seize opportunities in the future right now.<br><br>My personal perception also no longer clearly delineates between waking and dreaming life. The boundaries are degrading and the only coping mechanism I can devise is to consider all of this to be normal.", "filename": "1651616623394", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 990, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676618264511435, "time": 1676618264, "md5": "tPmyAPO4Lh8FNMYbRFMDMw==", "fsize": 278011, "resto": 34104326}, {"no": 34108156, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)02:54:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34104488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34104488</a><br>Tell me more about gatekeepers", "time": 1676620441, "resto": 34104326}, {"no": 34109217, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)07:25:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u201cVectors\u201d on wave 3 was trippy as hell last night.

They\u2019re almost worse than doctors in the way they play off our emotional attachment to our pets while raping our pocketbooks in the process. <br><br>For example, i\u2019ve got two tabby cats, one orange (M) and one grey (F), same litter, 3 years old. Had to take the female in for a bite wound shortly after I adopted her and let them give her the three year rabies vaccine at the time. Never took the male in for his. Both had the original one year rabies shot before adoption. Ever since, the female has had periodic health issues with an exorbitantly expensive bacterial infection that they wanted to keep her on meds for six months to treat that showed up shortly after the vax. Gave it a month and then dropped the meds and she was fine. The male on the other hand who did not get second rabies vax has had zero health issues and seems to be perfectly healthy all around.<br><br>At this point, I\u2019m doing for them what I\u2019m doing for myself - high quality food, no vaccines, regular deworming/anti parasite treatments, and only using vet for wounds or other trauma events I can\u2019t treat myself. <br><br>So yes, I would def focus on getting your doggos on the best feed you can find.

Here goes.<br><br>My suspicion is there is an infection loop driven by interactions between cryptococcus neoformans and Sars-CoV-2 that is behind the current wave of COVID-related immune failures. I&#039;ll include some articles to support below for you all to check. <br>The idea is that immunodeficiencies allow latent cryptococcosis at low levels, then introduction of a virus induces macrophage vomocytosis of those live cryptococcus spores into the hippocampus, these then follow the innervation route from hippocampus to thymus. The cryptococcus cells would then be the major player behind accelerated thymic failure/involution. <br><br>This leads us to the current scenario of na\u00efve t-cells and issues with stem-to-T-cell differentiation. Severely damaged thymus = lowered thymosin B1, if there&#039;s any. Lack of or interruption of t-cell maturation in the thymus via the process outlines above is leading to infections of old viruses that we have been vaccinated against for decades like polio. Add to this a decrease in BPC-157 that is also produced in the thymus and is one of the best healing comounds the body synthesizes endogenously, and now your body can&#039;t heal the damage that&#039;s set in. <br>I&#039;m going to follow this with some links (as usual) to support the theory.

I captured a few war trophies like wallets, phones or hats, but one especially hot day I was exploring an area I&#039;d not visited before. While there, I found an absolutely enormous old-growth softwood tree. Thing was massive, easily 15 feet around at the base.<br>It had good coverage if I wore good camouflage and offered a good view of a highway the tweakers used. One especially hot afternoon I was patrolling when I sat down at the base of the tree and rested a moment.<br>I leaned back, drank from my canteen and closed my eyes for a bit. When I did that the wind picked up and I began to shiver from the unseasonable cold. I opened my eyes, turned to my right and saw it.<br>There was a human silhouette, about 30 feet in the air. It was totally transparent, about the size of an average adult man, and hovered perfectly still in midair in front of the Alder trees behind it. It was clear enough that I could see the trees behind perfectly, all that was there was the outline of a man, without legs. It just trailed off into nothingness. It was like reality was embossed around the shape of this thing, and I could feel it was just staring at me. A slow, creeping horror came over me as I stared at it. I blinked and it stayed in place. I blinked again and it didn&#039;t disappear still.<br><br>cont.", "filename": "Old Growth Forest", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676569401800143, "time": 1676569401, "md5": "kUsg0dbNUeDnT9GcIJneuQ==", "fsize": 1613128, "resto": 34096551}, {"no": 34102703, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)12:45:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34102688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34102688</a><br>I felt paralyzed with uncertainty and fear. It was clear I was in this thing&#039;s home and I was not welcome. <br>I sat up and slowly I looped the shoulder strap of my backpack over my arm, grabbed my rifle with my other hand, and in an instant I was on my feet, turned away and running the opposite direction while the wind kicked up again. Even in direct 98-degree sunlight I still felt as cold as in winter. Trees shook, leaves fell around me while I sprinted through the swamp back to familiar territory, till I realized I was totally lost. I ran in the direction I&#039;d come from, from familiar territory, but I was nowhere I&#039;d been before, in a clearing in the swamp. I took cover behind a fallen tree and began appraising the situation.<br><br>I was still alive, far as I could tell I was still thinking rationally. I knew the direction I came from, and relative to that I had a rough idea of where the road was, the creek was still present, and if I followed it far enough I would eventually find where I came from. Slowly I began exploring the clearing, and found a small trail behind another old Cedar, where I was the tree was blocking the exit from view perfectly. I still felt like I was being watched, and I wasn&#039;t welcome, but I followed the trail and after about a quarter mile (I was only about a hundred yards from familiar grounds when I began running) I finally found my way back to my property.<br><br>It took me a long, long time to return to that area, I&#039;m man enough to admit I was terrified of what I&#039;d seen. Eventually I got balls enough to return with a better plan, and soon after arriving the wind kicked up again, just as violent as last time. This time I began to pray, and (using advice from dumbass wannabe pagans I used to know) audibly spoke into the woods that I had no idea what that thing I saw was and that I have no quarrel with it, but it does not have my permission to follow me home, nor do I allow it to follow anybody I know or care about.<br><br>cont.", "time": 1676569552, "resto": 34096551}, {"no": 34102739, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)12:51:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34096643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34096643</a><br><a href=\"#p34096675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34096675</a><br><a href=\"#p34096700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34096700</a><br><a href=\"#p34098011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098011</a><br><a href=\"#p34098762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098762</a><br><a href=\"#p34098786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098786</a><br><a href=\"#p34098800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098800</a><br><a href=\"#p34098813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098813</a><br><a href=\"#p34098824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098824</a><br><a href=\"#p34098839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098839</a><br><a href=\"#p34098853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098853</a><br><a href=\"#p34098858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098858</a><br><a href=\"#p34098879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098879</a><br><a href=\"#p34098888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098888</a><br><a href=\"#p34098896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098896</a><br><a href=\"#p34098917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098917</a><br><a href=\"#p34098922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098922</a><br><a href=\"#p34098932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098932</a><br><a href=\"#p34098958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098958</a><br><a href=\"#p34098970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34098970</a><br><a href=\"#p34099003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099003</a><br><a href=\"#p34099027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099027</a><br><a href=\"#p34099054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099054</a><br><a href=\"#p34099061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099061</a><br><a href=\"#p34099071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099071</a><br><a href=\"#p34099483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099483</a><br><a href=\"#p34099536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099536</a><br><a href=\"#p34099543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099543</a><br><a href=\"#p34099562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099562</a><br><a href=\"#p34099602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099602</a><br><a href=\"#p34099606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099606</a><br><a href=\"#p34099631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099631</a><br><a href=\"#p34099647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099647</a><br><a href=\"#p34099658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099658</a><br><a href=\"#p34099666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34099666</a><br><a href=\"#p34100568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34100568</a><br>These are WAY TOO fucking long.

He&#039;d say he was trying to dig down into the tunnel that &quot;The Zippers&quot; used when they wanted to steal things from his home and escape undetected back into the woods. The Zippers were so called because of their speed, they&#039;d zip in and out again.

Even better if she has a Libra moon, because the opposition can make for a love-hate relation that somehow works. I&#039;d say avoid Scorpio moons, because they will absorb all your toxic persona and then throw it back at you, instead of simply disengaging. Likely very dangerous for you.

Overall I get a very bad read on your attraction luck with summer signs (Gem, Can, Leo) and see a better affinity towards Spring, with the exception of Pisces (unless you&#039;re a faggot who sticks his tongue out in selfies). Taurus/Gem Sun signs generally may end up studying you and this will lead to disappointment over how they are perceiving you.

It\u2019s possible to connect with the energy of this love by being still and putting the focus inside the body. What is registered when nothing becomes the sweetness of existence without formality is the formless love, which waits for the moment to be made real in sense. However, someone advanced in age, who is perhaps no longer able or inclined to make physical love, can rest easy in the living reality of all the love that has been made in the great journey through existence. This can often be observed in dear elderly men and women who are content to sit for hours gazing out across the fields or the sea, naturally connected to their perfect lover within the being.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The perfect lover is a companion in both life and death. The actual living experience is the formal aspect of love\u2019s purpose, whereas the virtue of the often difficult situations that must accompany great love is the immortal state. In that other place, free of the restrictions of physical bodies, the reality behind the form is creatively free as a joyous expression of the authentic spiritual being. Love in the immortal space is complete as a unity of everything anyone has ever loved or recognised as the beauty and wonder of the sensory earth. This heavenly emanation is the purity of love without formality. Here, someone only has to think of a loved one and they\u2019ve immediately united with them. But also, it\u2019s possible to enjoy the smell of the rose or the rain, all being created simultaneously within the being.\u201d ~Lance Kelly</span>", "filename": "FB_IMG_1676608679854", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 675, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676608703031060, "time": 1676608703, "md5": "3wbcNLL8c98j0fMfvESGNg==", "fsize": 50528, "resto": 34102117}, {"no": 34107118, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)23:40:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106910</a><br>hey man, lifes pretty sweet up till the moment until everything ends leaving you with heartbreak and grief and all your memories getting that sad bent to them", "time": 1676608834, "resto": 34102117}, {"no": 34107140, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)23:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34107078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34107078</a><br>There are multiple approaches to Pure Land Buddhism.

The specific deity (or deities) you pray to are unimportant, so long as you pray regularly and with fervor. You would do well to pray at night before sleep and upon awaking every single day. If this notion repulses you, do it anyway. Disgust with holy names and artifices are a symptom of advanced spiritual attack. Disregard are pray.<br><br>The next step is developing a daily banishing practice. There are several formats and rituals for banishing and most of them are equally reliable and useful at both cleaning your sphere of influence as well as pushing spiritual attachments away from your subtle bodies. As a starter banishing, I recommend the LBRP from the Golden Dawn system. It is effective and there are a plethora of how-to&#039;s on line for you to follow.<br><br>The next step is developing a daily meditation practice. Meditation should be done after banishings.

For some people (mostly women), the incarnated spirit is a lower elemental spirit that is working through its first attempt at ascending through the spheres. To make this more understandable: lower spirits want to inarnate up to transcend, higher spirits want to incarnate down to experience. Sometimes these lower spirits aren&#039;t up for the challenge of a human life and eject prior to the human&#039;s death. When this occurs, the spirit that departed the living human being is replaced by a spirit that has both the know-how and the strength to pull itself into the pilot seat. Oftentimes, these are spirits that are otherwise not allowed to properly incarnate. Read: qlippothic shells or their like.<br><br>As to what can break the spirits hold, there are a few ways to induce this effect: severe trauma, unspeakably evil acts that are contrary to the spirit, and a magician knowing the &quot;True Name&quot; of the spirit and pulling it out of the body.

Having been left wounded in a vehicle after fleeing once again from Alexander the Great, he desired a message be delivered to his adversary. Quote &quot;he died without having done him any acts of kindness, but a debtor to him for the greatest, since he had found his feelings towards his mother and children to be those of a prince, not of a foe; that he had been more happy in his enemy than in his relations, for by his enemy life had been granted to his mother and children, but taken from himself by his relatives, to whom he had given both life and kingdoms; and that such a requital must therefore be made them as his conqueror should please. For himself, that he made the only return to Alexander which he could at the point of death, by praying to the gods above and below, and the powers that protected kings, that the empire of the world might fall to his lot. That he desired the favour of a decent rather than a magnificent funeral; and, as to avenging his death, it was not his cause alone that was concerned, but precedent, and the common cause of all kings, which it would be both dishonourable and dangerous for him to neglect; since, in regard to vengeance, the interests of justice were affected, and, in regard to precedent, those of the general safety. To this effect he gave him his right hand, as the only pledge of a king&#039;s faith to be conveyed to Alexander.&quot; end quote.", "filename": "alexanderBeforeTheDeadBodyOfDariusIII,LastKingOfPersiaEngraving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 702, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1676497452917050, "time": 1676497452, "md5": "5EKeeb9uOqwSMD9fmzslHw==", "fsize": 229389, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096778, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>I offer 1% of my power for 5 minutes", "time": 1676497522, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096783, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:46:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>Look into my eye and tell me what you see.", "filename": "81562895-e12-52458", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 304, "h": 580, "tn_w": 65, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676497560766841, "time": 1676497560, "md5": "5psBxk/fdBAgPsCjSYUp0g==", "fsize": 33846, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096803, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:48:04", "name": "EMPRESS", "com": "<a href=\"#p34094021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34094021</a><br>I offer my undying loyalty to all that is right", "time": 1676497684, "resto": 34094021}, {"no": 34096805, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:48:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34096545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34096545</a><br>Not OP but I&#039;m curious if you&#039;ve ever done breathing exercises like wim hof or fire breathing.

There are gandharvas, apsaras, etc. This is the Bhuvah as mentioned above. <br><br>Then there is Bhu loka, this earthly abode, karma ksetra, the place of birth death and karma. <br><br>Below us are the Patalas, which are considered subterranean heavenly realms. This is where evil demons or ill abodes may be located. The daityas, danavas, nagas and other beings live here. They often attack the gods. They are not evil per se but more like the Titans of Greek myth. I think there are seven different Patala Lokas. <br><br>Finally there is Naraka Loka, which is the Hell of the Puranas were Yamaraja reigns and punishes the sinful. <br><br>Pitra Loka, the heavenly realm of the ancestors, sustained by the ritual worship (and perhaps memory) of their living descendents, is also located in this area of the universe.", "filename": "Screenshot", "ext": ".png", "w": 621, "h": 540, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1676600674090030, "time": 1676600674, "md5": "JDaQpUhO4n45MAexz2OwuQ==", "fsize": 570219, "resto": 34102988}, {"no": 34106239, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)21:34:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106180</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Puranic Hindu</span><br>I quite like everything you are writing.

From this supreme paternal deity, who is Being itself, emanates the primary gods, who are portions of his own qualities. From these deities proceed hierarchies that embody their qualities and become increasingly complex. As these hierarchies proceed they become diminished in power and overlap with each other. When this net of archetypes interacts with dense matter it fills it with its light and gives it the infinitely rich and complex form which we experience. <br><br>The Nous or Intelligence exists below the primary gods. This would be analogous to Brahmas abode. It is the divine intelligence behind creation. It can be experienced in trance as intuitive intelligence which knows all things.<br><br>Below this could reside souls absorbed in this divine intelligence. This would be similar to Maharloka etc. The universal soul of creation as well as the planetary gods are also perpetually meditating upon this divine intelligence with a portion of their being. This is the Intelligable realm where gods reside. <br><br>The lotus flowers and yantras may exist on this level of reality. The primary gods which exist closer to the supreme deity may have abodes of a similar nature. This could be analogous to Svarga loka. <br><br>Then you have the divide with the physical world.

It is kind of a catch all for all manner of spirits, lower angels, and demons. <br><br>From folklore, I believe these beings do have their own abodes. They work in hierarchies with a leader. Solomonic magic appeals to these hierarchies when conjuring and controlling spirits, demons and ghosts. <br><br>They live in their abodes within the astral realm and go out to perform tasks.

I&#039;d like to share my observations and hear yours.<br>Materialists say that dreams are just our neurons firing at random. But there&#039;s nothing random about them; dreams have a narrative structure and the beings there seem to exhibit certain and don&#039;t want to be found out, resorting to antics to preserve the deception; the dream itself seems to be alive and will &quot;changes scene&quot; if the current one is not working.<br>Notes:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scenarios, characters become glitchy when you focus on them</span><br>First sequence: I am riding a bus, looking out the window. I realize I&#039;m dreaming. I notice how realistic the buildings are until I start to really pay attention: the buldings become glitchy and multiply assets such as windows, air conditioners. The scene changes.<br>Second sequence:<br>I walk into a store. Three girls walk in almost at the same time as me. I&#039;m still lucid. I ask them what they are. At first they look at me like I&#039;m a weirdo. I repeat: What are you? They try to ignore me. I corner one of them, grab her by the arms: What are you?, I insist. We are face to face. Suddenly her face starts glitching until it becomes featureless, like Dr. No-Face. The scene changes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;characters exhibit agency, want to keep the illusion</span><br>Third sequence: I&#039;m at a library. Still lucid. People are reading books and don&#039;t notice me. I shout: Look at me! They ignore me. I try to provoke them, calling them names. They still ignore me. I&#039;m making a fuss. One of them gets up and changes form into a beautiful woman, starts flirting with me, gently touching me pressing her face against mine. Even though I&#039;ve only just witnessed the change, it works. I give into the seduction.

I do have a tendency to romanticize things when I write. What I mean is for instance jacking off makes me feel lewd, and I seem to emanate lewd vibes when I&#039;m feeling that way, because people around me will start adjusting their clothes like they&#039;re protecting their bodies from my lecherous gaze. Usually pulling down their shirts or blouses over their pants. I&#039;m serious, people start doing this compulsively in my vicinity, like a tic that my proximity sets off. Honestly I hate being a horny fapping loser.

It&#039;s this concentrated energy, impending doom kind of thing. It&#039;s like the rituals release the energy. Let&#039;s face it OCD is probably related to ritual magic.

Spend some time actually thinking about the evidence we literally have access to, mostly the megalithic sites themselves and consider what we can derive from them. And look at them from an angle that most people overlook, how they resonate. How energy interacts with the materials that comprise them. How were they constructed? It isn&#039;t a coincidence that Stonehenge resonates in the Human Alpha brain wave range (8-12Hz) or that the pyramid of Khufru&#039;s inner chamber resonates at the upper range of our Beta waves (30Hz). Or that both Human Alpha and Beta waves resonate in the same range as the Earth&#039;s EM resonant field (7,14,21,28 Hz approximately). Archaeology is a science. But you know what else is science, science is a science. Physics. Try first understanding EM Physics (Maxwell&#039;s equations) and then applying some of this to these sites and you will see them in a new light.

Microwave ovens heat food because they are tuned into the resonance frequency of H20 (2.45 GHz), this excites the molecules and they release energy and anything that contains water is heated. So .... how do you build the megaliths, you have a device (the pine cone handbags) that softens rocks using the resonant frequencies of one or more type of molecule in them.

The epithets of the dark demon alone have much to say about his psychology and proclaim his comprehensive mythic program. He is known, among other things, as the \u201cenemy of the moon, subduer of the moon, darkling, flesh-devourer, lion\u2019s son, the roarer, but also [as the] lightgiver of the heavenly paradise\u201d . He is also called \u201cdragon\u201d, \u201csnake\u201d, \u201ceclipser\u201d, and \u201clord of the darkness\u201d. In the Hevajra Tantra it is still said that it is solely the consciousness of the yogi which brings the sun and moon under control. But in the Kalachakra Tantra, the Vajra master in league with Rahu pronounces the sentence of destruction over the two heavenly bodies.

Or go to a bar. Or move towns. Find new friends. Get a new hobby. Humanity has existed for a few thousand years, so there are many options for living already established.<br><br>Really though, you need to kill your mindset. To arrive at this place you must have some beliefs that are causing you to suffer. That&#039;s okay. Pain is a signal that you need to change, is all. If you look around you will find lots of resources available that can help you root out your faulty and limiting beliefs and help you to realise your human potential, which is truly a miraculous thing. Just know that you can kill your mind, you can kill the life you know, and sometimes you might need to do this, but it doesn&#039;t mean you actually have to end the adventure of this incarnation artificially.", "time": 1676590831, "resto": 34104952}, {"no": 34105436, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)19:29:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I have spent countless lifetimes repeating the same mistakes as I always have, in order to finally have my &quot;moment.&quot;<br><br>The moment lasted for eternity, feeling the bullet rip through my throat, up through my tongue, piercing the top of my mouth, and then time slowed down even more as the gases ripped through behind the bullet, burning my chin, and exploding into my mouth, tearing my cheeks from my jaw and cheek bones.

Also a pedophile. <br><br>I outed him publicly for what he did to my 19 year old friend (I&#039;m 20), but I&#039;ll start from the beginning. <br><br>Met a girl who was 12 when he was 17. He molested her many times. Groomed her until she was 18, and then began dating her. He was sexually and physically violent and after spraining her wrist by throwing her into a wall, she tried to break up with him in a car. <br><br>He wasn&#039;t having that. He essentially Chris Brown&#039;d her, except he actually left, but only when she was unconscious. Strangled her, smashed her head into the dashboard and windows, breaking everything including her face and nose, and nearly blinding her. Had priors and a conviction for drug related crimes and spent a year in prison (he does not have a job or a car, and lives off the charity of his weird enabling mother and sells drugs).<br><br>After he was released, he moved to a different part of the state. That&#039;s what he does, he does what he does to women until he gets arrested, and then moves to another city and repeats. He also does other criminal shit and has multiple DUIs.<br><br>I don&#039;t know exactly what happened, but he went back to prison for communicating criminal threats to another girl. He was also dating a high schooler in his mid 20s. I have looked him up and have found multiple arrests, most including domestic violence arrests against women. There are three publicly available, one court summary available, and more you can find if you really look. He has multiple children, and a pattern of poking holes in condoms and using children to trap his victims. We&#039;ll get to that a bit later.<br><br>He moved to my city, and made a Facebook and added everyone between the ages of 18-21, including my step-sisters, one who is 15 I had to tell him to stay the fuck away from. cont.", "time": 1676564828, "resto": 34098452}, {"no": 34102353, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)11:36:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34102312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34102312</a><br>I&#039;m talking 5000 friends.

He not only solely hangs around 18-21 year olds, he acts like them too. Something fucked up happened to this guy that made him mentally 16 forever.<br><br>Anyway. This guy would a dozen accounts and spam add literally everyone, but his friends list was mostly young girls. He was a sexual and violent predator who would pray on 16-21 year old girls with mental issues, drug issues, daddy issues, etc. All around vulnerable and fucked up young girls. When he got here his first girlfriend was a 17 year old. Took videos of her and sent them around to girls he was trying to have sex with, without their knowledge. CP and revenge porn enthusiast. <br><br>He eventually got his hooks into my 19 year old friend. She&#039;s a drug addict, rape victim, parentless bastard, bi-polar, and autistic to top it all off. Perfect victim for this fuck. <br><br>He would come to her house (yes, the 19 year old has a house and the 30 year old doesn&#039;t), drunk as shit, screaming at her, and would throw her on the couch and start strangling her. If you don&#039;t know, in domestically violent relationships, the predator strangling their victim increases the risk of homicide by over 1000%. If he does not go to prison for life like he should, he WILL kill one of these girls eventually. That is not a possibility, it is a guarantee.<br><br>She came out on her profile about him and I shared it. I later made a post about what a degenerate he was, all the shit he gets up to with a picture of his face and told everyone of my 18-21 year old friends to block him and to leave if you see him in public.<br><br>I got a message at 4 A.M from ANOTHER one of my 19 year old friends.

Look into the many cases of Muslims being cured of schizophrenia and other mental conditions by going to God and using the holy quran to protect themselves. Think of why demons inspire or even outright command humans to use holy scriptures as part of their magic. Its simply to make them disobey God in the most egregious ways. There are many cases of magicians being caught and they write the names of demons alongside holy scripture. Do not attempt to connect holy scriptures to magic at all. You can research everything iv stated above. Magic will kill you and those close to you spiritually and very very few come back from getting involved. Again, do not attempt to do magic by any holy book, your life will be ruined. I know some guys who went down that route and they either have entities fucking with them 247 or have that and are also homeless. The devil is a liar and he will abandon you.

At first no path exists, the same route has to be traversed over and over for it to establish and make a definite clearing and easily usable way. The more easy these ways are to use, the more we are used to taking them to the destinations we know they lead to. The problem is some paths have been made by experiences or ideas we did not know would lead somewhere bad, once we did we didnt want to go down again but we ended up returning those ways either through external routines reinforcing the experience or idea, or through memory because of an reflexive attachment to something either present or hidden that happened along that route or at the destination it leads to.

If you recognise a familiar path, a familiar feeling, thought or idea you know always leads to worse ideas or feelings when they begin, you can be more conscious of avoiding continuing down that way, and a way to do this is to divert attention and begin another trail of thought, it might have to be a blank thought, like just standing stillx and not taking any ways at that moment letting the impulse pass.<br>When a path in a forest is no longer walked along after time it begins to disappear ad the foliage regrows and covers the carved route up; the exact same thing occurs to neural pathways when they are no longer in use. <br>Frequency of unwanted mental states is important to reduce, as this will fradually allow the neurology to heal.

Just like normie communication is marred by the normie&#039;s compulsive status-signalling wisecracking, lesser directors will cling to clich\u00e9s in every aspect of movie-making because midwits feel competent and professional when they&#039;re abiding by clich\u00e9s. Lynch is a revered household name now so everyone respects him but he&#039;s the kind of guy whose movies make unsophisticated people go &quot;lol what is he even doing?&quot; <br><br>And what he&#039;s doing is simply following his bliss. He has no middlebrow inner critic forcing him to conform his vision to er &quot;social expectations&quot; (i.e. &quot;autism&quot;), he will not edit a scene until it looks &quot;normal&quot; but until it *feels right*, and every true artist knows what *feels right* means. (And this is what will ever elude the hack.) And that&#039;s why his movies strike one, yes, as pure, and you&#039;re probably right that this purity of expression probably reflects a purity of character to some degree.<br><br>(This is probably why pick-up artists are terrible dressers.)<br><br>Otherwise yes I get the same feeling, I&#039;m actually pretty sure he&#039;s from some elite bloodline or another, but he seems to be a genuine artist whose life revolves around getting in the zone and doing his thing, and he seems like a good guy.

In this state I do not bother to hold onto or write down every impression I see as they often come and go too fast and I&#039;m waiting for a certain feeling to come to me where I inexplicably know and have confidence that I&#039;m seeing the actual target. When this feeling is then felt I then make a strong effort to memorize what I can of the scene, end the session, and make my report. Doing this has resulted in me seeing perfectly without distortions and giving reports that can&#039;t be chalked up to &quot;it&#039;s so vague it could describe anywhere&quot; and instead get responses like &quot;wow that&#039;s so specific there is no way you could have guessed that&quot;. I should add also that my body tends to become completely immobilized in this process or else if it is moving it becomes completely automatic in regards to any motions produced as my mind is concentrated completely on the tuning and thus is avoiding using the parts of my mind that would use other processes for thinking about things. You must not think at all about the target, you must instead keep watching the scenes coming into your mind, until you get that right feeling. Thinking about the target and making guesses is not remote viewing, remote viewing is about perception not guesswork.<br><br>Do this and you will be way more successful in remote viewing than people using faulty methods.

However they will not be very fulfilling, you will get to know them and realize that you aren\u2019t as interested in them as you were before. The main reason behind this has to do with how you see relationships, you want to be with someone for a long time, while most women in your area are just curious and want to have something to \u2018pass time\u2019. This might be acceptable to you, but eventually you will get tired of it, because you crave stability from relationships; changes do not make you happy and you prefer to have someone who can stay with you.<br><br>The best advice that I see from this is to be patient, work on your own goals and pursuits and do not be too obsessed with finding the right woman, as of now. Instead work on not relying on relationships to define your happiness, because as of now, there\u2019s a void inside of you when you are single, as if it was painful to be alone.<br><br>Being single does not define your self worth; work on your spiritual life, career and hobbies.<br><br>The one other aspect to consider is that you need to let go of the pain from the past, you seem to have lingering pain inside of you that is making you want to escape your solitude, however, a relationship will leave you empty inside, unless you work on those aspects of above.", "filename": "Aphrodite-Nude", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 848, "h": 607, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1676603562194428, "time": 1676603562, "md5": "bcj9htdcfMDmQVTEhrEreA==", "fsize": 88468, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106518, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:12:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106510</a><br>Male, if that wasnt obvious", "time": 1676603569, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106520, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:13:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106323</a><br>What could you tell me about work?", "filename": "F01EF9DF-D9CC-4782-98E8-4056BB74C157", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 276, "h": 183, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1676603613078739, "time": 1676603613, "md5": "GrJByBLoclZN/Eg1uTx1/A==", "fsize": 17747, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106525, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:14:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Air Query<br>What role will MLD play in my life?", "time": 1676603664, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106526, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106509</a><br>Hey Just letting you know, I had to fire that artist Juliano. <br><br>he was a fucking fraud. don&#039;t remember the other reading you gave me but you said something about a woman helping my project?", "time": 1676603667, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106529, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:14:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106346</a><br><a href=\"#p34106357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106357</a><br><a href=\"#p34106400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106400</a><br>Is mine okay ? :o", "time": 1676603677, "resto": 34106213}, {"no": 34106542, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)22:15:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34106323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34106323</a><br>Male <br><br>I have a feeling that there is something I need to do?

So I guess it doesn&#039;t matter, I&#039;m just gonna listen to Lil Nas X and fuck some hookers and do some blow, because my choice doesn&#039;t matter.

This can be private or public, it is the intent the matters. One must accept Christ as their Lord and Savior. Both a King and a redeemer. I did this about a month before I was baptized.<br><br>I do have family that is religious and it was with their support and suggestion that I even agreed to be baptized. I had never been to a ceremony like that and I was very apprehensive up to the moment I was in the water. I had no idea what to expect to feel or experiance, nothing to go off of.<br><br>That day there had been a ceremony where they baptized people while a sermon was going and did a livestream of that while the sermon was happening, I thought that I was late and missed it, so I went to the room after the sermon and the people were still there and agreed to baptize me. I&#039;m glad it happened this way, it&#039;s not something that should be rushed, it&#039;s something that while public, ought to be very intimate and not performed for a video. <br><br>I&#039;d suggest heavily that you first accept Christ as your Lord ans savior, confessing your faith to Him. Though others may not hear you or perhaps understand, He will. <br><br>After this I&#039;d suggest you reach out to people you know who are Christian. If you do not then find a Church. Regardless of my personal opinions on the state of the Church in general, (there is much awry) it is vital to be in communion or contact with a congregation as a believer. Get to know some of them, share you story and express an interest in being baptized. Even if you do not agree with the church or decide you don&#039;t want to remain there, which is reasonable, baptism itself is something special and between you and the Lord alone.<br><br>For me it was a leap of faith, and indeed God responds to those who seek Him. Like following a whisper on a wind to an oasis in the desert.<br><br>In these times, which are full of distress in the world and in our hearts, God is my only peace.

It&#039;s a commitment to the Lord. <br><br>This entails many things, laid out by Christ.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

A lot of weight is given in the process of derivation of the laws through logic, it&#039;s a mathematical approach to belief. All that said, I struggle to rectify years of biology, psychology, and ethics which in many ways come to similar conclusions about the nature of evil/sin (selfish gratification) and good/virtue (control of base impulses). Now that I am interested in restoring my faith, I find it difficult to not hear years of study of the sciences overshadow religious texts with the scientific reasoning. I am not saying that it is wrong to learn science - just that it makes this so much harder. We know that much of this wisdom was boiled down to simple terms and allegory to be interpreted for the masses in a communal setting through years of study. This is an aside but it&#039;s one reason why it makes me so angry that there are people who interpret the texts literally. These texts are supposed to be mulled over and meditated on over a lifetime.<br><br>I feel that the only way to overcome this struggle is to go even deeper in the religious texts and attempt to achieve wisdom through mysticism. That requires a lot of dedication. Psalm magic isn&#039;t a one and done, it&#039;s a process.

However, there is nothing brave or loyal about my interpretations, but I thank you for the kind words. I&#039;m really just bumping along in the dark searching for the light of truth, just like everyone else. Also, does anyone ever really know who they are? That is a deep philosophical question for contemplation on a later date that also never really ends with closure, absolution, or even satisfactory resolution in my experience.

They are formed and forgotten, or at most you have vague concepts of the emotional arc within the dream. Your mind has decided it was unimportant for you to remember the details of the new dreams, but made the point of making them &quot;in depth and interesting.&quot; These terms are a little ambiguous.
