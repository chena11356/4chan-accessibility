At first he wants to push ahead, then he encounters obstructions that, it is true, mean oppression only when recklessly dealt with. He butts his head against a wall and in consequence feels himself oppressed by the wall. Then he leans on things that have in themselves no stability and that are merely a hazard for him who leans on them. Thereupon he turns back irresolutely and retires into his house, only to find, as a fresh disappointment, that his wife is not there.

Overall I get a very bad read on your attraction luck with summer signs (Gem, Can, Leo) and see a better affinity towards Spring, with the exception of Pisces (unless you&#039;re a faggot who sticks his tongue out in selfies). Taurus/Gem Sun signs generally may end up studying you and this will lead to disappointment over how they are perceiving you. You have luck with Libra moons, shyer Capricorns and Taurus with summer moons. &quot;Venus&quot; is technically suppose to indicate love life more than sun/moon combo.

People were beginning to accept gays back then (mostly because there was a huge push for it in the media) but the idea of &quot;gay marriage&quot; was still so radical that it would have been political suicide for politicians to bring it up back then. Even as far out as 2008, the majority of super-liberal Commiefornia voted against it, which was promptly ignored by the courts. Dennis Kucinich said something nice about trannies in the 2008 debates and he was mocked for it by the King of the Liberals, Jon Steward. There was no way trannies would have taken off organically in the &#039;90s under any circumstances. I am aware that they existed back then, but they were an underground fringe group.<br>Like the other anon said, the explosion of trannies today is from cumulative effects of porn addiction (or internet addiction more broadly), probably some environmental reasons too like plastics in the water screwing with everyone&#039;s hormones.

It isn&#039;t a coincidence that Stonehenge resonates in the Human Alpha brain wave range (8-12Hz) or that the pyramid of Khufru&#039;s inner chamber resonates at the upper range of our Beta waves (30Hz). Or that both Human Alpha and Beta waves resonate in the same range as the Earth&#039;s EM resonant field (7,14,21,28 Hz approximately). Archaeology is a science.

In this oration, Ramsay called for a massive project of universal illumination, a joining together of the arts and sciences. He echoes earlier Rosicrucian aims, but there is a more rationalist quality to his work, and it is arguably the case that he served as predecessor for the later French philosophes and their Encyclop\u00e9die. But he also linked Freemasonry to the Knights Templar, to aristocracy, and to a kind of mystical chivalry that was very attractive, particularly to the upper class. Many para-Masonic orders thus were generated.<br>From Magic and Mysticism by Arthur Versluis, i did not know of this connection between Freemasonry and Christian theosophy but it&#039;s very interesting how Ramsay is through this also indirectly linked to the Strict Observance Templar group which was taken over by Willermoz and &#039;rebooted&#039; as the Rectified Scottish Rite", "time": 1676307267, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078024, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)11:59:47", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<a href=\"#p34077972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34077972</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;34077994</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Versluis</span><br>Literally one of the only few good perennialists.", "time": 1676307587, "resto": 34074506, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 34078141, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:18:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078024</a><br>Personally i can&#039;t call him a perrenilaist, or anything actually lol<br>He practices Buddhism but mostly just talks and writes about Christianity, and when he does i have noticed that he tries to please as much people as possible, Traditionalists, Neognostics, Christians, (Neo)Pagans, etc...", "time": 1676308720, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078171, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:24:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078024</a><br><a href=\"#p34078141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078141</a><br>Oh also i watch him when he&#039;s on youtube sometimes and he mentioned that John Pordage&#039;s Metaphysica is getting translated, which is -huge- for all 7 people who care about that<br>I have the text in german (got it from some university site) but i can&#039;t be asked to read it all with ye olde calligraphy on every page, i&#039;ve also noticed skimming through it that he uses certain Kabbalistic terms like Adam Kadmon but i don&#039;t know if it comes from some sort of synthesis he achieved or if he is hust using those terms for theosophy without it being connected to Cabala", "time": 1676309069, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078410, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:55:06", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;a well respected (by me nonetheless) occult author is in my replies asking for [citation needed] on some Tantra information I consider to be extremely basic inside of traditions he holds interest in.</span><br>I literally hate it here.<br>We&#039;re fucking doomed.", "filename": "240386406_182856747162922_896644785360269017_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 643, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676310906252719, "time": 1676310906, "md5": "oMm0t+tQbwJuLLwmqnxCiw==", "fsize": 61713, "resto": 34074506, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 34078428, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>What is this &quot;here&quot; you speak of?", "time": 1676310990, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078480, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:03:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>There is only one acceptable response to people like him: bullying.", "filename": "1662399733987765", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1284, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676311387197733, "time": 1676311387, "md5": "SepROsUFH80lUdDIZzWW+Q==", "fsize": 148831, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078497, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:05:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>What author?<br>Also ape sama, I don&#039;t know why you seem surprised.

She absolutely adores L. and is almost like a little pet, no offense meant. She is not offended by the way, she doesn&#039;t care what anyone thinks of her, unlike most reptilians. Very openhearted and genuinely curious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s trying to learn how to human haha. She is very interested in us, and L. is her guide. She is also willing to show her reptilian ways, but she wasn&#039;t taught those. She was raised as a hybrid away from the more primal reptilian energies. There is a sweet innocence in her, and also a quest to find out who and what exactly she is. The reptilian part of her family is benevolent, and also hybrid (not related to Draco genetics), and their race&#039;s energies remind me a lot of the Yits (TReb is a reptilian hybrid from that race, channeled by Rob Gauthier). Only Chili is even more human than that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She is not big as most reptilians. Slender and limber, like a tiny lizard scurrying between the rocks.

To our knowledge, from all the immune cells investigated to date, none of them has been found to be inert to dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Generally, ALA, DHA, and EPA exert an inhibitory effect on the activation of immune cells from both the innate and the adaptive branch.

The study shows that fish oil enhances antiviral response by inducing interferon (IFN) which inhibits viral replication [69]. The anti-inflammatory effect by omega-3 FAs is stronger in DHA compared to that of EPA, and their secretion of cytokines IL-10 is further increased by omega-3. CD8 T cells are responsible for fighting against viruses by inducing the production of different cytokines in the body, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and granzyme B. However, the surge of cytokines by CD8 T cells to defend influenza viruses impose unintended lung damage and further deteriorate the clinical outcome.

Garsin, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston;<br>Author information Copyright and License information Disclaimer<br>Go to:<br>ABSTRACT<br>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs [Ile, Leu, and Val]) represent important nutrients in bacterial physiology, with roles that range from supporting protein synthesis to signaling and fine-tuning the adaptation to amino acid starvation. In some pathogenic bacteria, the adaptation to amino acid starvation includes induction of virulence gene expression: thus, BCAAs support not only proliferation during infection, but also the evasion of host defenses. A body of research has accumulated over the years to describe the multifaceted physiological roles of BCAAs and the mechanisms bacteria use to maintain their intracellular levels. More recent studies have focused on understanding how fluctuations in their intracellular levels impact global regulatory pathways that coordinate the adaptation to nutrient limitation, especially in pathogenic bacteria. In this minireview, we discuss how these studies have refined the individual roles of BCAAs, shed light on how BCAA auxotrophy might promote higher sensitivity to exogenous BCAA levels, and revealed pathogen-specific responses to BCAA deprivation. These advancements improve our understanding of how bacteria meet their nutritional requirements for growth while simultaneously remaining responsive to changes in environmental nutrient availability to promote their survival in a range of environments.", "time": 1676262479, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074028, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:30:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "wait until the sugar insul carb candida studies come out then maybe youll know how candida works and the human body", "time": 1676262626, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074041, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:31:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073977</a><br><a href=\"#p34073884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073884</a><br>down syndrome?", "time": 1676262687, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074177, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:51:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073777</a><br>checked", "time": 1676263889, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074206, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:55:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;ll be nice when the big change happens we won&#039;t have to listen to this dumbass and his spam posts", "time": 1676264113, "resto": 34054137}, {"no": 34074225, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:57:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34064922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34064922</a><br>Holy shit.<br><br>Recently I did 5MeODMT experience (and was doing Semen Retention for about 2 weeks because the Neoshaman I did it with told me that it&#039;s better to be sexually &quot;free&quot; so to speak). <br><br>Anyway long story short, I had a partial Kundalini awakening and my entire 2/3 weeks after 5meo were wild as fuck.

Beware<br><br>The objective of the present study was to compare cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine in respect to their transmembrane fluxes and find out which one is a better available precursor for the cells and thus better supports the intracellular glutathione synthesis. Cysteine can directly participate in glutathione synthesis, whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine must be first deacetylated before its incorporation to glutathione. In the present study we investigated and compared the efficiencies of cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine influx and efflux through the erythrocyte membrane.

MS sucks. <br><br>I spoke previously about how the maintenance protocol can start the remyelination process to actually heal and reverse the root cause of symptoms when it comes to forms of sclerosis. This was a complex interaction triggered by both a NAD+ pool and sirt activator. <br><br>Does oregano also provide benefit? Let&#039;s take a look. Delayed-type hypersensitivity is a reaction that MS patients have to a microbial source (fungal) that triggers a delayed inflammation response. With MS you don&#039;t want this happening because the immune response (for instance IL-17A or IL-22) causes further damage to the myelin sheath. This leads to common symptoms like tremors or motor instability. How does oregano benefit? <br><br>&quot;Mice treated with thymol or carvacrol had reduced DTH responses (26% and 50%, respectively) compared with control ... As carvacrol and thymol each suppressed the antigen-specific immune response by reducing THcell-related cytokines\\specific transcription factors, this indicated their potential to modulate destructive immune responses attributed to T-cells over-activation.&quot;<br><br>Reading between the lines, one of the pathways that carvacrol downregulated was IL-17A.

I&#039;ve seen this can often happen with a succubus when boundaries haven&#039;t been made abundantly clear from the get-go.

Be clear and upfront, whether that&#039;s through conversation or writing a letter. If that doesn&#039;t work, you can try banishing or exorcisms, but I&#039;ve never heard of anyone convincing a spirit to leave when the human partner feels they&#039;re being oppressed. (If they do leave, they&#039;ll do it of their own volition.) I believe there&#039;s also a deep kind of subconscious link that compels a spirit to remain in person&#039;s life - even if the human counterpart feels that they&#039;re being abused, there&#039;s an unacknowledged part of them that actually craves the attention.

There have been religious posters saying false things to convert people and the occasional larper, but they&#039;ve been obvious enough to dismiss after a couple of posts. The more difficult to believe posters usually are willing to provide enough details to determine their experiences are genuine, if not certainly succubus related.

Claims such as the properties of spinal fluid (which apparently can be raised, despite it being distributed throughout the spine), kundalini being just electricity, vegetarian succubi, and so many others indicate he doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about. He rails against sharing knowledge and experiences other than vague allusions and tries to shut down discussion. He denies the existence of the queen of succubi, which most of us have met.

That includes at least a hundred who arrived with an entity wanting answers about her.

New Age videos are all over and never get banned, New Age books are in every bookstore and bookselling site, New Age stuff is all over social media. And more importantly, the fundamental assumptions of New Age philosophy (if you want to give it the undue respect of calling it a philosophy) line up completely with the assumptions of modern liberal society. The New Age is generally skeptical of hierarchy, authority and force etc. (fear and hate are always bad, love is always good). The New Age literally divinizes the individual, liberalism symbolically divinizes the individual by conceptualizing society as a conglomeration of atomized individuals that&#039;s healthiest when those individuals are most free to choose their ideas and economic transactions. The New Age is fixated on everything being &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;growing&quot; and &quot;experiencing&quot; like you pointed out, so is liberalism. The New Age idea that all religions are one and that on a metaphysical level everything is one is far more compatible with liberal secularism and pluralism than traditional religions are. And historically, the New Age has not been some hidden thing, it was preached very publicly in the 19th century by movements like Theosophy and New Thought and was literally funded and promoted by intelligence agencies in the mid 20th. There&#039;s really only one religion/metaphysical system that&#039;s utterly incompatible with modernity and always will be and that&#039;s Islam. And traditional Islam *is* hidden in the English speaking world to the best of glowies&#039; abilities, they do their best to redefine it so that it&#039;s compatible with secularism, pluralism, democracy, individual rights and the Western geopolitical order.", "time": 1676299668, "resto": 34076515}, {"no": 34077339, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)10:01:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076515</a><br>Better get used to it Maze runner!", "time": 1676300511, "resto": 34076515}, {"no": 34078507, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:07:01", "name": "Anonaymouse", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076550</a><br>Well don&#039;t worry, just adopt a materialist view", "time": 1676311621, "resto": 34076515}, {"no": 34078873, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:54:32", "name": "S.L.M.", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076944</a><br>I like you. :3<br>go on then.<br><br>I will flee from you to go your grand adventure.", "time": 1676314472, "resto": 34076515, "trip": "!neZGQE5U1Y"}, {"no": 34079241, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)14:47:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34076515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34076515</a><br>Good.

Asking them various things and even arguing with them.<br><br>They gave uniform answers about the nature of reality which give the idea that we are trapped in a cycle of reincarnation to &quot;learn&quot; from past experiences. They did not know to what end this was. Each person is supposed to have a &quot;spirit guide&quot;, or ascended master, guardian angel, whatever that guides them towards good choices. But after interrogating them he finds their spirit guides are often woefully incompetent, malicious, even counterproductive in this guidance. The author gleams from it the idea that these guides may not be what they say they are, and might even be not all good, but rather, here to keep us trapped in this cycle.<br><br>To the random observer this sounds like some very interesting and sober information. To me it sounds exactly like Gnosticism. If the author could he would pronounce the guardian angels to be &quot;Archons&quot; and God to be &quot;the Demiurge&quot;. Gnosticism is a mystery school with a hidden agenda of Luciferianism, only giving lipservice to Christ.<br><br>But the point I&#039;m making with this, is that these books are all contradictory, often with hidden agendas, or just made to sell something.

I jump over a bank and instead of landing where it actually is, I land on the beach of a lake (known to me). Gray ice water. I fly up and look down upon the lake, then fall back first. I hit the water and begin to sink to the depths. The light from the moon fades and disappears. I sink into the abyss. Then I fall out the bottom into the sky. Open sky and sun above. I&#039;m falling through all this abstract machinery, morphing, changing. There were other dreams but that was about it. <br><br>It finally hit me that it matched the structure of several stories I wrote like 15 years ago. The water is a death symbol, not transformation. Can&#039;t go there without dying. Either the body sleeps for a while in there and is then washed back up on shore, or it falls through into the sky. Next comes a journey to the moon. I look down on the Earth. I found a cube up there, it was decaying. Finally an underground journey through a cave system. I kept dreaming of water, going into the water, being compelled.

The key word they led with is acceptance.<br><br>For me, to say you &#039;accept&#039; something, is to simply affirm that what is, is, that I am. It is to root the self in awareness, and not in thoughts or emotions or external events or the body. Your reality then becomes singular, because good and bad, happy and sad, this thought and that thought are both processed through the layer of &#039;it is&#039;. Dual concepts are processed through a singular awareness, and so you negate the bouncing back and forth between polarities such as right/wrong, happy/sad, do/don&#039;t etc.<br><br>If you were to interpret acceptance as meaning believing, I can understand objections. If you have a thought suddenly that says &quot;you are a worthless person&quot;, to accept that thought does not mean you affirm that its content is true or valid or reasonable. You do not enter into the world of the thought. You accept it as a thought, and nothing more or less. It is. You are aware it is a thought. You can then evaluate it for its truth content, or its potential origin.", "time": 1676373531, "resto": 34073924}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34082683, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)23:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Ascending / Descending in The Astral", "com": "Can someone explain the spiritual ramifications of, say, porn and how watching it lowers your position in the astral?

In a flash, he was surrounded by armed police(?) officers dressed in all black. My mother then dragged me away from the window and I quickly fell back into sleep.

Music as a form of expression can go, both, the furthest and the fastest as a relational form of unity. For better understanding, music is a gateway form that most humans relate to, thus it has the highest value as a form of divinity through unity. Yet, each individual perception may not even be the artist&#039;s intention. Thus, the form loses function via mechanistic forms of expression of form similar to language barriers creating ideas lost in translation.

Infinite: Imagine that instead of living for 100 years or something you lived for a minute. So it&#039;s all of eternity where nothing happens, then BAM, you are born, for a minute, the minute ends, and then it&#039;s all eternity not existing.

If you can imagine that a minute is too short and that it&#039;d have already ended, those 100 years would have already ended too. You&#039;re always living within that minute somehow, instead of the eternity before of after where you don&#039;t exist. So you are immortal and always living that minute (finite time between eternities.)<br>If you can&#039;t see how 100 years and 1 minute is the same at the scale of eternity, here&#039;s the second argument:<br>Things happen again. In this one, you assume that you came from nothing, that before you were born there was nothing, and after death there was nothing. What&#039;s the problem if you came from nothing once, why can\u00b4t you come from nothing again? You can extend it to the lifetime of the universe, if it came from nothing, why not again?

Cousin and I went Hunting this weekend, went well, but come Sunday evening I decided to stay at the cabin for another two days due to having extra vacation time from work. Cousin left sundown Sunday. Last night coyotes howled all through the night as they usually do in this area (Colorado, few hours north of boulder), but around 2:30 AM, after several minutes of howling they all suddenly stopped, seemingly at once. I\u2019d woken up to the sound of them, and I\u2019ve never heard them all stop so suddenly, as if just \u2018switched\u2019 off. Several minutes of silence followed, which was unusual as usually some light yipping follows of some kind. Eventually, I heard the most piercing, loud, gutteral howl I have ever heard in my life, and for reference, I grew up in woods like this, and regularly been in them for near 26 years, I\u2019ve heard it all, and this was the first noise that ever truly gave me that cold, creeping sense of dread where you freeze, even if for just a second. It sounded like a coyote being torn apart, before sputtering out into a lower tone, and then silence. I sat. Nothing more. I figured maybe it was just that, something dying, and shrugged it off. Until today. I decided to hit the creek and go fishing, and what I saw\u2026 both disgusts and haunts me. I can\u2019t even describe what I saw as a \u2018carcass\u2019 or a \u2018kill\u2019 from a hunt, it looked, sort of, like a coyote, but so utterly torn apart, it\u2019s head detached, bowels hanging out, a limb five feet away, and blood. So much blood. And the stench. Not rot, but\u2026 musk, a musk that made me feel like choking. Unnerved, I headed back to the cabin to instead just chill and read. Until the scream came again. at about 5:45 PM, the stench came. Horribly. I went to look for it\u2019s source. Eventually, I was led to my porch.

I consider myself blessed and without fail if i start talking to God I get surrounded by this overwhelming sensation of love and peace.. All you need is love and the willingness to listen and learn, praying is a good start.

You seriously think these are aliens? Let me ask you a question that hopefully is going to change your mind. What do you think is more likely: our government knows what these objects are and they belong to and were created by our governments, OR these are alien spacecrafts? Do you know how far away the nearest star is? 4.24 light years. That means it would take 4.24 years if you travelled at the SPEED OF LIGHT. Einstein proved this to be impossible for spacecraft to achieve because the mass of the spacecraft would get infinitely big as it approaches the speed of light. Imagine dragging an Eiffel tower that becomes two Eiffel towers, then four, then 80, then 16000 as you approach the speed of light. It\u2019s not possible to do this. Moreover, there is no guarantee that aliens would even be that close, meaning they could be even further away than that. Our governments are lying to us to distract us from the real issue: experimental aircrafts and otherwise secret projects and they are hoping that you are dumb enough to believe that they are instead aliens\u2026and a lot of people do. Long story short: \u201cUFOs\u201d are publicly identified if they belong to other governments, but not if they belong to your government.

Lucifer himself cannot stop you from making mistakes. Sin is forbid not as to confine you to unreasonable laws, but because it leads one&#039;s life to destruction. If you sin there are consequences, not because God is punishing you, but because you punish yourself. This is why you must try your very best to overcome sin, which Christ will help you in doing. My point is that you&#039;re wondering why God did not help you, but the reason he did not help you is because you probably didn&#039;t heed to his commandments in the first place.

You have to realize that Lucifer and other fallen angels do not grant knowledge without a price, just as God himself asks for your obedience, so do beings of false light. Can I ask, have you ever really tried getting involved with Christ? I don&#039;t just mean simple prayers, but truly seeking and following his will through deep prayer, fasting, repenting, confession, and doing your best to cut out sins from your life? These things do not all come easily and at once, but instead you will naturally change with help of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>I challenge you, put your head to the floor, humble yourself before God, confess every sin you can think of, ask for the blessing of repentance and to be blessed with the Holy Spirit, talk to him with a humble heart and he will guide you. I pray you find the truth in Christ. Its been a long journey for me personally. I&#039;ve been down just about every spiritual path, and believed the roads were true.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

A lot of weight is given in the process of derivation of the laws through logic, it&#039;s a mathematical approach to belief. All that said, I struggle to rectify years of biology, psychology, and ethics which in many ways come to similar conclusions about the nature of evil/sin (selfish gratification) and good/virtue (control of base impulses). Now that I am interested in restoring my faith, I find it difficult to not hear years of study of the sciences overshadow religious texts with the scientific reasoning. I am not saying that it is wrong to learn science - just that it makes this so much harder. We know that much of this wisdom was boiled down to simple terms and allegory to be interpreted for the masses in a communal setting through years of study. This is an aside but it&#039;s one reason why it makes me so angry that there are people who interpret the texts literally. These texts are supposed to be mulled over and meditated on over a lifetime.<br><br>I feel that the only way to overcome this struggle is to go even deeper in the religious texts and attempt to achieve wisdom through mysticism. That requires a lot of dedication. Psalm magic isn&#039;t a one and done, it&#039;s a process.

Your identity is fused with your pain, hard to separate your &quot;self&quot; and &quot;wound&quot; from each other. At times you feel guilty for existing, a tendency for being harsh on yourself.

Able to guide your community towards these solutions because of clear principles and efficiency. A need for sense of belonging in the world, knowing how each individual is connected as one. A deep connection to animals or plants. You are intelligent and have a natural curiosity. Lots of creativity and ideas that can influence others, which ties into holding a certain idealism or concept about the world, for how things should be, could be, ect. A need for seeking new things, ideas, thoughts. This idealism may have been somberly tempered after a certain point in your life because of your experiences, but trying to rekindle it is something that will come with time.

The Sun is the self, the core of your being, it wants to radiate, while Saturn is limiting, cold, dark and restrictive. So them being next to each other (Saturn even has the higher degree), means that your self is restricted. Essentially, you have low self esteem, low self-confidence, and maybe a bit pessimistic too. Can mean depression.<br>Mars opposing these two planets can generally lead to a lot of frustration. Even more so since you already have low self esteem. Mars in Scorpio is a very good placement, but Sun opposite Mars leads to a lot of competitiveness which isn&#039;t exactly too bad. However, you also have Mars opposite Saturn, which is bad. Your action oriented self (Mars) wants to push towards one direction, yet is yanked back by the chain attached to its collar by Saturn. So this placement means that you are fucked over by fate or circumstances whenever you want to do something. But since you also have the Sun-Saturn conjunction, I&#039;m gonna go out on a limb and say that you may not even try to do stuff, which against leads to a lot of frustration since you want to do shit.

One tower had an antenna atop it, whilst the other had a landing pad. Male and female, Boaz and Jachin, white and black, good and evil, etc. And then the One World Trade Center which took the place of the Twin Towers had both a flat base and an antenna, signifying the merging of the opposites into one, which is a key occult ideal. This would mean the Anti-Christ would actually be a hermaphrodite, not a post-op transsexual. The Jews also allegedly believe that God is both genders, so there\u2019s that, too, as the Jewish messiah is the Anti-Christ. As for when they revealed themselves, I would say 2030 if they were born in 2000, and 2031 if born in 2001. They work false miracles and build power over a 3 year period, and then in 2033/2034, they enter the Third Temple (which I believe will be fully built by that point in time), and declare themselves to be higher than God.

NDEs are almost always described as more real than our reality. And often people compare the reality shift to that which people experience when waking up from a dream. In other words, we know dreams are not real since, when we wake up, it is more realistic than the dream.

Break the phrase down: A conspiracy is a secret plan, often among powerful people, to do something bad. A theory is an idea. A conspiracy theory is inherently a rebellious thought. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone was making an intentional effort to feed conspiracy theorists weird shit. This would accomplish several things for conspirators of all kinds:<br><br>1. Anyone who could be defined as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; will look like a crazy person to normies. This would make it harder for conspiracy theorists to gain supporters, or even friends. They will probably even lose existing friends, though they will also gain a few friends in the conspiracy theorist world. However, the overall end result is that the conspiracy theorist becomes an outcast in society, and they can only go to other conspiracy theorists for support.<br><br>2. Anyone who gets into conspiracy theories will be fed tons of red herrings, many of which contain outrageous and fantastical things like aliens and demons and stuff. These kinds of theories will naturally be better at spreading than the legit but boring ones. Even if the true story is out there, nobody is interested in it. Aliens are much more fun to talk about.<br><br>3. Due to constantly discussing ufos and witchcraft and mind control and shit as if those were real things, a conspiracy theorist&#039;s grip on reality is likely to slip. They&#039;ll end up fitting the schizo theorist stereotype to some degree. They&#039;ll also become more fearful of the subjects of their conspiracy theories, and therefore less likely to form any actual resistance against them. Sorcerers and lizard men are a lot scarier than corrupt politicians and entrepreneurs, and politicians are extra scary if you think that they&#039;re lizard men that can read your thoughts.", "time": 1676115826, "resto": 34040903}, {"no": 34059513, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:04:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34058183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34058183</a><br>Ha, ok that was a pretty good story, even if they were somewhat condescending dicks.

It&#039;s why the geometry is sacred and math is the language of the universe. God was the source that split itself apart so that other forms of life could exist, and in this reality we see that play out on a massive scale. All things in this universe are extensions of the first duality, the first choice. <br>If someone asks me what the meaning of life is this is what I would tell them.<br><br>What they were explaining to me was that that concept is why evil exists. Evil, low vibrational beings are needed to be the opposing point to Good. Evil exists because good exists and vice versa. God as the source was the first being to have a choice.

In 3 months he had normal blood pressure. <br>I for instance had huge cravings of tuna cans. I supplemented omega 3 pills to that. Turns out my seborrhea dermatitis (skin disease like that of psoriasis) just entirely went away.

My most successful attempt I was floating in the corner of my room looking at my body but I felt a very dark energy coming from the closet. For some context, my brother used to complain about all sorts of weird shit with this closet and his wife even picked up and left in the middle of the night one time because of some shit she was experiencing in that room. The first time I myself stayed in the room I woke up in the middle of the night half dragged into the closet legs first, which is especially interesting because I was sleeping on a bed with my legs facing the opposite direction. ANYWAY, as I&#039;m floating there noticing this scary energy, I start to panic and I can feel this shadow dragging me into the closet. Luckily I had done a ton of &quot;research&quot; into this topic and recalled that things can only &quot;touch&quot; me in this state if I am scared, since I am in a form of raw energy. So I took a deep breathe and closed my eyes and repeated that I will be okay, and as I&#039;m doing this I can feel myself slowly floating back towards my body uninhibited. I open my eyes and I feel like I&#039;m going too slow for me so I panic for another moment, quickly feeling myself getting jerked back towards the closet. So I close my eyes and repeat that I&#039;m going to be okay, focusing all of my energy to relax, and lo and behold I start slowly floating back towards my body. Once I open my (real) eyes I swore off ever fucking with this shit again.
