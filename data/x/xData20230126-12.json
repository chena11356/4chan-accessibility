Unfortunately, I&#039;m too small brain to make much progress, but like you, I am also mystified that most people straight up don&#039;t care.

I think likely aspects of all of those are true.<br><br>The first question is much harder. This &quot;perceiver&quot; seems singularly special, in that it is non-material, and yet able to perceive things in a special way-a &quot;conscious&quot; way. Consciously perceiving something feels very different from anything else, indeed it&#039;s the only thing that feels like anything.

Rowling is an Illuminati Monarch slave - she is an actress who has hardly put pen to paper regarding the Harry Potter books. The original author of the first four books hasn&#039;t seen a penny from it. Rowling was only ever a puppet actress to dupe the media, and wasn&#039;t allowed to keep 99% of the money generated from this massive industry. The book CELEBRITY CAT was used to program Rowling as the &#039;actress author&#039; of Harry Potter. I was backstage at the Templar Castle at the time, as they led her on stage to be humiliated. She was only wearing a &#039;cat collar&#039; with a bell. I didn&#039;t see what they actually did to her, on stage. She was also programmed as a PUFFIN because the graduates thought she looked like one. The real author of Harry Potter created the hellish prison &#039;Azkaban&#039;, including \u2018the dementors\u2019, after horrific OIL CULT mind control programming. It was based on her experience in Azerbaijan. Another note, Rowling was also present at the Templar rite in which Madeleine McCann died - hence her offer of a reward in public, was all the more sickening.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What have the Harry Potter books got to do with all of this?

Just look around. All are needed, and everything fits together. It is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior.

It&#039;s been very interesting for me to look through all the different esoteric traditions. The way it seems to me, this mega.nz folder was a personal collection and at some point you opted to share it publicly. Is this correct? Probably you have answered this before but if you could tell me a bit about how this whole thing came to be, I&#039;d be grateful.<br><br>In the Beginner folder, there are a few dozen books, copied over from other parts of the library which have been deemed appropriate for people making their first steps into occult arts; self-initiation, if you will. Though other than than, I have found the library quite tedious to navigate. Would you agree that improvements can be made in terms of the layout/structure of the collection? Perhaps a grouping by period or by heritage or other attributes. The library is fifty or so gigs in size so the mega.nz hosting is not free. Have you considered hosting it on a VPS as your own website? It would be more costly and complicated but there could then be a more personalized visual aesthetic, which I believe the occult-interested appreciate and it would allow for the creation of information pages. What this is (the library), what the traditions are (who, when, what, etc). The zoomer is hard-wired to look up, in a search engine, whatever he does not understand and for controversial topics, which occult arts undoubtedly are, search engines and wikipedia are often\u2026 compromised. Or at the very least abstracts are written by people who are completely outside it. Having info pages -- a wiki, if you will -- written by people &quot;in the know&quot; would be a great benefit to the initiate.<br><br>Briefly, I&#039;m curious about the history of Ape&#039;s Library.

You, right here and right now, are the master, and the master will do as he pleases.<br>The issue is acceptance. Acceptance of the self in mind, body, and spirit.

Looking level or higher, I feel much more relaxed.

One reason I see is that it is very comforting to believe there is something beautiful waiting after the suffering and horror that is dying.

If sex was not pleasurable, nobody would bother bringing anyone into this horrible world where we are destined to decay and fall apart. If eating was not pleasurable, we would stop eating quickly and wither and die. Without sex and eating being pleasurable, this game falls apart. It&#039;s like we&#039;re designed this way to be farmed for something.

If we have the power to destroy them, why don&#039;t we? His response was that we do not have the power to destroy evil. They have their place, we have ours. If we purged their living souls, we would ensure the corruption of the whole system. No soul would be able to learn any lessons, we would slowly merge into 1 consciousness again, and the Universe would have to be remade again. Complete destruction would be the only novel thing for us, because no new experiences would be possible. <br><br>He told me that the duality, the dichotomy, the difference between two points is the basis for all life in our reality.

What God has done is give us possibility itself; every breath a gift, every pain a chance to learn. But in order for us to have free will there must be the chance to fail and be corrupted. Even so, no soul is beyond God&#039;s reach. So no matter how lost we become, there is the option to call for help. <br><br>So yes, God split into many because it felt good to do so, but it felt good because it was the best decision possible.

Among this is the dating of the fall of Atlantis as related to and from Plato, about 9k years before Solon&#039;s time (c9600 BC, 11,600kya). This coincides with meltwater pulse 1b of the roughly thousand year younger dryas climate catastrophe. Further the mass of ice that existed in North America alone would have been nearly equal to that of Antarctica before the younger dryas, a near equal mass was also over Europe. The geographic evidence of the younger dryas melt pulses points to mind bogglingly fast melting, previously thought to have been centuries or millennia has been revised down to months of years recently (in some studies, weeks). This rapid melting of such large masses of ice would have mostly drained into the Atlantic, it would change the thermocline and haloclines of the entire world ocean rapidly and immediately altered the climate. It would have also rapidly changed the isostasy of the Earth&#039;s crust under the Atlantic in particular and raised local sea levels much more rapidly than previously thought. These are merely results however, of a precursor event that triggered the massive melting and climate shift (whether caused from the sun, the Earth itself, or from a passing or impacting comet or asteroid or something else).<br><br>The evidence of catastrophism are all about us, in our sight daily.

This is where the trick lies in using angular speed. It\u2019s nonsense to claim that everyone on earth is experiencing the same speed just bc \u201cmuh maths\u201d said they are. They\u2019re not. Objectively angular speed is the wrong equation to use to determine if you would feel earth\u2019s spin. This is a very very simple concept to grasp if you just use your God-given common sense and logic instead of letting a mathematical equation that you don\u2019t even understand dictate what you believe.<br><br>The correct way to look at it is exactly how I outline with the plane analogy.

The fact that smoking is bad for you is pretty evident, and even a basic understanding of biology should make it intuitive that inhaling smoke into your lungs is going to damage them. It&#039;s unhealthy, and I can imagine that the drain on the economy from it was big enough to start some aggressive campaigns.<br><br>Anyways time for some more interesting theories. First of all, nicotine is definitely capable of improving the brain. It&#039;s a fast acting stimulant, and works on acetylcholine rather than dopamine like other stimulants do. Excess dopamine can be neurotoxic, but elevated acetylcholine is neuroprotective, and specifically improves memory and creativity. It&#039;s a subtly benefit, not aggressive like amphetamines, but I&#039;ve noticed I work better after taking nicotine, and will often use nicotine gum when I need a mental boost. <br><br>Another theory is related to the social component of smoking. There are very few times for people to just exist and talk in American society, especially with people outside your immediate family. The smoke break was one of these times, where multiple people would go outside together and just talk, all while under the influence of a substance that enhances cognition. The only other common time people talk with strangers is under the influence of alcohol which numbs cognition. Basically, by demonizing smoking, another avenue for people who normally would never meet to communicate was removed, and the remaining ways to meet people involve the use of substances which make you stupider, not smarter.", "time": 1674671095, "resto": 33926480}, {"no": 33928128, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:27:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You could change the world and still be a smoker.

There&#039;s just absolutely no way you were going to get cancer from occasionally being around cigarette smoke in a public restaurant, but this is literally what we were told and no one questioned it. It just didn&#039;t seem like a big deal at the time, and no one felt like sticking their neck out to protect smokers&#039; rights. Looking back on it, I do think that outlawing public smoking was an early exercise in social control and they were testing whether people would bend to authoritarian &quot;public health&quot; laws for the flimsiest of reasons. <br>Besides that, the way they demeaned smokers as people is similar to how antivaxxers were treated in COVID times. All that stuff about how smoking makes you reek and turns your teeth yellow was basically a personal attack.

If a feminine planet is located in a masculine sign, it may feel pressured and rushed to act before it is ready, thus becoming a source of tension or fear.

Now at this time, I quit sugar, smoking, coffee, masturbating, late nights, vegetables, carbs, and lazing about. So my guess is I was detoxing something from my body. When i looked online for detox information a few weeks later, I found out that apparently when you detox, these bacteria or whatever is being removed will create endotoxins that shut off bile production and then release the toxins into the bloodstream and it produces all the symptoms I was experiencing.

I&#039;m going to try using the rest of them and then buy some borax by itself to make my own mix and maybe put a little bit in my shoes.

Sexual energy is the single closest manifestation of one&#039;s primal energy, pure from potential. This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there.

First of all you are going to want to stock up on dream enhancing substances, such as wormwood, Vitamin B6, melatonin and huperzine to name a few. If you want an utterly terrifying and alien experience you could try a mushroom microdose. Do some research and see what works for you. You will also need some moderate stimulant such as coffee or something slightly stronger depending on how you respond to it. But the point is it should be strong enough to keep you awake generally speaking, but not strong enough to keep you out of a state of fatigue. So here is the method. <br>Get yourself to become mildly sleep deprived. Either get 2-3 hours of sleep nightly over the course of a few days, or pull an all nighter or two. (Do not overdo it. Seriously, do not push yourself to the point where you become delirious. That will do lasting damage to your brain and also it won&#039;t work if you do) Then once you are utterly exhausted take your dream enhancing substances an hour or two before you plan to sleep and your stimulant 45 to 30 minutes before. The idea is that you must be so exhausted that your body can&#039;t resist falling asleep and stimulated enough so that you can&#039;t properly fall asleep. IF it works (It might not) don&#039;t expect to be in control. I have fallen into sleep paralysis over 10 times and I have never been able to fully control it. My body ALWAYS assumes a sort of fight or flight panic and my heart beats like a mother fucker. Even when I have prepared extensively I get too frightened to be in control.

Before you ask, no, it was definitely just a dream and felt like one, i just watched and read too much ufo shit lately. So in this dream there were some ETs and humans collaborating, their goal wasn&#039;t necesserely malicious, they were studying and experimenting on humans against their will. The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

Funnily enough the night I did it I didn\u2019t do any of that stuff but I\u2019m sure it laid the groundwork, and I kind of did WBTB because I woke up to piss before I had the lucid dream. <br><br>Here\u2019s the crazy thing - before I became lucid, I was dreaming about this kid (I think it was a version of me for several reasons) that was being stalked / initiated by these creepy jester type beings. The whole atmosphere was incredibly anxious and on edge, and so (whilst still not lucid) I got down on my knees, clasped my hands in prayer, and prayed to God, putting myself in his hands and asking for his grace (I remember praying those specific words) to make things better. Whilst I was raised a Christian I don\u2019t go to church now and don\u2019t consider myself one, and don\u2019t pray in waking life, so it\u2019s fascinating that I chose to do so in the dream. <br><br>Anyway the next thing I remember I\u2019m running in golden fields near to where I grew up, in the sun and the countryside. It felt like what I imagine the Greeks called Elysium. And then I became aware as I was running round a corner that my brain was generating everything I was seeing - every leaf and ray of light. I could see the world around me, as it was emerging from me. And then I realised I must be dreaming, and became fully conscious. Immediately I decided to fly. I took off into the sky just like Neo at the end of The Matrix, and felt utterly euphoric. There was an audible and tangible vibration in my back behind my heart, and I felt the dream disintegrating around me. I tried to stabilise it but it fell apart and I woke up. <br><br>So now I\u2019m thinking that I should probably start praying more\u2026", "time": 1674675402, "resto": 33782044}, {"no": 33928513, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)14:38:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33928132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928132</a><br>Welcome to the yellow teeth club", "time": 1674675510, "resto": 33782044}, {"no": 33928875, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)15:53:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "gotta go sleep early today, good night dayo", "time": 1674680036, "resto": 33782044}, {"no": 33928979, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:11:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33928875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928875</a><br>good night!", "time": 1674681096, "resto": 33782044}, {"no": 33929217, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)16:48:07", "name": "John Doe", "com": "lucid dream last night after almost a week of dream journalling and 2 days of hand checks.<br><br>i happened to be flying around a vivid city and I realised I could try to fly faster if I focused hard enough. It was nothing drastic, but it did increase the speed a little. Out of nowhere i decided to do a reality check by looking at my hands and sure enough I had 8 fingers. This caused me to fall to the ground and lose my powers but with enough focus I gained them again. One thing I noticed however was that my field of view decreased a lot as well as a grain filter being put over my vision and everything lost colour. The world started fading but I kept saying &quot;control&quot; as a mantra and it worked as I could continue to fly. Now because I was in a lucid dream, I was wondering of what things I should do, so I tried to spawn a massive Mario piranha plant trying to visualise it, but it just didn&#039;t work. So I wondered if I could go to a new location but I thought creating a portal would be far too difficult, so instead I visualised a green vast grass field and dug into the ground and burrowed hoping that if I go deep enough I would end up in that place, kind of like the opposite of how in Minecraft with the nether how if you dig up enough you get to the void, this however caused my lucidity to end. :(<br><br>So does anyone have any tips on how to control lucid dreams better and how to do what you want more effectively?", "filename": "download", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 296, "h": 296, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674683287733585, "time": 1674683287, "md5": "FFrnkOM2XmDu7WWneNmFsw==", "fsize": 23479, "resto": 33782044}, {"no": 33929489, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)17:25:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33927878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33927878</a><br>Unfortunately no, however I did have a slight impression of having one this morning, which is better than usual.

There&#039;s a lot of random poetry in there; not useful for an occultist, but decent for an admirer.<br>- Lilith: Goddess of Sitra Ahra: https://zeitenundformen.files.wordp<wbr>ress.com/2014/01/lilith-goddess-of-<wbr>sitra-ahrab-t-p.pdf<br>Contains a ton of aspects with associated variety of sigils.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Videos</span><br>https://youtu.be/n1EKccz4fS0<br>https://youtu.be/01guwJbp_ug<br>https://youtu.be/75bnMRPRiDk<br>https://youtu.be/EHol9LrpWks<br><br>Lilith Appreciation Hub (discord): a6uv6wY2aU", "filename": "15", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 486, "h": 740, "tn_w": 164, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674470567705025, "time": 1674470567, "md5": "vgFH/PLaQe/SpgPv+NVQBg==", "fsize": 378389, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lilithgen-15", "replies": 98, "images": 14, "unique_ips": 26}, {"no": 33910787, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)10:17:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Praise Lilith", "time": 1674487028, "resto": 33909694}, {"no": 33911189, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)11:34:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the fuck was lilith doing in inannas huluppu tree?", "filename": "1674260748286499", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 927, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674491644234756, "time": 1674491644, "md5": "9XKdcRwaG09btW4VntdINA==", "fsize": 199143, "resto": 33909694}, {"no": 33911919, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)13:43:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33911189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33911189</a><br>She was having a nap", "filename": "inanna_and_the_huluppu_tree_by_mickthepict_deyjed2-pre", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 752, "h": 1063, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674499385780370, "time": 1674499385, "md5": "yWy3hxmlN71EGpwQ2BCocg==", "fsize": 228241, "resto": 33909694}, {"no": 33912441, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:08:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I offer Mother Lilith my praise and my gratitude once more. &lt;3", "filename": "Mother Lilith - Red hair - Blue eyes", "ext": ".png", "w": 711, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674504516124344, "time": 1674504516, "md5": "1hJlXuvN8Y6Wv4UGUJGwQw==", "fsize": 789034, "resto": 33909694}, {"no": 33913307, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)17:09:56", "com": "Hail Mother Lilith! ^^<br>May she give us all inner peace and happiness in fulfilling our innermost desires &lt;3", "time": 1674511796, "resto": 33909694, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33913489, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)17:34:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anybody else been receiving either answered prayers or a lot of synchronicities one after the other?

It&#039;s much easier to have a fruitful conversation this way.<br><br>I think the points you&#039;re making are fair, and it&#039;s exactly why I put in the warning to discourage worshipful behaviour and think for oneself. I&#039;ve had my own share of negative experiences in general with putting my trust in the wrong people, even including one where a parasitic entity pretended to be Lilith and used a promise I made to her in an attempt to manipulate me. Although this was devastating, it&#039;s because I had the courage to question what I believe to be her, that I was able to realise Lilith wanted me to confront and overcome said parasite, and after I did, I was able to see both myself and her for who she is.<br><br>As a deity, Lilith is fringe rather than mainstream. The reason the parasite I mentioned was able to affect me so deeply, is because it turned my own deep-seated insecurities that lingered from my adolescence against me. That&#039;s how parasitic entities work. And like me, many others who are drawn to Lilith are also outcasts, with a past that is troubled in one way or another: troubled enough that they would stray off the path of normality and seek her. Perhaps you can understand then that some of them are especially vulnerable, and prone to confusion.<br><br>It was as I began to see through my own problems and started to overcome them, that I began to understand just how much Lilith has truly helped me. And it was such a personal thing, that it was something I had to realise for myself; and yet despite that, Lilith still helped me realise it sooner rather than later. Rather than blaming her for the things I went through despite my faith, I appreciate that her warmth gave me the strength and courage to face myself, so that I could leave that sorrowful past behind me. I love her.<br><br>That&#039;s the same as I wish upon others. Perhaps you understand better now why I speak so highly of her.

Welcome to the eternal family of God! You become a Christian by praying to God in a confession of your need for Jesus&#039; blood to cleanse you of your sins. Ask God to forgive you, thank Him, and ask for Him to give you the Holy Spirit and fill you with Him. Get baptized. <br><br>Read your Gospels, read your Torah (the Pentateuch - the first five books of the Bible known also as the books of Moses), and read your entire Bible as diligently and thoroughly as you&#039;re able. Find yourself a good church to become a part of, but in the meantime, you may be able to find online resources to help guide your journey with the Lord. I don&#039;t what denomination you&#039;re intending to join - I&#039;m a non-denominational Protestant - raised more or less Southern Baptist, so here&#039;s a few people I would recommend listening to. <br><br>- Charles Stanley of In Touch Ministries; he&#039;s very good, I think, for young (in the Lord) believers in that he sticks to a simple style of preaching with clear references from the Word of God. <br>- It&#039;s Supernatural with Sid Roth; a Christian, miracle focused interview style show. God led me to this as a young believer, when I left the occult. <br>- Hal Lindsey; he used to have a show - the Hal Lindsey Report, but can now be found on YouTube. He&#039;s an excellent Bible teacher with a focus on prophecy. He delves well into the Greek when going over the New Testament, and I find it very enjoyable. <br>- Adrian Rodgers; because he is a favorite of my father. His sermons can be found on YT. <br><br>Here&#039;s some light Christian reading, if you&#039;re interested. <br><br>- Growing Up Spiritually; Kenneth Hagin<br>- Surprised by the Power of the Spirit; Dr. Jack Deere<br>- Eros Defiled; Dr. John White<br>- Humility: True Greatness; C. J. Mahaney<br>- The Weight of Glory; C.S. Lewis<br>- Wild at Heart; John Eldridge <br><br>I suppose that&#039;s enough of those for now.

You are either under God&#039;s protection and off-limits, or you are the legal property of the devil and all the forces who serve him. UFOs do not get spotted by accident by randos down below.

He didn&#039;t know how to read or write, but I get the sense he lived in France or Hungary maybe. He was a bad person, to say the least, and was killed in a small skirmish where he was stabbed in the gut with a boar spear. I remember his last thought were anger that someone used a hunting weapon on him, and how in God&#039;s name did it penetrate his ringmail. After falling to his knees he was beheaded from behind, and I remember trying to spit on my killers as I rolled away. <br><br>I think the reason I can remember Thomas is because his actions are the reason I chose to incarnate into poverty this time around.

He spent a lot of time saying goodbye to his pets, he had 3 cats and a dog, I think. He had his neighbor take them because they all knew he was done for. He had been called back to his temple to answer for Heresy against the gods. He was well aware that the punishment for heresy was death, even for someone of his station. He could&#039;ve fled and lived in Nubia where his mother&#039;s family was from, but instead he returned to the temple. On the way there were armed guards that fell to their knees at the sight of him, my guess is because they knew they were going to be sent to kill him and they were grateful that he was returning to face punishment. <br><br>I remember the pool in front of the temple was so beautiful that night.

I remember the guy had such a big ugly nose that Akkhan always hated/was jealous of. I guess he thought the nose might be why the high priest had better breathwork than he did? Maybe it was just vanity. The high priest looked at him and nodded slowly. He glanced to his personal guards and Akkhan was immediately stabbed to death. They were very sloppy about it and death took awhile longer than it should have. <br><br>I think I remember Akkhan&#039;s death because of how deliberately and almost passionately marched to his own death. He was guilty of the heresies he was being executed for and he would not renounce them and he would not flee. I was supposed to know that for some punishments we are deserving of them. <br><br>The heresies? He began telling people that not all of the gods were &quot;Gods&quot;. He just wanted everyone to know that some of them were just ascended mortals, but only the priesthood was allowed to discuss that. He didn&#039;t really doubt their power or divinity, he just wanted people to know that the Neters were once not. He thought people would be happy to hear those things but he was wrong.

The bigfoots are being less openly confrontational. They don&#039;t pound the house as often. But now I&#039;m seeing lights in the sky at night. They move in a weird zigzag pattern with jerky acceleration then zoom off so fast I can&#039;t even imagine the speed. There&#039;s poltergeist phenomena in my house now. I watched a floor lamp jump into the air and crash back down. One of my wife&#039;s rancid buttplugs flew off the shelf and hit me and I puked and had to spend 2 hours cleaning up the mess, I heard bigfoot laughter in my head the whole time. I turned on the sink and fire shot out of it. But the worst part is the dreams and telepathic communications are getting worse. The bigfoots are telling me more and more they want my wife but I haven&#039;t been able to trick her into getting taken by them, she&#039;s onto me. It doesn&#039;t matter though because they say she isn&#039;t &quot;ripe&quot; yet. They say they want my &quot;hairless hog&quot; to be &quot;nice and swollen&quot; when they take her, they want her ass cheeks to be like two massive sides of beef. They&#039;re using psychokinesis on her colon to make her IBS worse, they want her farts to be as loud and disgusting as possible for their atavistic mating ritual that they say is older even than humans. The bigfoots compete in a series of athletic games for access to the female, then in the final stage she farts in their faces repeatedly and whichever bigfoot is alpha enough to not faint or even flinch takes her. If farts aren&#039;t enough to separate the men from the boys the female must projectile shit at their heads. The smells coming out of my wife lately have just about made me black out, my eyes water and I have to run out of the house. Started screaming in rage at the bigfoots outside when I was gassed out of my own house for the fifth time in one day because of whatever black magic they&#039;re working on her ass.

I remember the whole dream had this weird uncanny feeling, like something nefarious was going on behind the scenes. Eventually it ended up I was kidnapped and kept in some compound beneath the school where people were kept. Everyone was naked and kept in abhorrent conditions, shit and piss everywhere, dirt floors, cold concrete walls, barely any light. We were fed like animals in a trough, fighting over what we were given. The whole place was basically a holding grounds for test subjects, for the purpose of being killed in horrific ways, electrocuted repeatedly, beaten, and humiliated in various ways, many sexual. The one I remember witnessing was a man who had a turbine implanted in his abdomen, and when they turned it on it essentially liquified his bowels like a high powered meat grinder would, and he was forced to suffer and die slowly. When he was almost dead they came in and took him away somewhere, it felt like I was just viewing all of this as well, as if I had no other purpose there but to witness it. At some point I escaped, and went running to a house where someone was raking leaves. I remember feeling this primal terror at this point, fleeing this torture chamber. As I got to the person raking, they looked panicked, as if I was doing something that could get them in trouble. <br>When I got to them and begged them to help they brought me inside and called someone on the phone, shortly after I was vanned by some guys in uniforms. The next thing I can remember was being in a setting, nighttime to be specific. It was in a big empty field, with people in black suits with hoods and strange masks.

And how is even this connected to astral travel?</span><br>There exists an infinite amount of realities with infinite &quot;you&#039;s&quot; into which you can focus your conscious awareness. Astral projection and other OOBEs are, in essence, the same thing - projecting your consciousness into the Astral Plane etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do I have to come back?</span><br>Not from shifting.<br>Yes from projecting, but also somewhat up for debate.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Does this have anything to do with the teenager trend spreading on TikTok and in other places?</span><br>Yes and no.

I&#039;ve been looking into AP a lot lately and I&#039;ve had some really intense experiences but it never gets to the point where I can actually see or feel anything beyond the point of shifting. It feels like my body is slowly shrinking inside itself and I hear noise that&#039;s getting louder and louder, even shaking of the whole body at some points but I always drift off and wake up. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me being excited although I try as hard to just put emotions to the side in the process or if I&#039;m doing something wrong. I&#039;ve been advised by some kind anons to refer to /succgen/ for a helping hand but I don&#039;t want a demon to fuck me in the arse or anything sex related. What I&#039;m looking for is an entity willing to offer a helping hand without getting into a wicked relationship with it. It sounds too good to be true but I&#039;m new to all of this although I&#039;ve been trying for quite some time and I don&#039;t know who to reach out to. I&#039;ve been listening to the HemiSync FLACs and doing meditation, I&#039;ve read through some literature regarding AP and tried multiple methods. What I&#039;m looking for in the Astral Plane is a mentor like entity that will teach me about the history of humanity and nature and help me get in touch with the spiritual plane in general.

She had hallucinations, used odd patterns of speech, became belligerent and paranoid and, near the very end of her life, failed to recognize her husband and son. Without her husband\u2019s knowledge at the time, Ms. Twyman became involved in QAnon and other viral, pro-Trump conspiracy theories which led her to interact with people and groups she never would have interacted with when she was healthy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From October 2018 to March 14, 2019, three months prior to her death, Ms. Twyman appeared on and co-produced a podcast hosted by Defendant Alger entitled RX ONLY PICTURE SHOW (\u201cthe RX Only Show\u201d) where she discussed esoteric topics and various conspiracy theories.

Is it a coincidence?", "com": "The number 33 is considered to be a sacred or significant number in several religious traditions. Some examples include:<br><br>Hinduism:<br>In Hinduism, 33 is considered to be a sacred number because it is associated with the 33 gods of the Vedas, who are believed to be the highest deities in the Hindu pantheon. The number 33 is also believed to symbolize the ultimate attainment of spiritual enlightenment and the realization of the ultimate goal of life, which is union with the divine. I also encountered it in the Upanishads.<br><br>Buddhism:<br>In Buddhism, the number 33 is often associated with the 33 celestial abodes of the Buddha, which are believed to be realms of existence in the heavenly realm. These celestial abodes are said to be inhabited by beings who have attained a high level of spiritual development and are on the path to enlightenment.<br><br>Christianity: In Christianity, the number 33 is sometimes seen as a symbol of the age of Jesus at the time of his death. This interpretation is based on the belief that Jesus was crucified at the age of 33. One example of the number 33 appearing in the Bible is in the New Testament, where it is mentioned as the age of Jesus at the time of his death. According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus &quot;began to be about thirty years of age&quot; (Luke 3:23) and &quot;suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried&quot; (Acts 2:23) at the age of 33.<br><br>Islam: In Islam, the number 33 is sometimes seen as a symbol of the 99 names of Allah, which are believed to represent the attributes and qualities of God. One example of the number 33 appearing in the Quran is in Surah Al-Ahzab, where it is mentioned that there were 33 companions of the Prophet Muhammad who pledged allegiance to him at the event known as the &quot;Pledge of Al-Aqaba.&quot; These companions are considered to be among the most prominent and influential followers of the Prophet Muhammad, and are highly respected and revered in Islamic tradition.<br><br>Sikhism: In Sikhism, the number 33 is sometimes seen as a symbol of the 33 million gods and goddesses that are believed to exist in the Sikh pantheon.", "filename": "33_upanishads", "ext": ".png", "w": 611, "h": 758, "tn_w": 201, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674671770153182, "time": 1674671770, "md5": "qHU0CH4bW8cwrjSjl8yULg==", "fsize": 319742, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "number-33-is-it-a-coincidence", "replies": 36, "images": 7, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 33928684, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33928683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928683</a><br>12 is more significant.<br><br>Judaism: 12 sons of Israel.<br><br>Christianity: 12 Apostles of Christ.<br><br>(Shi&#039;a) Islam: 12 Imams.<br><br>Hellenism: 12 Greek Gods on Mount Olympus.<br><br>Odinism: 12 Main Gods.<br><br>Discuss the power of 12.", "time": 1674672547, "resto": 33928683}, {"no": 33928685, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:52:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "probably just an archetype of human consciousness<br>example, shitloads of languages use the &quot;i&quot; sound in words for tiny things<br>see, tiny, petite, pequeno", "time": 1674672752, "resto": 33928683}, {"no": 33928686, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:57:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33928684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928684</a><br>7, 12, 33 tend to all be significant, yeah.<br><a href=\"#p33928685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928685</a><br>So I should become a Mason?", "filename": "33", "ext": ".png", "w": 320, "h": 270, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1674673046099391, "time": 1674673046, "md5": "nphEamAJyQ+/2YTYZpuSsQ==", "fsize": 8356, "resto": 33928683}, {"no": 33928687, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:58:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33928683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33928683</a><br>33 is a numerical representation of the Jewish star which is a representation of Saturn&#039;s hexagon.

Jewish and Christian thinkers were influenced by their neighbor\u2019s religions since they reference Tartarus and church iconography used images of Jupiter for God as a sky father or Isis for the Virgin Mary. Latin America and the Caribbean have a history of using saints as stand ins for gods. <br><br>That being said. Don\u2019t ever but anyone above THE God which I feel represents not only the whole universe but the untapped potential within you which Jesus talks about having the kingdom within you. As in life, no answer is outside of you. These figures are there to help you think and play out what you want but they are not the answer.

We\u2019ve confirmed the surface of earth is flat with countless observations which falsify the claimed globe radius of 3959miles, we\u2019ve falsified the assertion that earth spins, and we\u2019ve proven empirically that the gravity would not be capable of preventing earth\u2019s atmos from seeking equilibrium with the alleged vacuum of space.
