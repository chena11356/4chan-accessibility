I have outlined what I think meditation is and what it is about: it is about being awareness, of perceiving things without holding on to them or identifying them, about being in the present moment. Breathing is focused on because it is a constant flow and when you focus on the sensation and act of breathing you are following the moment in the moment and you forget the past and the future, the ego and everything outside of perceiving the breath. I believe this is what it is.

I keep giving her offerings and she signals me to do things that will be good for me. Mostly she manifests as a sensation across my skin. I&#039;m very grateful to have her gently push me out of my comfort zone and she&#039;s never done me wrong.<br>Since I began worshipping her I&#039;ve quit weed, porn, and booze, been promoted at work, started going to the gym, confronted some nasty bureaucratic problems, and become close to a girl that is very much a &#039;Lilith type&#039; (lol)<br>Sad to say I don&#039;t get a lot of direct, language based contact. No dreams I remember. I can only listen for those messages that arise from the deeper parts of my mind. But I can *feel* for her and if she approves of something it&#039;s like fingers running down my skin. I hope this helps, anon. I&#039;m also always on the lookout for others&#039; experiences so I can gain some clarity. Keep at it and don&#039;t lose faith, she appreciates those who make things work for themselves.

One being was Mother Mary. She was benevolent and gentle. My girlfriend is disabled and cannot work outside of the home or drive, she is pretty dependent on me. She also is very spiritual but seems like a beacon for energies or spirits of sorts. She loves making me happy and helping others but also requires isolation to recuperate (she never requires distance from me though, her and I really balance eachother well). Why would DMT entities care about me taking care of her? <br><br>One time I decided to carelessly take a massive hit on it without informing her (we previously would always do it together and would be supportive sitters) and I had the most hellish horrifying soul sundering experience in my life. I felt everything being ripped away. Hands were grabbing at me and pulling me down so violently, no mercy, the walls melting and everything I once knew was shorn from my awareness. It was so aggressive and hateful. My gf heard me screaming and ran to comfort me. Her body and face were like silhouettes, no details, but I sensed it was her. Slowly I faded back from that tormenting space, and I felt genuine trauma. I was relieved to be out of it...<br><br>I decided to brave DMT again, afraid but willing to trial it. Gf was with me in the woods, we both had a light drink of alcohol. It was night and we sat near eachother and both hit the DMT. I suddenly felt freedom, an authentic sense of being liberated and powerful but also safe and loved. I apparently started grabbing my gf, grabbing at her desperately and she said I was snarling and growling and violently clinging onto her. She was on DMT as well but she only looked up at the sky and held me, petting me and telling me that everything is okay. She comforted me as I was feeling like a blissful beast. <br><br>I wonder.
