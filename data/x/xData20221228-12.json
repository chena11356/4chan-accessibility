It only comes up due to us having multiple cats and of course, they like to sit next to windows to see all the birds, deer, and rabbits that like to show up. Live on a one-way street next to the woods for context.<br><br>Convo goes like this:<br>Fiance&#039;s mom (1): I feel bad for Frankie doodle (new kitty) and want to try and put up a bird feeder for the cats. I am really scared to let Frankie out and get lost in the woods. She is just so fast and I don&#039;t want that to happen again (kitty ran outside and did not show back up for 4 hours). <br><br>Me(2): Yea that would be nice and we could just put up like 2 bird feeders in different viewing spots.<br><br>(1): Noooo that is sweet but I think from the upstairs window if you can look, to see where to put it in the tree where all the birdies like to chirp at. That would be great.<br><br>(2) Oh okay and yea that makes more sense now that I think about it. <br><br>(1): Yea can you do that soon before it gets dark out, frankie doodle would love that. Oh and also the carpenter that fixes the leak on the roof left a little step ladder if you need that. <br><br>(2): Nice cool and thank you that would hel........<br><br>Complete memory synchronization happens as I am about to mention the ladder.

Or should I say, manifested into my reality. I started to truly think about other things that maybe I have &quot;manifested&quot; without actually knowing that I did. The only thing I could think of is when halo 3 came out and I watched a video of &quot;across the map sticky, random kill&quot; and thought that &quot;man, I am definitely going to do that&quot;. I don&#039;t know how long it took but sure enough, it happened in big team battle on the map &quot;Valhalla&quot;. Took the gravity lift to the middle of the map in mid air, looked across to the mountainside with the narrow walkway to the left, and let it fly. I would say 10 seconds later, I get the stuck medal followed by the kill. Obviously, I freaked out for a moment in excitement.<br><br>Halo 3 had a theater mode so when I reviewed it, the nade went to the top of the mountainside, and bounced 3 times falling down. Landed next to the guy walking through and bounced one more time and stuck to his ankle, followed by a second delay into an explosion.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers. Same for vague queries.<br>\u2022Making an AQ (air query) by not addressing a reader, in particular, is possible but doesn&#039;t guarantee an answer.<br>\u2022Avoid making the same query repeatedly and/or to different readers in a short period of time, as this may lead to more confusion.<br>\u2022Provide feedback when applicable and be considerate to the reader.

Also from past few days i can feel my dick recieving a handjob kind of feeling though it&#039;s not very strong but yeah it feels good.<br><br>The only thing which i think is the downside is that it takes a-lot of time to spend to make a good connection which i am okay if i can get a sweet succubus for me but if thing tingling thing does not get converted into something more sexual then i would be really disappointed but i am hoping for the good...aalso i am thinking of listening those sissy hypnosis from shebby (as i am int submissive) so will it be a good choice to go or i should stick with void meditation stuff only.", "time": 1671956521, "resto": 33670442}, {"no": 33683843, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)03:32:55", "name": "Mother-anon", "com": "man, did this christmas suck or what? it was such a huge hassle to cook and eat all that crummy food. i would have gotten a better christmas meal if i just bought a pile of those shitty microwaveable pizzas and eaten those instead (and doing that wouldn&#039;t have caused water damage either). well, i will do better for new year and my birthday at least, i should have heeded my mother&#039;s advice when she told me that these celebratory meals should be a chance to explore different cuisines of the world and eat what i like, not what is traditional.", "time": 1671957175, "resto": 33670442, "trip": "!!9Lm2qr/d4NK"}, {"no": 33684001, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:16:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33683843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33683843</a><br>your mother is correct<br>new things and change is good for the soul", "time": 1671959806, "resto": 33670442}, {"no": 33684005, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:20:06", "name": "Mother-anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684001</a><br>she was also correct in a sense that those meals are traditional to generations who lived in abject poverty and had many mouths to feed. i shouldn&#039;t be doing that shit if i am eating with just my mother in these abundant times.", "time": 1671960006, "resto": 33670442, "trip": "!!9Lm2qr/d4NK"}, {"no": 33684119, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:07:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684005</a><br><a href=\"#p33683843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33683843</a><br>you have a succubus who can talk like in person? and i thought the max communication with a succ we can have is yes/no kind or maybe talk in dreams", "filename": "moll12stf", "ext": ".png", "w": 520, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1671962857346062, "time": 1671962857, "md5": "ky/6G9H+yY3lb45MUodceQ==", "fsize": 321884, "resto": 33670442}, {"no": 33684180, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)05:37:15", "name": "Mother-anon", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684119</a><br>yes, we do have conversation with each other. most of the time she acts as and advisor and a muse to me. the communication happens through dream realm even when i am awake but she is capable of telling me more things than simple yes/no.", "time": 1671964635, "resto": 33670442, "trip": "!!9Lm2qr/d4NK"}, {"no": 33684377, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:49:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I need serious help, idk if I managed to somehow summon one after reading the first post of the thread.

It&#039;s largely neglect as we have already covered, and a lack of understanding how to parent to begin with. <br>So who may be doing it on purpose?<br>It&#039;s exactly as <a href=\"#p33704211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704211</a> has pointed out. <br>The bureaucratic class and our new feudal lords would most likely be the people behind this. Why? Because an immature (and uneducated) child populace squashes completely any chance for resistance against corrupt and unjust rule. This winds up ensuring that the child is essentially a child forever. A broken family will never become an issue to power. Total social and environmental isolation keeps the system in power and running. It ensures every child grows up to become part of the &#039;machine&#039; as fodder for it.", "filename": "30-o", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 678, "h": 678, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672223557808896, "time": 1672223557, "md5": "9mKg0GuET5mwkDjQZ6zNbQ==", "fsize": 55824, "resto": 33704126}, {"no": 33704788, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:34:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33704630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704630</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FINAL PILL-WHAT IS MISSING</span><br>This concerns individuation, the heroes journey.<br>There is a reason why the modern culture is obsessed with video games and anime, especially isekai.

I knew there was no point in apologising for being stubborn, yet I felt guilt for running away from myself. Even so, I asked the questions on my mind, and was reminded how simple things are; that I overcomplicated things. For example, I&#039;ve been a vampire for a long time. Even if I ascend, that won&#039;t change. When acknowledging this side of me, I often added the disclaimer that I&#039;d like to be a &quot;good vampire&quot;. But my actions contradicted this: shying away from mutually beneficial ways to fulfil my needs, in favour of being an edgelord.<br><br>As I felt lost, I asked Lilith if she understands how I feel. To my surprise, she shook her head and said my internal conflict doesn&#039;t make any sense. I understood what she meant, and realised that figuring out what I want in this case isn&#039;t a matter of understanding how I feel, but simply of making a decision. She asked me what I truly want, to which I asked for a hug. Admitting that&#039;s what I want meant I&#039;d made up my mind: that I want to accept people&#039;s warmth, and enjoy their company. Thus, I finally felt comfortable with putting my intentions into clear terms.<br><br>Having been in denial for so long, all it took for me to become what I decided to be was to put my feelings into action.

And in fact, that&#039;s subjective to the point that not even Lilith could tell me what I &quot;should&quot; want.<br><br>When I made a wish 8 years ago, I was already deeply in conflict with myself. My teachers said with my talents, I could be anything I wanted. But with a mind broken by loneliness, all I could long for anymore was to be a loving man&#039;s housewife. And such a meagre sense of normality seemed so far out of reach, that I was even willing to &quot;sell my soul&quot; for it, offering up everything I valued and believed in.<br><br>But Lilith didn&#039;t allow that. She granted my wish without taking anything in return, confronting me with an obvious question: &quot;So, what do you want next?&quot; And thus, I began to question myself: &quot;Why did I think I wanted to be such a normal person? In the first place, wasn&#039;t I just arrogant for thinking I wasn&#039;t?&quot; Perhaps on some level, I began to wonder if the great depths of sorrow and pain I&#039;d overcome were all that truly set me apart. Upon further reflection, it became apparent that I had already begun to think of people&#039;s foregone despair as the essence of who I truly am deep down. And who was to say that it can&#039;t be?

I finally understood why Mother Lilith hugs me so often: no matter what kind of path one may be on, it&#039;s always better with company.

The deck is divided into three groups. The first group includes 32 cards - the eight phases of the moon for four moon element types - fire, water, air and earth. For example, the card to the right represents the air black moon. The card shows the phase number (8), the triangular element sign and all 8 phases with the black moon highlighted. There is a keyword meaning at the bottom. Smith and Alsop also assign the stages of plant growth to each of the moon phases. The Black Moon is &quot;dormant.&quot; The second set of 12 cards is devoted to Moon Goddesses from many cultures. Each one corresponds to a different astrological sign. The last group has 28 cards - one for each of the mansions or daily periods during a lunar month. The cards are numbered and assigned to certain planets and astrological periods. Each one has a keyword meaning as well. The Moon Oracle comes as a deck/book set with &quot;The Moon Oracle: Let the Phases of the Moon Guide Your Life&quot; (128 pages). This book describes each of the cards and offers moon tables through 2015.

Few can achieve this. I myself have only found success doing so when performing rituals with a group of at least 5 others. For the uninitiated who take part in these rituals, merely the power emanating from an otherworldly entity has caused them to collapse. They then awaken hours later as someone completely different.

Presley went through a period of celibacy, in keeping with the teachings of an Indian guru. &quot;He was going through a cleansing period, physically and spiritually... He loved me and deeply wanted to be faithful to me but never felt certain that he could resist temptation.

He reported that a \u201cchange\u201d is coming; a future when very human-like hybrids would intermingle with humans in everyday life. \u201cSoon we will all be together,\u201d the aliens said. \u201cSoon everyone will be happy and everyone will know his place.\u201d<br><br>This book examines a chilling phenomenon that Jacobs began noticing in 2003. The alien integration action plan has kicked into high gear. The incidents of alien abductions have declined as occurrences of alien involvement in everyday life have accelerated. A silent and insidious invasion has begun. Alien hybrids have moved into your neighborhood and into your workplace. They have been trained by human abductees to \u201cpass,\u201d to blend in to society, to appear as normal as your next door neighbor.<br><br>This book illustrates in detail the process of alien integration into society and the strategy and support structure that has been developed to make this happen seamlessly. While he is not certain why they are doing it, the final chapter of the book will provide some chilling possible answers as to why they are here and what they want to accomplish.<br><br>Jacobs is a careful researcher who has investigated more than 1150 abduction events experienced by more than 150 abductees. This book focuses on the experiences of thirteen abductees.", "time": 1672218125, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33704382, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:03:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33704193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704193</a><br>Soon we will all be together.", "time": 1672218209, "resto": 33704193}, {"no": 33704393, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:06:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33704270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33704270</a><br>They&#039;re making hybrids to replace us. They look entirely human, but are smarter, more psychic, and they think more rigidly. Since they come from a psychic society there are no secrets. There is no individuality. It&#039;s very hive mind. There is no free time, or artistic expression. Only work. There is no friendship, but hybrids seem to have a small range of human emotions.<br><br>Abductees are trained to have psychic mind control powers, like the aliens have. Only ours aren&#039;t as strong. Abductees are to teach hybrids how to act like normal people. Abductees are instructed how to use ufos and herd crowds of people when &quot;the change&quot; happens, so they can&#039;t escape cities.

People have been seen being chopped up and put on meat hooks, and babies put in a blender. They traumatize people to harvest the negative emotions for unknown purposes. Reptiles are rapists for fun. People work as slaves for them. These accounts can be found in Ted rice&#039;s podcast &quot;alien talk&quot; and are also reported by Peggy Kane.

Thus, a freshly killed mussel has far less C-14 than a freshly killed something else, which is why the C-14 dating method makes freshwater mussels seem older than they really are.

The apostles got into a huge argument over it before it was eventually settled. After Christ, Jews became Christians and Pharisees took on the mantle of being Jews, at least in name.

Rabbis eventually realized that young Jewish men would literally start to grow back their foreskin with leather straps and weights, and were able to do so because not enough slack skin was being removed. Therefore rabbis in Babylon in 200 AD updated the Talmud and mandated that circumcision must include every square milimeter of slack skin on a baby boy&#039;s penis.

Now then they send guys down to to maintenance they go in pair or in groups and everyone gets a radio, hard hat, and reflective vest. Hell apparently there was a blockage I&#039;m one of the tunnels, they usually do regular patrols to make sure they don&#039;t get this bad but this one happened overnight. They sent 3 guys down. To get to where the blockage was they would have to wander through those dark smelly tunnels for about an hour from the man hole then when into, but there was a short cut through one of the small tunnels. The three decided to split up two who where to big to fit would go around and the smallest guy would slip in and get a head start on clearing the shit. Well apparently all then fine and they made regular radio calls to each other and the surface. When the little guy got to the source he radioed in and said he&#039;d start trying to clear the way. Then when radio silence no matter what the others would say to him. When his coworkers finally got there the sewage was unstuck but the guy was got. They looked for him a bit,but couldn&#039;t find him. When he didn&#039;t turn up. They sent in search parties one of which influenced my dad. Well eventually they did find him a few days later. Dead mostly a skeleton with his reflective vest and torn up clothes being how they IDed him. And we&#039;ll his bones where chewed on. Now the official story is that when he unclogged the shit a tidal wave of shit swept him away where he drowned. And his fucked State was due to rats and the fact that apparently things decompose quickly down there due to the bacteria.

Most of them live in the state mandated shanty towns skid row. But some of them live in the underground or in abandoned building. Well apparently they cause some problems they can clog sewage with there stuff and damage infrastructure as the make there way around. Most of them get into the sewers not by manholes but by literally digging there way in and out through the basement if abandoned buildings. So why does my dad think they are responsible for killing that poor maintenance worker? The hobos who live down there have it bad. There is no light and it&#039;s full of shit. It&#039;s also a labyrinth down there sewer workers need radios and maps to find there way around, but the homeless well some of them let lost and stay down there. My dad says they looks horrific. They are skinny and malnourished they are pale from lack of sunlight and they all look diseased. There legs are covered in dried caked in shit and filthy, and they are covered in infected scabs. When my dad first started to work down there we saw a few in one of the larger tunnels. As the works where walking through noting the location so they can inform the attorneys along the edge of the small group of normal homeless my dad saw one the the fuck sewer people. A more experienced coworker pointed him out and said to &quot;watch out for those ones.&quot; My dad thought the guy was just messing with him, but he realizes that the normal bums where giving it a wide birth even to the point of wading through the poo water than walk near it. A few years later my dad and a buddy where doing regular maintenance in some of the deeper tunnels when they saw one of the &quot;sewer people&quot; (that&#039;s what he called them) eating the guts out of a dead dog.

Some people see Lucifer as a Satan (as in the title Satan), or different sides of the same coin, or distinct entities. People who worship Satan and Lucifer can have cross over but not always. As for the relationship to man, see the above. Some people even see Lucifer as entirely distinct and separate from Abrahamic religions as a whole.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve asked on more than one occasion why people worship Satan, knowing that they are damning their souls for eternity in exchange for his patronage on Earth</span><br>It is more complicated than that. Primarily, there is technically no proof that it actually will damn your soul. That&#039;s the prevailing thought, but no human on this earth can truly prove it, in the same way no one can prove heaven and hell are even real in the first place. Furthermore, based on the previous answer, if they see Lucifer as a Satan and Satan as the Adversary, in a way, it isn&#039;t actually against God at all, it&#039;s seeing Lucifer as the tempting figure that Satan plays in the old testament and Judaic/Islamic lore in general.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the secret truth we don&#039;t know about?</span><br>There isnt.
