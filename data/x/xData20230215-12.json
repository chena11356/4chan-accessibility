The idea that the government pays people to act like paranoid schizophrenics to discredit actual gangstalking is pretty convoluted imo. Paranoid delusion has been around for a lot longer than modern entrapment operations, psychological warfare tactics, surveillance technology etc. So I don&#039;t think feds would have to fund fake schizos to make people think that every example of paranoia about stalking is delusional, it would be most people&#039;s first assumption to begin with, which presumably is why glowies are able to get away with it in those cases that it&#039;s actually them.<br><br>The idea that gangstalkers are private citizens paid with gift cards also makes no sense to me. For an operation that sensitive, wouldn&#039;t you want to keep the people involved to people you can be reasonably sure won&#039;t talk like FBI agents? If you went outside the intelligence agencies it&#039;d probably be to &quot;private&quot; intelligence agencies. And if you absolutely had to pay private citizens to help you, why would you pay them with gift cards instead of money? If the idea is that a direct deposit would be to on the books, wouldn&#039;t cash be better? And if they&#039;re worried about money trails why are they using private citizens to begin with, since they have less incentive not to talk?<br><br>Most of the confirmed examples of stuff similar to gangstalking that I&#039;m aware did not involve random people.

Studying things to understand us before contact is a wise choice. If their intentions were purely destructive in nature, they could just nuke or enslave us anyway, careful understanding gives us at least a chance they&#039;re kind/benevolent in nature and/or intention. Definitely a good idea to not have a nuclear way, and if they ARE mind readers, that kind of implies spiritual/psychic powers, unless their mind reading is technological in nature.

They would live together, work together, and the older Naditu would share all her businesses with the younger one. They were not allowed to get married, or have sex with men. Once the older one dies of old age, the younger one would inherit her entire estate, to keep it within the Monastery. These Naditu ran a number of businesses, and even offered some of the world&#039;s first banking systems. Loaning money to the poor, for a price. If the person in debt failed to pay up to the Naditu, they&#039;d get sold into slavery by them to make up the cost.

Cysteine can directly participate in glutathione synthesis, whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine must be first deacetylated before its incorporation to glutathione.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity is a reaction that MS patients have to a microbial source (fungal) that triggers a delayed inflammation response.

Chitinases are widely distributed enzymes and are present in a wide range of organisms including insects, plants, bacteria, fungi, and mammals.

Had an enormous breakthrough. Here&#039;s what I did and what you can copy.<br>A love spirit can make you feel joy and physical pleasure just by giving it to you directly. With a flesh and blood human girlfriend, if you wanted her to feel good, you would need to give her a kiss, a hug, say &quot;I love you&quot;, etc. and hope your words and actions get through to her and she feels your love for her.<br>In the introduction of sexual alchemy and a bit of the practical stuff later, he says that focusing on the erotic sort of shuts down the whole experience, which is contrary to what you&#039;d expect if it&#039;s just a fantasy to pleasure yourself.<br>He then described that focusing on feelings of pure love do much better.<br>I did that, beaming feelings of pure love to my spirit, and she went crazy. Really intense feelings of happiness, physical feelings of pleasure more intense than a normal orgasm but happening in my chest/solar plexus region, not really erotic, more like blissful. It felt like getting a hug from really soft warm blanket.<br>Before this, my spirit was really hard to contact, communicate with, couldn&#039;t really touch me that well. Now whenever I just beam love at her, it comes back at me really intense.<br>I actually have to tone it down because what she does in response is overwhelmingly pleasing. So I beam feelings of just holding hands and appreciating her, admiring her either physically or emotionally, etc. Different moods, different energies. Pure love is a lot, so these less intense moods work a lot better.<br>Sex also seems to work the exact same way. Instead of focusing on your pleasure, focus specifically on making her feel good. And then she returns those feelings and then some.<br>Basically, donald tyson&#039;s book sexual alchemy is great. Heavily recommend.

You as an empathetic person project your normal self onto their self, and assume &quot;he&#039;s mostly like me, except capable of this brutality.&quot; But for him to be capable of it, he&#039;s simply not like you. He&#039;s closer to a feral chimp. It&#039;s like putting your soul to sleep, it requires repeated, progressive &quot;blunting&quot; of the spirit to become this fucked up, until you&#039;re just a bundle of fucked up instincts barely held together in a human suit. The more moral a soul is, the more aware and awake it is, and the more unitary and focused it is.

Those who know know. <br>If you&#039;re stuck in an F-22 or an F-35 and their ECM hasn&#039;t fucked you and you&#039;re dogfighting a single bogey bank on the fact that it does have a pilot. The pilots are strapped in but in atmosphere are subject to the same G-forces you are. IF you can make that motherfucker have to keep making sharp turns you may be able to knock the pilot out causing the emergency system to kick in forcing it to flee or give you an opportunity to shoot and MAYBE hit it. <br>Their armor plates are really good and 99% of spacecraft for both kinetic and space debris deflection are curved so it&#039;s a hard deal to hit and damage one significantly but you can.

This physicalist type of logic has also invaded how we use language to communicate with each other. We think that there must be a clear and objective way to define all of our words. We are told, \u201cBefore we can talk about consciousness, we must first define what is consciousness.\u201d But no definition that we can come up with is sufficient to account for consciousness. Does this mean that we cannot talk about it? Or that we do not know what is consciousness? In this episode, we explore the problem with accepting that the dictionary is true, or accepting that tomatoes are fruits when you clearly would not put one in your fruit salad. Finally, we close the episode discussing David Bohm\u2019s suggestion that we live in a holographic universe where the entire universe is reflected in each one of us. Within this grand context, our natural language is woefully inadequate to capture the ineffable truth of our reality. The best we can do is to more carefully explain with our words how our mind came to see things the way that we see them now. By more honestly portraying the functions of our mind, we can avoid making strong truth assertions about the world and avoid slipping into unproductive arguments with other people.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1<wbr>pIB1nViQ", "time": 1676432144, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34090578, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:35:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34087861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34087861</a><br>Hebrew - all of Nature is encoded in that language", "time": 1676432158, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34090645, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:43:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34087861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34087861</a><br>Arabic and Persian for Sufi mysticism", "time": 1676432588, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34092207, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:02:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bimp", "time": 1676448172, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34092433, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:48:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34090547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34090547</a><br>If i remember correctly it is a Babylonian map of tge region, crisscrossed by the rivers Tigris and Euphrates surrounded by constellations and arrows pointing to places further away", "time": 1676450911, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34092445, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)03:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34087861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34087861</a><br>Can knowing german be of use in the occult?", "time": 1676451136, "resto": 34087861}, {"no": 34092579, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)04:25:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34089335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34089335</a><br>Thanks.

The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (gimel, v. 17). Like many other psalms, this prayer includes dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81\u201388), joyous praise (e.g. verses 45\u201348) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g. verses 132\u201334).

A lot of weight is given in the process of derivation of the laws through logic, it&#039;s a mathematical approach to belief. All that said, I struggle to rectify years of biology, psychology, and ethics which in many ways come to similar conclusions about the nature of evil/sin (selfish gratification) and good/virtue (control of base impulses). Now that I am interested in restoring my faith, I find it difficult to not hear years of study of the sciences overshadow religious texts with the scientific reasoning. I am not saying that it is wrong to learn science - just that it makes this so much harder. We know that much of this wisdom was boiled down to simple terms and allegory to be interpreted for the masses in a communal setting through years of study. This is an aside but it&#039;s one reason why it makes me so angry that there are people who interpret the texts literally. These texts are supposed to be mulled over and meditated on over a lifetime.<br><br>I feel that the only way to overcome this struggle is to go even deeper in the religious texts and attempt to achieve wisdom through mysticism. That requires a lot of dedication. Psalm magic isn&#039;t a one and done, it&#039;s a process.

TCM is a fake tradition, made up by mao zedong and out of touch with it&#039;s real sources. <br>Meridians have basis in a real thing (the subtle body) but aren&#039;t going to clash against western occultism neccesarily.

Western occultism is largely broken lineages. the GD is a broken lineage. Western esoterica is a broken science. <br>2. Stephen skinner has spoken on this exact issue wrt western occultism. GD practitioners tend to not have siddhis because they don&#039;t meditate or do any actual energy work. Full stop. Magic is supposed to be secondary to/ as a vehicle for meditative absorption and energy. Can&#039;t get into samadhi? Your visualizations will do nothing for you. Can get into samadhi? Visualizations serve as a vehicle for the vital energy. External energy becomes internal. So on and so forth.

The problem is they have no idea how to meditate and they&#039;re only utilizing gross conceptual thought. They&#039;re tricking themselves into the idea that just conceptual THINKING is enough. <br>Visualization isn&#039;t a BAD thing. There&#039;s a reason that there&#039;s relatively uncorrupted neigong manuals out there with extensive visualization techniques. <br>The visualizations serve as a meditation subject and enhancer. They aren&#039;t supposed to be the end goal, because the actual experience may be far different than what you initially visualize. And as you pointed out, if you visualize something wrong- you can give yourself health complications. This is something even energy cultivators in schools using Cun Si will admit. <br>Is it needed? No. Can it be helpful? Yes. <br>If a daoist with no experience in meditation absorption and energy cultivation (whether being part of a system that avoids visualization or not) tries to use thunder magic, he will fail 85% of the time. He has no idea what he&#039;s doing.<br>If a daoist with experience in those uses thunder magic, he will succeed almost every time. The magic is a vehicle for his meditative absorption to manipulate not only his own vital qi but the energy of the world around him.

Lucifer himself cannot stop you from making mistakes. Sin is forbid not as to confine you to unreasonable laws, but because it leads one&#039;s life to destruction. If you sin there are consequences, not because God is punishing you, but because you punish yourself. This is why you must try your very best to overcome sin, which Christ will help you in doing. My point is that you&#039;re wondering why God did not help you, but the reason he did not help you is because you probably didn&#039;t heed to his commandments in the first place.

You have to realize that Lucifer and other fallen angels do not grant knowledge without a price, just as God himself asks for your obedience, so do beings of false light. Can I ask, have you ever really tried getting involved with Christ? I don&#039;t just mean simple prayers, but truly seeking and following his will through deep prayer, fasting, repenting, confession, and doing your best to cut out sins from your life? These things do not all come easily and at once, but instead you will naturally change with help of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>I challenge you, put your head to the floor, humble yourself before God, confess every sin you can think of, ask for the blessing of repentance and to be blessed with the Holy Spirit, talk to him with a humble heart and he will guide you. I pray you find the truth in Christ. Its been a long journey for me personally. I&#039;ve been down just about every spiritual path, and believed the roads were true.

In a lot of ways people who find Jesus essentially no longer wanted anything to do with what they perceived as hollow pleasures in their hearts or had an experience that made it impossible to deny Jesus. <br>Even people who still cling to &quot;something&quot; deep down want something more then fulfilling their vices and their journey is more a matter of letting go what is holding them back.<br><br>That said, I don&#039;t encourage you to just jump ship to Jesus just because.

In this oration, Ramsay called for a massive project of universal illumination, a joining together of the arts and sciences. He echoes earlier Rosicrucian aims, but there is a more rationalist quality to his work, and it is arguably the case that he served as predecessor for the later French philosophes and their Encyclop\u00e9die. But he also linked Freemasonry to the Knights Templar, to aristocracy, and to a kind of mystical chivalry that was very attractive, particularly to the upper class. Many para-Masonic orders thus were generated.<br>From Magic and Mysticism by Arthur Versluis, i did not know of this connection between Freemasonry and Christian theosophy but it&#039;s very interesting how Ramsay is through this also indirectly linked to the Strict Observance Templar group which was taken over by Willermoz and &#039;rebooted&#039; as the Rectified Scottish Rite", "time": 1676307267, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078024, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)11:59:47", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<a href=\"#p34077972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34077972</a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;34077994</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Versluis</span><br>Literally one of the only few good perennialists.", "time": 1676307587, "resto": 34074506, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 34078141, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:18:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078024</a><br>Personally i can&#039;t call him a perrenilaist, or anything actually lol<br>He practices Buddhism but mostly just talks and writes about Christianity, and when he does i have noticed that he tries to please as much people as possible, Traditionalists, Neognostics, Christians, (Neo)Pagans, etc...", "time": 1676308720, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078171, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:24:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078024</a><br><a href=\"#p34078141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078141</a><br>Oh also i watch him when he&#039;s on youtube sometimes and he mentioned that John Pordage&#039;s Metaphysica is getting translated, which is -huge- for all 7 people who care about that<br>I have the text in german (got it from some university site) but i can&#039;t be asked to read it all with ye olde calligraphy on every page, i&#039;ve also noticed skimming through it that he uses certain Kabbalistic terms like Adam Kadmon but i don&#039;t know if it comes from some sort of synthesis he achieved or if he is hust using those terms for theosophy without it being connected to Cabala", "time": 1676309069, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078410, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:55:06", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;a well respected (by me nonetheless) occult author is in my replies asking for [citation needed] on some Tantra information I consider to be extremely basic inside of traditions he holds interest in.</span><br>I literally hate it here.<br>We&#039;re fucking doomed.", "filename": "240386406_182856747162922_896644785360269017_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 643, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676310906252719, "time": 1676310906, "md5": "oMm0t+tQbwJuLLwmqnxCiw==", "fsize": 61713, "resto": 34074506, "trip": "!Th0tH..7io"}, {"no": 34078428, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)12:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>What is this &quot;here&quot; you speak of?", "time": 1676310990, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078480, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:03:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>There is only one acceptable response to people like him: bullying.", "filename": "1662399733987765", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 1284, "tn_w": 120, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676311387197733, "time": 1676311387, "md5": "SepROsUFH80lUdDIZzWW+Q==", "fsize": 148831, "resto": 34074506}, {"no": 34078497, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)13:05:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34078410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34078410</a><br>What author?<br>Also ape sama, I don&#039;t know why you seem surprised.

Even if you hate it you&#039;ll need the &quot;knowledge&quot; to hold conversations with normies. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep all of your real interests to yourself unless you are in a specific situation where you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that those interests are a welcome topic to discuss, and even then don&#039;t overindulge in the conversation unless you wanna kill the vibe by dominating it and making it fucking weird with your unusual (and to most people creepy) vibrational energy. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Develop proper hygiene, and get better attire so your outfits don&#039;t scream &quot;AUTISTIC&quot;. No creepy t-shirts or backpacks or anything of the sort. Just get some nice-fitting t-shirts that have cool designs (no anime or video games though) or have iconic brands or sports teams on them, some nice button down shirts, and a whole lot of well-fitting black and/or blue jeans with some nice high tops and converse. Work out, get cut, not too big though. And go to an actual hair stylist so they can get you a cut that optimizes your weird face. If you&#039;re bald then I&#039;m sorry, you&#039;ll be kinda creepy by default no matter what you do (unless you get a Turkish hair transplant)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Learn comedy. Seriously, comedy is a learned skill that anyone, and I mean anyone, can pick up. Watch standup specials, improv classes, read books on it, whatever and wherever the comedy lessons come from. Read psychology books too, maybe that one on propaganda from Edward Bernays. Practice that comedy and psychology, first with close friends and family, then move on. Not maliciously though. You&#039;ll learn to read expressions and body language from that and you&#039;ll be able to use logic to compensate for what you lack innately. A good sense of humor can go incredibly far, no matter how ugly and/or weird you are.</span>", "time": 1676417822, "resto": 34088659}, {"no": 34089005, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)18:39:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34088659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34088659</a><br>Autism is too broad.

But the quiet one is not very social, can&#039;t even have or hold any type of conversation and his lack of social interaction might make him act weirder or even develope dangerous thoughts or behaviors, that&#039;s why people say that a person who spends too much time alone sooner rather than later goes insane. I can go more in depth about this one and how to tackle it if you&#039;re that type of autist<br><br>t. autist who studied psychology to try to understand my own problem.

For a physicist, this isn&#039;t the end all be all, but for physics--which is a language, model, and system made using concepts such as time and space as its base-- the phrase &quot;new physics&quot; is common. Physics is itself a spatial term, so without a distinctive state of space and distinctive flow of time descriptively, how can events be said to ever occur?<br><br>Events don&#039;t have to have a form exactly. Some tendencies are to look for a source of an event. We find it, but for those who aren&#039;t looking directly at it, we have to describe it. But if it wasn&#039;t something we saw in a physical form, but saw as a structure of logic, there will always be a way to represent it in a form.<br>For an example to contemplate on: the expansion of space as a result of gravity. Consider it logically. Let&#039;s imagine we have four points arrayed as if in corners of a square. They aren&#039;t there, but we can see all four of them from there. Now these points can&#039;t be four points if merged. If we say they can not merge, and we also say they attract per gravity(and the gravity can not cause them to merge or else gravity has no parts to attract together), imagine a fabric forming under each point. The fabric expands and gets closer to merging so that the four points are able to obey every ridiculous rule placed upon. That&#039;s the thing with physics in the logical structure of reality: the universe, as if refusing to do otherwise, gives you a superposition every single time, self-resolves paradoxes.

Funny thing is most people who believe in karma don&#039;t even know what the concept entails. Karma is a Hindu concept that says that the beneficial or negative impacts of karma may not even happen until the next life, and that every good or bad thing that happens to anyone is a result of such karma. This means that people who have shit lives are/were more immoral in this life or a past life than evil people who lead great lives and never have a bad thing happen to them. It means that karma has bestowed evil people with success and riches while bestowing good people with suffering and destitution, and that every person in this system is getting what they deserve. Most modern retards who believe in karma also believe in star signs and horoscopes being deterministic of a person&#039;s behavior, they think karma is just &quot;if you do bad thing then bad thing will happen to you&quot; without stopping to consider that the most successful people in the world have built their lives on an endless stream of bad things that caused the suffering of others. I don&#039;t know which concept is worse, the idea that people will get what&#039;s coming to them even though the worst ones quite clearly never do, or the idea that we shouldn&#039;t worry about it because they&#039;ll get what&#039;s coming in the afterlife (ultimately the same concept of morality as Abrahamic religions).", "time": 1676400948, "resto": 34069588}, {"no": 34087013, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)14:02:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34069612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34069612</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Powerful</span><br>It depents...

what I saw they seem more like pressure cookers.

Me and most of my family is there too and we&#039;re being tormented and piloted like puppets. Yes they keep reviving those that are killed or had already died as long as their bodies aren&#039;t too decomp they would take the skin. They look kinda like short black skinny chimps with no hair and super uncanny. They&#039;re faces I don&#039;t remember too well but I think I kept seeing blue and white dots like pixel squares. Don&#039;t get on the ships they all keep you for something like torture buts it&#039;s different, they may treat your graciously and then burn you with hot iron and then be nice to you again. I don&#039;t believe any ayy lmao are good and I&#039;m not too sure what stops them, I was shown in my dreams they were stopped but by someone else than me and I had failed to keep myself and others safe.

So cute! She is around the same age as L. and she sees in her her idol and a teacher. She literally follows her everywhere and tries to mimic her gestures, movement, attitudes etc. Like a little monkey lol.. Chili is a reptilian human hybrid. A sister to L. of sorts. She absolutely adores L. and is almost like a little pet, no offense meant. She is not offended by the way, she doesn&#039;t care what anyone thinks of her, unlike most reptilians. Very openhearted and genuinely curious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s trying to learn how to human haha. She is very interested in us, and L. is her guide. She is also willing to show her reptilian ways, but she wasn&#039;t taught those. She was raised as a hybrid away from the more primal reptilian energies. There is a sweet innocence in her, and also a quest to find out who and what exactly she is. The reptilian part of her family is benevolent, and also hybrid (not related to Draco genetics), and their race&#039;s energies remind me a lot of the Yits (TReb is a reptilian hybrid from that race, channeled by Rob Gauthier). Only Chili is even more human than that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She is not big as most reptilians. Slender and limber, like a tiny lizard scurrying between the rocks. She is about 5 feet tall, perhaps a bit less at this age. But she loves to walk on all fours too, and loves to rock climb, and bask in the sun.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel she is very excited about actually coming to Earth physically in an open contact way. Some day. It&#039;s almost like a Little Mermaid wanting to have feet and live on the land. It is her greatest excitement. But of course she is not desperate about it, she knows about perfect timing and that all will be perfect as it already is.</span><br><br>...yeah so I guess you can shoot your shot now?", "time": 1676081984, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056008, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055973</a><br><a href=\"#p34055937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055937</a><br><a href=\"#p34055984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055984</a><br>I am going to rape an alien", "time": 1676082000, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056013, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>Hmm, to be honest I was hoping to meet an alien diplomat observer whichever.<br><br>One that is willing to dispense with the feel good ideas that humans psychologically require.<br><br>The common masses will always be too dangerous for the foreign nature of aliens, unless modified greatly.", "time": 1676082049, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056014, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>source", "time": 1676082061, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056015, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055988</a><br>It was the Scorpios asking them, and it wasn&#039;t &quot;asking&quot; as much as it was them being grabbed by the arms and escorted out", "time": 1676082062, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056018, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34055980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34055980</a><br>This is impressive stuff, which 4chan thread was this leaked in?", "time": 1676082083, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056022, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056000</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;divine quads</span><br>What other tidings do you bring uakkh2ms great sage?", "filename": "scientific laws", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1025, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 43, "tim": 1676082103908769, "time": 1676082103, "md5": "oKm3reSBhz0W5Zh3xIaMkA==", "fsize": 107431, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056030, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "do i get lyran dommy mommy gf?", "filename": "lyrian", "ext": ".png", "w": 941, "h": 801, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1676082220023476, "time": 1676082220, "md5": "rQ28E5n6BdgmH9DoWfZ85A==", "fsize": 903365, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056031, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056008</a><br>Thank you for proving my point.<br>What a useful idiot.<br>Enjoy the slave mines, if you aren&#039;t used as compost.", "time": 1676082224, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056032, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:23:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056014</a><br>its literally in every pic but: https://www.vashta.com/my-product/c<wbr>hili/<br><br>The guy is fucking great at what he does and you can see that he&#039;s still improving.", "time": 1676082226, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056042, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056007</a><br>Would share body heat with.", "time": 1676082397, "resto": 34055054}, {"no": 34056047, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34056031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34056031</a><br>You will never outsmart an alien.

Then I felt though the short grass for the ring, later that day I searched the area with a metal detector &amp; pinpointer, then I searched the yard in case it got knocked some distance when I grabbed her. I found nothing but an old nail and a bottle cap. <br><br>A year later she was playing in her playhouse and I remembered my ring. For shits and giggles I quietly said to the machine elves or whoever has my ring, that&#039;s over so you can give it back now. Then she wanted to play and go to the swing.

On top of that there are an additional FIFTY German U-boats that were still sailing the seas as late as 1950. These guys were still taking orders and sailing the sea 5 years after Germany officially surrender. Most of the early 50 boats were guys who willingly surrendered so they could return to the world rather than spend their lives underground or in the service.<br>2) There are an extreme number of Germans who to this day go missing in either Southern Argentina or Northern Canada. There&#039;s an interesting story of an RCMP officer in Canada in the 80&#039;s who was assigned to work missing persons cases in the Northern Yukon because he spoke.....German.

Spend some time actually thinking about the evidence we literally have access to, mostly the megalithic sites themselves and consider what we can derive from them. And look at them from an angle that most people overlook, how they resonate. How energy interacts with the materials that comprise them. How were they constructed? It isn&#039;t a coincidence that Stonehenge resonates in the Human Alpha brain wave range (8-12Hz) or that the pyramid of Khufru&#039;s inner chamber resonates at the upper range of our Beta waves (30Hz). Or that both Human Alpha and Beta waves resonate in the same range as the Earth&#039;s EM resonant field (7,14,21,28 Hz approximately). Archaeology is a science. But you know what else is science, science is a science. Physics. Try first understanding EM Physics (Maxwell&#039;s equations) and then applying some of this to these sites and you will see them in a new light.

The fact that you became comfortable being alone, means you can take your time with finding the right person. However, right now from what I see, it\u2019s a moment of chaos where you live, there\u2019s instability, so the dating scene is not very active. People are more worried about the economy and fear of a recession than finding a new partner.<br><br>From what I see you will benefit more from appealing to girls, it seems like a lesbian relationship will make you happier overall, mainly because you will be in better tune with each other, and because the gender roles will not get in the way as much compared to a heterosexual relationship.<br><br>Now in regards to being tomboyish, yes it can be appealing to both genders, however it seems to be more effective towards girls; lesbian girls seem to really want someone strong and supportive, but also dynamic and cool. So you can let that part of yourself freely; guys seem to find tomboys appealing too but to a lesser extent.", "filename": "67402081_1300460163438431_5976520921656066048_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 526, "h": 809, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676440000865454, "time": 1676440000, "md5": "DiVzxmzoIWPKfJNzpCEvZA==", "fsize": 103760, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091545, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:46:55", "name": "Missha w.", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091397</a><br>4 of cups - empress rx - the moon rx - queen of cups <br><br>Whatever love you\u2019ve kept for that person from your past will keep you awake, you\u2019ve lost so much of yourself to them and it\u2019s time to recognise what is it that you are missing.", "time": 1676440015, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091548, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:47:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091376</a><br>Where will I meet my next gf?<br>https://youtu.be/7R53Z9pjvKM", "time": 1676440036, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091549, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:47:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091167</a><br>Trade?", "time": 1676440039, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091563, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:48:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Air query<br>My husband did nothing for Valentine\u2019s Day<br>Does he even give a shit about me?", "time": 1676440136, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091577, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:50:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "AQ <br>This weekend, should I hang out w friends, attempt with girl A or invite out girl B?", "time": 1676440234, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091590, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:52:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091376</a><br>How does she feel about me?<br>https://youtu.be/I_QJwR6D9d4", "time": 1676440326, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091603, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091545</a><br>Thank you, I\u2019m trying to drop that person right now actually\u2026<br>Are you okay with a follow up if I give you another song?<br>https://youtu.be/eB6XZndD9Dw<br>Can you tell me if I\u2019ll meet someone else soon?", "time": 1676440383, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091610, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:54:09", "name": "NTA", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091098</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Queen of swords, queen of pentacles, fool, 7 of swords</span><br>Sunrider, is this a 4-card-spread?<br>Is this the 3rd-parties forecast or the querents?<br>Is the 3rd-party an idiot or the querent?<br>How do actually know for certain?", "time": 1676440449, "resto": 34089403}, {"no": 34091612, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)00:54:35", "name": "Missha w.", "com": "<a href=\"#p34091410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34091410</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not obscure but impeccable taste none the less </span><br><br>9 of swords rx- ten of swords - five of pentacles - the sun <br><br>It seems that you have a lot on your mind right now, possibly related to a past love or some feelings of guilt.

Meditation per se is not about overcoming emotion. There are many types of meditation for many different ideas, but the meditation practices that magical and esoteric practitioners utilize are derived in part from Tibetan (and more broadly Buddhist) awareness meditation. This type of meditation is not about overcoming emotion or &quot;accepting&quot; things, but about being aware of your emotion, surroundings, and reality. Mastering this awareness allows one into deeper states of understanding about the nature of all things.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vz<wbr>eYD2VY5o", "time": 1676369040, "resto": 34073924}, {"no": 34084361, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)05:27:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34073924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34073924</a><br>You spend your whole day reacting.<br><br>Some time spent not so caught up in it all cannot hurt you.

If anything can possess and damage a person it is an idea such as that. Notice also how his ideas are found almost nowhere else. He talks about meditation making people strange, but his opinion is incredibly farfetched, superstitious, and rare. Meditation is a common practice all over the world and has been noted for its benefits. I have a feeling that the only time meditation becomes harmful is when the person is susceptible to flights of fancy and strange thoughts already, and when, perhaps, they start to chase certain mystical states of mind, magic powers, or communing with voices.<br>As a practice of enhanced awareness and finding a layer of space between the awareness and the thoughts, the ego, the emotions, so that they can be seen for what they are without getting entangled in them and becoming convinced they are more than they are, meditation is a strong and healthy practice for a person.<br>As for his insistence on a person finding a master or joining a sect before they meditate, I think that is a convenient thing for him to say considering he spams his email address in all the comments to get people to make him their master, join his sect, and give him their money.", "time": 1676372133, "resto": 34073924}, {"no": 34084534, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)06:18:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34084290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34084290</a><br>You say it&#039;s not about accepting things, and maybe you have some understanding attached to that word that makes that statement true for you, but from my perspective it is fine to say that the practice is related to acceptance. In the video you posted notice at the end when he says &#039;thought okay, no thought okay; emotion okay, no emotion okay; key is awareness, focus is awareness, not the object&#039;. In other words, whatever is, is, and you don&#039;t struggle with it, don&#039;t chase it blindly. Also note that there is a therapy called ACT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which is basically a Westernised and medicalised version of mindfulness. The key word they led with is acceptance.<br><br>For me, to say you &#039;accept&#039; something, is to simply affirm that what is, is, that I am. It is to root the self in awareness, and not in thoughts or emotions or external events or the body. Your reality then becomes singular, because good and bad, happy and sad, this thought and that thought are both processed through the layer of &#039;it is&#039;. Dual concepts are processed through a singular awareness, and so you negate the bouncing back and forth between polarities such as right/wrong, happy/sad, do/don&#039;t etc.<br><br>If you were to interpret acceptance as meaning believing, I can understand objections. If you have a thought suddenly that says &quot;you are a worthless person&quot;, to accept that thought does not mean you affirm that its content is true or valid or reasonable. You do not enter into the world of the thought. You accept it as a thought, and nothing more or less. It is. You are aware it is a thought.
