I first became aware of my higher self two years ago; most likely it was triggered by the reunion with someone I haunted in a past life (now my ex). In the culmination of the incident where I devoured everything I deemed negative within him (after which he broke down as he realised how delusional he&#039;d been), it was as though leaving my vessel: my physical body lost consciousness, and I was an enormous chaotic black blob with hints of red, seeping into every crevice of his soul, swallowing his negative energy, upon which it was immediately made unrecognisable by the unrelenting cataclysm within me, simply becoming a part of it. I understood that this is my true form, and for some reason, it didn&#039;t really bother me, and I didn&#039;t stop to think about what it means until now.<br><br>Yesterday I confronted my higher self, or perhaps vice versa. I realised that the aforementioned blob is just the aura (almost completely opaque), and deep within it is what resembles a person. This person was frantic, and although he/she only screeched and snarled rather than speaking with words, I understood the cause of his/her dismay: &quot;Lilith is trying to take the pain away. I don&#039;t know how to stop her.&quot; That person, that is to say &quot;I&quot;, looked so utterly defeated over this, that I began to cry, knowing that even if I hugged myself, that would just be belittling.<br><br>How did it end up like this?

As such, I&#039;m dependent on his attention and frequent reminders of his appreciation for my mental stability.

As his popularity grew, it was understood that Anu and Marduk could utilize Jesus to strengthen Anu\u2019s hold on human culture, and reposition himself as a loving God\u2014the father of great entities like Jesus. Avatars were generally considered an annoyance by Anu. Usually they were killed or locked up to wither and die. Stories would be created to either cement them to Anu\u2019s glorification, or they would be vilified and deemed to be of Satan. There was no middle ground with Avatars.

Just thinking about it now fills me with nostalgia, the warm effervescent honey of cherished memories flowing through my veins and filling my brain with serotonin (I know about this because I had to go to the mental hospital and take antidepressants but more about that later).

To this day, I feel bad about it. I feel bad about video games, too, and I don\u2019t play them anymore. I wasn\u2019t always like that. As I said before, I played a lot of video games one summer when it was very hot, and also in the other seasons too. I nostalgically remember coming over after school to see &amp; hear the satisfying whine and flash as my old CRT TV came to life, so I could play my video games which people consider classic now.

I put on my Nike sneakers and swung my backpack on my shoulder (with just one strap, I tried to be cool even though I was not) and began walking down my block. There was a strange old neighbor who never left the house that children in the neighborhood would whisper frightening rumors about to each other when we had sleepovers. They said that some people\u2019s pets would go missing and you could hear animalistic howls coming from that house late at night, like an animal yelling in pain. They said that the mailman would deliver a package there in the same size box every two weeks, and that five mailmen had gone insane and quit just from standing on the porch. They said if you walked past at 3 AM the door would be wide open every night, but it was always shut other times. No one ever saw him because he never left the house, nobody knew what he ate but people thought it was the animals that went missing and the animalistic howls were him eating the animals. I never believed the rumors, I was precocious and I believed in science and reason, not ghost stories and fairy tales.

Remembering now, pretty much everything was rusty, unless it wasn\u2019t made of metal, in which case it was dusty (the rusty things were dusty too).

At one point I noticed an empty boot at the edge of the treeline (or brushline, I guess, it was mostly saplings). I walked up to investigate it. Something about the way the top part sagged unnerved me. I thought back to when I had seen a similar unexplained single shoe we found on a different adventure. Just after we&#039;d found that one we heard some weird animal noise that scared the shit out of us and forced us to run back to the car. When I shone my flashlight up from the boot, I noticed a path in the treeline where someone had clearly come and gone enough to punch a distinct hole in the brush. Before I could even evaluate it, the expensive flashlight I&#039;m oh-so proud of suddenly died. I couldn&#039;t turn it on for several seconds afterwards, even when I was sure the cap was on tight.

Hades is \u201cSheol\u201d in Hebrew. Adamites have an eternal spirit so when they die, their bodies decay but their spirits abide in Hades/Sheol awaiting Christ\u2019s second coming. Peter explained that Hades is where Christ visited the \u201cspirits in prison\u201d during the three days between His death and resurrection when He preached the gospel \u201calso to them that are dead.\u201d<br>Here we see that an Adamite can turn to Christ after death, which is entirely opposite to the teachings of most modern churches. Christ states in Revelation that He will \u201cdestroy Hades and Death,\u201d and all Adamite spirits will be released and return to Him in heaven. There will no longer be death for Adamites. It\u2019s as simple and cut and dry as that.<br>There is no \u201chell.\u201d<br><br>So where do the other two terms fit into this? Gehenna is a compound Hebrew word. It refers to the \u201cvalley of Hinnom,\u201d the wicked place where in Jeremiah\u2019s time the Israelites sacrificed their children as burnt offerings to Baal.<br>When Christ used the word Gehenna, He was referring allegorically to the fiery trials in this life. This includes the chastisement Yahweh visits on the Israelites when they stray. As in the literal Gehenna, one\u2019s body may be allegorically burned during these fiery trials.<br>One\u2019s body may be punished or even destroyed in this life. However, the eternal Adamic soul will be saved.

Their fate is then outlined: \u201cThese [goat nations] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous [sheep nations] into eternal life.\u201d Here \u201ceternal punishment\u201d should be translated as \u201clake of fire.\u201d This means they cease to exist completely and forever.<br><br>Churches teach that you could spend eternity in hell if you don\u2019t obey your priest and attend church. These teachings do not follow scripture because scripture clearly states that your origin determines your destiny.<br>Christ has saved His Adamic creation, so Adamites will be restored and judged for the life they led. Since Adamites have eternal life, Yahweh has good reason for punishing and chastising them in this life. He is correcting them and making them better.<br>But since all non-Adamites will be tossed into the lake of fire and destroyed utterly, they are never corrected and punished for their actions in this life.<br>Mistranslating \u201chell\u201d misleads and obscures this truth.

Only instead of a board with rocks. They had a board with names of god, and they were trying to obtain kernels of truth. This kind of divination was forbidden in the old testament. &quot;Thou shall not use God&#039;s name in vain&quot;.<br>Like saying &quot;If I&#039;m lying, may God strike me dead.&quot; *not dead, so I must be telling the truth*.

Then God will pick a messiah to separate &quot;his chosen people&quot; from the masses. <br>The usual rhetoric is &quot;they forgot who they were&quot; suggesting they were always &quot;chosen&quot;, and not just random people that a cult successfully recruited. <br><br>So in the New Testament. The jews were living under the Romans. They were not assimilating. In one sense, they didn&#039;t need to be separated. They wanted to print their own money. Stamp their own gold bullion. Live by their own standard. But in another sense, that&#039;s the kind of idol worship that always fucks them over. Again, the missing context here that most people today are missing was how the temples supported the economy.<br>Plus, outside of bible stories, when have the jews &quot;needed&quot; to be distinguished? Right? They&#039;re usually driven out because they refused to assimilate, or accused of subversive conspiracies. <br><br>The promise - the point - of God&#039;s covenant was to do away with that system centered on a geographical locations. Jesus in the New Testament, would talk to people (See: Woman at the Well) how some day people would be free to worship anywhere. They wouldn&#039;t suffer in some pyramid scheme. A kind of globalization - but again, there was no separation of church and state back then. Inheriting the Earth. More context to keep in mind. <br>Not long after Jesus died, the Romans destroyed THE temple. The religious bureaucracy, for a lack of a better term, had essentially tied it&#039;s own hands. They couldn&#039;t rebuild without a command of god, not to mention other ceremonial observations for ritual cleanliness that would make it a challenging task.

Now there&#039;s this part that say that the spilling of the seed is not permitted. Why is it not? You see, there was this guy called Onan who was in a levirate marriage and it allowed him to have sex with his deceased brother&#039;s wife until she got pregnant. But every single time he pulled out just so that he could always fuck someone if were he to become horny. Also, he pulled out for another reason. So that he would not have to give what he inverited from his deceased brother to the child. This way he could have two things: sex with a woman who didn&#039;t even like him whenever he wanted and a lot of fortune that he otherwise he would have needed to share with a child and its mother.<br><br>Onan&#039;s sin was that he pulled out so that according to the law a woman would need to become his bitch and he would inherit a lot of money, which this way he did. That&#039;s why the spilling of seed is forbidden. On another note, even Maimonides allowes one to relief their sexual desires, but masturbating without being horny first is a sin. So being a coomer and looking at porn is a sin, but jerking off just because one can&#039;t think about anything else but sex is okay.

I believe that Judaism as a religion is cool as fuck but most Jews belong to Rabbinical Judaism which I do hate a lot. Most of the rabbis and baal shem tovs (healers and such) would stab their community in the back if given enough in exchange for that. There was this guy who was a baal shem ra (master of the bad name). It was believed that a bad spirit got attached to him and he tried to exorcise it, but the spirit told him that, &quot;rabbi, there&#039;s no need to be afraid of me, truth comes through my wicked hands&quot;. and things like that. This guy, the baal shem ra, believed the same, that most rabbis and most baal shem tovs are frauds and if given enough money, they would harm the people who follow them.<br>I also tend to dislike the ultra-orthodox because they are quite the opposite of what a Jew should do in this life. They tend to think lowly of non-Jews and shit on converts. I mean, Moses was a convert too and so was the most known rabbi, Akiva and so was Onkelos, whose Targum (Torah translated into another language) is still studied today. So yeah, I tend to dislike those who follow their rabbis blindly and do hate those rabbis who only bring their followers down rather than lifting them up, but think of Non-rabbinical Judaism as a cool thing. Not that I don&#039;t study the writings of rabbis, but don&#039;t follow them blindly.<br><br>Cont.", "time": 1670970257, "resto": 33596720}, {"no": 33600693, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:25:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33600687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33600687</a><br>There were two monks washing their cloths in a river.

I have extensive backcountry exposure, even did a stint as a big game guide in a remote backcountry camp. On this day we enjoyed the fishing and settled in for the night.<br><br>I pulled out my pan and stoked up a nice fire. It was clear and cool as the sun faded into the western slopes. We cooked up some fresh rainbows with garlic and butter and filled our stomachs. I leaned back against the cooler after pulling out a refreshing beverage. The boy was soon asleep by the fire as it had been a busy day. I sipped my beer and watched the moon light bouncing off the little waves in the lake. There was still a light glow on the western horizon where the sun had gone down and I could see the outline of the mountain peaks towering over the little lake. I slowly faded off to sleep with the sound of the lake waves gently lapping on the rocks.<br><br>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, the lantern was out too. The moon was gone and it was pitch black. Something was wrong. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. I was paralyzed. I could hear my heart thumping as I strained to hear something in the bush, all was quiet. I had a horrible uneasy feeling. I gathered myself together and started kicking around the fire, a small flame came alive and I quickly threw on some wood. In the firelight I could see that the boy had awoke and was shocked to see his wide open eyes staring at me. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing, go climb in the tent.&quot; I lied. He crawled into the tent but even in the light of fire I couldn&#039;t shake my wariness.

I finally instructed the boy to wake up and go get in the truck. I packed up all of camp and drove around to the other side of the lake and slept with him in the truck. At dawn I got up and looked across the lake where we were camped earlier, and another uneasy feeling came over me. I decided it was time to go home.

It&#039;s honestly true. Any of us at ANY TIME can reach out and pray to Him, in all our authentic flaws will be evident to Him. Our genuine call will be heard and He will know your intent beyond all awareness. He is always patiently waiting. I&#039;ve known this but often doubted it... so much of this world has caused me to question the truth of God&#039;s love and power, of his glorious grace and forgiveness. Christ is as harsh as He is benevolent I&#039;ve learned... surrendering unto Him opens the pathway to a connection that will ignite all the lies in a blaze, like an unveiling, and truths will start to wash over you. It&#039;s amazing that all these years He was beside me always willing to guide me, offering me the lessons I needed... He is near us all. It just takes that one time to surrender it all... all that you think you are, all which you thought you knew. Like removing all attachments, all data, all identity, all power and asking Him &quot;please Lord of Lords, help me understand.. help me to know you. I want to forever be with you my God, help guide me.&quot; And if you are genuine and have faith, it will manifest. You will feel His presence, it will be with you constantly. Without the presence of man&#039;s influences, without all the data and rituals and dogmas... He will give you answers. And you WILL notice the world and people around you will challenge it. Satan and many doubts. Tricks and lies and ego will challenge. Your own mind will challenge the skeptic your own faith. <br><br>Be strong. The forging will be grown by Christ, God needed your willful choice to love and seek Him, then He will be with you, fill the hollowness of your soul. Nothing in the world can take that away from the children of God. So be humbled and honor it.

Between the fire of the blood in our hearts against the ice of cold reason. The World Ice Theory speaks to those humans to whom the christian guilt idea aswell the idea of pure expedience is alien. This breed of men opposes nature with strenght, never avoids it neither through the forced shame of asceticism and humility nor through soley sensual gratifications of the moment. It posesses all the superiority of the nordic character. It looks with fresh, lively and couragous eyes into the heart forbidding experiences of a dramatic nature. Hidden behind this taciturn and unbending features there is a secret existence of true human. A wonderful toughness of healthy life resistance. A true kindness and always faithful comradeship of strong-willed men. They are polar people who feel comfortable under the ancient nordic law of fate. Bold, not tired. Intact, never chatty. Resoloute and wise. Self-assuard and audacious characters who are facing the dangers and tests of sacrifice. Upright, insurred dramatic beings who&#039;s heart is adventourus and steel.

Weirdest shit ever considering I had to write it down afterwards to make sense of it all. I live in the mountains and am surrounded by protected forests. The logging companies bought some of the trees and have been deforesting an area full of rotten wood. I don&#039;t have neighbors but live in a bungalow style place so they&#039;re like house mates and everyone is different ages. The older couple are up in their 60s and he&#039;s a career military man with stories that would shake /x/ and /pol/ I live on the opposite side with my wife and the &quot;straight edge&quot; lives in between us. He&#039;s a douchebag that gets drunk and tries to fight constantly. He wasn&#039;t here when it happened though that bungalow was empty. The military guy doesn&#039;t have family in the area and asks me if I want to go get a Christmas tree with him. I was waiting for him and pushed on a tree branch to see how frozen they were and fell head first into the snow well and felt the snow bury my legs. I started by calmly getting my composure and using an old stuntman trick and waited a minute to see if I broke anything. I had one arm under me buried and was getting it free when I felt dread and started yelling for help. I took a deep breath and smelled strong piss and figured it was a coyote pissing tree and needed to GTFO. I hugged the tree and pushed myself up enough to get one leg above the snow so it had a new air source. That&#039;s when I felt a hand or maybe two wrap around my leg like you would hold binoculars so much strength was in the grip I bruised that day from. After I got smashed in the face with snow and wiped it out. I noticed half the tree snow was gone as it fell on me and around me. The snow that smashed me in the face was from 4 feet above that and you could see a swipe in the snow like fingers dragged across it. I was red faced and he came out and asked me what was going on because I was covered in sap and smelled like strong urine.

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here.

After leaving the hospital I just had the idea I was a shaman and told my mother things about her mother that she never told me. I went to a spiritual store and the clerk basically agreed based on what I told him. I bought a book about Shamanism and saw parallels with them and I. I was also diagnosed with Schizoaffective at the hospital as my parents have a history of Bipolar Disorder. <br><br>I guess school performance would also indicate me being highly intuitive and such. I would always score incredibly highly on tests without thinking much about them. For instance, my science teacher in high school was surprised I got the second highest score in the school on a test as I slept in every class I could and just didn&#039;t pay much attention to coursework. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This fear comes from your ego.

I was playing at my grandparents house, about to run into the back yard, when I got caught in a spider web. A huge spider started to approach me, and I called out to my grandparents who were sitting in the yard close by. There was some feeling of distance from them, like a veil or water between us, they couldn&#039;t hear me and they couldn&#039;t help. As I grew older I associated that spider with the abusive aspects of that side of the family, how mean my grandpa especially could be, how that spilled off on my Mom and later my siblings, getting caught in those cycles of being vicious to the people you&#039;re supposed to love the most. But this makes me reconsider the symbology, especially since I&#039;ve been able to let a lot of that shit go into adulthood and how I&#039;ve dodged those shitty attitudes a little better than some other people in my family. Maybe something scary was keeping me from fully integrating into something worse.<br><br>I ended up living in that house for a while after college.

I don&#039;t care if this steps on any toes, it&#039;s a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn&#039;t Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a &quot;front&quot; for their activities.&quot; Svali <br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/welcome/child-page/<br><br>\u201c...and as you join Freemasonry, initially they&#039;ll tell you that their G, the G in the square and compass, means God. But then as you go up through the levels, they&#039;ll tell you, &#039;Oh, this stands for Gnosis, knowledge.&#039; But then when you get higher up it stands for the Generative principle, which means, buggering little boys. And I&#039;m not saying that on my own authority. I spoke with the highest ranking Freemason to defect to Christianity, Jim Shaw, he was a 33rd degree Freemason, and I had a number of conversations over the phone with him about Freemasonry.

I&#039;m saying positive affirmations a lot, am doing yoga, eating well, and generally have a more empowered feeling. This has been reflected in my dreams! I have more awareness in general, and more control once I become lucid. <br>The other night set the bar higher for me. I woke up about half an hour before my alarm, and decided to have a good dream for the remaining time. I lay in bed thinking about all the people I&#039;m thankful to have in my life, and then proceeded to dream for what felt like an entire day, about going to a &quot;waterpark&quot; with my fianc\u00e9e. It was sort of like the poolrooms, only outside, in the sun. Occasionally, I would get the typical worries I get while on vacation - is the dog being taken care of well, etc. But then I would remind myself it was just a dream. Literally the best dream I&#039;ve ever had. <br>I&#039;ve changed my tactic basically. Rather than becoming lucid and trying to teleport to where I want to be, I set positive intentions while awake and then go lucid in whatever place I end up. Guides in this general have helped a lot! <br>Last night I was exploring with some old classmates and current coworkers. One said something about the &quot;other kids&quot; getting candy. So I decided to find it, and voila, found the stairs leading up to the &quot;candy room&quot;. I ate sour patch kids and M&amp;Ms. The colors were so vivid and the sugar rush felt real.

I&#039;ll provide some context first.<br><br>A few months before that occurrence, I put together a ritual to &quot;turn my soul female&quot; (whatever that means, considering I had noticed my etheric body already was as such?), and performed it daily for a month.

(On that note, seeing how many here have a &quot;futa succubus&quot; really puts into perspective what a normal mindset that is.) But the novelty quickly wore off, and while touching it in an enjoyable manner was no longer an issue for me, soon the feeling that the shape is wrong, inescapable as I felt it constantly, physically in my body even if I tried my best to ignore it, became almost unbearable again.<br><br>I realised that even if I try to relieve it spiritually or mentally, in the end that dysphoria stems from a biological, neurological disorder, so non-physical changes could never be more than a coping mechanism. What I felt after I woke up from the surgery, merely feeling the nerves in the right shape before I even saw anything, made me unable to misunderstand that anymore.

For example, it&#039;s not like changing a person&#039;s physical body against their will would suddenly change their gender accordingly. Same with the subtle body, of which the gender can be changed as easily as shapeshifting; even my older brother who basks in his own manliness has done so before just out of curiosity, although he didn&#039;t like it.

It&#039;s not the body, not sexuality, not stereotypes. It seems both intangible and invisible. Normally I&#039;d conclude then that it doesn&#039;t exist, but I&#039;m reminded of the ritual Lilith performed. At the time, She pointed out that I had overlooked something with the ritual I did earlier that year, and offered to fix it.

Grey pupils. <br><br>She smiled at me and then grabbed her tit and moaned. I couldn&#039;t move in the beginning but managed to put my arms on her hips almost against my will. At that point I woke up. <br><br>Wasn&#039;t even close to cumming but I gasped once and then just snapped back into consciousness. When I woke up I was alone on the mattress. It was about 4:30 now.

It&#039;s much like other fungal damage, even some of the same inflammation markers are present. <br><br>This organ goes from initially programming how immune cells are set up, to training them for being in the field, and culling cells that are either too reactive or not reactive enough. Homeostasis coming up again. The thymus is also the place that certain peptides are made, like BPC-157 and thymosin-b4. Thymosin is very important for differentiating stem cells to t-cells, also for developing naive t-cells to mature t-cells. It usually tapers off usefulness by puberty and becomes less effective until (due to epithelial damage) it is basically just fatty tissue by age 70 or so. It&#039;s a process referred to as involution and it&#039;s never been well explained. <br><br>My suspicion, due to some really odd reports from long term protocolers, is that certain immune cells are very high in count and correct differentiation to mature states. But since there&#039;s no cancer or infection present on tests it looks like the cells are just in ready state. This could be explained by thymus being repaired from lack of inflammation. Fungal infection damage due to SARS-CoV-2 after effects could also tie in here as the reason we&#039;re seeing so many problems with naive t-cells in current post-covid syndrome reports. <br><br>To get to the point here, I think the thymus can behave in adulthood like in childhood as long as you turn the inflammation down.

Indeed, NaMN can be obtained following the transfer of the phosphoribose moiety of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate to NA by the nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, Npt1. Then, NaMN is adenylylated by nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenyltransferases (Nma1/Nma2) producing nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, NaAD is amidated by the glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase Qns1, generating NAD+</span><br><br>As you can see above it goes through a few conversions before hitting the pool. NMN is the most direct precursor to NAD+ but is significantly more expensive versus Nicotinic Acid. <br><br>A big part of why the nac protocol is run prior to maintenance is to clear out most of the fungal overgrowth first. Fungi can also use NA as beneficial so adding it too soon can have the opposite effect.
