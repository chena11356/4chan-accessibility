Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism. It was a popular belief system in ancient India.<br><br>One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.<br><br>In 8th century CE Jaina literature, Saddarsanasamuccaya by Haribhadra, Lokayata is stated to be the Hindu school where there is &quot;no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.&quot;<br><br>Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.<br><br>Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena.

If a scientist is an atheist but he&#039;s in charge of authoring a science book then his bullshit atheistic beliefs become all of our reality and that&#039;s pretty much what has happened to science. It&#039;s not based on fact, it&#039;s based on the individual belief systems of the gatekeepers in science. If a scientist is christian, their scientific views are gonna mostly align with Christianity, not facts. Most of us here are actually smarter than your typical scientist because we are more open to shit they refuse to be open to because their so worried about their non-existant dumbass reputations (money). I don&#039;t understand why people base everything off of what science says or some book, what about what you&#039;re heart says? Did you forget about that? Science will never understand the true nature of reality until it merges with spirit, and we&#039;re a Loooonggg way from that. Our science is like a hundred years behind. So in other words, science has about 200 years before I even start looking at it, paying attention to it or taking it seriously. It&#039;s so far behind that it&#039;s not even relevant to us right now so fuck what science says.

But most of them won&#039;t even talk about those things because they&#039;ve been told not to or their afraid of what some other christian scientist is going to think of them.

Richard Tomlinson told me quite extensively about his dream of an &#039;ideal all-male society&#039;. However, his Master was Prince Philip and the Royal Family, so one can say that this particular &#039;dream&#039; originated in this sickest of all families. The incredibly sick and hetero-hostile Sat B&#039;hai Illuminati cult and the Royal Family have already started to create prototypes within the current UK population. Tomlinson was of the opinion that eventually the Illuminati cult would create a society of men who had wombs, to run their ideal &#039;Lord of the Flies&#039; warrior cult society of the Templars. Women would have already been eliminated. They didn&#039;t have the technology to actually create female human eggs from scratch (they had tried but failed), but could easily clone the large banks of female eggs at their disposal - therefore, this wasn&#039;t a problem. They now had enough eggs and enough technology to keep on cloning these eggs, to be then transplanted to the male womb. For some reason, the Illuminati scientists had found that it was far better for the child to grow in a manufactured male womb than from a test-tube basis, and they had managed to genetically engineer men with these wombs but not vaginas...hence the need for Caesarians. What is worse, is that Tomlinson then admitted that his own erstwhile son - Orlando Bloom - actually has one of these wombs - one of the earliest prototypes that was successful - whether the guy knows it &#039;consciously&#039; or not - I am sure that this is true. Tomlinson was matter-of-fact about it all - only a matter of time before they would take over.

Most of us have been reincarnating on this planet all the way back since the caveman days and will keep doing so until the planet ends or we decide to stop or don&#039;t need to. You don&#039;t flip flop between being male or female or you&#039;d be too mixed up an confused sexually during each life an it would take you longer to find an develop your sexuality. You&#039;ll typically start out as one sex an have a dozen or more lifetimes as that sex, then you&#039;ll have a few where you are bi or gay as the new sex because your still having bleedthrus from being the sex where you were before and you&#039;ll eventually settle into the new sex and have a dozen or so lives as a straight person in that sex until your reincarnation cycle is over and you can start reincarnating on another planet. You can flip flop but most of us don&#039;t. If a person is a gay man, it&#039;s 9 times out of 10 because they were a female in their most recent past lives and they still resonate with that sex or vice versa. If a girl looks masculine, she&#039;s a tomboy, she might not even be gay but she&#039;s just tough like a guy, it&#039;s 9 times out of 10 because she actually was a tough guy in her past life. I can tell what people were in their past life just by looking at how they carry themselves an what they wear an how they talk. Like the weird girl always wearing the pirate hat talking bout sum &quot;Arrrrgghh&quot; all the time an likes pirates, that&#039;s because she actually was a real pirate in her past life back in the 1800&#039;s. You can actually develop an eye for it if you train yourself to. Sexuality is way deeper than people think it is.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Dont step/lean on markers. If you see knocked over offerings, try and pick it up and place it upright, whenever not too much of an inconvenience. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. it should go without saying, dont take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br><br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, dont take photos of them intentionally. If someone approaches put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after theyre gone. <br><br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br><br>Some reccomendations:<br><br>1) Boots. It gets muddy in some areas. Dont wear anything youre not ready to get soiled.<br><br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots and selfies. <br><br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration.<br><br>4) Get these as soon as it opens.

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect. They aren&#039;t willing to let go completely.", "time": 1671425470, "resto": 33613980}, {"no": 33638745, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33638685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33638685</a><br>Very well put. I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

There is no yin an yang, there is only yin, good. The bad or negative is simply a teaching tool that teaches you what good is. You learn love by experiencing evil, hate, suffering, negativity, and all the low vibratory emotions. So you have to say &quot;I am an eternal soul from a loving God here on a dual planet, I know the opposite of love doesn&#039;t really exist, it just feels like it does and I am experiencing the illusion of it or the illusion that I am separate from God to learn the fact that I&#039;m Not Separate from God&quot;. I am not a Male and Not a Female. I am an eternal soul, a light being, a wisp of love energy experiencing being human. And experiencing being human means experiencing duality, the opposite of love, hate, crime, evil, anger, violence, murder, rape and so on. All those things only exist where there duality exists, but the key is, Duality doesn&#039;t really exists, only love exists. Your ego dies when you realize this because once you realize this there really isn&#039;t a reason to have an ego because you realize the things you thought you had it for are all illusions or projections, they aren&#039;t really there. You realize you&#039;re living in a giant fishbowl being watched 24/7. It&#039;s a bit hard to explain but yeah, it&#039;s realizing that primal instinct is only necessary because of the things you don&#039;t know or the technology you don&#039;t yet have. You realize that primal instinct and ego can all be replaced by technology and knowledge. You learn to work smarter not harder, if you knew better you&#039;d do better. Ego death is like a life hack but only if you understand what it truly is and not what people try to say is.

Ego-Death is a long, long process that takes years to achieve if not decades. So live your life as you must until you are ready. <br><br>Start with stoicism, all you need is the book meditations by Marcus Aurelius, the philosophy of &quot;It is what it is&quot; and learn to say &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot; and mean it. Once you are stoic enough (again, this takes years) you can advance further if you still want your full ego death. <br>At this stage, you can give up on the small things like hygiene and appearance unless they make you uncomfortable, give in to comfort again after your stoic journey and live to fulfill your base human urges besides that of boredom (although stoicism should help you handle being bored a little, meditation is absolutely a must as well) as entertainment feeds the ego. Also begin to empty your life from everything material that isn&#039;t a necessity. <br><br>Now you will live an empty life with barely anything but what is needed.<br>You should be at the level that you will not even move if a bus came speeding at you at 100 miles per hour because you now don&#039;t exist as a human but as a creature with no center, no thoughts away from his natural state and when you are ready, you must lose your home, sell it, donate it, pass it down or just leave. Whatever you want, just get it gone and keep nothing in return for it.<br>You will own nothing as the concept of ownership is a remnant of the ego of man in his search for safety and security.<br><br>Now you are a bum, homeless, living wherever you want, taking only what you need as a drone of what once was humanity who is at peace with his life being seen as bad within greater humanity.<br>Most men who achieve this end up comitting self-immolation as they feel nothing and fear nothing and use their peace to aid humanity further (see the many acts of protest by monks over the years) They were ready and so will you be if you want, the only other option is to live until dead", "time": 1671447103, "resto": 33631737}, {"no": 33640493, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:02:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33640253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33640253</a><br>Stoicism is just the Sigma grindset.", "time": 1671451327, "resto": 33631737}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33639328, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)01:33:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Christianity was the last Great Meme, but people decided to move on.

Each one of them prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, so greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea.<br>(ll. 19-21) Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!

I came across S0/Ben a few years after his flare-earthquake model came out. I keep checking the papers as he covers them and his conclusions do seem sound to me. I also got my hands on a copy of White&#039;s &quot;World in Peril&quot; - it&#039;s a good read. Ultimately I think Ben&#039;s conclusions about the 12,000 year cycle are spot on, and the whole concept answered a lot of questions I had as a kid and in grad school (biology).<br><br>I also agree that everything going on geopolitically is easily explained by what is going to happen. To me it seems the current NATO/Russia conflict was engineered in order to eliminate a potential threat, as most of Russia&#039;s heartland should be relatively safe come the event, and Russia itself will be geographically located such that the amount of usable land will increase by orders of magnitude. The Russians also know, and probably suspect this, providing interesting context for the Russian claims that this is a war of survival. My suspicion is that the goal is to provoke a nuclear conflict as close to lights out as possible. It also explains the continued expansion of the underground network in China.<br><br>I am doing what I can to get ready. Unfortunately I live in Alaska. Post grid-down will be about as hard as it gets up here. I will be relatively sheltered from the tsunamis, but if it hits in the summer we&#039;ll be sun-facing, and the seismic element is also troubling.

The flows of this metal in and out of the core, and around it (through convective processes), generates a magnetic field.<br><br>(2) The Coriolis effect and the combined magnetic and electrical generation of these processes keep the movement (very) roughly circular around the axis of rotation. If it was driven solely by convection and the Coriolis effect it would remain very stable for a long time, but the effect of powerful local magnetic fields and electric currents is able to disrupt this circular flow. If this flow is disrupted in one place, it is likely to disrupt in other places, leading to a complete destabilization of flow around the core-mantle boundary. Thus, the field collapses (no more circular flow). However, convection means the process starts up again, possibly in a different direction, possibly in the same direction.<br>(3) There&#039;s plenty of geological evidence to show that pole reversals can occur very quickly, and that on average they take 100-150 years to complete.

We are currently passing through the galactic midplane (an electromagnetic plane created by the supermassive star/black hole cluster at the center of the galaxy) which carries a substantial load of interstellar dust. This dust is not conjecture, it is here, and astronomists have been reporting it for about a year now. <br><br>The sun is essentially a large nuclear fire. What happens what you throw a bunch of very cold, flammable dust on a fire? I&#039;ve had bonfires at -40, and I&#039;ll tell you: first the fire dampens, then the fire gets much bigger than before and very quickly. The same would occur if you were to bombard the sun with a high amount of cosmic dust - the outer shell would cool, the sun would dim, and then the built up energy in the interior would catch up, the shell would warm up enough, and a &quot;small&quot; explosion would occur in which the outer shell of the sun is cast off. <br><br>There are two things to note here:<br>First, we have observed that the two nearest stellar neighbors to pass through the midplane ahead of us flared. They didn&#039;t flare bright enough to call it a super nova, but they flared too much to write it off as a random event or error. They flared in sequence, relative to the time they entered the galactic midplane.<br><br>Second: If the outer shell of the sun were to cool, the sun would dim. It may dim so much that the sun itself would turn dark red, possibly even black, dark enough that you could look directly at the sun. Instead of the normal luminescent star you would see a dark circle halo&#039;d by the dust particles and field interaction lines created by the powerful electromagnetic interactions of the sun.<br><br>In short, the Black Sun is most likely an ancient symbol from the last time this happened.", "time": 1671137327, "resto": 33596953}, {"no": 33614441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33614388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33614388</a><br>Nahhhh.

There is not much error in when this happens - we&#039;re doing it right now.<br><br>As for the crustal displacement theory: the crust is essentially held in place on the mantle by a combination of friction with the partially solid upper mantle and weak electric forces. Solar energy input through the solar-terrestrial magnetic electric circuit can heat up the upper mantle and disrupt these forces, causing the crust to locally displace (pretty much every earthquake over 6.0 is associated with space weather energy inputs). A large enough solar energy input (from a micronova, perhaps) theoretically can liquefy the entire upper mantle and cause the entire crust to detach. Then what happens?

We live in an Apollonian age of numbers, results, capital, etc. and it is killing the side of ourselves that believes in anything - this naturally leads to nihilism and bleakness. The same nihilism and bleakness that presides over the entirety of our culture today. This is why you don&#039;t see any great works of art anymore. <br><br>A Santa Denier is the man who deems himself intellectual for believing in the &quot;science&quot;; yet, has this man done his own research? He believes in molecules, yet has he seen them for himself under a microscope? I say, &quot;NO&quot;. He was merely told this was the case from some book, or from some teacher. So, here, we see, this intellectual man is just as vulnerable to belief systems as anyone else. <br><br>William James backs me up in his essay, &quot;The Will to Believe&quot;: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yet if any one should thereupon assume that intellectual insight is what remains after wish and will and sentimental preference have taken wing, or that pure reason is what then settles our opinions, he would fly quite as directly in the teeth of the facts.&quot; </span><br><br>Santa IS real, because we believe him to be; it is as simple as that.

Are any people here into philosophy besides the weird schizoconspiracy shit? I had some mystical insights reading philosophy myself.<br><br>At the start of philosophy was Plato, who believed in two realsm. There is the everyday realm, of bodies and objects which whither away, and then there is the timeless realm of the Ideas, which the trained philosopher can percieve with his mind&#039;s eye; one can compare this to a third eye of some sorts.<br><br>Deleuze believed philosophers created concepts out of the plane of immanence; a sort of undivided &quot;field&quot; of energies, forces, flows, without humans, without subjects, without consciousness. Life, death, and all dualities and dialectical relationships are non-existent on this plane.<br><br>Then Schopenhauer. He literally believed that the reality of individual objects in time and space; what he called &quot;the world as representation&quot;; is an illusion; all that exists is the fundamental unity of the Will. You are Will, I am Will, there are no humans, there aren&#039;t even beings. This is simply the veil of the Will covering your eyes.<br><br>Then Derrida, who believed that language is a completely empty system; that the idea of another person having written this message is an illusion stemming from a belief in &quot;logocentrism&quot;.<br><br>Berkeley thought all of reality is subjective idas; the only thing binding it together is the universal observer: God.<br><br>So, anyone into philosophy?

Say you walk into a busy mall, the way you dress, the way you look, the way your hair is, skin is, the colors you are wearing, the energy around the brands you are wearing, the way you are wearing your clothes, the way you appear, the way you walk, talk, sound, look, and feel, can completely heal someone and raise their vibration and you also have the power to do the opposite. Say your in that busy mall and it seems like no one notices you but some older lady 50ft away sees you and zones in on you. The way you appear, your appearance, and the way you carry yourself can heal or hurt her drastically or anyone who really zones in on you and notices you and picks up on your energy. Others might not even see you. You ever hear people talk about &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; or &quot;when I walked in the whole room got quiet&quot; or &quot;that guy was breaking his neck to loom at me&quot; or girls who brag about stopping traffic because of their looks. We all have an energy signature and put out a different vibration which has the power to heal others that we don&#039;t even know, just by seeing them or even hearing them and you can energetically send love from your heart chakra to anyone you see or anyone you can think of dead or alive and they will feel it. Say your walking in that mall and see two guys arguing, you could send love to them energetically and they would both just stop, look at each other strangely and probably not even know why they just spontaneously stopped arguing.

It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off.

As souls on the other side, when it&#039;s time for us to come back to earth and have another earth life we spend so much time prepping and preparing and arranging and working out the logistics. You even go into a veil simulator where you practice losing your memory and practice the veil coming over you that way you don&#039;t back out once it begins to happen. When you are born, your essence or vibration goes all the way down from like 100 to like a 2. Only a piece of you goes into this body and the rest stays in spirit and acts as your higher self and you can even divide your essence into multiple experiences at once meaning you could be having a life here and on another planet at the same time. Your energy is reduced soooo much just to come to this evil, vile, dual planet with all the evil and crime and bad things going on here compared to where we are coming from. So when souls finally get sent off to the womb going into a new life, they sometimes back out or chicken out once they start to realize and remember how bad it is on earth and the fact that they will be back in a physical reality where everything will be based on touch an sight an smell an this dense plane where everything takes a long drawn out process. It also happens on purpose to certain people who have a soul contract that calls for them to learn the lesson of grieving or the lesson or experience of a miscarriage. It teaches the mother something and its usually karmic. Like if you caused a woman to lose a baby in a past life then when you die, you might volunteer to come back as a mother that has a miscarriage to give back the karma.

These references help solidify and articulate the form and manner of character by which constitutes their animated being. There are multiple examples of adaptations or affections going globe-trotting and somehow manifesting in species on the other side of the world despite their being no point of crossover/cross contamination whatsoever. That&#039;s the Welt/Zeitgeist for you. But anyways, being subconsciously articulating them within their minds is a big problem, because their method of camouflage involves a form of perception blocking that works through blocking/bouncing back any reference recall requests of cognition, thus making them move &quot;too fast&quot; for us to see. When really, they&#039;re moving as too fast of an &quot;error&quot; or &quot;gap&quot; for our brains to bother rendering, and so it nulls them out. <br><br>And this is all before I even start bringing up their &quot;shininess&quot; which is attributed to some weird metallic-alloy cloth makes it to where the color spectrum in physics is flipped - so that only the colors they ABSORB and not reflect are the ones being emitted.

Alesiter was a powerful empath as well, which Lam needed for undisclosed reasons, and he rewarded Aleister with his &quot;guiding light&quot;, which in real life often manifests as stunningly and frequent algorithmic synchronicities (basically anything that involves a random generation by at least one pass-thru, Lam&#039;s &quot;blessing&quot; will be on that generation, thus passing down his knowledge onto his apprentice). It&#039;s kinda neat, until you realize it literally makes you go full-blown psychotic if you don&#039;t process it correctly and stare at it too hard - something about the human mind not liking that &quot;spooky action&quot;.<br><br>Also, Aleister was likely the reason why the feminine race-mind ended up ghosting out, due to him going full-blown horn-dog, grug-brain whenever he was articulating the 20th century model for them. Which, you know, he ended up getting them to start feminism so hooray, but also...... they started feminism... And their first order of business was to be granted the vote... free of the responsibility from the draft. Ya dun goofed, Al.
