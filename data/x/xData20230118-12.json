It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying.

Flerfers often post it as proof the Earth is flat. Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

O2 + Hydrocarbon = H2O + CO2 + energy. Some magical traditions believe breath is related to fire. And of course, fire needs air to live too, so this is not too far fetched.<br><br>The hindus recognize that life is connected to breath. If you stop breathing, you die. If you&#039;re alive, you must be breathing. Even plants follow this rule, though they inhale CO2 and exhale O2 in a sort of marvelous reversal. That might explain sacred trees, secret groves, nature worship, etc. They are the necessary flip side of animal (and human) life. Your breath shows a window into your emotional state. A sudden gasp (stress), fast breathing (excitement), slow breathing (relaxion), etc. If you understand this, you can alter your breathing make the connection go the other way. These are breathing exercises.<br><br>Anyway, air and earth are present in almost every religion that has gods. As the story usually goes, air + earth create the first man or first god. These concepts are usually named the sky father (or heavenly father) and earth mother (or mother earth). In the old testament, this process is used to create adam rather directly. Clay + breath = adam, the first man. In the new testament, this is where jesus comes from, but more symbolically. The one above all (sky father) + mary (the earthly mother) = jesus. But these stories are everywhere. In any case, women create by having children. Men don&#039;t have children, so they create using ideas.<br><br>So what does air signify?

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

E.g. thinking of kindness as hard as we can won&#039;t generate good feelings and get rid of all of our anger. First we need to be patient and stick with basics, which may just be chanting or repeating phrases from the Karaniya Metta Sutta. Then we need to see what the results are of that over a period of practice. <br><br>I often compare it to Tai Chi. In the beginning we must learn basic choreography as well as postural basics. If we speed through the form without basics we can injure ourselves no matter how much we talk about &quot;moving meditation&quot; and &quot;flow&quot;. The basics must slowly, gradually, and patiently be developed over time. Then we find that the appearance of flow is only external, and the real internal stuff has to do with our mind and connection to the body, and what we do with that. At first it seems like a lot, but after continuous development it all comes together naturally.", "time": 1673981935, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33865782, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)14:20:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33865632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33865632</a><br>To simplify: If you&#039;re up in your head a lot, just try being more mindful of the body.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

Stress causes the body to tense. Sustained trauma and stress causes a perpetual state of tension in the body. Specific memories of traumatic events can cause the body to tense in certain areas. For example, being punched in the stomach repeatedly and unexpectedly can cause the abdominal muscles to remain tensed indefinitely in preparation for a surprise attack. This then creates a compounding effect where the pelvic floor and back become unbalanced. This imbalance then disrupts the flow of energy in the body. You can read &quot;The Body Keeps the Score&quot; if you are interested in the mechanisms behind this.<br><br>Most people who have difficulties in this area tend to have issues around the heart chakra/diaphragm. This is because breathing becomes shallow in anticipation of a threat. I&#039;ve actually noticed by taking long walks where the tension spots are in my chest area. I recommend trying that if you want to find your tension areas. Unblocking the chest through conscious deep breathing will make dealing with everything else that will come up much easier, so I think dealing with that first is probably the best route.<br><br>As simple as it sounds, it is not easy. You have spent years breathing differently so it takes conscious effort to make full, deep breaths. In addition the muscle tightness is actually going to inhibit your ability to do so. So it will take a lot of effort and remembering to breathe properly. As we know, the breath is tied to the flow of the body. If you can correct this then other things will become easier to deal with.<br><br>Besides TRE, another good practice is vagus nerve stimulation.

He was always whistling and sighing, and had annoying widget notifications on his phone which he refused to silence.

Victims, very often minors, are subjected to an internal judicial committee\u2019s interrogation and humiliating violation of their privacy, including detailed inquiries into sexual acts (consensual or not).<br><br>Survivors, rather than abusers, are often excommunicated (shunned and treated as dead while alive) for their bravery in speaking out.

The orgies never end there anon. So unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die, and have as much of whatever kind of sex you want forever. As one NDEr said, if people knew how awesome heaven is there would be mass suicide all over the world immediately.<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

And it shows &quot;San Francisco&quot; as being in modern day Sonora state in Mexico. There is a &quot;Chapel of San Francisco&quot; in this area, &quot;The Capilla de San Francisco Xavier&quot;.

No chapter of Arctic history is more mysterious than the disappearance of these Norse settlements sometime in the 15th century. Theories for the colony&#039;s failure have included everything from sinister Basque pirates to the Black Plague. But historians have usually pinned most responsibility on the Norse themselves, arguing that they failed to adapt to a changing climate. The Norse settled Greenland from Iceland during a warm period around 1000 C.E. But even as a chilly era called the Little Ice Age set in, the story goes, they clung to raising livestock and church-building while squandering natural resources like soil and timber.

People may say that means God created it but I don&#039;t think so. In God&#039;s original creation, man didn&#039;t have to work and he could live for free. After the serpent came, God&#039;s curse was that Adam was going to have to work for a living (Gen. 3). Masons seems to adore this curse, however, and elevate employment to a noble status other than the literal curse of original sin which it is. Furthermore, it says in Judges twice, &quot;In those days, Israel had no king. Each man did as he pleased.&quot; Therefore, one may assume that the secret command hierarchy of the masons was something that crept in through the unceasing rebellion of the Israelites against God&#039;s intended creation: each man should do as pleased and he shouldn&#039;t have to work to pay the rent on his life. Masonry adores a model of society which is the opposite of the one God created. They like the one that Satan likes: wage slavery and each man doing as he is told. God subverted Satan&#039;s rebellion and put himself at the top of Satan&#039;s cult, i.e.: &quot;The Lord rules over Israel,&quot; but the cult is inherently Satanic, in my opinion, due to the above.<br><br>Although God&#039;s only complaint against the Israelites was that they would follow the ways of other nations, the Israelites demanded a king &quot;so they could be like the other nations.&quot; Even when God told them they would hate it, they would not heed God&#039;s wisdom (1 Sam. 8). After the kings started to choose some men as commanders and some as field hands, what is now called &quot;the pyramid&quot; eventually developed. God didn&#039;t create it that way. It was the result of the Israelites&#039; rebellion. In the way God wanted it, each man should do as he pleased without falling under the dominion of another man. God gave man dominion over animals but masons say that men have dominion over other men, which is 100% satanic.

From the summary it sounds quite believable. The heavy metals that are in chemtrails are also a reason why people might get parasites. One of the theories I&#039;ve heard is that our bodies purge heavy metals based on our genetics (better genes mean better way of getting rid of heavy metals). When body is weakened, it becomes more susceptible to parasitic infestations. Parasites act as sort of a defence mechanism by eating up excess heavy metals (just like we are mostly water, they are mostly heavy metals; after one purge I tried feeling the density of one of the bigger worms. It was extremely dense, hard and rubbery).<br>The craziest part is that the heavy metals that end up in the human body have either a positive or a neutral charge. Our bodies are more or less negatively charged. They fuck up our energy field. The same thing with EMTs: the frequencies they emit do the same thing, not to mention that the heavy metals and heavy metal loaded parasites are quite receptive on those signals.<br>But it&#039;s just a &quot;crazy theory&quot;.

The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE)", "filename": "Aryanz", "ext": ".png",

A large part of my adult life has been opening up to the matters of the 5th house and trying to force myself into social situations.

I tried it once but the pump was sending in a fine mist of pump oil and I couldn&#039;t stand it. Our solution was to take one of those snorkel tubes and stuff it full of rags to filter out the oil. The spot we chose to test it out was a decent size pond that connected up to the drainage system of a newly constructed shopping center/strip mall type place. My friend goes in with the new filter and he is going right towards the large black plastic corrugated drainage tube. all of a sudden, the tubing jerks and a whole bunch of bubbles blast out of the water. the line, still belching air, was separated from the snorkel and my friend was gone. He had gotten sucked into the drainage tube sideways and was blocking the flow like a log jam. Some how he got loose but when he did he got sucked down the drainage tube out to where it opens up into a ditch by the street. Miraculously, he was able to hold his breath and come out alive at the other end. From Our perspective, he had just disappeared and he didn&#039;t come back up. We went in looking around the edge of the pond trying to find him, hoping that he was just playing a joke and that he had swam away unseen somehow. It didn&#039;t make sense but we where so desperate and scared we couldn&#039;t understand at the time. Minutes since he disappeared, two police came and hollered at us, and when we looked over, our friend was with them. He was wearing his shirt tied up around his waste, tied up like a loincloth, with a decent gash across his chest from where he was pressed up against the pipe. Later, he recalled that his pants had been torn off, and he was gasping for air, half naked, in a huge rocky ditch where the police happened to see him as they where driving by. Nothing can describe the terror I felt when I realized that he wasn&#039;t going to come back up.

Weren&#039;t the jews God&#039;s chosen people?</span><br>Alright so the Israelites (Jews) were the chosen people of God, correct. The land of Israel was the chosen land that they found after a bunch of fighting wars and adventures after they fucked off from Egypt. During this time, in the Old Testament, it was made pretty clear that God only fucked with Jews and if you were a Gentile (aka a Goy) then he didn&#039;t fuck with you. You were not in his graces. <br><br>If you were part of a goy civilization that decided to wage war on the Jews, you will most likely loose since the old-testament Israelites could tap into God&#039;s power and do shit like change the weather, cause famine to their enemies and rain fire down from the sky. Now the Jews couldn&#039;t always do this and spam their God-abilities, cause sometimes God didn&#039;t fuck with them either &#039;cause they pissed him off a lot, but if he does fuck with anyone, he will fuck with ONLY the Jews of Israel and nobody else. And they are the only ones who get to go to Heaven when they die, everyone else basically got fucked for all God cared. <br><br>The bible didn&#039;t seem to make it clear whether in order to get cool with God you had to either be a true-blooded israelite, a descendent from the tribe of Abraham, or if you could convert from being a non-goy. I don&#039;t think conversion happened too much in those days but there are mentions of King David or Solomon conquering goy armies in battle and the former leaders of those armies are all like &quot;oh we realize that your God, the God of Israel is the true God&quot; and start to believe in him but considering they aren&#039;t israelites I doubt they got saved. <br><br>Now comes Jesus. Unlike God in the old testament, Jesus opened the path of salvation so that ANYONE could be saved, as long as they believed in him. Before it used to be exclusive to just Isrealites/Jews, so God sent his son down to open up Heaven for everyone as long as they believe in the word of God.", "filename": "1673708054858623", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673930650835837, "time": 1673930650, "md5": "AlV1UMlEkJTt8y7iqcl9EQ==", "fsize": 49467, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861518, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Shit my pant", "time": 1673930741, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861521, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:46:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33861514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33861514</a><br>You&#039;re forgetting the part where Jews actively denied the new covenant so it became open to everyone else instead.", "time": 1673930779, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861559, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:51:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33861521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33861521</a><br>Yes, thank you for mentioning that.

Nowhere in the Quran does it state anything about blowing yourself up. In fact, Islam has a very similar (and kinda vague) view on war and violence in which it preaches that violence and murder is sinful and encourages peaceful relationships between muslims and their neighbors. Similar to the old testament in the bible, Muhammad&#039;s armies do fight wars and it there&#039;s a verse stating that if muslims are threatened they can fight back, which is a little clearer than Christianity&#039;s new testament view honestly. <br><br>However modern Jihadist views really twist things up. Like &quot;Jihad&quot; in the Quran is never used to refer to any sort of warfare and instead its kind of like a personal struggle with oneself, like some kind of &quot;growing-up&quot; as a muslim or self-improvement shit. And the suicide bombing shit is another misinterpretation, because the Quran specifically denounces suicide of any king, and jihadist often refer to suicide as &quot;martyrdom,&quot; using the term &quot;shaheed&quot; from the quran but actually Shaheed/martyr is specifically used in Islamic scripture to refer to someone who is killed for their beliefs, not someone who kills themselves. So it&#039;s basically the same thing as Christian martyrdom <br><br>The 72 virgin thing is sort of true, though. However the verse uses a term that translates to &quot;beautiful women&quot; and even refers to their &quot;swelling breasts&quot; and not whether they are virgins or not, and it also states you&#039;ll have like ten thousand servants or some shit along with the big-tittied hot bitches.

I&#039;m talking about the power of the mind.<br><br>That&#039;s right, I know it sounds crazy, but bear with me. The human mind is capable of things that we can&#039;t even begin to imagine. From telekinesis to astral projection, the possibilities are endless. And yet, we&#039;ve barely scratched the surface of what our minds are capable of.<br><br>Think about it, if we could harness the power of the mind, we could change the world. We could communicate with the dead, levitate objects, and even travel through time. Imagine the possibilities of being able to control your own thoughts and emotions, to rid yourself of negative energy and manifest positive change.<br><br>But here&#039;s the thing, we can&#039;t do it alone. We need to come together as a community and start studying the power of the mind. We need to experiment, share our findings, and work together to unlock the secrets of the human mind.<br><br>So, I urge you, fellow anons, to join me on this journey. Let&#039;s explore the unknown and unlock the true power of the mind. Together, we can change the world.

In other words, the magician must deliberately offer to the god his very soul, as well as his personal hopes and ambitions, as an act of sacrifice. The Saturnine deity will accept no lesser gift as the price of admission to His inner sanctum. One does not need to perform this ritual in order to practice the Saturnine cult, or Saturnine magic. This route must exclusively be taken by those who having tasted the bittersweet gnosis of the god, wish to bind themselves to the Black Cube, and to its eternal current. To the believers in the cycle of rebirth, this ritual creates karmic (or psychic) chains that cannot be broken, and commit the magician&#039;s future selves to the service of the god.

The gist of the electric universe based SDC narrative is that Saturn used to be our star. But ancient and medieval cosmology usually had all the classical planets in their own fixed spheres, hermetically sealed ones (maybe where the term hermetically sealed comes from to begin with considering the role the spheres played in Hermeticism). So for the sun and Saturn to switch places would have destabilized their entire cosmological outlook. It would be the equivalent of us today finding out that the earth is actually flat.<br><br>And idk enough about electric universe to say but Saturn death cult is absolutely an op and the goal seems to be to promote Gnosticism and an astrotheological reading of Abrahamic religion, something Masons have been big on for a long time.

Keel claimed to have been a psyops officer in the Canadian military, and to have given propaganda broadcasts during WW2 from inside the pyramids. Also a notorious forger. Icke is 100% a theosophist with Gnostic leanings, reptilians are just archons for the sci fi age. And he was commanded by spirits to do things, he&#039;s said that himself. Maxwell is a Mason who specifically takes shots at the Abrahamic conception of sin, he says it&#039;s a corruption of sine, as in the sine waves from Saturn that generate our false reality.

For example, traditional Sufism is not antinomian, it&#039;s actually a lot more bound up with a traditional approach to the sharia than Salafism is since Salafis tend to want to revise Islamic law in an attempt to return to the early days of Islam. al-Ghazali&#039;s last book was on fiqh, not ego annihilation, and none of the great Sufi authorities thought you could get to a stage of spiritual development where you don&#039;t need to follow the sharia anymore. Sufi wine and romantic imagery is exclusive to a certain strain within Sufism, a basically nonexistent one these days afaik, and was just metaphor for the love of God in the same way that the Song of Songs uses erotic imagery to talk about the soul&#039;s approach to God. Sufism is not pantheistic, with some possible fringe cases of heresy. Most Sufis I&#039;m familiar with are Asharii but there have been some great Athari Sufis as well. Sufism is not pacifistic, many of the great Sufis fought in jihad themselves, many others wrote about it, and there are Sufi groups to this day fighting in Iraq. Sufism is ascetic but Salafism can be ascetic too, look at Sh. Ibn Uthaymeen.<br><br>Tldr, Western treatments of Sufism tend to try to separate it from more orthodox Islam, and to downplay its overlap with orthodoxy. They do this because of a bias that tells them Islam couldn&#039;t possibly have rich interior spirituality, that must come from outside Islam, because white wine moms love Rumi but aren&#039;t so sure about sharia, and on the part of 5 eyes, because Western spooks think they can defang Islam by promoting Sufism as an alternative to &quot;Islamism&quot;.", "time": 1673820623, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849448, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:15:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846552</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians also engaged in genocide.</span><br>Ever consider that us human beings are universally retarded and such absurdities like genocide are just a perk of living in this gay, stupid ass world in the sufferings of the human condition that not even the greatest of worldly luxuries and escapism can cure?", "time": 1673820926, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849568, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:30:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33848683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33848683</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t and I consider that a completely valid question. <br><br>Even if we were to accept the Christian narrative of the crucifixion, complete with death and resurrection, why should it be the death that gets the focus and not the resurrection? If you&#039;re a Protestant it has to be the former because most Protestants think the death and resurrection was a human sacrifice that allowed God to create a legal loophole in order to forgive people (subsititonal atonement). But that&#039;s not the only way it&#039;s been framed by Christians. Eastern Orthodoxy has an entirely different scheme of salvation, they go with christus victor theory rather than subsititonal atonement theory, and in the medieval era they criticized the Latin West for an excessive focus on Christ&#039;s suffering and death. So yeah, I don&#039;t think the veneration of the cross does self-evidently make sense, an awful lot about the many ways Christianity has handled the crucifixion story doesn&#039;t make sense.<br><br>But on top of that, there&#039;s no biblical basis for God reclaiming the cube.

The end result of believing there is an anthropomorphized, personal god judging us for sins is ultimately not different from one&#039;s own deeply held subconscious beliefs, such as guilt and desires, determining what happens to us in the afterlife. To (poorly) paraphrase Christ, we allegedly are judged by God according to how we judge others. Christ really insisted on repeating this general concept over and over. Depending on how you look at it, this could simply be a different perspective or way of expressing the same idea.<br><br>The same general concept is arguably presented in the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead with the weighing of the soul and in Zoroastrianism with the crossing of the bridge. It&#039;s again not far off from the Buddhist and Hindu reincarnation based on Karma. I&#039;m probably not doing the best job of articulating myself, but what I&#039;m getting at is all of these feel like clues pointing to one truth about death and the afterlife.<br><br>If we entertain this as being true for argument&#039;s sake it raises some questions though. What about the concept of a shortcut to salvation through grace of a savior such as Christ or Krishna? Well, if it really is ultimately about our most deeply held (subconscious) beliefs, then the &#039;good Christian&#039; would have a clean conscious because they truly forgive the sins of everyone, and thus can accept the belief they are saved, this being &quot;saved by Christ&#039;s sacrifice&quot;. Similarly with believing karma is absolved/transfered to Krishna by believing Krishna has that power, clearing your conscious.<br><br>All of this begs the question of psychopaths. How do they fit in? By not having guilt, do they simply get a free pass? That can&#039;t be right, right? So I wonder if they aren&#039;t simply people who already &quot;sold their soul to a demon&quot; in some way.

I thought it was the Edict of Milan that ended Roman assrage over Christianity, at least officially. Maybe there was further persecution up to the time of the Council but if so this is a genuine gap in my knowledge of history. I&#039;d say the change in Roman attitude wasn&#039;t an abrupt about-face out of nowhere. Christianity had been getting steadily more popular by the time of the Edict of Milan, and prior to it Roman persecution was fairly uneven. Most of the Roman freakouts seemed to have been occasioned by the increasing popularity of Christianity in fact, usually in an indirect way. It seems this increasing popularity created the sort of environment in which a major Roman political figure, such as Constantine, could be won over to or just made sympathetic to Christianity so as to choose to end the persecution officially. <br><br>Most Christians sadly have nothing interesting or informative to say about their religion so I agree there. But it also seems to me that most atheists online live up to the caricature of redditors on 4chan lol. So I don&#039;t see it as unique to Christians. The sad reality is that most people aren&#039;t smart enough to gather and synthesize their own info.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers.
