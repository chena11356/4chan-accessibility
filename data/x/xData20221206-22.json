This is someone young and energetic who may have a warped sense of reality and sets of expectations. I can barely tap into her without feeling out of sorts. Are you sure you want this? This is a lot to handle. She despises this search for the right partner as it makes her even less grounded with tapping into all these male energies and there&#039;s something in you that stands out to her and she&#039;s filled with this sense of relief. This awe of you stems from this pronounced sense of peace that you give her. Are you a very calm person? There&#039;s a King of Cups impression you&#039;re giving. Perhaps that you lack a stereotypical male&#039;s attributes and it&#039;s throwing her off a bit. There could be a desire for more, for you to embody each of the suits because that would be perfect in her mind. She&#039;s not so perfect either and while she&#039;s aware of that some days, she&#039;s oblivious to her own faults on others. Don&#039;t let her trying to find defects in everything slow you down and it&#039;s also important to note now mesmerized she is by your gentleness at times.

I missed something. I feel as if you would only obtain the Holy Spirit if ya lay all of your sins at the feet Of Jesus Christ during the being born again prayer and baptism. I feel as if that lines up with scripture. It&#039;d be semi-similar to the ego-death dharmics and drugies speak of but not quite, more like a death of lower the worldly nature that you thought was part you and a birth in the divine and spiritual nature of God. Even after that one will be still be tempted by sin and will prolly still occasionally fall to sin but willfully sinning ethier shouldn&#039;t be a possibility or is blasphemous, depnding on who ya ask. I think, if you truly doubt you&#039;re salvation as I said before pray about a fast for a few days maybe even seven, make sure to drink snake water though, and when you feel ready to devote your whole self to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and accept the Holy Spirit within and absolutely submit to God&#039;s will, feeling true agape towards Him, and lay all the sins from before at His feet. Prehaps then you will believe in your salvation. I&#039;m still hanging on to the once saved always saved philosophy but since I&#039;m druggin I should pray about things. Since I&#039;m running outta my stumbling block I realize in a visceral way what I knew this whole time how much of a dead end this drugging thing is or indeed much of anything of this physical world, even seemingly innocent things. It never satisfies and when the stimulation is gone or gets old your always left feeling hollow, because without God we are. Thank you for reading my novel and I pray you finally get to walk with Him anon.

The problem is that I don&#039;t know what his worship was like, but only his mythos.<br>The most famous one says that at the beginning of time there were two beings in the world, Tup\u00e3 and Jurupari, Tup\u00e3 was &quot;a kind of saint, a moral summit, devoted to doing good, who had very few followers&quot; and Jurupari was &quot;the incarnation of the devil who dedicated himself to partying, dancing, drinking, music and pleasure, who was followed by many people&quot;. Tup\u00e3 was jealous of Juripari and on an unlucky day he decided to burn him in a bonfire, so women followers of Jurupari came to collect his ashes, but instead they found a palm tree that they felled and used to make flutes that reproduced Jurupari&#039;s voice. Women used these magic flutes at parties where they got drunk and danced erotically with men. The Sun sent Jurupari to be reborn on Earth through a virgin and he became a lawgiver very similar to Moses among the natives who transformed their matriarchal society into a patriarchal one. So only men could use Jurupari&#039;s magic flutes. <br>As I like Afro-Caribbean Religions and Mesopotamian/Canaanite/Egyptian/Gre<wbr>co-Roman Paganism I wanted to make a syncretism of that to fill that void of worship. In Santeria, Eshu was the god of chaos who requested 1001 pigeons to Olodumare, the solar god, to let her create the Universe and then Eshu became Olodumare/Sun emissary like Jurupari. In Canaanite Paganism, Baal was probably a ancient sun god turned storm god associated with the seasons as well as Jurupari, in addition to being a patriarchal god whose very name means &quot;owner of the woman&quot;.", "filename": "1670287631834", "ext": ".gif", "w": 219, "h": 255, "tn_w": 214, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670354240680759, "time": 1670354240, "md5": "AOi9H+Bbep5mIu+0s3tcSw==", "fsize": 1295342, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "tips", "replies": 36, "images": 15, "omitted_posts": 31, "omitted_images": 12, "last_replies": [{"no": 33548968, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:25:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33548412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33548412</a>", "filename": "1669846333379518", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 396, "h": 382, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1670379901270209, "time": 1670379901, "md5": "MJA1fa63SEPFaM/I2tvrVw==", "fsize": 24259, "resto": 33545964}, {"no": 33549166, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:50:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33545964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33545964</a><br>Ayara Cavala", "filename": "Acompanhante-india-nua-31", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1888, "tn_w": 59, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670381400799711, "time": 1670381400, "md5": "S5HR2WYyrp6/YYvODpRU2Q==", "fsize": 103216, "resto": 33545964}, {"no": 33549426, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:29:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33545964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33545964</a><br>Archon worship is bad for you, dumb monkey.", "time": 1670383740, "resto": 33545964}, {"no": 33549442, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:31:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33549166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33549166</a><br>Hoobity hoobity zim zam woo woo zammity zizzle please fuck my nozzle", "filename": "1664668005978783", "ext": ".gif", "w": 480, "h": 352, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1670383894372406, "time": 1670383894, "md5": "y8XIMhZ0qQ58T0xXZN1b/w==", "fsize": 97051, "resto": 33545964}, {"no": 33549479, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:38:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33549166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33549166</a><br>Sauce?", "time": 1670384325, "resto": 33545964}], "last_modified": 1670384325}, {"no": 33536680, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:56:40", "name": "Space Cowboy", "sub": "/cdf/ - Cosmic Death Fungus General", "com": "Realm Of Entropy Edition<br><br><br>previous: <a href=\"/x/thread/33511154#p33511154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33511154</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;START HERE!

I had to work hard for several days to discover that the single-stranded Helix with 6 bases per turn refers 2&#039;, 5&#039;-linked RNA or DNA, as opposed to the normal 3&#039;, 5&#039; variety. This is known to hardly any molecular biologist, and I found out only by making an accurate model. There is no other plausible way of constructing a 6-fold helix as indicated. [published research] shows that 2&#039;, 5&#039;-linked RNA will form double helices, but prefers to remain single-stranded. [Other research] explores the use of 2&#039;, 5&#039; RNA as an antiviral drug; it seems we have been exposed to such strange molecules in the past, and have evolved an interferon-RNAase L system against them. Recall that origin-of-life experiments in the 1980s by Leslie Orgel, found that RNA would often polymerize into two different forms, namely 2&#039;, 5&#039; versus 3&#039;, 5&#039;; and it was a mystery to chemical evolutionists why 3&#039;, 5&#039; was favored on Earth. Note that many abductees remain ill with chronic fatigue, which generally includes a high level of RNAase L; just as if their immune systems have been activated by contact with 2&#039;, 5&#039; RNA. The clear implication is that 2&#039;, 5&#039; RNA may represent an alternative system of genetic coding to 3&#039;, 5&#039; RNA or DNA as found on Earth; and that the makers of the Chilbolton pictogram wished us to understand that fact. Whether a sacred band of elite scientists could hoax such a result seems doubtful; since 2&#039;, 5&#039; nucleic acids are mentioned rarely in the literature, and nowhere does it say that they form a single-stranded helix with 6 bases per turn.

Just because freewill isn&#039;t completely free like you thought it was or like your fake religion tried to tell you it was, it&#039;s not, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a complete illusion. Freewill just isn&#039;t what you think it is or isn&#039;t really what we&#039;ve been told it is. Freewill works alongside karma, time, reincarnation and the planet to create the human experience. Freewill in it&#039;s rawest, purest form is when you make decisions that aren&#039;t aligned with your soul plan or purpose or soul contract. You guys MUST MUST MUST remember in all circumstances and conversations that we are PLANNING OUR LIVES BEFORE BIRTH. You have to remember that, it&#039;s a small detail but very important. You planned this life and your soul contract is like a blueprint, but it&#039;s just a blueprint. So you come here with this blueprint in one hand and your freewill or freedom or ability to make your own decisions in the other. When you use freewill to make decisions that go against the blueprint, that causes karma. There&#039;s good karma and bad karma but either way, it has too be paid back but not in money, in experience, emotion, feeling, ENERGY. All emotions and feelings are just energy, everything is energy. People think because they found out that they have a blueprint or that we generally have a a set path for our life that it totally X&#039;s out freewill, No it doesn&#039;t, we have Both. People say well if reincarnation is real and there is no hell then everyone would be shooting each other killing babies with no consequences and that&#039;s where the soul contract or blueprint comes in. Everyone isn&#039;t gonna make the decision to kill a baby because everyones blueprint or soul contract isn&#039;t for them to come in an be a babykiller.

She had a PC, and a pretty good one at that, when she was about 12 and she had a handful of games, The Sims 3, some fuckin virtual pet game I can&#039;t remember the name of, and for some reason I will never ever fucking understand, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. I guess it was because Twilight was all the rage back in 2008, but she saw &quot;vampire&quot; and immediately latched onto it. I&#039;d actually get dragged into her room to play it for her because she was retarded and didn&#039;t understand RPGs, I was a fa/tg/uy though and I actually played a few VtM chronicles with friends at high school back in the day, so I knew quite a lot about Vampire. It was after she got done watching me play VtM for her that she pushed me off the computer and started playing the Sims 3. I decided I&#039;d stay around and watch her because it was a boring weekend and I didn&#039;t want to do my homework yet. I was firsthand witness to this, and it&#039;s how I know she isn&#039;t lying about this story. She decided she&#039;d create LaCroix in the Sims 3, and while at the time vampires weren&#039;t in the game, she&#039;d downloaded some mod to add them to the game along with a bunch of clothes. She made LaCroix to the best of her abilities and placed him in a random house in the game. Then she started playing and shit got just fucking weird. The game froze on the loading screen, and crashed. She launched the game again, and thankfully the game had saved before she tried to play LaCroix, and so she loaded the save and went into the household.
