In the very sharpest images there are hints of diffraction rings visible on the edges of the satellites. That is of course the<br>absolute limit of optical performance, and is only rarely attained. Interestingly, the process you have, of using a high-quality imaging<br>system, with fast read-out, and then selecting the rare `perfect&#039; images<br>is something which has been developed and applied somewhat by one of my colleagues here. You might like to look at our local web page presenting some of this:<br>[link to www.ast.cam.ac.uk]<br>You might also be interested in a journal produced by the<br>MIT Lincoln Laboratory - which is the group which has built some of the things you are seeing.

It looked like a bunch of bots and feds started swarming my thread and they might start coming here. Real dicyanin works but it is pretty hard to find; a rarity if you can find real goggles. Basically, it is said that dicyanin dye that is applied to glasses or goggles allows you to see the world we people can&#039;t, an astral plane; a demonic and angelic realm. I had a russian uncle who warned me about these glasses because once you see their world, you can&#039;t unsee it and if they see you noticing them they will torment you until you commit suicide. They used dicyanin in soviet interrogation rooms to see auras around people to see if they were telling the truth. Be careful OP and tread lightly. Also the supposed &quot;50 dollar glasses with dicyanin dye&quot; you see on etsy is bullshit.

These fuckers didn&#039;t even check my TPO antibodies, even though they know I have UC for nearly 14 years now. (I think I might have a law suit for medical negligence, since if they checked these antibodies 9 months ago, I could&#039;ve done something for the inflammation and allowed the thyroid to do its thing). <br><br>My doctors refused to run a thyroid panel and only want to treat my high TSH level with levothyroxine. I have so far refused to take this drug and opted for what helped me get my UC under control. A super strict carnivore diet, daily cold exposure, breathing exercises, intermittent fasting, morning light exposure to regulate my circadian rhythm and hormones, and light exercise including running callisthenics.", "time": 1674647821, "resto": 33924731}, {"no": 33926461, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)06:58:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33926455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33926455</a><br><br><br>Just for the record I feel way better, I sleep immediately around 10pm each night, (no exposure to computers or phones after 8pm and gonna look into getting red lights to stimulate melatonin production.

The same day they diagnosed me with HT, I was profusely bleeding out my rectum for the first time in 6 years of remission. I have not bled since that day I decided to go back to the lifestyle changes (touch wood). I have energy and can run and do exercise and I&#039;m getting noticeably stronger with my callisthenics. <br><br>I have today just managed to pay for a private thyroid panel and my bloods have been sent off to a lab testing for 10-15 different things such as free T4, T3, TSH, TPO, folic Acid, D3, inflammatory markers... I&#039;m not expecting much in terms of my thyroid levels to drop, because I have only done this for 5 weeks and I think this is not long enough to reduce the inflammation. I will continue to get these checked in the coming weeks. If they are getting worse then I will likely have to go on levothyroxine for a brief period of time and taper off them. I am also waiting for the results to see if its hashimotos or not, so I selenium load for a month and then introduce iodine/iodide into my daily supplements.

Now at this time, I quit sugar, smoking, coffee, masturbating, late nights, vegetables, carbs, and lazing about. So my guess is I was detoxing something from my body. When i looked online for detox information a few weeks later, I found out that apparently when you detox, these bacteria or whatever is being removed will create endotoxins that shut off bile production and then release the toxins into the bloodstream and it produces all the symptoms I was experiencing. Apparently you can use bile salts prior to doing a detox to prevent these symptoms as the bile salts keep the production of bile flowing to remove the toxins. Would this work to prevent the die off symptoms you are all experiencing?? Just a thought I had anyway. <br><br>Sorry for the long text.

There was also a legal conflict between me and a Mexican drug dealer who has ties to a Mexican drug cartel. I received threats of violence, he sent me pictures of mutilated corpses, cartel killings etc., and I sued him. There was a court case and he was punished by law. However, that woman was siding with him. This drug dealer once wrote me that I should kill SM, trying to persuade me to commit femicide. I reported his messages to the police. Later SM complained of harassment and went to the dean of my faculty but she also told the dean that it was me - not that guy - who was planning on killing her. It was the most devastating, embarrassing experience of my life where I had to explain myself. It was traumatizing. Later on I found out that she was fucking that drug dealer guy and he was using her as a strategy of defense, wanting her to testify in court against me. However, she was not a witness in that case of course. <br><br>And she is really a complicated person. She once told me that she broke off all contact with her father and that he feels emasculated by her. She also told me that she had experiences of abuse. I don&#039;t know.

The plants are selectively bred (even genetically modified) to be the best for a uniform harvest (run the machines once) and to stay nice on the grocery shelf until sold. Not for flavor, sturdiness when lacking Big Ag pesticides/herbicides, and definitely not for nutritional value. Literally anything you grow yourself will be an improvement. Check out Steve Solomon&#039;s Gardening When It Counts for good advice. He recommends pre-industrial-revolution heirloom varieties because of their hardiness and nutritional content. His author&#039;s voice is exceedingly kikish and annoying, but the planting advice is sound.<br>If you want the biggest taste/nutrition difference, I&#039;d recommend heirlooms or at least growing your own for: tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries or any kind of bramble berry or blueberry, squash, and melon.<br>There are many issues with adulterations of herbs used in alternative/herbal medicines, and too often the seller buys a unit of stock and keeps it on a shelf for years after its potency has waned. You can grow your own and get much higher quality herbs since you control all aspects of the growing, harvest, and storage. Calendula is a good one for beginners. Chamomile has a huge taste/effectiveness difference when you grow it yourself. Storebought is so weak it might as well not exist. Homegrown is actually soothing.<br>Harvest Time also has spiritual and magical connotations and associations with particular deities if that&#039;s your thing.

How do we know it is a solid cube? Regardless: that requires speculation, and speculation is the name of the game of all black box systems by proxy. <br>The cube doesn&#039;t contain things like a prison, for the key to the cube is that, being a black box, the contents are irrelevent for the user. What matters is how interactions that occur, on it&#039;s surface, or that conjunt with it as inputs, create outputs not from the cube, but more exactly at some point in the future. The black cube is 4D scrying mirror - a real crystal ball, but with the quality of guaranteeing an output rather than displaying to the viewer what the output will be (that&#039;s why it&#039;s a mirror.) <br>When you think of black cube symbolism, you see that there is no &#039;real intent&#039; of the user to the cube, as being black, ANY user is only seeing exactly what they put in, and what comes out, and nothing more. Think about blackrock. What does black rock do if not send inputs into a black box (the market) in anticipation of future outputs?<br>What does this mean? It means that the black cube is synonymous with &#039;a deal with the devil&#039; - in the sense that one &#039;speaks of the devil&#039; rather than cutting for the sake of a red guy with horns - a worship that is so immanent as to be temporally congruent with the real volition of the worshipper: automatic. A wager that is guaranteed in it&#039;s exchange not by a one off deal but by a constant confirmation of it&#039;s reality - a proof of stake - is that not the cross? The stake is the state of the unfolded cube. Proof of stake = proof of state. State confirmation. What is the state? The state is not a &#039;thing&#039; or an &#039;entity,&#039; but a time horizon.

The fact that smoking is bad for you is pretty evident, and even a basic understanding of biology should make it intuitive that inhaling smoke into your lungs is going to damage them. It&#039;s unhealthy, and I can imagine that the drain on the economy from it was big enough to start some aggressive campaigns.<br><br>Anyways time for some more interesting theories. First of all, nicotine is definitely capable of improving the brain. It&#039;s a fast acting stimulant, and works on acetylcholine rather than dopamine like other stimulants do. Excess dopamine can be neurotoxic, but elevated acetylcholine is neuroprotective, and specifically improves memory and creativity. It&#039;s a subtly benefit, not aggressive like amphetamines, but I&#039;ve noticed I work better after taking nicotine, and will often use nicotine gum when I need a mental boost. <br><br>Another theory is related to the social component of smoking. There are very few times for people to just exist and talk in American society, especially with people outside your immediate family. The smoke break was one of these times, where multiple people would go outside together and just talk, all while under the influence of a substance that enhances cognition. The only other common time people talk with strangers is under the influence of alcohol which numbs cognition. Basically, by demonizing smoking, another avenue for people who normally would never meet to communicate was removed, and the remaining ways to meet people involve the use of substances which make you stupider, not smarter.", "time": 1674671095, "resto": 33926480}, {"no": 33928128, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:27:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You could change the world and still be a smoker.

The only footage that survived was this clip, as everything else was fried. After he exploded my wall, a huge flash blinded me for several minutes, which was why I backed up to the wall scared and confused. After reviewing this footage, he appeared to be conducting a mating ritual that most ayys do when sexually aroused. When he finally left several hours later, as I cowered in the corner, I saw that he had taken my pants with him. Looking out of the hole in my wall, they were hanging out of the door in his ship as he flew off. A couple hours later I found a homeless man wearing them, as he had scavenged them when they fell off the ship.

Unfortunately, I&#039;m too small brain to make much progress, but like you, I am also mystified that most people straight up don&#039;t care. Toddlers look at everything and ask &quot;why?&quot;, why don&#039;t people ask about the most fundamental &quot;why&quot;?<br><br>As for me, I think it has to do with the true nature of reality. I&#039;m not sure that anything really &quot;exists&quot; in the conventional sense. External existence is not necessary for the phenomenological experience of consciousness, only a perceiver is needed.<br><br>So now there are two questions. 1) Why is there a perceiver in the first place, and 2) why the whole &quot;setup&quot; with living life and all that? I think that&#039;s what <a href=\"#p33930349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33930349</a> meant with he differentiated between the question why(existence) and the question itself.<br><br>The second question is where the psychic vampire archon loosh stuff comes in. Or alternately, the interdimensional mmo that we&#039;re all jacked into. Or some complex way by which the greater hive organism of Humanity evolves, as we upload each of our experiences and lives. I think likely aspects of all of those are true.<br><br>The first question is much harder. This &quot;perceiver&quot; seems singularly special, in that it is non-material, and yet able to perceive things in a special way-a &quot;conscious&quot; way. Consciously perceiving something feels very different from anything else, indeed it&#039;s the only thing that feels like anything. This property is so special, that I think this is what is meant by the innate &quot;divinity&quot; of Man referred to in many religions.

Among this is the dating of the fall of Atlantis as related to and from Plato, about 9k years before Solon&#039;s time (c9600 BC, 11,600kya). This coincides with meltwater pulse 1b of the roughly thousand year younger dryas climate catastrophe. Further the mass of ice that existed in North America alone would have been nearly equal to that of Antarctica before the younger dryas, a near equal mass was also over Europe. The geographic evidence of the younger dryas melt pulses points to mind bogglingly fast melting, previously thought to have been centuries or millennia has been revised down to months of years recently (in some studies, weeks). This rapid melting of such large masses of ice would have mostly drained into the Atlantic, it would change the thermocline and haloclines of the entire world ocean rapidly and immediately altered the climate. It would have also rapidly changed the isostasy of the Earth&#039;s crust under the Atlantic in particular and raised local sea levels much more rapidly than previously thought. These are merely results however, of a precursor event that triggered the massive melting and climate shift (whether caused from the sun, the Earth itself, or from a passing or impacting comet or asteroid or something else).<br><br>The evidence of catastrophism are all about us, in our sight daily.

In your heliocentric paradigm you believe in galaxies tens of thousands of lightyears accross in size. So go ahead and Picture a merely-go-round the size of the Milky Way galaxy 50,000 lightyears across that\u2019s spinning. Do you honestly think that someone sitting 20 feet from the center of the roating galaxy sized merry-go-round is experiencing the same speed as the someone at the outer edge tens of thousands of lightyears away from the center?? Of course they\u2019re not. That\u2019s ludicrous! Obviously the person near the center would be traveling extremely slow compared to the person at the outer edge that would be traveling literally faster than the speed of light. This is where the trick lies in using angular speed. It\u2019s nonsense to claim that everyone on earth is experiencing the same speed just bc \u201cmuh maths\u201d said they are. They\u2019re not. Objectively angular speed is the wrong equation to use to determine if you would feel earth\u2019s spin.

It&#039;s been very interesting for me to look through all the different esoteric traditions. The way it seems to me, this mega.nz folder was a personal collection and at some point you opted to share it publicly. Is this correct? Probably you have answered this before but if you could tell me a bit about how this whole thing came to be, I&#039;d be grateful.<br><br>In the Beginner folder, there are a few dozen books, copied over from other parts of the library which have been deemed appropriate for people making their first steps into occult arts; self-initiation, if you will. Though other than than, I have found the library quite tedious to navigate. Would you agree that improvements can be made in terms of the layout/structure of the collection? Perhaps a grouping by period or by heritage or other attributes. The library is fifty or so gigs in size so the mega.nz hosting is not free. Have you considered hosting it on a VPS as your own website? It would be more costly and complicated but there could then be a more personalized visual aesthetic, which I believe the occult-interested appreciate and it would allow for the creation of information pages. What this is (the library), what the traditions are (who, when, what, etc). The zoomer is hard-wired to look up, in a search engine, whatever he does not understand and for controversial topics, which occult arts undoubtedly are, search engines and wikipedia are often\u2026 compromised.

This is the same reason the upside down pentagram is a portal to the 5th dimension, because it is a satanic symbol. In order to create a spiritual portal to the 5th dimension, you must draw five upside down pentagrams, one on the floor in the center of a room, and one on each of the four walls facing the four cardinal points (north, east, west, south). After this is done, you create a circle of salt around the center pentagram on the floor, and you summon Satan through meditation.

I am in the midst of somewhat of a spiritual awakening/crisis. Apart from a couple of years spent in a protestant Christian school when I was very young, I have led mostly a secular life. My pride, training in logic, the overwhelming nature of choice when it comes to religion, the corruption of man present in religion, and other factors have kept me from formally or even informally following Christ.<br><br>For the first time in many years, I have had an opportunity to really confront some things about myself and my beliefs and am coming up disappointed and short of the answers I am looking for. The state of the world, my constant fear and anger, my own life of sin, a need for purpose, and my worry for my family have been the catalysts for my newfound spiritual pursuit. I have loosely believed that we are put here to gain experiences and \u201cgrow spiritually\u201d, but I have not progressed beyond that rudimentary belief. As I have been pushing forward lately for spiritual answers (inconsistently at best), I have come to a few conclusions:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This life is an illusion. One of my first memories as a young child is a time in school when I knew just as I know the sky is blue that life is not what we think it is. What then is the truth?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I need to find some spiritual answers. My laissez-faire approach is no longer enough for me or my family</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While I know we are supposed to rely on faith alone, my imperfect nature has made me look for signs to know what direction in which to apply my faith. The miracles of Christ and those that have been an offshoot of belief in Him and His teachings are very compelling.

Even though I believed in being as honest as possible with people, usury, sales tactics, the pursuit of profit, and other aspects of business are unGodly. How is this to be reconciled?

The gospel of John can be interpreted in other ways, and the trinity itself is just a concept invented by men to combine father, son, and holy spirit into one God. I believe Jesus was messiah, and one with God. The Jews at that time believed that in the world to come we would all be unified with God. Jesus, being born from the holy spirit was already one with God from birth. I don&#039;t believe Christ was God in the flesh, but instead he was a god who came from the word and soul of the God. In the psalms of David, we are referred to as children of the most high, and God wants us all to be gods but we failed him and remained mere men. So achieving godhood is a common theme with Yahweh. I believe Yeshua was a man who was also a god, because he was one with the creator God. He is objectively not the creator though.<br><br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/u/0/d/1NGa-9x2vF7lAAjXIMgTPmx09W1<wbr>JyHZmHVV3_Vws2TQk/htmlview#gid=0", "time": 1674753921, "resto": 33934541}, {"no": 33936021, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)12:30:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33935997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33935997</a><br>Good finding son, not a single mistake <br>Jesus was not god, he was a son of God <br>Great job, bright mind!", "filename": "7777777", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 863, "h": 1110, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674754233867569, "time": 1674754233, "md5": "eS/SpCgb35DQ/1Lm4HgMOw==", "fsize": 180673, "resto": 33934541}, {"no": 33936042, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)12:34:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33935918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33935918</a><br>The corruption of the church is at the Vatican level.

Sexual energy is the single closest manifestation of one&#039;s primal energy, pure from potential. This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there. You can literally consider your sexual proclivities as your &quot;energy signature,&quot; and yes, this is why when you go on nofap that signature signs brighter and women magically seem to notice you more.<br><br>In a kabbalastic representation, sexuality and sexual energy is often connected to Yesod, but the darker and fetishistic impulses are actually a dark, shadowy reflection closer to Daath and linked towards darker &quot;spheres,&quot; which is not bad in itself, but is seen in the signature because often such fetishes are more &quot;rooted&quot; in manifest things than higher ideals, thus linked more to lower planes than higher.

By coping with trauma by splurging into hedonistic lust or becoming their ideal &quot;saint&quot; self. I did both and found out neither made me happy until I stopped caring and accepted who I am. When I was super coomer, I would edge for weeks and all day. It was painful and made me tired and depressed. When I did the nofap, I had more energy and woman flirted with me more but I used sugar to replace porn. Now not everyone who does nofap is like me, some succeed and go for years while the longest I could do was 40 days. During my nofap phase I always felt guilty about my sexuality. Since during that time I went over to christianty since I was attacked by literal demons weekly. I thought I was impure and guilty, and created some sort of guilt complex.<br><br>But a year ago I stopped that I just accepted who I was. Now I feel zero energy loss when I cum since in the end were are just gods in a matrix being harvested for loosh.

According to scientists, this happens every seven decades as part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation.

The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the inner core&#039;s rotation slowed significantly beginning in 2009. The study also found that a larger, decade-long pattern may be at play, with the rotation of the inner core varying on a decade-long timescale and reversing course every 7 decades.<br><br>It is important to note that the inner core is a solid ball surrounded by a fluid outer core, which allows it to rotate at a different pace compared to the planet&#039;s outer layers.

Scientists suggest that journalists can avoid inaccuracies by double-checking with scientists themselves.<br><br>Although the changes won&#039;t have much impact on life on the surface, more research is needed to understand the significance of the inner core&#039;s rotation on the planet&#039;s geophysical processes.", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-27 at 17-23-11 Stable Diffusion Online", "ext": ".png", "w": 563, "h": 543, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 241, "tim": 1674804428263352, "time": 1674804428, "md5": "Z34c6rUi4pDt6sbB3dHKxA==", "fsize": 677877, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-core", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 33941826, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:30:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "K...keep me posted", "time": 1674804630, "resto": 33941813}, {"no": 33941912, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:49:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There&#039;s been a increase in volcanic activity, just gonna put that out there .", "time": 1674805786, "resto": 33941813}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33931623, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:48:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Can you /x/-pill me on Harry Potter?<br><br>I remember ANTIFA being really into this series and Right-Wingers telling them to &quot;Read Another Book&quot; and now is the very same Far-Left boycotting this franchise because the author turned out to be &quot;Transphobic&quot; although she seems to be very much in line with the left for everything else.

Disregard the pagans and heathens, first of all. Their opinions on the matter, I mean. Christian ego death is the only true ego death. It is not the same as in Buddhism, as Buddhist ego death is oxymoronical from the start. The Christian &quot;dies to self, and lives to God.&quot; This is not a NT concept either. The way our Lord wished the Sabbath to be sacredly upheld is a picture of the Christian inward attitude. I want to reference the Japanese concept of &quot;kokoro no kamae,&quot; if you&#039;re familiar. Here is an excerpt from Isaiah 58: <br><br>&quot;If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot<br>from doing your own pleasure on My holy day,<br>and call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord honorable, and honor it, desisting from your own ways, from seeking your own pleasure and speaking your own word, then you will take delight in the Lord...&quot;<br><br>This attitude is essentially the Christian posture of the heart.

I recommend reading the whole chapter (as well as the whole of Scripture, of course), for a clearer picture. <br><br>&quot;Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.&quot;<br><br>The Christian, united by faith through the power of the Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Christ Jesus (See Colossians 2-3 and Galatians 4 as well on this), is free from the shackles of sin, and no longer is a slave to it as the unredeemed masses are. The believer is in the position of authority to present himself to God for righteousness, thus furthering their own likeness to Christ, or to sin for unrighteousness, foolishly.

It is my active relationship with the God-person, Jesus Christ through the God-person the Holy Spirit. God is a person. He is not an abstract force or an spiritual concept. He is a person. I&#039;ll give you two examples which are relevant to my original posts. <br><br>Once while at college, waiting for the last bus of the day to carry me home, I was praying or praising, perhaps talking to the Lord, I can&#039;t recall, when suddenly the Lord showed me a vision. <br><br>I saw myself, seated upon a throne in a marble throne-room - all that I can recall either in white or black stone, gleaming beautifully. Before me, servants in white robes and servants in black robes continually came to kneel before me, receive a decree, and leave in silent obedience (I was seeing all of this in the third person, I should add - like viewing a scene from a film, almost). These persons were angels. The voice of the Lord spoke to me and said, &quot;Every idle word you say is either giving permission to my holy angels to bring it about, or to Satan and his angels to bring it about.&quot; He then brought to my mind a recollection of the story of King David, as he hid in the caves of Judea (I believe). King David, hiding from King Saul at that point, was longing for water from the well of his hometown in Bethlehem, he expressed this out loud, to himself - he thought, but three of his valiant men overheard his longing. Unbeknownst to him, they went to Bethlehem, at the time occupied by some large number of Philistines, and they slew 300 men to bring him a drink of water from that well. The mere passing wish of their King sealed the fates of 300 men that day. The reason this story is relevant, as I pointed out through Romans 6 and Colossians 2-3, is the Christian, raised via the Spirit through faith, is seated with Christ in Heaven spiritually. We are born of a divine birth from above.

I felt I kept sinning no matter how hard I tried not to, and my relationship with God was suffering as a result. I felt shame. I cried out to the Lord about this, and one day, I suddenly had a vision. <br><br>I saw four fields rapidly flash before my eyes. <br><br>The first field was verdant and green, bursting to the brim with vegetation far as the eye could see, yet what grew there were the worst sorts of plants - thorns, thistles, brambles, and everything which would make it impassible, uncontrollable and undesirable. <br><br>The second field, which was the same field (all four fields were the same field in differing states), was the same field with the same plants, yet rather than being healthy and green, they were all yellow and dead. <br><br>The third field was barren. It had only soil, with little sign of vegetation. <br><br>The fourth field was full of every healthy and beautiful thing you could hope for. It looked the way anyone would want a good field to look, and beautifully green. <br><br>As soon as the vision passed (it was very quick). The Holy Spirit gave me the interpretation wordlessly. The field is the heart of man - his mind, soul, or whathaveyou. The first, undesirable, state is achieved very simply. As you live your life, there are seeds of sin everywhere. You will encounter them whether you want to or not, generally speaking. Those that water those seeds, by practicing the sins or dwelling on them, water the weeds of the field. In the end, their spiritual state is as tangled and unhealthy as that field.<br><br>The second state, the undesirable field of dead plants, comes by actively refusing to practice habitually your sins or to dwell on sin, yet the seeds still fall in the soil, and though unhealthy, over time the plants grow. Something must be done about them. <br><br>The third field is what happens when a person obeys the Word, &quot;takes every thought captive,&quot; even uprooting sins in their life.<br><br>(3/4)", "time": 1674792803, "resto": 33935993}, {"no": 33940738, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)23:17:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33940710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33940710</a><br>The fourth field is achieved by replacing those seeds of sin with righteous things.
