As for singular tasks, Michael is going to burn away the negative energy from you and traces of her from all of your various energetic bodies. Raphael will be doing the healing and repair work on your energetic bodies.<br><br>---<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here&#039;s a step-by-step method to call upon and inform them of how to perform the task.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Take a look at each sigil / symbol for a minute or two each. It&#039;s your choice whether you want to actively visualize it in your mind&#039;s eye; imagination or look at it long enough to let it sink into your subconscious. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. When finished looking at the sigils, begin to perform breathing exercises. Breathe in deeply, holding it for however many seconds is right for you, and then breathe out. Repeat this as many times as needed until you feel calm enough to continue. 3 to 5 times usually works well for myself and others I&#039;ve done this with.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One common method people use is breathing in for 4, holding for 4, breathing out for 4, holding for 4, repeating this process until satisfied in being calm enough.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. In calling for Michael and Raphael, intonate their name (a.k.a. specifically pronounce each syllable in a chanting-like manner, slowly and with emphasis) as many times as you feel are needed. I tend to go with 3 and it seems to work well enough.</span><br><br>(1/3)", "filename": "Screenshot_2021-02-27-03-52-02-1-5-1-1-1_0 (1)", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675428001744863, "time": 1675428001, "md5": "L2eQxVNK2H+CzMtC1W/+PQ==", "fsize": 180977, "resto": 33991423}, {"no": 33996399, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:42:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33991423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33991423</a><br><a href=\"#p33996386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33996386</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The pronunciation for each is as follows:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Michael is MEE-KAI-YELL </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Raphael is RAH-FAH-YELL</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Give yourself a moment if needed, and then ask your request to both Archangels. State your intentions in a humble and gracious manner. Let it be naturally flowing and talk to them as you would another person. There&#039;s no particular script to follow. Just say what feels right, and let them know you appreciate them hearing you out along with being present. Coming from a genuine place in asking for assistance is what matters when coming into contact with them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plus, state that you appreciate that they will accomplish this task effectively. Being certain in what you want to occur for a task is important for these sorts of magickal operations.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. Grant them permission to contact you by any means necessary or is convenient, such as (but not limited to): Divination, Angel Numbers, Omens, Dreams, Synchronicities, etc.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. Once done saying what you feel needs to be said, say that they are free to leave or give them permission to stay. It&#039;s up for you to decide. You can also say for them come and go as they please, which is what I tend to do. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be sure to say that their permission to do so comes under the condition that they do not do harm to you, anyone you care about or are connected to and anyone in your physical vicinity. When it comes to Archangel Michael and Raphael, it is highly doubtful they will do so, yet you have to be precise in your wording with anything in magick.</span>", "filename": "Screenshot_2020-11-27-23-44-05-1-6-1-1-1_0_0", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675428147955668, "time": 1675428147, "md5": "ztcTjcLTCnEvPBMY4G90bQ==", "fsize": 267561, "resto": 33991423}, {"no": 33996435, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)07:51:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33991423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33991423</a><br><a href=\"#p33996386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33996386</a><br><a href=\"#p33996399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33996399</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7.

There are subtle things that aren&#039;t in most books, as an example, in Theravada Buddhism, only the ancient books like the Visuddhimagga explain siddhis and how to reach them as an extra side course with jhanas.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

Can I just point out that the entire concept of \u201cDivinely ordained war\u201d is so stupid.. why not \u201cdivinely ordained rock paper scissors\u201d? If, as Evola puts it, divine war is ordained and justified bc \u201cGod was called as a witness and would bestow his favor upon the victor\u201d then why not call God as a witness to a divinely ordained coin flip, and avoid the gruesome and pointless violence and bloodshed of war? The answer of course is because a rock paper scissors match or a coin flip would not appease the corrupted man\u2019s need for senseless violence to inflate their overgrown egos. and if it was a bloody battle that these brothers desired, could they not have fought it amongst themselves rather than sending thousands of men into battle to kill one another under the justification of settling the dispute for them?? absolutely ridicoulous that Evola fails to see the hypocrisy and senselessness of it all.<br><br>Although Evola does credit the terms of this specific battle as being more civil and humane than most, since they agreed to not loot and pillage, and also they agreed to care for wounded soldiers; the problem is that he begins with the faulty axiom that men must do war in the first place, so therefor it\u2019s best that they do war in the spirit of the Gods. Why not strive for a higher ideal of man and society tho? I\u2019d be more impressed with a philosopher that stated outright and clearly: \u201cIf men must do war simply for war&#039;s sake, then take no part in it, instead go your own way.

Your entire write-up is built on an erroneous foundation anyways: the idea of the &quot;Holy War&quot;, or that there is metaphysical meaning in martial prowess, did not originate with Evola or any of the traditionalists. First off, a warrior &quot;creed&quot; that abided by a higher law was central to the warrior caste in every traditional civilization. Samurai, Knights Templar, Teutonic Order, The Kshatriyas, I could go on and on. Secondly, this phenomenon was not the result of the ruling classes propaganda like you are claiming, as if the kings in these societies made up a bunch of wacky spiritual stuff to justify war. To these men, combat was something that resembled a spiritual experience: overcoming fear of death and all human instincts of self-preservation. Aligning oneself with an &quot;unshakable courage&quot; that is the foundation of illumination as the Buddhists said. Combat was a &quot;contest&quot; in the highest stakes game known to man.

So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall.

Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

Violence IS NOT prohibited by the Golden Rule. Treating others how I want to be treated completely allows for the justification of a well-deserved asswooping. If someone were to infringe on my personal boundaries or physically assault me or my loved ones, it is in their best interest that i stand up for myself and do everything in my power to take control of the situation and teach them that there are consequences to violating the Golden Rule themselves. if I were to be unjustly transgressing on someone else&#039;s wellbeing, it is in MY best interest that i be taught a lesson, be that thru physical or social consequences for my shitty behavior. <br><br>When you choose the golden rule as your highest virtue, you intrinsically develop a sense of right/wrong that is not able to be manipulated by the trends of the times. what is best for your wellbeing is to respect others in the same way you expect to be respected. if you dont want another person to force their worldview upon you by means of manipulation and/or physical force, youre not going force your worldview on them by means of manipulation and/or physical force. As soon as the Golden Rule is violated by either party, the transgressor has immediately opened themselves up to whatever consequences are necessary to correct that specific behavior, and as long as those consequences themselves do not violate the Golden Rule, they are justified.<br><br>obviously there are subtle nuances to the Golden Rule, and its not always quite as black and white as the examples i provided above, but the paradigm IS robust enough as a guiding principle of one&#039;s life to act as compass pointing them towards the kingdom of heaven.", "filename": "the golden rule", "ext": ".gif", "w": 780, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675205268706338, "time": 1675205268, "md5": "wLWrl/qL403PHBgBzUi9lQ==", "fsize": 121461, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33976826, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:52:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33975973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33975973</a><br>Look dude, I don&#039;t have the time or patience to respond in several successive posts to everything you said.

You seem to focus a lot on hypothetical circumstances where the ruling class is corrupted and feeding out lies to its military for its own purposes. While I would never claim that this has never happened, such an attitude of the royalty represents a deviation from the primordial &quot;soul&quot; that animates a civilization during its apex, its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, or when it can be truly considered &quot;traditional&quot; from the point of view of the perennialists. When this happens, it represents a decline in the quality of that civilization. In a type of civilization that is more aligned to this primordial purity (which is absolutely a real thing, the only thing might I add that can be said to bestow legitimate power onto a being or entity, being itself ultimately synonymous with God), war has an entirely different character than what you&#039;re describing, and is not embarked on recklessly in pursuit of material gain, for desire of material wealth already represents the decline of royalty.<br><br>There are certain peoples that are by their inherent nature more prone to violence and martial action.

Insider Here. The US government has predicted war with China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia by 2025. This is known. What&#039;s not known is that the US government also predicts a general internal collapse in the US caused by an ongoing covert war between the various factions in the intelligence community and military. This in an ongoing, internal conflict that has been waged since WW2 without anyone&#039;s knowledge. They have given me intel that says the US will eventually either be invaded or collapse internally because of the US-Israel alliance. This dates back to a secret Masonic-Judaeo agreement conducted in 1782 at the congress of Willhelmsbald. Because I know this I have been subjected in the last week to a highly sophisticated psychological weapons system that operates through synthetic telepathy. This is actually a real program and not conjecture. I am writing this message to tell you that you need to leave America if you are aware of the NWO because the DOJ has put everyone&#039;s name in a case management system and has a perpetually rotation ranking system of all high value targets who do not go along with the mainline US foreign policy. If you are on this website it&#039;s a high likelihood you are in this database. Everyone needs to get long-term, paid visas to Asia and escape before any of these potential wars or collapses happen.

They are mainly just an intelligence gathering agency that gathers and analyzes signals intelligence from communication and electronic devices. iirc the NSA does have its own police force, but they usually defer the intelligence to other intel or law enforcement agencies who are designed to conduct action and countermeasures against whatever threats. As for the CIA, while we have the resources to conduct covert action, the Agency is limited by the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act in which conducting any espionage or &quot;psyops&quot; like you say would be a federal crime, since many of the people on 4chan are US citizens. I&#039;m not gonna say we do or don&#039;t, I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s technically very illegal and there have been people who have gone to prison for that. The NSA is actually supposed to get a FISA warrant just to be able to put a US citizen under surveillance but after 9/11 the president said fuck the warrants they can spy on whenever they want whenever they want. <br><br>IF AND IF there is a type of psyops being conducted on American citizens, whether it be gaslighting or whatever, my theory is that there&#039;s a completely off-the-books agency that isn&#039;t public knowledge like the rest of the alphabet orgs that do it. Since they don&#039;t technically &quot;exist&quot; unlike the CIA, there&#039;d be less legal risks for them to do something like that.

I&#039;m sorry, Tripfag-kun. You can get a bit of an idea of what we were doing there just by googling stuff.

Same ballpark at least. <br><br>What I can tell you is that it was a massive failure. HUGE ass failure. Legit the lowest point in my career, and I had just moved up in the gs pay scale before getting transferred there. It ended badly for mostly everyone deeply involved. The head of the Far East division even lost his position and later retired. A lot of us were moved around. <br><br>I got btfo from the far east completely and got stationed in West Africa and spent over a year doing really menial low-intensity intelligence work in Ghana. My salary was still the same, but any hopes or chances I had of climbing the corporate ladder or getting paid more were pretty much crushed for the most part. It&#039;s gotten a little better now but HK was a big regret of mine and left a sour taste in my mouth. I really wish I would&#039;ve just turned it down and requested to be stationed somewhere else.

And maybe this would apply to HK, too?<br><br>As in, the purpose of the Taiwan Independence movement is to create a Taiwan without the ROC China in the name of the country. Taiwan until recently still held fantasies of taking back the mainland and had a Mongolian Affairs board/etc. I think China under this posture, of Taiwan being the legitimate government of China, but still claiming to be culturally Chinese, was mostly happier with the Taiwan status quo, because at least Taiwan did not want a *cultural* divorce from China, if that makes any sense. I also think the DPP Party of Taiwan is essentially all baizou with tearing down statues of Chaing Kai Shek and wanting to not display the old KMT flag, etc, they remind me of leftist liberals in USA in that manner. The DPP also has overall decreased civil liberties in TW as well, in the name of freedom and democracy. So Taiwanese Independence movements seemingly want a Taiwan totally culturally divorced from China, and this is why China is angry, not so much from the government, as even Deng Xiaopeng said &quot;Who cares if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice?&quot;<br><br>I actually envision China less as wanting direct governence over all of its old provinces, but more wanting a sphere of influence and creating a sort of Culturally Chinese Union of sorts, combining Taiwan, HK, Singapore, and even Vietnam in their sphere of influence, and China is more upset at the divorce of those countries from Chinese culture and identity than the actual governments? <br><br>Just my thoughts, am I stupid?", "time": 1675354664, "resto": 33982031}, {"no": 33989643, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)12:18:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33989295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33989295</a><br>You&#039;re not stupid, anon-kun. But to answer your question, I believe the PRC cares far more about the governance and reclamation of Taiwan rather than the culture. Maoism is still very popular among the CCP members in China and Mao&#039;s cultural revolution was all about purging the old culture which he deemed to be anti-socialist and in doing so he destroyed a lot of ancient chinese art, literature and desecrated historical sites. The modern day CCP probably isn&#039;t as zealous as he was about getting rid of the old culture, but they are still supportive of a society where the sociocultural views are in line with Mao-ish ideals and the more modern CCP ones. They claim to be a &quot;socialist democracy&quot; but this is bullshit they are basically just authoritarian modern communists. <br><br>They reason they haven&#039;t gone to shit like the former Sovief Union is mainly cause they&#039;re a little more loose with their communism unlike the Marxist brand and allow private ownership of businesses and enterprises but they are still nothing close to democracy and its laughable how they refer to their system as a democratic one. <br><br>As for the SAR of HK and Macau, I think they are generally somewhat accepting of the &quot;one country two systems&quot; policy. Basically they&#039;re way cooler with that policy in comparison to Taiwan&#039;s self-sovereignty, which is like &quot;fuck that&quot; to them. However Hong Kong has been had (lol nignog grammar) it&#039;s problems in government, and while it&#039;s a true form of democracy, they&#039;re steadily getting worse. Also the PRC, while sorta cool with 1country2systems will gladly take an opportunity to exert more control over the SARs if its presented to them. Xi Jinping probably got semi-erect when he slapped the Hong Kong National Security Law on them in 2020. Also even before that they were trying to get an extradition bill passed in the SARs allowing them to basically grab any fugitives they wanted from the custody of these territories before us evil capitalist can get em!", "filename": "1675235914914489", "ext": ".png", "w": 416, "h": 416, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675358281679481, "time": 1675358281, "md5": "sSq/NVH/EdgMHKxXaWONAw==", "fsize": 192216, "resto": 33982031}, {"no": 33989672, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)12:25:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33989643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33989643</a><br>Also just want to add that despite the tone of my posts and me LARPing as a glowie I am not some extreme democracy shill who gets aroused when they hear &quot;yuuh government for the ppl!&quot;<br><br>But I do highly agree with Churchill quote on democracy stating that &quot;democracy is the worst form of government aside from all the others that have been tried&quot;<br><br>Right now it&#039;s the best we got.

Eating sugar can feed the bacteria in your mouth that feeds on it and, along with tarter, becomes a film called plaque. The plaque will eat away at your enamel and irritate your gums, leading to oral problems down the line. While plaque may sound scary, everyone will deal with it in life. <br><br>Even healthy foods that are a part of a balanced diet, such as fruits and grains, contain sugar that affects bacteria and acid in your mouth. However, if you\u2019re following a keto diet, you cut out almost all foods that contain enough sugar to feed bacteria. Carbs are mostly responsible for all of the sugars in your bloodstream and mouth. You\u2019ll experience much less tooth erosion and decay if you aren\u2019t eating sugars. Of course, you still need to brush and floss regularly to keep your mouth healthy, but it\u2019s never wrong to reduce the factors that can harm you. <br><br>Less plaque also means fewer cavities. Sugars that stay on your teeth lead to dental decay. The bacteria that causes decay thrives in a sweet environment. Avoiding dietary sugars can reduce the likelihood of developing dental cavities. A low-carb diet without candy, sugary fruit, sugar-filled juices, baked goods, soda, and other similar foods/beverages can help to keep your mouth healthy. The ketogenic diet has high fat, lean meat, and limited carbs as part of their structure. There are practically no sugars in the diet, so it won\u2019t form cavities.", "time": 1675338651, "resto": 33982676}, {"no": 33988128, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:18:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33986793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33986793</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N-acetylcysteine Inhibits and Eradicates Candida albicans Biofilms</span><br>https://www.researchgate.net/public<wbr>ation/269109392_N-acetylcysteine_In<wbr>hibits_and_Eradicates_Candida_albic<wbr>ans_Biofilms<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coexistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa With Candida albicans Enhances Biofilm Thickness Through Alginate-Related Extracellular Matrix but Is Attenuated by N-acetyl-l-cysteine</span><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC7732535/<br><br><a href=\"#p33988003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33988003</a><br>Shame on you for claiming wrongful thing sand struck fear in people who could be helped by this protocol.", "time": 1675340301, "resto": 33982676}, {"no": 33988215, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:37:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33988003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33988003</a><br>make your point, a fair hearing", "time": 1675341477, "resto": 33982676}, {"no": 33988230, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:40:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "is sauerkraut a good thing to eat while being on the protocol?<br>I&#039;m been suffering from having stomach upset for 2 weeks while being on it, kinda scary.", "time": 1675341610, "resto": 33982676}, {"no": 33988249, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)07:44:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it possible that I contaminated my BSO bottle by drinking from it directly?<br>It tastes a little off now.<br>I would&#039;ve assumed that it&#039;s anti-bacterial.", "time": 1675341861, "resto": 33982676}, {"no": 33988463, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)08:29:32", "name": "Space Cowboy", "com": "<a href=\"#p33988215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33988215</a><br>Don&#039;t feed the troll.

Everything we perceive is basically the frequency of light (light speed is a frequency, basically how many units of distance you can travel in a second). So ... energy traveling at the speed of light can be perceived by us visually when an object absorbs that energy. There is no reason energy can&#039;t travel at frequencies other than the speed of light and it does (wifi, microwave oven, tv signals, etc.) and we perceive none of it, unless it is modulated into a frequency we can either hear or see via an electronic device, or in the event of a microwave oven, the frequency from the magnetron just so happens to be the molecular orbital frequency of H20 so the effect this frequency has on matter is perceivable by us. Touch, similarly is electromagnetic repulsion between similarly charged particles, if the particles don&#039;t contain a charge on a frequency in which interference can occur, than things can just pass through us.

There are different frequencies, but they stand for a different thing, and that is indeed oscillation but not of a total flickering of reality. Rather, there is an amplitude not recorded here.<br><br>You must realize the false sense some of scientific popular theories are built on first. It is common knowledge light exists in different forms beyond visible light, with infrared, ultraviolet, etc. up until gamma and such. The contradictions within the speed of light (inconsistent speed, relativity, etc.) are dismissed by elegantly making lightspeed the baseline for reality functioning and defining all else in respect to light&#039;s constant (above the quantum level). What if I told you though that spacetime matter&#039;s influence upon light was viewed in reverse by scientists trying to square this problem? Sound is considered vibration of particles, and travels faster through infinite density and slower through minuscule density. If matter is vibrating constantly due to being energized, and matter is viewed within a 4 dimensional and above nature as opposed to within a 3 dimensional view, it can be said that the &quot;density&quot; of any matter, including empty space, approaches infinity due to the inclusion of a dramatically larger dimensional axis. Light bends to the gravity of spacetime 3 dimensionally, but from an existential viewpoint all bends to the basic vibration of existence, throughout all of space. This vibration, even down to propositions such as string theory, is inherently the same as sound. Sound is faster than light is a key occult knowledge, and further that thought along a multi-dimensional axis is also &quot;sound&quot; in this sense. Light even is simply born and one manifestation of sound. <br><br>So, it is not that different dimensions are found at different flickers, but rather, different dimensions lie in different intensities of vibration of the universal plane along an additional axis to the 3 dimensional space (and isn&#039;t necessarily the time axis).", "filename": "1616162125343", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 689, "h": 517, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675407579438717, "time": 1675407579, "md5": "ZJ2RB+1isXFCM7x5oIKUWg==", "fsize": 58594, "resto": 33989728}, {"no": 33996073, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:02:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33992620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33992620</a><br>The clock speed of the universe.", "time": 1675422142, "resto": 33989728}, {"no": 33996080, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:03:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "would zero point be the constant/baseline frequency?", "time": 1675422238, "resto": 33989728}, {"no": 33996212, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:47:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33989728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33989728</a><br>Carrier wave is the term you are looking for.", "time": 1675424866, "resto": 33989728}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33995278, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:03:49", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I. just.

They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul.

When presented with an idea (for example, one of my areas is currently Intro to Economics), say, the Law of Demand which states that, all other variables being equal, in a market quantity of good demanded (QD) has an inverse correlation with the price (P) of the good: I will think about my observations and experience in the world and in markets. Do I see people buying more of a good, eggs for example, when they are cheap and less when expensive? Yes and I do the same. If a good is sold cheaper in A shop than B shop people will go to A shop. Do I see from my own experience that if prices of a good are too high then more will be supplied than bought, and there will be a surplus? Yes. And that if prices are too low than more people will buy than suppliers are suppling, and there will be a shortage? Yes.

Various classes and factions of Nephilim waged a brutal, possibly global war against each other which did involve the use of nuclear arms. <br><br>This war was part of a curse proclaimed by God against the Fallen Angels, by which they would watch their own offspring kill and destroy each other. This war preceded the flood itself. It seemed by the point of the war there were various types of Nephilim, mostly distinguished by how much Human blood was intermixed within them. Those with less were of a less human, more gigantic physicality, and those with more Human blood were well.. more human like. <br><br>Subsequently, you&#039;ll find fragments of the memory of this war in several pagan religions and various folk lores. For example, the conflict between the Olympians and the Titans which resulted in the death and imprisonment of the Titans, and the Aesir versus the Jotunn which resulted in essentially the same thing. It seemed that the more Human Nephilim won with the aid of advanced technology while the Nephilim more alike the Fallen lost. The Aryan texts such as those found in the Hindu religion seem to describe in quite alot of detail this war. <br><br>As for the different groups you find in mythology, I&#039;ll use the Greek pantheon as an example:<br>The Primordials of the Greek pantheon correspond to the Fallen Angels. The first generations of Nephilim to the Titans, and the diluted Nephilim to the Olympians. This gradual process of dilution with Human blood seems to be almost an almost universal theme in the various retellings of our history.<br><br>This age is the same age as Atlantis, and the flood was the younger dryas impact event which saw rapid (within weeks or less) melting of glaciers causing an almost 400 feet rise in sea levels and the absolute, immediate destruction of the civilization itself. <br><br>The demons people try to contact are more likely to be the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim and not the fallen.

Train yourself to believe she&#039;s into you, likes you and wants to fuck you, for example, and then go out to the date and just be chill and do and say whatever seems reasonable.

And I can show you why, it&#039;s actually quite simple when you think of it in this context:<br>Consider that game where you try not to think about something. Or in the case of &quot;the game&quot; where you&#039;re winning as long as you don&#039;t think about it.<br>Here&#039;s the trick: For you to not think X you must have X in your mind in order to act as the filter. Or think of it like a computer program. If I have a list of numbers and I want to filter out the number 5, I have to store 5 somewhere to use as the comparison filter.<br><br>So you have random thoughts that you don&#039;t identify for a couple of reasons. One is the above, your mind identifies shit it doesn&#039;t agree with and the thought occurs.<br>Another reason is that your mind always has a model of situations, so by simply being exposed to a negative thought over and over it&#039;ll pop into your head the next time because you&#039;re just expecting it.<br><br>If our civilization was healthy it would be trying to teach you this stuff, and to not worry about those thoughts. But instead there are those who want to make you identify with those thoughts so that you try even harder to &quot;filter&quot; them out, thus increasing your filter... And thus leading to even MORE of those thoughts because you need to be more aware of them in order to &quot;filter&quot; them.<br>So you end up fighting yourself and creating the very thing you&#039;re fighting. Thought Policing is extremely toxic. Don&#039;t do it.<br><br>Instead realize this - There is ALREADY a part of yourself that knows you don&#039;t identify with those thoughts, right? If there weren&#039;t then you wouldn&#039;t have made this thread.<br>So my advice to you is to empower THAT part of you (that&#039;s the real you), and ignore the thoughts that you already know you don&#039;t identify with anyway. You don&#039;t have to think counter-thoughts.

With the help of his intuition and guidance from the forces of heaven, he began to work to elevate people to their true potential and to oppose those who sought power over others.<br><br>As he continued on his journey, The Nobody began to see the results of his efforts. He watched as people around him began to awaken to their true potential and to understand the power of their own minds. He felt a growing sense of hope that the world could be changed for the better and that he would be able to help bring about this change.<br><br>However, just as The Nobody was starting to gain momentum, he was faced with a new challenge. He discovered that the satanists were not going to give up easily, and they would stop at nothing to maintain their power over the world. With a growing sense of fear, The Nobody realized that the battle was far from over, and that he would have to face the satanists in a final showdown.<br><br>The story ends with The Nobody standing on the brink of the final battle, unsure of what the outcome will be.

Most people simply don&#039;t do any work on themselves and thus remain in the dark.

It gave me a weird feeling like it was not enough people and too many strippers but I liked one of them a lot and I was really drunk so I spent a long time in a private session like a few hours. They asked me if I wanted any drugs and I asked for some coke and some MDMA. The MDMA did absolutely nothing so I figured just a sugar pill for some free money for them. After he took me to some hotel that was almost empty and we spent a couple hours there. Ok I know all very irresponsible what can I say I was very drunk and I&#039;ve never had great impulse control. It happened.<br><br>Ever since getting back things have been weird. The first night I woke up at 2am and was thinking to myself but was like a demons voice telling me I&#039;m going to Hell and laughing at me. It told me this entire world is just a soul farming factory, they create evil temptations for people and confuse them with this material world so that most end up losing their souls and having them harvested for the elites. I prayed but found myself confused if I should be praying to Jesus or if he&#039;s just in on the game, or the old Jewish god from before Jesus came but he seems to demand sacrifice. Like is the only way to avoid Hell to step on someone else and send them there instead? I just can&#039;t believe that won&#039;t have karmic consequences.<br><br>Anyway I fell asleep eventually and had the most vivid dream of my life. I watched an entire movie, it was called Greatest Story Ever Told and it was a modern adaptation of the Bible maybe a couple years old. It was very modern and well made but like it was from an alternate universe where the Bible belt controls the USA and it&#039;s culture and Hollywood. It was a cautionary tale and mostly like an anti LGBT propaganda film. The message was basically that God DOES hate fags and you better obey him and his ways.

Being able to visualize is a prerequisite for basically ANYTHING occult. The first thing you MUST do, is learn to use your mind&#039;s eye. You can learn this.<br><a href=\"#p33978153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33978153</a><br>Your senses are being called upon to conceptualize the horse. Maybe &#039;hallucination&#039; was too strong a word for people who can&#039;t do it (yet), nobody is literally seeing anything anywhere when they visualize. They are creating the image/scene/whatever conceptually in their head. Whether it&#039;s in its own conceptual space (there&#039;s that word again) or you overlay it onto reality is really beside the point, you&#039;re just placing the conceptual space you&#039;ve created &quot;over there.&quot; Seeing the horse in the valley behind closed eyes is literally the same function as putting a little tiny, mouse sized horse here on my floor and watching it prance about. (&lt; -- Hint, this is also how you make a tulpa.) Which is why the other anon is an idiot and visualization is a prereq. Concrete example right there.

I know that gravity as a theory is not exactly compatible with hollow earth, but you know what I mean. How do the inhabitants of inner earth stand on their feet? Is it more of a system of seperated caves with differing size or is it an inverted globe with no firmament, one in which you could raise up your head and instead of stars you would see the opposite side of the inner sphere many thousand miles away? Do they have a day/night cycle, considering that some models have an inner sun and some do not?

To understand pole shearing, you have to understand the basic geometry of a field. Fields are important because all observable physical phenomena adhere to the same rules as the field. <br>The shape of a field is toroidal as you likely already know; the donut shape with an infinitely small hole in the center. This donut shape comes about due to the behavior of the poles. The poles are acceleration vectors spinning in toward the center point. These poles define the function of gravity (being a total lack of a given magnitude of force) and the gravity &quot;action&quot; is what drives literally everything else. <br>The two poles (North, South) of any field spin opposite of each other in toward the center, but they do not stop at the center. The remnant of the motion is cast out the other side as magnetism, that meaning expansion. So the southern pole of any field is what pushes out the northern hemisphere of the expansion of that same field. The opposing pole directly mutes this effect, causing net interference between the inward acceleration that eventually defines the field shape. This shape is not an absolute thing though, but rather has a gradient of possible configurations. What determines these configurations is the power of the poles. By increasing spin, the power of the pole increases (power has nothing DIRECTLY to do with energy, as the poles lack appreciable energy in their magnitude/tier). As the pole&#039;s power grows, the expansion from the other side is further muted down. This causes a spinning mass to inevitably assume a ring shape as all the magnitude (where lesser fields can propagate) is squashed out toward the equator.<br>Take a look at the Sombrero galaxy for example, or Hoag&#039;s Object. Even spinning a bucket of water abides by this same principle which is fundamentally centrifugal motion. <br><br>TL;DR spinning fast or over a long time makes a given mass sort into layers of density and form rings.", "filename": "crash course", "ext": ".png", "w": 1041, "h": 783, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1675275623659755, "time": 1675275623, "md5": "QhvVmMDrc4gMMBtSTmEWwQ==", "fsize": 923543, "resto": 33981857}, {"no": 33982314, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)13:27:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33982267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33982267</a><br>I&#039;m not OP but like this?

Perhaps some of the luminescence is light from the Sun that is bent, carried along the &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;bands&quot; of the magnetic field, and trapped in the interior center (functionally a zero-point). This miniature false sun would function somewhat similarly to a lower magnitude of black hole, only operating on energetic levels, rather than massive levels; slowly leaking trapped light and electromagnetism back out as dull illumination and jettisoning more from the poles.

Weed is truly not dependable, but it has sweetness in its flavour. My question is if science and magic could ever turn to discovery of one another, and in such a way that it could be distributed as common knowledge.

This is as close as you can get into a 2nd density consciousness without actually being there, since if you truly go 2nd density, you won&#039;t remember a damned thing (like a sleepwalker).

I.e. sloth is sinful because it&#039;s embracing a lesser base good (resting, for instance) over a superior higher good (say, giving alms to the poor). What defines an evil act is when a person does an act that is embracing a lesser good over a greater good. To use an example a friend gave, if you are angry at someone and hit them then that is a sin because you&#039;re placing your personal sense of justice (and seeking justice is inherently a good thing, it is good to be just) over a greater good (reconciliation and forgiveness, or brotherly correction). This is important to understanding Hell, as we understand that committing evil acts disposes us to seek lesser goods over higher goods.<br><br>Secondly, what is Heaven? Heaven is the beatific vision. It is seeing the truth for what it is. It is seeing God directly and being in His presence. To the just man this is a fount of joy as the just man loves God and seeks to be in His presence. The just man is the man who has disposed himself to seeking the higher goods over the lesser goods: he avoids lust as a base, lower good in favor of prayer or earnest human companionship. He eschews gluttony in favor of restrained eating, so that he can have more to help others or to save so that he can raise a family (which in turn, fulfills another good: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply&quot; as the birth of more just ones gives glory to God and increases good in the world through *their* works). He seeks to serve God recognizing that our God is the highest good in Whom nothing is lacking and in Whom all good is plentiful. Who is goodness Himself. Thus the soul of a good disposition will flee to God&#039;s love even if he must at first go through purification of his minor sins (what we call Purgatory).", "time": 1675289438, "resto": 33966021}, {"no": 33983988, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)17:11:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33983980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33983980</a><br>Then what is Hell? Hell is the absence of God&#039;s grace. Are there punishments in Hell? Certainly, the withdrawal of God&#039;s grace, in absence of which a person cannot rise to do higher goods. There are punishments that vary based on sins and such and such. But understand this: Hell is chosen. The soul that is condemned to Hell chooses his place in Hell. He sees God in his final moments and even with the graces bestowed by our Lord at moment of death willingly jumps into the (essentially metaphorical) flames of Hell. The hardened sinner who chooses this is the person who has not disposed himself to seeking out greater goods. He has sought out lust over any other use of time. He has avoided Mass in favor of watching pornography. He has not seeked to serve God but to enjoy base pleasures of the material kind to their utmost. He therefore has chosen to avoid the highest good in favor of the least of goods. Why would a man who has for all his life seeked to separate himself from God now seek Him after death? He would have to give up his sin. He would have to accept God&#039;s Love over what he has chosen to love. He would have to finally give up all those little habits he has learned to seek over the very epitome of Beauty in front of him. Thus, he decides at moment of death to continue in his depravity, and that is what God grants him.
