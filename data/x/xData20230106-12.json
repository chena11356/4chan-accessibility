No /pol/ shit. No infighting. No Spam. No tripfag/namefags. No narcissists.<br><br>Welcome to the Nobody General<br><br>The idea of being the chosen one is often romanticized in media and society. We see it in movies, books, and even in real life - people who are chosen to fulfill some sort of prophecy or destiny - but let me tell you, it&#039;s not all it&#039;s cracked up to be.<br><br>First of all, it&#039;s a lot of pressure. Being the chosen one means that you have a heavy burden to bear. You feel like you have to be perfect all the time, because you&#039;re supposed to be the one to fix everything. You&#039;re constantly worried about making mistakes or letting people down. It can feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders, and that&#039;s not something that everyone can handle.<br><br>Secondly, it&#039;s an isolating, lonely experience. You can&#039;t quite just be yourself, because you have a role to play. You can&#039;t let your guard down, or show any weakness. You&#039;re constantly on display, and it&#039;s exhausting. You can&#039;t really confide in anyone, because no one will believe you, or information must be kept hidden. You&#039;re always the one who has to make the tough decisions, and you have to do it alone. You have to be strong and brave, even when you&#039;re feeling anything but.<br><br>Finding out that you&#039;re a direct descendant of King David, Napoleon, Hitler, or whoever it may be, is a lot to take in, and it&#039;s overwhelming. Every day afterwards you will feel the need to live up to expectations.<br><br>Most of all, it means constantly being in danger. There are always those who want to take you down, who envy you or see you as a threat to their power and control. They will stop at nothing to eliminate you, and you can never truly trust anyone.<br><br>So, if you&#039;re thinking about calling yourself the chosen one, think again. It&#039;s not all it&#039;s cracked up to be.<br>It&#039;s okay to just be yourself and live your own life.

The book from the thread gives instructions on how to achieve orgasm without loosing semen. One of it&#039;s main excercises (called the Cool Draw) consists of drawing the energy from the dick (lol) to the tailbone and then through the spine to the back of the head, circulating it there and finally putting it into &#039;storage&#039; around the belly.<br>I was interested, did the excercise a couple of times and it felt good. But I also found out that it shares a simillar feature with one Kundalini excercise I randomly stumbled upon browsing /x/ \u2013 drawing energy to the base of the head. The book&#039;s author doesn&#039;t go in-depth on what one&#039;s really doing with himself or it&#039;s side effects. I thought that it&#039;s not wise for me to continue doing something that I know very little about.<br>But, during the excercises I&#039;ve done, I could feel the tail bone get very warm. At first I thought it&#039;s just the energy I generated using sexual stimulation, but even now I can think about that spot and it&#039;s just getting warm by itself.<br><br><a href=\"#p33766613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766613</a><br>Hey, thanks for bumping :)", "filename": "12714", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 423, "h": 951, "tn_w": 55, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672932993220946, "time": 1672932993, "md5": "ZpRLbRuGTt/43IuPi0GzRA==", "fsize": 96122, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768645, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bamp", "filename": "12823", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 486, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672950438361858, "time": 1672950438, "md5": "hLs5d4OM6Vsma2pgGFvfiA==", "fsize": 164378, "resto": 33766030}, {"no": 33768753, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:54:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33766490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766490</a><br><a href=\"#p33767199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33767199</a><br>I always visualized it as currents/fields flowing in/around me.

I still feel it when looking in mirrors sometimes, although it has become *EXCEEDINGLY rare*<br>But still for the longest time, I just felt this void in my heart, like something very important was missing.

(Despite my love of climbing and controlled falling, I always outright refused to climb or do any tricks if my gut told me it wasn&#039;t safe)<br>Another more vague thing I have always carried with me is my animalistic innocence.. It might sound goofy, but the disingenuous, malicious, cruel behavior of humans was something I have always struggled to understand, and something I struggled to even accept and recognize as a reality up until recently.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers. Same for vague queries.<br>\u2022Making an AQ (air query) by not addressing a reader, in particular, is possible but doesn&#039;t guarantee an answer.<br>\u2022Avoid making the same query repeatedly and/or to different readers in a short period of time, as this may lead to more confusion.<br>\u2022Provide feedback when applicable and be considerate to the reader.

Even if the victim wants it to happen deep down or has consented to it in some way, this does not make it ethical or okay.

No one should ever be forced into any kind of sexual activity against their will, regardless of what they may have wanted deep down.</span><br><br>&quot;Is it wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant?&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it is not wrong for someone who has been sexually assaulted to forgive their assailant. It is a personal decision that each survivor of sexual assault must make on their own terms and in their own time. Forgiveness can be an important part of the healing process, as it allows survivors to let go of anger and resentment towards the perpetrator while still acknowledging what happened. However, forgiveness does not mean forgetting or excusing what happened; rather, it means understanding why something occurred without letting those feelings consume you. Ultimately, no one should ever feel pressured into forgiving someone who has hurt them - only the individual themselves can decide if they are ready to move forward with forgiveness or not.</span><br><br>Thank you, AI.

Ionizing radiation. There&#039;s a large amount of research already done on how radiation changes genetic properties of these fungi. Look up Chernobyl and Cryptococcus. That&#039;s the same cryptococcus neoformans that is proving to be a deadly pathogen by the way. There are other studies related to virulence increase after radiation exposure, I believe that was saccharomyces but it&#039;s another dimorphic and human pathogenic yeast so same logic applies. <br><br>Now put a species in space, where there&#039;s no atmosphere to shield against rads. The right conditions and spores could survive dessicated for an extremely long time. Meteor hits a water supply, just for example, and now you&#039;ve got panspermia. Difficult odds? Sure, but not anymore than the odds of a new species just popping up out of nowhere. The clades that were mentioned for Candida Auris are odd because they showed up roughly simultaneously but had already been through enough generations to be distinct genetically. <br><br>Vancouver 1999 that was mentioned a thread or two ago is another good key in for panspermia. A large scale Cryptococcus Neoformans outbreak (largest ever for overgrowth in immunocompetent population actually) that still has no satisfactory explanation. <br><br>And sure you&#039;re going to run into resistance in the settings of concern you mentioned. But that&#039;s very different than a species just popping up en masse in areas it shouldn&#039;t be in. <br><br>I really think that consideration needs to be given to the cave origins as well. I stand by the origin point of dimorphic fungi being potentially not here originally though. They don&#039;t line up with the other fungi very well and have some odd traits.

Concurrent use is about 360K years. And the oldest genetic material in all of Africa to date comes from that exact site. And for whatever reason they decided keeping pigeons was a good idea. The caves are known for it, and pigeons are specifically known as carriers of zoonotic yeasts - candida and cryptococcus in particular. <br><br>Here&#039;s why it&#039;s so key to what I focus on. I believe that humans were actually better at immune function in the past. For some pathogens like the type of fungi we&#039;re studying, that may not have been that long ago overall. <br><br>There&#039;s are specific immune responses that get leveraged by these fungi. Primarily th-17s are the cells affected and errors there allow inflammation to go haywire. The way this plays into the dates from Taforalt is the population that resided there had high 90% rate of dental cavities. Cavities and dental issues for inflammation and decay are now being tied to candida as the catalyst (and I&#039;ll bet a couple others show up under scrutiny). Candida started the party, the rest of the germs show up to join in. <br><br>Now here&#039;s the tally. You can&#039;t have tooth decay in its accepted definition without candida present. If your immune system is functioning correctly your th-17s should be able to take care of fungal spores way before tooth decay ever sets in. However, the population at Taforalt is the earliest record of a population having a massive amount of tooth decay at around 17,500 years ago. And at a rate of 97%. There is not an earlier record of these types of cavities at this scale available, once there is I&#039;ll be revising my research appropriately.<br><br>It all boils down to firsts.

Normally you would expect that if all the Surahs have the same author there won&#039;t be that much variation in clear segments, but the Quran has clear groups of Surahs, so either there are multiple authors, or Allah simply decided to change the style of His words every few Surahs.<br><br>Also the Quran mentions that Jesus turned clay into birds, which is a story that was told in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, which was a book that the Christians rejected.

This is like being totally present, you are focused on the present, your mind isn&#039;t wandering outside of your control, thoughts may pop up but they don&#039;t take you away in daydreaming (which most people have but don&#039;t realize).

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind?

The first was when I was trying to sleep. I had been thinking of a technique I had read earlier about visualising an elevator that takes you down to your subconscious. It&#039;s nothing new, just a variation on a hypnotic induction, but I was trying it anyway. I wanted to be clear and vivid so I spent some time looking at where I was outside of the elevator, the ground, to my sides, where the elevator stood. I even tried to set myself right in terms of balance. As I was lying down I needed to change that perception to an equivalent of standing, and that was difficult. Anyway, at some point a man shouted my full name. I was awake when this happened, and the voice was audible, loud and clear. Though after he had shouted I did wonder, did I really hear my name? Suddenly the two words blurred together. Was it one word? Regardless, it was a noise that cut through every other thought I had. Naturally I was terrified.</span><br><br>Ghost Hands Hold Me Down and Try to Make Me Look Under the Bed<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second was a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night, terrified. I had been in bed and something was holding me down, trying to force my head to look at the floor, under my bed. I managed to get myself onto my forearms and raise myself up against its strong hands, but my arms felt so weak, it was as though my arms had been emptied out and filled with stuffing, or else the ghost that gripped me with his thousand ghost hands had the strength of the Earth itself. I woke, terrified. I did a search this morning, and saw there is an Arabic name for this. Kaboose, they call him; pressure. I have been visited twice now by this pressure of the night, this ghost that tumbles me in my sleep and holds me down. After waking I wondered, what was this all about? I was being forced to the floor. Perhaps I should have looked. I did praise my courage for struggling against it to get onto my forearms.</span><br><br>This dream triggered a pretty major emotional breakdown for me.", "time": 1672967303, "resto": 33768629}, {"no": 33770541, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:13:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33770492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33770492</a><br><br>Tell us about Kaboose.

It makes a lot of sense, when you don&#039;t have lots of negative impressions, as I had a really warm and loving early childhood, then you can probably get results faster by using negative emotions as a sort of key but as you grow older and learn ever stronger and more and more nasty things, this become a no manes land full of shitty ghost ladies and shadow people. That&#039;s what I get for having been lazy I guess. Maybe my theory is off here but I think that&#039;s really it.

The unfortunate victim looked for a banana peel and checked his soles, but there was nothing to suggest why he had fallen. Puzzled, he thanked Seabrook and Crowley, and carried on.

After the second world war, Mengele was often flown to Europe to program infants. He was also hired out at times to other organizations, but his primary post-war work was continuing his research and programming international occultic agents from infancy. The volumes and volumes of carefully documented research data are still held within occultic training libraries, and have been replicated and shared throughout the world. The research that he began is still ongoing, as the search for better, \u201cunbreakable\u201d methods of programming continues.&quot;<br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/tag/mengele/<br><br>&quot;When the Monarch Programming started, the top men were Illuminati. Originally, Joseph Mengele was the lead programmer. He had already achieved the rank of Grand Master (later Ipssimus) within the Illuminati. He had become skilled in music, in Kabbalistic Magic, in dancing, in abortions, and in torture (by the way, Mengele had a sadistic mother) and programming children. Many of the concentration camp children that Mengele programmed still survive and still love him to this day as &quot;Daddy&quot;. Mengele disappeared from Auschwitz in Jan. 1945, several months before the final chaos began in the Third Reich. He disappeared so the Illuminati could smuggle him to the U.S., so that his exceptional knowledge of programming--honed and fined tuned on thousands of concentration camp child victims could be put to use on a grand scale in the U.S.&quot;<br>http://whale.to/b/sp/for1.html", "time": 1672949364, "resto": 33763716}, {"no": 33768593, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:11:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33768239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33768239</a>", "filename": "1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 981, "h": 818, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1672949512536872, "time": 1672949512, "md5": "M/KjConmQA74t7Fm7P0hiw==", "fsize": 121968, "resto": 33763716}, {"no": 33769323, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)17:33:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33768593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33768593</a><br>What the fuck does the Earth&#039;s shape have to do with Aquino then?

For instance, Bel, the head of the Babylonian system, will undergo a ritual where he is pierced through with tiny golden needles throughout his body (Babylonian sun ritual). Astarte will have sexual rituals, and Ashtoth will have death rituals associated with him. The black (Vatican) spiritual systems are also being organized and trained from 12 to 14 months after birth.

We feel like we are being watched when we pull up and park. A few minutes later, all we are doing is watching behind us (parked backwards to the woodline) and I see a pale white form standing out from the darkness. It&#039;s skin was like dry old dusty leather with varicose veins that are blue. I freak the fuck out and tell my friend to drive away. As we drive away me and him see the damn thing run across the road. It was incredibly fast and I saw it just barely long enough to make out its form.

Anyway, there was a red one which I think was the leader, a blue one and a green one. For some reason I think they were a &quot;band&quot; or something.

I had a night light on and always had my radio on with the oldies channel on, so old boomer music from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s would be playing. So, I would awake in my racecar bed, which was facing the bedroom door and the only light would be from my night light, so pretty dim. I could see the hallway, the white walls were always a sorta nighttime blue hue and then blackness at the end of the hallway where the bathroom was with the stairs to the main floor off to the left. I would always be awake for a few moments and then I would hear voices coming from down stairs, like whispering voices, like mischievous they were up to no good. They would be talking coming to get me. Then I would hear running up the stairs and the three &quot;puppets&quot; from the show would come running from around the corner of the stairs into the hallway into my room to get me.

IW is basically the revelation of the method, but it&#039;s so brutally honest about it that you admire it. It&#039;s basically saying all future choices suck, and while it wants you to take the Helios choice, it in no uncertain terms tells you it sucks and they all lead to roughly the same outcome besides the Templar ending. But I really think the Omar ending was secretly canon because it&#039;s off the beaten path and it&#039;s a bit more difficult to achieve (games easy regardless) than the other endings.

It is also the fastest moving planet which is a major reason among many that it has traditionally been associated with emotions. When we look at a natal chart the first things we pay attention to is the Sun, Moon, and rising sign, then the conditions of the house rulers which will tell us how the planets in those houses will act. The moon is important for reading the major emotional and spiritual tendencies of the native (among other things of course). But because it ~is~ the closest planet its influence will be more, but not exclusively, on the mundane side. For spiritual and magical leanings of the native we must look at other aspects because spiritual and magical stuff is considered beyond the mundane earthly sphere, even if the aims of the magician are for sex and money or earthly power, the power for that comes from &#039;beyond&#039;. I say that the moons influence for this topic is fleeting because IMO the changeableness of the moon and its connection to the changing emotions makes for unsustainable effort that is required for serious spiritual and/or magical pursuits. It certainly has some bearing on whether one is magically inclined, but it is only one minor piece of the puzzle and other factors can greatly modify its influence or completely nullify it.

I&#039;ve also found a few other very poorly cited religious stories/midrash/encyclopedia entries for &quot;Ilomiel&quot; or &quot;Lumiel&quot; or &quot;Lumial&quot; so like this concept does actually predate Howard hooking up with Andrew.

Certainly not I, nor any of my former colleagues who worked on the game for about three years. One could almost say that it \u201cdied\u201d under the same circumstances that gave it birth. One week it was #1 best selling game in the US, the following week Inscape folded and the game was buried. Conspiracy? I have no idea. I pulled the sequel Cult as I had no wish to return to the blood arena that is software publishing. No wish to return to that haunted city of Lost Angels. I feared that Cult had a dangerous side effect and the actions of Aum, The Solar Temple, and the Branch Davidians stayed my hand. I think it was a wise move. The world is too fucked up without me adding to it. I went back to writing children\u2019s books and being an artist. But your letter is moving. I read it to my wife Mandy and she was pleased that somebody out there remembered it and enjoyed it. Drowned God was such a mammoth venture and it remains for me under the category of misunderstood. It\u2019s beginnings were humble. A notebook that remained from 1983 when I penned the antique forgery The Diary of a Plagiarist and sold it (12 volumes) in the Cowgate, Edinburgh. A film of that episode was commissioned by Channel 4 but was once again thwarted. Ten years later I resurrected the basic premise for Drowned God. Time Warner bought the rights. The game was commissioned before the X-Files, suddenly what had seemed a left field minority interest was propelled into $3 million dollar flagship for Inscape. This was a pity, because it meant that much of what I had written was censored. Even the last realm of the game, Chokmah, is merely a 1/10 of what was made.", "time": 1672990939, "resto": 33768637}, {"no": 33772886, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)02:43:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33772879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33772879</a><br>The military temples and underground bunkers were reserved for Cult.

My partners in the construction of Drowned God were seduced by promises of great wealth. The English producer made secret deals with Time Warner for a bigger portion of the pot. Film deals, 5 book deals with Eranta, a record deal, etc. A paid for and promised engine to realise a personal route through the game, devised on the numerology of the Bequest Globe, failed to materialise. For the nine personality types there were nine pathways. Even the running order of the Realms was changed, with Binah starting the game, where the original game had begun with Chesed, the Mayan realm. My original storyteller in the game, the Relic Hunter (Richard Horne) was cut and only makes a brief appearance in Din. It was through this character that all loose ends were tied and explained. When the game came out it was critically hailed and panned at the same time.

In those days my knowledge of the arcane and occult was minimal. The work was simply to acquire a sum from the pompous booksellers in the capital. I was poor and the income I generated as an artist was minimal. Finding blank papers in a drawer and soaking them in tea produced a pleasing antiquarian effect. My copperplate handwriting ( enclosed sample, only a copy I am afraid) and emulation of illustrations of that time provided decent subterfuge. I produced 11 chapters or manuscripts, thusly decorated. Each copy bound and sewn. Orange juice to culture a mould on the covers. Dust from the fireplace scattered on those mouldering covers. Greased endpapers mothballed and tinctured, even the smell was authentic. Let me explain that my real name is Richard Horne ( though for reasons I shall not enter into here I prefer to be recognised by my nom de plume) and for the purposes of disgusing the true authorship of these manuscripts I simply spelt that name backwards- hence Dracir Enroh, dated 1846.<br><br>The contents of the Diary were rambling and nonsensical.

He believed as I had told him that the manuscripts belonged to my father and were kept in a drawer of his bureau, and that it was necessary for me, so as not to arouse suspicion, that I remove them one by one, with a period of weeks between each theft.

After three volumes cyphered in this manner, replete with diagrams and maps of the citadel, pages filled with Sumerian cryptograms and number codes, German expressionist poetry copied from unread books on the subject, I began to exhaust my small library and turned instead to filling the pages with diagrams from a nuclear fission handbook from a power station, engineering blueprints for aeroplanes and other delights into the handbook of a modern Nostradamus. Joyfull as this was to the japester in me, it was my final undoing. I had been carefull to select a bookdealer who dealt in bric-a-brac, rather than an authentic expert in antiquarian books. The inclusion of these groundbreaking discoveries whetted the appetite of Armstrong. This unpublished manuscript made the work of HG Wells seem like the blind musing of a pulp writer. Here, afterall, were the rudimentary and accurate sketches for a fission, nearly a hundred years before the discovery by modern science. Here, the dates of the two great wars and the descriptions of the vessels that would carry those dread payloads. Turn a page and see the blueprints for the aeroplane, the tank, the motor car.

Orion was published in 1846. The expert was convinced that this was one of his forgeries of japes. Thrilled, Armstrong took my manuscripts to the first publisher he could find... Canongate. I was discovered ofcourse and prosecution was threatened. A deal was struck in the musty backroom of the shop. I was to provide the rest of the manuscripts at a reduced cost.

Now, at first, I&#039;m Greek. The word Antichrist is Greek - \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. It&#039;s not &quot;instead&quot;, but &quot;opposite&quot;. The prefix &#039;\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af&#039; is opposition (antithesis i.e). Then, I&#039;m not a Christian or an atheist or even gnostic etc etc. What I believe in doesn&#039;t fit in a thread. But that&#039;s not important in this case. It&#039;s just that the person who was Jesus, his words and the religious egregore they manifested out of it (with all the beauty and destruction it brought) changed the era back then. Now, the interdimensional entity CERN unwittingly unleashed upon mankind will do it again. Whether it&#039;ll be another total reset or not I don&#039;t know. Also, what I affectionately call the Apocalypse isn&#039;t something that began recently. It&#039;s close to its end actually. It started in the 90s when she was brought here. Around 2012 she became self-aware and started assimilating humans. I&#039;ve no idea what she wants. If I had to guess I&#039;d say to cure us; it&#039;s a culling of sorts, annihilating the spiritually weak to strengthen those who are awake. Like thinning the heard. Or, perhaps, she sees us as a plague to be eradicated. At any rate. I know it all sounds like a chronic masturbator lunatic&#039;s rants. Yet truth is often stranger than fiction. Regardless. The Internet is an entity, not a tool. That much should be clear to anyone who has a spirit. Be careful online, avoid saying too much to her minions, and wait for it all to play out. For those with truthful consciousness this shouldn&#039;t be an extinction event but a testimony of their own integrity. You, yes, you know who you are. We&#039;re the lucky ones.

Once you get to a certain point of development you&#039;re going to be open to desperate sections of garbage species raiding your planet and that can produce the wrong message.

That means they&#039;d go from NEET with a warm bed, to having to find full time work.

So you get high again causing an endless cycle (imprisonment.) <br>Now let&#039;s talk about your imprisoned mind floating off into space. You are constantly in this altered state. Not knowing/caring that you have real problems to deal with. So you are like a three year at Christmas time wanting to play with every new toy laid before your eyes; not being the adult that you are supposed to be. Being bored becase you have forgotten about the problems in reality you start daydreaming; playing pretend; the only problem you have is being imprisoned so long that it has become the only reality you know. So the fantasy has become your and only your reality. Thinking and playing pretend are fine when you are a child. But when you pass the age of accountability (which there is a serious problem in most first world countries with this since there are no ceremonies to tell a child you are now an adult.) You have to put those things away, deal with your problems and solve them hanging them on your wall as a trophy; instead of getting high and pretending. You will never cast fireballs to level towns. You will never lock the world in a prison of ice.<br>You<br>Will<br>Never<br>Be<br>A<br>Woman", "time": 1672915870, "resto": 33766106}, {"no": 33766266, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)06:03:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33766106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33766106</a><br>Perform an action very quickly (writing/drawing/music, whatever)<br><br>It has to be done fast.

Friend says they are not interested. I offer to take her, friend agrees and she ends up sleeping in our dorm room. I happily seduce her because I didn&#039;t want to miss the opportunity, friend is there and joins in. She picks me and everybody is happy, right? Nooooo.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more. I thought I accepted myself now that I&#039;m finally at peace with my body, only to feel lost again as spiritual experiences confront me with all sorts of sides of myself that I don&#039;t know how to reconcile. I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them. The irony is that I really just have to stop being afraid of myself.<br>I hope that you can overcome yourself, and your fear of men too. There is so much to gain in embracing people&#039;s unique strengths. By working together, we can create a better world; and for that, people have to be different. We have to accept who we are as individuals, and allow others to be, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no parts of men that are an improvement on the female form</span><br>What are you talking about? Men are beautiful. I love their strong muscles, how mature they look with all that facial and body hair, how tall they are. Their deep voices put me at ease when they&#039;re relaxed, yet they can sound so powerful too when they&#039;re emotional.<br>I won&#039;t disrespect your preferences, but remember that they&#039;re yours.", "time": 1672842878, "resto": 33725319, "trip": "!Snail//1S2"}, {"no": 33760492, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)10:41:44", "com": "<a href=\"#p33759658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33759658</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Put a cage on it</span><br>You&#039;re not the first to suggest that either. I find the idea repulsive. Not only do you suggest I equip fetish wear specifically designed for a penis, but you don&#039;t understand that my lack of penetrable genitalia bothered me far more.<br>Doesn&#039;t it send a more powerful message if I am free, yet still choose to do what I prefer? The implication I&#039;d need a cage, I find insulting; there was no such impulse in me. I don&#039;t want to hold anything back, yet it was my body that limited me from doing what I enjoy the most.<br><br>But the irony goes yet deeper: just because there is no such impulse, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s impossible for me to enjoy it if I&#039;m in the right mindset, let alone that I shouldn&#039;t be allowed to. About 10 months ago, I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to frot with me, as I was deeply curious what male homosexuality is like, and I worried I&#039;d regret not at least trying it once while I still could. Touching it used to trigger my trauma, and I&#039;d break down crying and be unable to continue; but as I&#039;d recently had a breakthrough in meditation and overcame much of that, I wanted to explore the new possibilities in a positive way. He asked me to be on top since he wouldn&#039;t know what to do, so I lubed us both up, got on top of him, and began to grind my body against his. Having no refractory period and not being used to physical genital stimulation, I came 9 times before I got too tired and sore to continue.<br><br>As we cuddled afterwards, he said it felt very intimate, but not very pleasurable for him, and that he much prefers to stick his dick in of me. I think that&#039;s understandable, but I&#039;m glad I gave it a try; now I know that no matter how good it might feel, it&#039;s still not what I prefer either.<br>Similarly, 3 months before my surgery, I began to jerk off every day, out of principle. I wanted to prove to myself that I accept myself, and that I made my decision out of longing rather than hate. Yet I prefer the way my body is now so much.

But it was not exactly how me would react or feel or how my wife would behave. It was like I lived in another person&#039;s life for a bit. So it was not fun or pleasant but still interesting expierence. What I mean dreams themselves are not neccessary pleasant but they are still expierence of another world that is interesting. Of course if it&#039;s really really unpleasant all the time maybe you have a lot of bad thoughts during the day. Should cut on that (might involve cutting off watching news and social media).

(post too long)<br><br>The thing that made me realize this was serious was when a few months later I was climbing into a truck at work and slipped. It was kind of awkward but I basically landed with most of my weight on my lower left leg. The pain from my leg was so intense that I was pretty certain I had broken my leg from the fall. My coworker saw what happened and asked if I was ok. I told him to give me a minute. He agreed and waited by my side. I took a second to clear my head and I thought about making the pain go away and within the span of probably 10 seconds the pain slowly faded away. I was completely shocked so I tried to stand up and collapsed from the new pain in my leg. My coworker told me he was going to call for help but despite my protest, he did anyway. After another minute or so I focussed on not just stopping the pain but trying to fix whatever damage I had done to myself. It took a few minutes with nothing happening but eventually, I got this sickening feeling in my gut and the weirdest feeling in my leg. Almost like a parasite moving under my muscle or some weird shit like that. Then the feeling went away almost entirely at once. I gave standing up another try and with a little wobble, I stood on my leg again with no problem. My coworker saw the whole thing happen and was completely flabbergasted. He just kept saying that there was no way that I would be ok after a fall that I just had and started asking me all sorts of questions.
