I was afraid to put myself out there. I&#039;ve never even once asked a girl on a date I didn&#039;t think I was good enough. Whenever I would daydream I would create a fictional character in my head to dream with.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

E.g. thinking of kindness as hard as we can won&#039;t generate good feelings and get rid of all of our anger. First we need to be patient and stick with basics, which may just be chanting or repeating phrases from the Karaniya Metta Sutta. Then we need to see what the results are of that over a period of practice. <br><br>I often compare it to Tai Chi. In the beginning we must learn basic choreography as well as postural basics. If we speed through the form without basics we can injure ourselves no matter how much we talk about &quot;moving meditation&quot; and &quot;flow&quot;. The basics must slowly, gradually, and patiently be developed over time. Then we find that the appearance of flow is only external, and the real internal stuff has to do with our mind and connection to the body, and what we do with that. At first it seems like a lot, but after continuous development it all comes together naturally.", "time": 1673981935, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33865782, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)14:20:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33865632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33865632</a><br>To simplify: If you&#039;re up in your head a lot, just try being more mindful of the body.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

My buddy shot up first, he took a huge shot, I mean, I don\u2019t know how he survived it. I took a small shot, almost 1/4 of what he did. I could hear him laughing while I fell off my chair onto the floor. I felt like I was falling for hours. Every time I said a word in my inner monologue I felt my soul fall deeper and it felt like it was being crushed, or like I was falling through weak floors, it hurt terribly. Finally I saw a light in the ceiling and my inner monologue started to scream towards the light, screaming the light got closer. Screaming in my head and clawing towards the light hurt worse than falling. I realized it was the rectangular light in the ceiling I was clawing my way towards. I could see it perfectly though my eyes were closed, it was pitch black, and the light, but the light was white and didn\u2019t emit light into the black. I felt myself being judged. I was being judged harshly and I felt my inadequacy, I felt deep shame, regret, and also fairness. I wasn\u2019t being judged unfairly. Then my eyes opened, i completely forgot where I was for about thirty seconds. I saw my friend dying and rushed to get him help. It must\u2019ve been a cardiac arrest or something from shooting up.

Sexual energy is the single closest manifestation of one&#039;s primal energy, pure from potential. This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there. You can literally consider your sexual proclivities as your &quot;energy signature,&quot; and yes, this is why when you go on nofap that signature signs brighter and women magically seem to notice you more.<br><br>In a kabbalastic representation, sexuality and sexual energy is often connected to Yesod, but the darker and fetishistic impulses are actually a dark, shadowy reflection closer to Daath and linked towards darker &quot;spheres,&quot; which is not bad in itself, but is seen in the signature because often such fetishes are more &quot;rooted&quot; in manifest things than higher ideals, thus linked more to lower planes than higher.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;re still very active. Thanks again to you, and everyone else that helped me years ago when I first asked for help in finishing the tasks in Chumbley&#039;s One Grimoire.<br><br>I think I finally found the path where the Warden wanted me to take. I&#039;m still a bit mad about the whole I accidentally Chumbley&#039;s One Grimoire though. Anyway, how are you doing with your chod practice? <br><br>I really tried reading Chumbley&#039;s other books because they&#039;re interesting especially Azo\u00ebtia&#039;s dream work, I seem to fail in understanding them at a deeper level. It&#039;s Qutub and ONE where I can understand a bit and have spoopy happenings. The One Grimoire is dangerous af, and I would caution anyone wanting to do the ritual outlined unless they&#039;re mentally and physically prepared. Of course, there&#039;s this matter with compatibility to account for too. Is it just one Warden assigned per book or are they different ones guarding them?<br><br>Years later and I finally understood some of the inside jokes the Warden left in my dream meetings with him. Even my sojourn entries had memes thanks to my interest in other Asian cultures. icanteven (\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\ufe35 \u2501 <br><br>Moving on, if anyone else is suffering from nightmares, I find reciting Psalm 23, 91, 121 or the Verses of the Eight Noble Auspicious Ones, even just a page of either the Sutra of Golden Light, or Medicine Buddha Sutra helps. There&#039;s also Chenrezig&#039;s mantra, Green Tara, or the Vajra Guru mantra: OM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM. They&#039;re more effective combined with following the advice of a health professional/after taking a medical examination to check for any underlying causes just in case.<br><br>And hiya, Sevenleaf.

I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me being excited although I try as hard to just put emotions to the side in the process or if I&#039;m doing something wrong. I&#039;ve been advised by some kind anons to refer to /succgen/ for a helping hand but I don&#039;t want a demon to fuck me in the arse or anything sex related. What I&#039;m looking for is an entity willing to offer a helping hand without getting into a wicked relationship with it.

I&#039;ve been listening to the HemiSync FLACs and doing meditation, I&#039;ve read through some literature regarding AP and tried multiple methods.

It looks like a clinical version of finding God, with God being relabelled. It looks right though. The key to love, to life, to suffering, is to accept it. Become present to each moment, realise that God is everything, and your body, your eyes, your senses, are a field that God feels himself through. You can live every moment as though you were sharing every experience you have with the life that births the form of you, and by placing yourself outside yourself, you expand and root yourself in something that can never die or be injured and never needs anything. <br>You are not an identity, but a field, a context. If God puts you off, forget God, it&#039;s just a name for a way of living (it is life itself, free of all concepts and names, the deep awe and unknowable mystery in every moment). You could call it death, nothing, life, presence, neither-neither, it doesn&#039;t matter because the experience is one of flowing without grasping. If you find a name for God you should throw it behind you and grab the next one and expand forever on endless names, each one essential and then useless once grabbed. It is like a game of hot potato with life. Every moment is a hot potato you have to keep throwing to God.<br><br>Lately my goal is to feel God all the time, and to be present in everything I do. This means suffering, but by suffering, by looking at what hurts me, what blocks me, what limits me, by staring at it and accepting it as it is, it melts away.

It is a brilliant way of getting out of having to solve the problem or be held accountable...but eggs are still unaffordable and creating people just to punish/torture them is still evil, and no amount of rhetorical trickery changes that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have NEVER attributed goodness in the familiar moral, welfare-oriented sense we apply in human moral evaluation to God</span><br>&quot;Okay, okay, so I maybe used the word inflation, but I never said I meant it the way the word inflation is understood by you.

I mean, it&#039;s common knowledge that we&#039;re made of around 80% water, and emerging knowledge most fungus and parasites do thrive in an acidic environment (see Dr. Simoncini&#039;s work &quot;Cancer is a fungus&quot;), yet there&#039;s little to no discussion on this thread about alkaline water, and it&#039;s even stronger evolution into &quot;kangen water&quot;. The latter is simply a hydrogen rich type of water, with very low ORP values, which means it has an anti-oxidative and rejuvenating effect on our body. Curiously enough, this type of water was popularized by non-other than Hiromi Shinya, an absolute pioneer of colonoscopy and related techs to remove intestinal parasites https://youtu.be/VcOz4WxH9iI?t=10 <br>The man himself performed somewhere around 400.000 colonoscopies and God knows how many demons pulled out of people&#039;s buttholes during his lifetime, so I feel he kinda deserves a place of honor in this thread as a side note.<br><br>Another unsung hero in the de-parasite&#039;s battle imho, is Dr. Robert Cassar, who devoted his last 35 years literally removing parasites from people all around the world. In the case for water, he advocates for pure (homemade) distilled water as a powerful detoxing and lymphatic cleansing agent. So I&#039;ve tried it, and after 3+ months I&#039;ve been drinking it, I can attest its cleansing benefits in the form of: a) more frequent urination, which I associate with faster and more efficient kidney&#039;s work, and b) a strong and unpleasant &quot;fishy&quot; smell at the beginning of NAC protocol (ammonia, thus candida?), alternating for some days with other kinds of unpleasant smells, some very &quot;fungus-like&quot;, until circa 3 weeks after the smell subsided. So my peasant&#039;s guess is that bad smelling stuff is better out of my system, and that wasn&#039;t happening before I introduced pure distilled water.", "time": 1674452673, "resto": 33895977}, {"no": 33908671, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)01:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33908522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33908522</a><br>Pure distilled water, despite being virtually clean from ALL contaminants, do tends to be acidic in nature, thus I started adding a little baking soda to it in order to bring it between a 7 to 9 ph.

When I did the nofap, I had more energy and woman flirted with me more but I used sugar to replace porn. Now not everyone who does nofap is like me, some succeed and go for years while the longest I could do was 40 days. During my nofap phase I always felt guilty about my sexuality.

You guys convinced me to just calm down and try to talk it out with the incubus. I don&#039;t know what his name is so I&#039;ll call him the incubus. I still don&#039;t think I over reacted. I really wish I could tell someone about all of this but unfortunately that would land me in the looney bin so all I have is this place. I did put some thought into everything that happened since I did the letter on my way back home. The incubus hasn&#039;t done anything malicious to me or anything that would make me feel unsafe. He seems to watch me from afar most of the time unless I sit down. When I got home I sat down on my couch with a beer again and said that I would talk to him. I felt the incubus come near me this time but could feel him a little better. It&#039;s like a cloud of energy that falls on my lap. I told him no sex only talking. Most of the questions were yes and no type since he can only talk to me in single words. He gave me some insight on lots of things I was wondering about but who knows if he&#039;s being truthful. What did stand out was when I asked him what he wanted from me and I got this sudden feeling within me of love coming from him it&#039;s like he injected me with his feelings or something. I told him not to do that again because it kinda freaked me out. We talked some more and in the end I agreed that he could stay for a while but I don&#039;t know if I want this as a permanent thing and he agreed.

The first technique for sex reassignment surgery wasn&#039;t even pioneered until half a century ago. Either way, I&#039;m glad I was able to get the help I needed.

The people in Hell keep themselves in there and the Demons that dwell in there are happy to torture them, but anybody who doesn&#039;t think they deserve Hell can&#039;t *actually* be kept there beyond just being convinced to stay. <br>-Animals seem to have more of an influence on this then people expect. Lots of people are dragged out of Hell on horses, dogs, even pet birds, they&#039;ve kept in life, and Heaven is reported to be occupied by Animals. Animals seem to come and go wherever they please or are needed. <br>-The Godhead uniformly hasn&#039;t been condoning homosexuals. The singular barometer of divine judgement really does just seem to exclusively be how empathetic you were in life and the kindness you had for others.

Once we do, and then go further and seek the light of highest self, we in essence have taken the entirety of the matrix of what we perceive as &quot;God&quot; within ourselves and manifested it within our being. <br><br>Once we reach this state, we can travel to &quot;the wilderness,&quot; the &quot;place&quot; of everything outside our matrix of human makeup and consciousness, and due to carrying fully all of the light of what we are within us by actualizing our higher and eventually highest self, we shine it upon the wilderness and can interact with it similar to a plane we are familiar with. Basically, we create our own sphere of ourselves to mirror our makeup to superimpose upon the &quot;outer,&quot; the &quot;beyond&quot;, the &quot;lovecraftian gates,&quot; and through the superimposition we make sense of things of this higher plane, it acts as a &quot;translator&quot; for us to understand as well as a means to filter out harmful influences to our matrix. That is what is beyond unmanifest and manifest, and why it will not make sense until you achieve a higher state of existence, because you cannot EXIST there until you carry what makes you &quot;you&quot; and your consciousness safe within every piece of your holistic essence.", "filename": "1600103587115", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 392, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674460230687668, "time": 1674460230, "md5": "yrMzBp6xafylpVRzWB/vsg==", "fsize": 147252, "resto": 33908855}, {"no": 33909194, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:06:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As above so below.</span>", "filename": "astarte", "ext": ".png", "w": 512, "h": 768, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674461200465559, "time": 1674461200, "md5": "M5JLCHqR0abYvXb6YN7G0w==", "fsize": 754217, "resto": 33908855}, {"no": 33909242, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:15:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33909118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33909118</a><br>is this what McKenna was hinting at when speaking of 2012 being the precursor to what he unknowingly percieved to be the Age of Aquarius (he called it timewave zero)? so then, is the dmt realm so far out that is even beyond not only vishnu but beyond all vishnus and beyond the brahman itself? the realm of the coders? or simply as he put it the future of all existence leaking back into the now because as time moves for us, reality falls apart because it is unfolding and simultaneously folding in unto itself because we have already achieved the absolute state of unity and are simply the ripple of that energy zooming back in like a rubber band?", "filename": "Screenshot_20230123_031527_Firefox", "ext": ".png", "w": 1080, "h": 1051, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1674461743749213, "time": 1674461743, "md5": "kbBdOy/cMGdF8n+jvHlCpQ==", "fsize": 1118023, "resto": 33908855}, {"no": 33909259, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)03:19:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33909056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33909056</a><br>Everything is a fractal, it&#039;s like a hologram that contains smaller copies of itself.

All this stuff is also in Capricorn. The third house governs routine, familiar, and &quot;close by&quot; activity - it can refer to many things depending on what you do. Perhaps you want to impress your siblings, perhaps you want to write for a local magazine, or perhaps you want to be a politician or something else. At any rate, you are serious, methodical and balanced in your approach, if perhaps a bit hesitant.<br>4th house Venus suggests good upbringing. Fifth house Jupiter in Pisces suggests great creative ability - whether it refers to children or artistic works or what have you, you will know better than I do.<br>Saturn in Aries 6th house suggests that you should take your health seriously.

If you&#039;re going to be talking about masculine and active signs then it makes no sense to ignore the traditional designation. If Sagittarius is the sign of the wanderer or adventurer, Gemini is the sign of the trickster or &quot;manipulator&quot; (in the objective rather than the social sense). It&#039;s not a coincidence that Gemini rules the arms. As the third sign in the zodiac, Gemini also invokes the symbolism of the number three, which symbolises the emergence of self-awareness and the manipulation and control over other things. A lot of the active and masculine archetypes you find in modern fiction, like the lovable rogue, for example, can be much more closely identified with Gemini than with Sagittarius. At its best, Gemini is an insightful and strategic sign, and at its worst it is a cunning and malicious one. It seems unfair to me to reduce it only to the ideas of superficiality and unreliability - it entirely depends on the situation and the manifestation (like which house and what planets are involved). In mutable-type situations I think you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a sign that does better than Gemini.", "time": 1674253183, "resto": 33888585}, {"no": 33891390, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)17:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are Scorpios one of (if not) the most volatile signs?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

I&#039;ll look into it.<br><br>The thing regarding Pessoa is he did believe in it. Extensively. The prediction of his death was off by just a few months. He predicted the year of death of one his friends, in one of his horoscopes. A death that occurred 20 years after Pessoa&#039;s own death. This at a time where calculations where all hand made.<br>Concerning the points you brought up, regarding (1) he says this as for the intimate (i misspelled before) as in, you cannot know the inside of a specific person through astrology, that is, their feelings. Of course, that matters little when he himself says that &quot;The horoscope reveals, little more or less, what he worlds sees&quot;. So even if your intimate self sees itself in a certain way, the world will not see it like so. <br>Concerning point (2) is just a matter of logic as in you can&#039;t decerne from a birth location and time alone the material wealth of a certain person starts with or his family connections he/her was born into. You can say the person will grow to be wealthy or that he/she will fall on disgrace in the context of his/her life. A pleb at birth can become an aristocrat in his lifetime and a millionaire at birth can fall into poverty. The horoscope doesn&#039;t know your starting wealth but it knows where it is headed.<br>Astrology does spook me a bit, but that is why must look further into it.<br>Honestly think the auspicious future I can have depends entirely on me, specifically on leaving my lethargic ways behind, but I feel like I have inevitable bad omens around me, so better to foresee them and prepare than just wait for them to hit me unannounced.", "time": 1674308038, "resto": 33888585}, {"no": 33895958, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)09:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33893190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33893190</a><br>It&#039;s decent, I think.<br><a href=\"#p33893234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33893234</a><br>Bro, both your ascendant ruler and the ruler of your 10th house are in your 1st house.

The 8th house has no direct connection to the 1st house and therefore you have more difficulty being aware of and connecting with your life purpose.

The moon governs your 9th house of higher learning, religion and foreign things, so your experiences here may be related to those topics.<br>7th house Taurus has a stellium in it. Your sun in the 7th house means a central meaning of your life is relationships. You express yourself and fulfil yourself through relationships with others. Saturn is also here - this can introduce difficulties, struggles and delays, but you also have both benefic planets - Jupiter and Venus here - so you should be fine. Jupiter and Venus both bring great fortune to your relationships. All of this occurs in the sign of Venus, meaning that she governs this area of your life and guides the other planets in its sign. Your public life, practical activity, family life, creativity/children and finances will also be drawn into the field of relationships, since these are all governed by planets in the 7th house.

Received wisdom goes that the former was considered legitimate by the Church and the latter wasn&#039;t, but the boundary between them was a lot blurrier than that in practice according to some esotericism scholars. But you can easily see that the idea behind natural and demonic magic doesn&#039;t line up woth the idea behind white and black magic. Is summoning a spirit to teach you calculus black magic? Is manipulating the aether to crush some personal enemy white magic? All of the above varieties of magic are about human beings trying to master the cosmos and the unseen world, which is inherently self-worship, satanic, and irreonciliable with the submissive attitude we should have towards God. The planets are God&#039;s and we&#039;re not so powerful or important that we can affect them, we cant even change the color of one hair on our heads as the Bible says, so even if they did have some occult power it&#039;d be blasphemous to try to harness it.", "time": 1674453042, "resto": 33906282}, {"no": 33908554, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:51:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33908439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33908439</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Born Again Barbarian</span><br>Oh boy lol.

When a god or higher being from another plane, like a ruler of a sphere, gives you its influence, it ultimately is a wisp of its full power, right? It is a lot to due with &quot;distance&quot; and being centered in a different locale metaphysically. &quot;Magic gf&quot; is a bonus, but given the shit I seen and the good will towards me I would want to &quot;shift its locale&quot; from where she resides from that plane (which again, feels &quot;different&quot; than a typical astral one) to as if she resided here, which theoretically should result in far more power. It might be an impossible thing for, say, Thor to manifest here, but due to the TYPE of plane this is from what I been learning, I can&#039;t help but wonder if it can be done due to its dense and opposite cycle nature. I need to emphasize, this feels different than more astral planes and is closer to a thing like shadow plane than those, and why I think it might be what is considered a qliphot.", "filename": "7d08c4c1721f379ea0619f456963b0e6", "ext": ".png", "w": 1200, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674407348937334, "time": 1674407348, "md5": "iBCXKy7KWONPVCpBHi3OXQ==", "fsize": 1545596, "resto": 33892410}, {"no": 33904104, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33901646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33901646</a><br>Listing to you anon I believe your words are based and true. <br>That being said, what books can direct me to real magic and angelic slave bullshit. <br>what information was provided by you and your demons on manifestation and cultivating real power?", "time": 1674410541, "resto": 33892410}, {"no": 33904179, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)13:20:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33892410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33892410</a><br>I need a spell to make impossible desires come true please.

Premodern Christians were absolutely brutal towards Muslims at times, much more brutal than you&#039;re aware I&#039;m sure, but if you look at Christian-Muslim polemics from the medieval period, they didn&#039;t stoop to the level that modern heroes of christendom like David Wood and Christian Prince or all the crusader larpers on /pol/ regularly do.

You rage over the aspects of Islam that are most radically inconsistent with liberal values. Which is why anti-Islamic movements in Europe are usually full to the brim with faggots and atheists and why you reserve this level of venom for Islam specifically. Hinduism has tens of thousands of gods, you think you have only one, we have only One. More in common with us right?

There was also a renunciation of the Devil and then a sealing with the Holy Spirit via use of holy oil and laying on of the hands. Sometimes these would be followed by charismata i.e. spiritual gifts where the participants would enter a trans like state where the Holy Spirit or their guardian angel may speak through them and ecstatic dancing might occur.

As said, early Christians thought demons were literally everywhere. They were often equated with the gods of foreign nations, hence why they applied the Greek term daimon to them (originating in the LXX). It was believed that Jesus was triumphing over these &quot;rulers&quot; and &quot;powers&quot; to bring about the Messianic Kingdom. In some sense, Christian &quot;magic&quot; put an end to all other magic because Christian &quot;magic&quot; was from Yahweh, it was holy (kodesh), unlike gentile magic which was considered unclean (&quot;tumah&quot;, drawing on Jewish notions of purity and impurity). Jesus of Nazareth was likely a Jewish magician and indeed so much of modern Jewish magic as found in Kabbalah can be correlated with Jesus&#039;s actions in the gospels and in Christian ritual and prayer today.

Not that I&#039;m saying it was created from scratch then, it obviously has some deep roots, but when we&#039;re comparing specific elements of the life of Jesus PBUH as reported in the Gospels to specific elements from kabbalah, influence of the former on the latter is more provable than vice versa. Also the Bible is a (collection of) compromised text(s) so it could&#039;ve easily been edited later. And if you&#039;re talking about Western &quot;Qabalah&quot;, that didn&#039;t come about until even later, with the Renaissance.

The reader must question whether he could have been privy to the outcome of the Russian workers\u2019 movement before those workers themselves had ever heard of Marx or formed the movement to oppose their masters? And if he was, how could he have such foresight to suggest a World War could simply be brought about and that it could be controlled in such a manner to accomplish his goals? It\u2019s not only highly unlikely but there is nothing of substance to suggest it actually happened. No testimony from anybody else associated with Pike, no other correspondence or writings from Pike himself - literally nothing other than this alleged letter. It should also be noted that other than the general enlightenment movement the only &quot;Illuminati&quot; organization documented within decades of the time-frame of the letter was the Bavarian Illuminati which officially disbanded in 1785. Though conspiracy theories flourish to this day and the term is used in the abstract, serious accusations of the group\u2019s secret continuation had died out at least 50 years before the letter was allegedly written. Out of all the verified Pike literature, only Morals &amp; Dogma makes a fleeting and abstract use of the term Illuminati and this certainly ins\u2019t in he context of some all powerful secret society. So if Pike believed a war must take place for the Illuminati, who are they and what evidence is there to support that they existed and he was a member? Of course some irrational proponents of the &quot;letter&quot; will say they\u2019re a secret. But if they are such a well kept secret, how do (you) know they are/were real?

There is no record of Pike knowing or meeting Birnbaum or having any connection to the Zionist movement. The ideological roots of Fascism were only in their infancy during Pike&#039;s final years, and the term was not used publicly until Mussolini took his position in the 1920s. The term Nazism did not emerge until the 1930s with the rise of Germany&#039;s National Socialist party.

I ran into this building in the dream and there was like this concrete tub of water. I grabbed a bucket and filled it and when she came down flying in I threw the water on her. Comical but she was like dissolving wizard of oz style. I don&#039;t think she actually dissolved though I think it was a dream metaphor. Woke up right away after.

I have found many ways to fly or float in dreams, but the most common and easiest to work with involve motions or principles that are rooted in reality or easy to grasp in the moment - like pretending to swim in the air or flapping ones wings like a bird. <br><br>I&#039;ve also become very good at moving objects with my mind in a way that a comic-book or anime character might, specifically moving stuff towards my hands in a way one might recall a yoyo (I love yoyos) or moving it around as though my arm were some sort of wand directing it where to go. However, all feats of wonder in dreams lucid or otherwise are tricky in that they generally require absolute faith you&#039;re able to do them when you attempt them. If I am tricked even for a moment that I &quot;believe I can&#039;t&quot; or if the effect falters at all, the instant I lose motivation, it stops working. I&#039;ve trained now to keep trying; so that steels my resolve. <br><br>I think this is why many newbies and even relatively excited lucid dreamers get a power once and then let it go quickly and can&#039;t do it again - without the motivation trick and good recall, it&#039;s a bit like catching sand until you get a good foundation. Many might attribute their powers in dreams to gifts and lessons etc and I think that&#039;s a marvelous way to reframe the trick of motivation (because you will remember you were &quot;given&quot; that power and own it) but in reality, at the most basic level, any well-experienced lucid dreamer knows that literally anything can be done in a dream purely by wishing it so. I can close my eyes and start a dream over from scratch, direct it exactly as I want it, teleport, or summon anything. <br><br>It gets boring if I do this, but it&#039;s great to be able to stop a nightmare. Great to start a bad dream off right.

It feels like my body is slowly shrinking inside itself and I hear noise that&#039;s getting louder and louder, even shaking of the whole body at some points but I always drift off and wake up. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me being excited although I try as hard to just put emotions to the side in the process or if I&#039;m doing something wrong. I&#039;ve been advised by some kind anons to refer to /succgen/ for a helping hand but I don&#039;t want a demon to fuck me in the arse or anything sex related. What I&#039;m looking for is an entity willing to offer a helping hand without getting into a wicked relationship with it. It sounds too good to be true but I&#039;m new to all of this although I&#039;ve been trying for quite some time and I don&#039;t know who to reach out to. I&#039;ve been listening to the HemiSync FLACs and doing meditation, I&#039;ve read through some literature regarding AP and tried multiple methods.

It&#039;s a private company that prints the money and lends it to the government.<br>That&#039;s like Walmart being in charge of printing all the US money, and loaning it to the government that must be paid back with interest. But where would they get the money to pay it back? From Walmart, and that money must be paid back too.<br>It&#039;s a recipe for never ending debt. That&#039;s why the US debt is in the trillions of dollars and nobody gives a fuck. Does that seem right to you?<br><br>You&#039;re living in a debt world. A slave world.

in their earliest documentation were known as &quot;brethren of the free spirit&quot; this name is related to a passage in the bible that goes &quot;where the spirit of the lord is, there is freedom&quot; this belief group in the middle ages were given a slur &quot;adamites&quot; because they wanted to recreate adams nakedness and shamelessness, shame is the original sin of man and woman, society is built upon shame, with shame one upholds social-constructs wether they are true or false shame is a whip of society to stop society to stop being society, if too many people in society do
