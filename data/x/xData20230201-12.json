Your scene should just be holding a $100 bill in your hand, and probably after some time has passed. So what I suggest is to imagine just holding a $100 bill in your hand while you&#039;re sitting around at home resting. Don&#039;t imagine the moment where you actually get the bill, imply that it happened in the past (this is a teaching from Neville). This opens you up to getting it in many possible ways, whether finding it, or getting it as a gift.<br><br>Lastly, anons in these threads have said that they manifest free money frequently now, but they started off small. One even said he had to start with a penny before making any success. So, with the above, set a deadline of two, maybe three weeks. If you make no progress, set a smaller goal like a $50 bill, $20 bill, etc., rinse and repeat, and then you&#039;ll find out what your mind finds believable. Alternatively you could start off small with like a $5 bill and work your way up if that&#039;s successful right off the bat.", "time": 1675231882, "resto": 33976158}, {"no": 33979263, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:17:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33979209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33979209</a><br>Any interest in business?

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift to multiple receivers across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

Can I just point out that the entire concept of \u201cDivinely ordained war\u201d is so stupid.. why not \u201cdivinely ordained rock paper scissors\u201d? If, as Evola puts it, divine war is ordained and justified bc \u201cGod was called as a witness and would bestow his favor upon the victor\u201d then why not call God as a witness to a divinely ordained coin flip, and avoid the gruesome and pointless violence and bloodshed of war? The answer of course is because a rock paper scissors match or a coin flip would not appease the corrupted man\u2019s need for senseless violence to inflate their overgrown egos. and if it was a bloody battle that these brothers desired, could they not have fought it amongst themselves rather than sending thousands of men into battle to kill one another under the justification of settling the dispute for them?? absolutely ridicoulous that Evola fails to see the hypocrisy and senselessness of it all.<br><br>Although Evola does credit the terms of this specific battle as being more civil and humane than most, since they agreed to not loot and pillage, and also they agreed to care for wounded soldiers; the problem is that he begins with the faulty axiom that men must do war in the first place, so therefor it\u2019s best that they do war in the spirit of the Gods.

I\u2019d be more impressed with a philosopher that stated outright and clearly: \u201cIf men must do war simply for war&#039;s sake, then take no part in it, instead go your own way. Don\u2019t be a sheep. Don\u2019t follow the herd. Be your own person, and do not bend your will, your actions or your morals for the sake of any cause that misaligns with them.\u201d", "time": 1675158730, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33972584, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)04:53:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33972582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33972582</a><br>Evola goes on to say later in the chapter:<br><br>\u201cEven torture, which was conceived as a means to interrogate prisoners was originally related to the notion of divine judgement.

You are trying to apply all these modern conceptions of humanism and sentimentalism to a domain that is totally impervious to those concepts. Your entire write-up is built on an erroneous foundation anyways: the idea of the &quot;Holy War&quot;, or that there is metaphysical meaning in martial prowess, did not originate with Evola or any of the traditionalists. First off, a warrior &quot;creed&quot; that abided by a higher law was central to the warrior caste in every traditional civilization. Samurai, Knights Templar, Teutonic Order, The Kshatriyas, I could go on and on. Secondly, this phenomenon was not the result of the ruling classes propaganda like you are claiming, as if the kings in these societies made up a bunch of wacky spiritual stuff to justify war. To these men, combat was something that resembled a spiritual experience: overcoming fear of death and all human instincts of self-preservation. Aligning oneself with an &quot;unshakable courage&quot; that is the foundation of illumination as the Buddhists said. Combat was a &quot;contest&quot; in the highest stakes game known to man.

And if the air creates equal pressure at all points in the chamber, then certainly the air creates equal pressure at all points in the flat Earth dome.<br><br>Yet there is no denying that air thins as you climb in altitude. At 100,000 feet, somewhere near the top of the theorized dome, the air pressure is so low that it is effectively a vacuum. <br><br>This alone debunks all of flat Earth.<br><br>Note: no flerfer has ever provided a workable answer to this.

So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall.

Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

As soon as the Golden Rule is violated by either party, the transgressor has immediately opened themselves up to whatever consequences are necessary to correct that specific behavior, and as long as those consequences themselves do not violate the Golden Rule, they are justified.<br><br>obviously there are subtle nuances to the Golden Rule, and its not always quite as black and white as the examples i provided above, but the paradigm IS robust enough as a guiding principle of one&#039;s life to act as compass pointing them towards the kingdom of heaven.", "filename": "the golden rule", "ext": ".gif", "w": 780, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675205268706338, "time": 1675205268, "md5": "wLWrl/qL403PHBgBzUi9lQ==", "fsize": 121461, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33976826, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:52:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33975973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33975973</a><br>Look dude, I don&#039;t have the time or patience to respond in several successive posts to everything you said. Either find a better way to consolidate your ideas in a more brief way, or take the discussion point by point. Overwhelming your opponent with walls of text that are extremely broad in scope is not an effective strategy.<br><br>I will just try and address the overall sentiment of your post then. You seem to focus a lot on hypothetical circumstances where the ruling class is corrupted and feeding out lies to its military for its own purposes. While I would never claim that this has never happened, such an attitude of the royalty represents a deviation from the primordial &quot;soul&quot; that animates a civilization during its apex, its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, or when it can be truly considered &quot;traditional&quot; from the point of view of the perennialists. When this happens, it represents a decline in the quality of that civilization. In a type of civilization that is more aligned to this primordial purity (which is absolutely a real thing, the only thing might I add that can be said to bestow legitimate power onto a being or entity, being itself ultimately synonymous with God), war has an entirely different character than what you&#039;re describing, and is not embarked on recklessly in pursuit of material gain, for desire of material wealth already represents the decline of royalty.<br><br>There are certain peoples that are by their inherent nature more prone to violence and martial action. These people have their place in the story of humanity, and should it be desired that this &quot;aspect&quot; of humanity that the people represents should be defeated (which is essentially what you&#039;re saying), then let it be done under the right spiritual &quot;pretexts.&quot; This would absolutely stand as an example of the &quot;Holy War&quot;, where the paradox of war must be resolved on a transcendent level.

I learned meditation through the Goenka retreats where they teach a body scanning technique that allows you to tap deeper into your bodily feeling sense (kinesthetic sense) to the point that you start to see how this interacts with other layers that we would usually describe as psychological (i.e. thought) or feeling (i.e. emotional). I practiced very hard for a couple years a learned a bunch but ultimately it was not well suited for my psychology. The technique gave me to much to do. I think some people might benefit from a task oriented meditation like that but for my psychology it just provided too much opportunity to distract and obstruct myself through analysis.

In my experience you can&#039;t really stop thoughts or have the mind become completely blank as some describe it (or maybe you can if you&#039;re way more advanced than I am), but you can realize that you are not your thoughts - the thoughts keep churning away, appearing, changing, running their course, in your mind, but you are separate from that.

In acknowledging this, I acknowledge that what may have been an important step or critical tool for my journey may be the opposite for you.<br>The heart of my practice is to destroy all that is false, and this starts with realizing you, and everyone around you, has a voice in their head that they listen to.

I&#039;m not trying to be clever, I am being honest that only your awareness is faster, smarter, and stronger than your mind. In all other ways, mind is faster, stronger, it knows your weak points, it can pre-empt any attempt to get ahead of it. But awareness precedes all thought. Thought is encompassed by awareness.<br>Since the mind is always trying to generate some illusion or falsehood, the practice of watching the mind is something you can do all day, every day. <br>&quot;Oh, there it goes again, telling that story about how worthless I am.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh wow, look at my mind go, making up stories about why I feel what I feel. It&#039;s really on the loose now!&quot;<br>Awareness is the weapon, so every time you see your mind making things up, you are aware that it is only making things up, not discerning truth. Every time you catch your mind, you take energy away from it, you kill it. &quot;See the thing, kill the thing, clean up the mess.&quot;<br>This is an endless process and there is never a time you must stop.

Nothing is satisfying and your day will be ruined, back to work on Monday. But he sits down comfortably on his bed and practices the awareness-watching-awareness method. Back and forth from the mind back to awareness. After a half hour, or an hour, or longer, he miraculously feels better and wants to partake of activities again.

You want pussy, so you seek women, seeking women makes you realize there are things you need to work on, like your hygiene physique, hair, financial status, and most importantly, your ability to actual have a sociable personalty like a chad instead of an overly introverted loser. All of these things are ultimately enhancements to your life brought about by a desire to wreck pussy that all have major carry over into every other area of your life.

I realize these things intuitively (serving others and spreading positivity) and have learned how important they are over the years but I rarely implement them. (I&#039;m not certain why exactly, I think it&#039;s my health making things very difficult to do.) I view generosity though as the easiest and best way to go combat evil and negativity in this world, that and finding, understanding, and sharing the truth. <br><br>I&#039;ve put myself in extremely negative situations before intentionally and unintentionally and it feels like my suffering is what has always given me the most power and energy and ability to change and create and transform. From being put into a psych ward (multiple times, the first:) because of my mother lying to the government. Being in jail because of using benzos and blacking out, and while in jail having extreme pain for days and almost losing a part of my body and being unable to even sleep. Almost dying due to cutting my arm open, when I think about it still it hurts my soul. There were many odd circumstances around that event, such as someone trying to give me a ride that I didn&#039;t recgonize and knowing my name. There&#039;s a lot. Being homeless, etc.<br><br>In the same vein as this I&#039;ve been wondering if doing negative things to myself or going into the depths of depravity is worth it simply to experience these things, but even then I don&#039;t have the energy to even do that. <br><br>What do you mean be aware of my breathing? Is there a proper way to breathe you&#039;ve been taught? Or do you just mean be aware of the feeling itself? <br><br>I am serious about the psychic and spiritual path because I don&#039;t want to waste what I&#039;ve been given, it is unique and powerful, and I can use it to help others and improve their lives in many ways. It is the same reason why I want to cultivate my creativity, I want to give others what I have.

When you&#039;re enjoying life, you don&#039;t ask questions like why am I here, what am I doing here, what&#039;s the purpose of Life? You just live it, enjoy it, and die.

This differs from what you hear in Western Buddhism, which is that you get to jhana through focusing meditation practices and eventually randomly enter jhana. Those meditation practices are the opposite of abandonment, because you&#039;re actively chasing novel experiences. <br>You basically can enter jhana by being bored, and sustaining that until the mind &#039;dries up&#039; from the water of sensuality. Then once the mind is free of sensual obsession, the mind enters jhana. This is how I understand his teachings and was able to enter the first jhana once as a layperson for about 10-15 seconds on account of this, and a video about entering the first jhana by Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero.

Once that happens, if someone were to drag him to that same pit of embers he used to be addicted to, he&#039;d be fighting to get away, because now that pit of embers would be exclusively painful.<br>Senuality is the same way. People just cover up that fundamental lack of ease/lack of comfort/dukkha/whatever with sensual pleasures.<br>Jhana is a temporary liberation from this.

There is no Princess Peach, Mario. We Toads made her up. The princess is part of an ancient Toadian tradition our ancestors started 2000 years ago as they fled Dry Bones Bowser\u2019s pyramids in the sand kingdom on World 3.

By making sure an Italian plumber successfully reaches the goal post in each kingdom thinking he\u2019s saving the princess, the Toads could keep Bowsers eternal tyranny under control. But the whole adventure has been based on a lie, Mario. There is no princess, that time you kissed Princess Peach and ate cake with her by the beach on World 4, it was Toadette in a disguise the whole time.

Accept it, and know that if you ever say anything about it in public, us Toads will make sure you never work as a plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom again. Why do you think your brother Luigi is always so scared, Mario? Did you think he was just scared of boos? IT WAS US, MARIO! We made the Boos! He read too closely between the signs, that\u2019s why we gave him that haunted mansion. Our Toadian ancestors trained the Yoshis that carried you as a baby to safety.

But that kingdom cannot be one of Toad supremacist tyranny. We must embrace all ethnicities and genders of plumbers if we want to keep this new found peace alive. And if these plumbers decide to revolt against the tyrannically shallow, exploitative, and schizophrenic mythos forced on to them by their ancestors who clung to the Toads\u2019 signs for generations, then they too shall be cast in lava with Dry Bones Bowser. There must always be a Princess in the Mushroom Kingdom, and I, Toadette, am willing, no, I was born to impersonate this Princess Peach and ghost write love letters to up and coming plumbers. Not because I want to, but because these plumbers deserve to start their games with a sense of purpose and belonging. From now on, me and my Toadette descendants will personally be waiting in full Princess Peach cosplay at the end of every kingdom to ensure that the mushroom kingdom always finds its plumber, and that this plumber always finds their princess.

The Statue of Kilkenny banned the use of Gaelic in the early 1300\u00b4s within the PALE, which is a small area around Dublin, since the rest of Ireland at this time was largely autonomous and was ruled by a collection of Hiberno-Norman lords nominally in service to the English crown (apart from the Pale) but in reality independent. The purpose of the Statutes was to curb the increasing Gaelicization of these former Anglo-Norman lords.The Statutes were ignored and failed outside of the Pale and by the time the Plantations happened in the 1600\u00b4s, the now Gaelic nobility ruled rather supreme, with Gaelic culture (and language) perhaps being the strongest at any point in its history.

It was largely the Irish themselves who abandoned Irish. For economic reasons and also the social stigma that was attached to it from being/speaking Gaelic in the context of the British Empire. Not to mention that a huge number of native speakers died or emigrated during the Famine (it hit the West strongest, which is where the language was most dominant).

Physiognomy basically means predicting things about a person such as their behavioural and personality traits from their face. 80% of our genes effect our brain and most behaviours are actually to a high degree heritable. Since facial features are also heritable there&#039;s a decent chance that some facial features will be associated with some behavioural traits. For example, just from the face you can generally tell when someone has violent anti social tendencies and is from a lower socioeconomic class. The typical benefit streets face. You can also tell when a black guy is safe or not just from a momentary glance of his face. Two guys could be wearing the same outfit with the same facial expression when one screams danger and the other doesn&#039;t. Same for girls.

That\u2019s a Sunday school concept that\u2019s not at all an accurate representation of reality. What happens is that your body will die and your soul will move on. Where it goes doesn\u2019t depend on some \u2018naughty or nice\u2019 list that God has up in Heaven. It\u2019s dependent on the vibrational frequency of your soul. Either positive or negative.<br>You see, that\u2019s what we are all here to do. To choose our frequency, which we do every second of every day with our choices. It\u2019s vaguely like what people call karma, but not in the My Name Is Earl sense. The more bad you do, the more it weighs on your soul negatively.<br>So, you do enough bad, the frequency of your soul becomes negative. Then when you die, your soul moves to the next world. Either a positive one or a negative one. Positive ones house positive entities and negative ones house negative entities.<br>Now, there\u2019s a bunch more semantics and finer details about how it all works and various exceptions to the rules, but that is the gist of it. I don\u2019t know what the next worlds hold. Only speculation and theory, but I know it\u2019s not what every little tyke was told in church.<br><br>So don\u2019t worry about burning forever.

Air Force sergeant Jonathan Lovette was assisting Major William Cunningham on a mission to recover scattered debris from a recent rocket test. The two military personnel ventured into the desert to search for the debris. Major Cunningham was shocked when he suddenly heard a loud scream. Assuming Lovette had been bitten by a snake, Cunningham crossed the dune to aid Lovette where he witnessed an unfathomable sight.<br><br>Instead of finding Lovette tending to a snake bite, Cunningham watched as the soldier was being dragged by a long serpentine arm wrapped around his legs, connected to a silver disk hovering in the air 15 to 20 feet away. The major found himself unable to move during the encounter, in a state of paralysis, Cunningham was only able to watch in horror until Lovette was pulled inside the craft which then took off with astonishing speed.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/co<wbr>mments/qqw2o9/the_disturbing_human_<wbr>mutilation_of_jonathan_p/</span><br><br>So... no fucking wonder some of the aliens abduct cows.", "filename": "Babe the big blue ox", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 468, "h": 340, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1674997659908010, "time": 1674997659, "md5": "x2SikFAa2bRADTe+B0uvWQ==", "fsize": 95050, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958021, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661715401198", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997718916627, "time": 1674997718, "md5": "+/gEalFfMbmUCJ/utXuzvA==", "fsize": 972796, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958022, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958010</a><br><a href=\"#p33958004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958004</a><br><a href=\"#p33958001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958001</a><br> Absolutely not, you mongloid cointelpro wannabe faggot fucking glow bitches.<br><br>https://www.theblackvault.com/casef<wbr>iles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-tre<wbr>pang-ssn-674-march-1971/", "filename": "glowerers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1674997720784313, "time": 1674997720, "md5": "Lw+IqQaf11hXYkKWpri9pw==", "fsize": 48878, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958026, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1673795875791611", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674997780642169, "time": 1674997780, "md5": "vhgu+iA0fsrWX4sXqlblhw==", "fsize": 868389, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958033, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1668161218895432", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1674997844067726, "time": 1674997844, "md5": "hnG5MXJG+uK2CzCyfpjwrw==", "fsize": 1468817, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958039, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:11:46", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1664661881458144", "ext": ".webm", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674997906502974, "time": 1674997906, "md5": "sq5Q7rkavj2v9PUMw2rHfw==", "fsize": 784756, "resto": 33955008}, {"no": 33958046, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33958033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33958033</a><br>unironically i spent about 4 hours a few weeks ago looking into this and its the real deal.

Some food-sourced vitamin E supplements provide other forms that are vitamin E-related, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. They constitute the vitamin E complex.

The truth is that our bodies create vitamin E from completely raw natural fats through healthy natural bacterial processing during digestion. If digestion is healthy and uncontaminated, during digestion, our bodies&#039; intestinal bacteria not only fractionate food molecules but redesign them, including the production of vitamin E.

It is an extension of your consciousness while you are resting.<br>2) True interpretation requires intimate knowledge of the minute life of the dreamer and his mind. The dreamer holds the key to interpret his own dreams and figure out the correlation of the events in the dream to the corresponding situations in real life.<br>3) I consider dreams to be immersive &quot;workshops&quot; to work out issues, like a videogame&#039;s practice mode. Actions in dreams do not have consequences once you wake up. No one has ever been hospitalized because of an accident in a dream.<br>4) Dreams are not good or bad omens in and out of themselves. They do not predict the future. They have no hold on real life. They are not external messages from the spirit world*. You will not access &quot;information&quot; you are not already privy to in your real life, although some bits of it that you are aware of may take new forms and be combined and rearranged in creative ways. So-called &quot;prophetic&quot; dreams are either coincidences or self-fulfilled prophecies.<br>*I regretfully include this bit even though I hate to discount the possibility that dreams are a portal to or from an external extraordinary world. I have dreamed of my mother in a very positive way soon after her death and it was very comforting at the time as I believed it was her own soul contacting me.

In other words, you may access your intuition in a more vivid form.<br>6) Dreams are not always about life or death issues, but often about trivial situations. They are no less useful but their importance should not be exagerated.<br>7) Nightmares have a very positive connotation for the dreamer and should be embraced. They are simulations which prepares you psychologically for future difficulties and challenges. If you wake up from a nightmare and feel relieved that it is over, consider your day blessed.<br>8) Not all details in a dream have a profound meaning. There is a lot of randomly generated &quot;noise&quot; that is not worth pondering about, especially if you have no special emotional reaction to it within the dream. Dreams are not David Lynch movies, mathematical equations or puzzles to be solved, even though they certainly are cryptic, fickle and frustrating to interpret.<br>9) A good first step to interpret a dream is to focus on your emotional responses within them.

Atleast the version we know was disbanded by the Gestapo (like all secret societies in germany) and it&#039;s founder Rudolf von Sebottendorf deported back to his turkey (he was half turkish). The only influence the Thule society had was that the dear friend of Hitler, Rudolf Hess and also Alfred Rosenberg were former members, there might however been (or still be) a more secret part of it, and only the exoteric mainstream part was disbanded. I also read several accounts of a whole tibetan Legion defending the F\u00fchrerbunker till their last breath, even after the german chancellor commited suicide, giving the Soviets high losses and as revenge (or for what purpose whatever) being wiped out from history.

If you know that you&#039;re in a tough spot then I&#039;d say ask yourself if you feel you can practice responsibly and be self aware about that? If the answer is no, I would say that you need to create some routines that centre around spiritual and mental hygiene, then revisit this in a month. Hygiene could be only delving into the occult or divination for just a few set hours a day and redirecting your thoughts the rest of the time. It could also mean meditation, or taking responsibility for other areas you&#039;ve been neglecting. I say that because divination will not help you feel in control of your life on it&#039;s own, it just gives more information to work with.<br><br>There could be other forms of divination you could explore too. I really like bibliomancy as a more lowkey alternative to tarot that doesn&#039;t involve so much interpretation and can get you in touch with your intuition. <br><br>A few things I&#039;ve found are important; being able to ground yourself, finding a balance between logic and emotion, opening yourself up to diverse experiences, thinking in a dialectical way, separating yourself entirely from readings if they&#039;re for another person. Doing readings for yourself, with a limit of say, one a day is a good way to start out learning and using your intuition. It should be a self reflection exercise though to start with.<br><br>It&#039;s very typical advise but meditation can really help you find the presence of mind needed to regulate and present enough to receive information through divination with clarity.", "time": 1675201911, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976435, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:52:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976356</a><br>Could you just tell me a thing that would be in my own highest interest to know?", "time": 1675201923, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976453, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976105</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5oH, QoD</span><br><br>Yes, it is.<br><br><a href=\"#p33976344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976344</a><br>I don&#039;t want to know.", "time": 1675202045, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976462, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:55:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976356</a><br><a href=\"#p33976284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976284</a><br><br>Can you this one, please.", "time": 1675202158, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976463, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:56:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976433</a><br>Meditation will pay dividends outside of spiritual practice too.", "time": 1675202173, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976469, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)16:57:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976391</a><br>There\u2019s so much suffering and self-destruction going on, it\u2019s bonkers", "time": 1675202254, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976486, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:00:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976469</a><br>Yeah, everyone is doing it except the one they hate.<br>;)<br>Whoda thunk it?", "time": 1675202415, "resto": 33975994}, {"no": 33976489, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:00:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33976356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33976356</a><br>Should I quit this job?

While I was always attracted to women, I really didn&#039;t felt it was a priority during say, college life, to the point that I would cut my relationships rather abruptly at the first sing of inconvinience. I can actually pin point the moment that I became somewhat obsessed with the idea of &quot;needing&quot; someone to share my life and it came out of the realization of how motivating it was for me. It&#039;s in good part a selfish desire, ironic to consider that I want to give the best of me to someone as selfish, but fundamentally I think it is because it does brings out the best of me and thats perhaps what i seek moreso than everything else.
