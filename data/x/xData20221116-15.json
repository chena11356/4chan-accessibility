The story goes a supposed witch was killed in Georgia a long time ago and her spirit haunted the graveyard and at 3 am things get really crazy. There is a one car bridge leading in and out of the graveyard which makes it scarier. We got there and found the grave not much happened but there was a very eerie feeling and my skeptic friend was laughing and mocking the witch and the whole time. He even pulled down his pants and mooned the grave and was slapping his butt\u2026. Anyways we leave and go back into the city (it\u2019s now 4:30am ish) the mocking friend who was also a pro level skateboarding/snowboarder/rollerbla<wbr>der and he was riding a skateboard.

For example, goats are very hierarchical. if the lead goat in a herd is very fond of human attention and you were to go in and give other goats attention first, it would ram the other goats and chase them away so that it could get all of the attention. Same with food, it can be difficult to make sure everyone gets equal food when you are feeding them yourself because the head goat will want ALL of it and will bash and chase the other goats. Generally when feeding you want to bring the top goats away from the others to feed them first then feed the others while the top goat or few goats are eating and keep them distracted until the smaller goats finish.

I have a theory: our cameras.<br><br>You know how it&#039;s weird how something so mysterious and impossible somehow only gets caught on shitty cam footage and all the 4k resolution or whatever never gets one? Well, have we ever thought about why that is? Sure, cameras can carry an unusual energy given, at least the analog ones, they&#039;re mirrors bouncing light onto tape. For so long, we only had the art of others to describe what these creatures look like as they had an easier time getting away with it during those years. Ever since cameras came into the picture, they&#039;ve gone further into hiding and things only got worse for them since we invented video cameras. However, if we have this technology now, the fancy shit that allows us to view infrared, heat seeking, or downright nightvision, why can&#039;t we still see them? That&#039;s the issue itself: what we have made now is so far removed from analog cameras and early forms of filming (90s camcorders and VHS recorders) that they probably no longer carry that same unknowable energy as their ancestor tech.<br><br>So what am I thinking? Older forms of filming, from 16 mm film to early camcorders, probably contain that sweet spot of being able to view the supernatural movement while not being so removed from the energy older cameras. Has anyone noticed when you feel &quot;different&quot; when you hold this tech? Sure, it feels weird and alien because its old, but really analyze those feelings. Why do you feel strange? Why does it seem unusual when it&#039;s just an ordinary camcorder? It has to be that sweet spot energy of old and new. It pretty much explains why some of the most &quot;plausible&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; footage of supernatural events online are viewed through the most God awful cameras in the world.", "filename": "2019-05-15 21.13.50-1666225042504", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 215, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1668624267231042, "time": 1668624267, "md5": "eXy/vBZea4j0a4pOq1woCA==", "fsize": 134359, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-cant-we-see-those-dang-supernatural-critters", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 33384422, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:57:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "(2/3)<br>Of course, some parts of the world are behind in tech which could be one explanation, but who would have a shitty enough phone or camcorder in this day and age? Not a lot, so I propose a secondary offshoot to this theory. <br><br>Again, think about it, the most plausible videos that contain supernatural events tend to be so low quality you can&#039;t even understand what you&#039;re looking at? The issue is that these creatures obviously hide themselves in some sort of other dimension that we can&#039;t perceive. However, if they are spotted, what would be the best option for them? Teleport? Memory wipe? No, blur our cameras and dawdle. If they don&#039;t do anything abnormal and act like some blur among the blurs, then a lot of people can easily dismiss it as a fake or &quot;unusual footage.&quot; The ultimate counter to this would be multiple cameras, but who&#039;s to say they&#039;re strong enough to turn off all of them or blur them all conveniently? Wouldn&#039;t that alarm us to their existence? Yes, so they stay in their separate dimension we can&#039;t see to travel and only come out to possibly collect a few resources only found in our world. God knows what they are because we never see them for too long. Then again, who knows why they come out all if there&#039;s more risk than gain? Whatever they&#039;re doing, if they go into areas where they know they&#039;re going to possibly confront humans, it&#039;s better to go into areas that either aren&#039;t technologically advanced or have weak hardware that can be easily manipulated.

Apparently, in my mind, I&#039;m able to realize this girl is someone I&#039;ve read about online, she&#039;s some weird lolcow type of person, she&#039;s got scars all overs herself, she draws weird furry porn or something gross, and she hurts herself in ways like just standing in the road and not moving for cars, hoping they either hit her or the people inside the car get so mad they get out and hurt her. For some reason, my dad decides to bring her with us to this job, to mentor her and help her heal from her issues or something. He doesn&#039;t know what I know about her, so I feel uncomfortable with her around. We&#039;re ripping up carpet and stuff in this house.
