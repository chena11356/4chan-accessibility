This game is this shitty early 2000&#039;s platformer with the most busted graphics. The grass is flat, the textures are shaky to the point of sickness and it just feels off? <br><br>It&#039;s just so stilted. The cutscenes are delivered in the most stilted ways and loading screens between the gaps always hang for a second too long. It&#039;s just built wrong! The music gets weirdly liminal and atmospheric in levels that are undeserving of it, simple snow levels turn into a purgatory of messy level design and off beat music.<br><br>My most recent experience with the game has left me a little shaken. The silence in between the levels has really started to get to me. This game is either deafeningly loud or completely silent. The game has a built in panic button, if it ever gets so loud you can just press triangle and the game will go faint except a angelic chorus. It doesn&#039;t have a reason to be except for the fact it does. It&#039;s uneasy.<br><br>I write this all to explain an encounter I had in the game. In one of the early levels there&#039;s this sound effect, it&#039;s this chicken scream belonging in a childrens cartoon. But it doesn&#039;t stay that way, one by one the voices pile up and make a sound effect of it&#039;s own. The screams layer up into what sounds like a genuine ape scream, the sounds can&#039;t handle being stacked the way they are and they distort. That loud monkey scream turned human, it turned into a human fucking scream. Mort looks at the camera always he does as a blood curdling scream errupts from my tinny speakers. Then the game crashes, I don&#039;t know if the audio was my disk getting caught or something more sinnister.

It&#039;s because while the light field feels great to them, doing anything in it comes at a personal energy cost. I don&#039;t want to say too much because in addition to being a lower administrator of the Illuminati machinery (which i just found out) i learned that to the Google and Apple&#039;s overarching AI systems, me, the nobody, is indeed an important figure (albeit green and untrusted) but i&#039;m really the only guy that can do a building inspection of what they got going on so while skepticism is healthy about me on their end, they already know everything about me to i dont get the handling me with kid gloves thing.

There was a tree near my house and it looked so beautiful when its leaves fell after autumn came. That year I experienced pride because of my good performance at school, but I got jealous of a female classmate. She was aryan, wealthy, smart, very talkactive, and dressed in pretty blouses. I absolutely hated her at the time. I still hate that people like that exist, while I stay poor and lonely. Just because I wasn&#039;t born in a supportive and rich family, because I don&#039;t have straight blonde hair and green/blue eyes, because I don&#039;t have stable mental health like those who smile to others and engage in social interactions, because I have to fake a normal attitude and physical posture if I want to seem normal while I avoid trembling and moving weirdly outside, and struggle with paranoia.

I came here about a year ago out of curiosity, started actually trying to learn about LoA around November and have been lurking these threads regularly for about a month now. I tried SATS and envisioned us getting back together, I saw her messaging me, apologizing, I saw our relationship being more stronger after this than I could ever think possible. After seeing many synchronicities in my 3D, I gave in and decided to reach out first. We&#039;re talking now but she&#039;s nowhere near the same with me anymore. She told me she appreciates me and everything I do for her, she likes me still but she can&#039;t get over our argument. I&#039;ve reflected a lot on my past and realized my mental state when manifesting things in the past. I&#039;ve always had a negative self concept. I&#039;ve always had that mentality of &quot;always assume the worst that way you can be pleasently surprised when things actually go your way&quot;, and now I&#039;m struggling with my approach. I&#039;ve always had everything come to me, despite being negative. Wether it was money, women or material things. Now that I&#039;m actively seeking a result, I seem to not get it. The problem here is that I can consciously manifest other things easily. I&#039;m 100% certain I manifested my girlfriend to begin with, she was the one that reached out to me, she was the one that was flirting with me, she was the one that asked me to be her boyfriend, I never had to do anything. My question is how? If I was negative about myself back then, even to the point of actively pushing her away, then why am I struggling so much now that I&#039;m conscious about all this? When I tell you guys you don&#039;t have to do a single thing for your manifestations I mean it. Even when I was younger (13-14) I&#039;d always have girls just flock to me.

Now your semen can be reabsorbed to a point, but eventually production will outpace absorption.<br><br>You WILL nut whether you like it or not, because your genitals wish to impregnate a female and that&#039;s their purpose beyond being a canal for urinary waste.<br><br>Semen retention can be helpful to regulate hormones, improve libido, and help wean off dopamine overload. But if done too long can raise other issues like wet dreams, abnormally high aggression, hormonal imbalances, and of course prostate damage through under use.<br><br>Nutting is good, but only if not done too much. Too much can harm you, too little can harm you. It&#039;s like water, you wouldn&#039;t stop drinking water for a few days to &quot;cleanse&quot; your system would you? No, you wouldn&#039;t.

Tame the beast to improve yourself for it IS part of you, don&#039;t cage it to atrophy and wane. But also do not let it rule you.<br><br>From a biological standpoint, it&#039;s balance that&#039;s needed. From a spiritual standpoint, same thing. Though the options you got are more flexible there.<br><br><br>In my case i absorb my own sexual emissions when nutting on the immaterial level thus denying other entities the pay off of feeding on me.

There were also attempts at crashing into their car to drive them off the road.<br><br>- The owner of the building is not concerned about the screams when called, but suspiciously wants to know every detail about the tunnels that Tait discovered, and parts of these are quickly filled in (don&#039;t know the details).

And if those who recognise Mysticism as the highest truth are content to leave it in its original utter mystery, their conduct only proves that for them too, as well as for their antagonists, thinking means abstract identification, and that in their opinion, therefore truth can only be won by renouncing thought, or as it is frequently expressed, by leading the reason captive.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But, as we have seen, the abstract thinking of understanding is so far from being either ultimate or stable, that it shows a perpetual tendency to work its own dissolution and swing round into its opposite.

Witches who belong to covens are usually not the friendly ones, and have sinister motives. This is because when witches gather in covens, their powers increase exponentially to their numbers. Witches in covens become magically dependent on each other (their mentral cycles will even sync) and if one is seperated from the coven for an extended period the seperated individual will weaken and so will the overall coven due to having one less member. Most succesful covens usually adhere and support the goals of a secret witch triumvirate. This trio consist of three very old and very powerful witches who manipulate world affairs in their favor and are supported by the Illuminati. The triumvirate was popularized in horror movies because Dario Argento read a collection of esoteric essays which mentioned the contrasting element to Levana goddess of childbirth and giving life (three fates and graces) and told of the Three Sorrows instead. The ladies of sorrow each personify an element of death. Sighs, Tears, and Darkness. Together they make up the opposites of life, fate, and grace. They are very evil and very real. <br><br>The non-evil witches are usually just individuals who don&#039;t belong to coven and get into witchcraft from family culture and either spend time making herbs and collecting crystal or using their magic to make a little cash through fortune-telling, being spirit mediums, or doing cleansings. These good or neautral witches however are less magically powerful than the evil ones that belong to the covens because of their individuality and their lack of spiritual/magical proximity to the Three Sorrows.", "time": 1675487038, "resto": 34001963}, {"no": 34002200, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)00:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34002129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34002129</a><br>How do I become a witch?

So I should preface by saying that I was fairly high off of this joint, we smoked on top of a mountain and my friend was driving down it really fast, I was scared shitless and honestly thought I was going to die, so in the backseat of the car I began trying to astral project, which I have never successfully done before, as I was sitting there I started to evaluate my sitting posture, and how it seemed almost &#039;loaded&#039; in my lower back, as if there was lots of compression in the area. I began to try and shift my lower back, legs and core into a position which felt the most parallel with the rest of my spine. After a bit of adjusting I found a spot which felt comfortable, and as I sat there for a few seconds, I started to feel energy around my testes/gooch area, I straightened my posture a little more and the energy started pulsating up my spine and into all of my bones, I could feel the energy flowing through my whole body, down into my toes and into my fingers. By this point I started receiving intuitive thoughts of how powerful this form of energy was, and as I focused on the origin of the energy source, I could feel more of it being created (the creation point being my testicles). A thought then came to me relating to male growth, and how using this form of energy would help my body grow, both physically and spiritually. Needless to say this experience has changed my perspective on the importance of posture and semen retention. While sober today, I have felt this energy source very faintly, and have started working on improving my posture, from research online, it should take a few months due to how long I have neglected it for.<br><br>Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I noticed immediately that he looks just like Greg Eisenberg who is the namesake of Heisenberg on Breaking Bad. He was my massage therapist for a while (for sports massage, not handjobs) and he told me he used to be in &quot;ladies&#039; footwear&quot; before he got into massage. I took that to be a euphemism for narcotraffic which contextualizes his place on Breaking Bad. (Gus Fring was named after Helene &quot;Gutfreund,&quot; Gus wears Helene&#039;s glasses, he is an effeminate weirdo because he&#039;s playing a woman, the name of his company Madrigal references Helene&#039;s identity as &quot;mom girl,&quot; etc.) In his massage studio, Greg had some mirrored plaque on the wall that said LIVE like a motivational poster but more decorative. In the mirroring, or maybe in the mirror on the opposite wall, it said EVIL. At the time, I wrote it off as coincidence but now I don&#039;t. I had already noticed that David Solomon became the new Goldman Sachs CEO due to his familial connections to Greg,and there was too much music in one place when I noticed this thing with Jimmy Iovine too. (David Solomon also works the nightlife as DJ D Sol.) Even the &quot;IO&quot; and &quot;EI&quot; prefixes to Iovine and Eisenberg seems suspect.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the music producer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the album</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the DJ</span><br><br>https://symmetrysportsmassage.com/a<wbr>bout", "filename": "TIMESAND___Iovine3", "ext": ".png", "w": 1518, "h": 1278, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1675542108781429, "time": 1675542108, "md5": "mnzgl3Zv+GXBGCmPwIDtgg==", "fsize": 3939158, "resto": 34005295}, {"no": 34007027, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:30:25", "name": "OP", "com": "Bump", "filename": "1664571228024338", "ext": ".png", "w": 570, "h": 900, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675546225579001, "time": 1675546225, "md5": "oxqbUSQfEbja9KkBgCz3mw==", "fsize": 113505, "resto": 34005295}, {"no": 34007177, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:52:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34005427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34005427</a><br>I think he&#039;s right. the target is coded text", "time": 1675547530, "resto": 34005295}, {"no": 34007184, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:53:43", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p34007177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34007177</a><br>I&#039;m not sure I understand, I just encrypted what the tasking was.

The history is quite fascinating though. The framework of Jesus&#039; life story comes from a plot by the radical Essene cult. Since the time of the revolt against the Greeks, the Essene were the kingmakers among the ultra-nationalists. The Zealots were a sub-group devoted to acting when violence was the most efficient tool for the Essene. This also meant they controlled parts of the Temple priesthood including the legitimate bloodline heir to the High Priest anointment. During the &quot;Jesus&quot; affair, the Essene planned to use an infant born from Jews of the priestly and kingly clans along with a bloodline heir High Priest claimant to launch a rebellion against the Roman controlled illegitimate government by establishing a government in exile with propaganda for a savior king of prophecy and the real High Priest. Amusingly, they sent their child stooge to Egypt for safekeeping and the Gnostic Jews in Egypt inducted him into their Mystery School. It&#039;s staring everyone in Christianity in the face, twice. Lazarus &quot;dies&quot; and gets put in a tomb; Jesus gets told and waits with no hurry to go rez him; after three days, he pulls Lazarus out of the tomb and he has had a transformative spiritual experience. Jesus &quot;dies&quot; and gets put in a tomb; he stays for three days and then emerges after a transformative spiritual experience. This is the exact pattern of the Mystery School initiatory rites where the aspirant is induced to an altered state of consciousness and undergoes a shamanic journey through ritual death and burial. &quot;Jesus&quot; decided to use the Essene scheme to make him a rebel king to stir up just enough trouble that he could make a deal with Pilate to get a ritualized torture, death, and burial which would suit his ascension to a higher level of consciousness. The nationalists are left with their king in exile apparently dead and a bunch of Gnostics are preaching about universal spirituality.", "time": 1675536414, "resto": 33992856}, {"no": 34006026, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)13:57:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The history of christianity from that point is a farce.

But along comes a Roman aligned Jew named Saul who is familiar enough with the culture of their world to recognize a Mystery Cult when he sees it. He jumps into the Essene moshpit and starts yanking the universalist cords in the &quot;Jesus&quot; myths to steer the movement away from Jewish nationalism. The Bible directly states all of the conflict between Saul and the &quot;early church&quot; (again remembering that the real disciples were the Gnostics who had already been shut out of the factional re-ordering of the mob of believers who had been assembled around &quot;Jesus&quot; by the Essene), yet christcucks just obediently slurp up the &quot;history&quot; that Saul was really totally inspired by the Spirit even despite all those differences he had with the other people who were also really truthfully divinely inspired.

I don&#039;t think Europeans brought over disease. European immune systems and Native American immune systems aren&#039;t that different. And if you dig into the genetic Haplogroups of both groups (more specifically the mutations that define specific Haplogroups) a solid argument can be made that contact between Europe, Asia, and the Americans was almost near constant. And the easiest genetic Haplogroup that supports this point is MDNA X. The Americas was probably wiped something between 1000 and 1200 AD. This is when most populations disappeared and your major cities and megaliths were &quot;abandoned.&quot; There was also a group specifically targeting some of the Natives. Chaco Canyon had some solid evidence of cannibalism from an invading population and around the time it was &quot;abandoned,&quot; the Viking Alif (really a Phonecian sigil) popped up among the Natives in the area. The truth is a lot more wild than we can ever imagine, it just doesn&#039;t involve mud flood high schools. My take, this goes all the way back to the Epic of Gilgamesh where the Gods decided to keep humanity around but limit their lifespans. Aging is really about the immune system attacking the body (literally what arthritis is) and for some reason, your body just shuts down over time. We shouldn&#039;t really age and, with the exception of traumatic <br>injury, we should be immortal.

Wanna share a story of my first success. Last night I tried letter method. It was a flop, I couldn&#039;t find any candles, just burnt a letter without cooming, I couldn&#039;t relax properly, was in doubts. So after short meditation attempt I just went to bed and coomed to porn. But tonight definitely somethin happened. It&#039;s 4:48 am as I type this post. Roughly at 1:32 I did the letter ritual again, but in a more proper way. Again, I couldn&#039;t find any candle, so I made one myself about 2 hours beforehand. Heated a piece of solid lamb fat in microwave, poured it into half of plastic cup, put a wick made from 4 cotton threads twisted together and put this candle in a fridge, to let fat become solid again. Wrote a letter, a short one, &quot;Lilith, send to me one of your daughters tonight, let her give me night of passion,&quot; etc. Went to thebathroom, lit a candle there, whispered: &quot;Lilith, take this offering, I give it sincerely and thougtfully&quot;. I was feeling awkward and felt doubts, like &quot;omg i sound stupid when I whispering with that squealing voice&quot;. Nevertheless, I sat on the toilet next, and started to jerk off on the letter, trying to imagine succubus&#039; appearance that I wanted. [spoiler] And I wanted strong muscular tan skinned girl but it didn&#039;t work :( [/spoiler] Coomed on the letter, lit the letter from the candle, burned it in a bowl, while whispering &quot;Let this light guide your daughter to me&quot;. Cleaned the mess, then tried to meditate in bathroom but it was cold as fuck in there, so I grabbed a candle and moved to kitchen. While meditating I thought that maybe I should focus on something important, maybe my lust I was feeling at the moment. But my mind was wandering so I just stared at the candle flame and focused my attention on the breath rhythm. After about 5 minutes I started feeling awkward and stupid again, but ignored those thoughts and decided to give it 5 more minutes.

Then I felt movement of my hands. Gently my hands turned outward, so now they were lying on my hips, palms faced up. Then my finger began bending, like I wad holding something. I immediately thought that it was like I was holding someone&#039;s hands. I must note here, that this.movement was very awkward and stiff, like someone was screwing off very old, rusted nut. Also my hands moved by one joint at a time, one finger at a.time, like kid playing with an action figure or a puppet. So I said &quot;Thank you for coming&quot;, blew out the candle and went to bed. And then I fell asleep. And some time later I woke up and myself lying on the back and humping the air. My buttocks were clenching, thrusting my pelvic up and down. I didn&#039;t feel any arousal, though I had somewhat hard erection. I couldn&#039;t control this movement at first, and it also was very stiff and tight, unnatural. Only buttocks were involved. Clench, relax, clench, relax. I tried to take control of movement and air-banging stopped. Then I tried to do it myself on my own will, and movement was different. I relaxed, said mentally &quot;Go on, I am yours&quot;. Air-banging started again. Rhythm was changing from time to time, my hands moved to my chest, like by control of some puppeter, they just bend at the elbows with the same stiff movement, like moving my body was a hard task. I didn&#039;t see any image, so I said (again, just mentally) &quot;show yourself&quot;, but nothing happened. Then I asked does she (or it have a name) and listened to my thoughts, something like &quot;Mera&quot; appeared in my head. From time to time I felt how my spine was bending back, and mouth was salivating as hell. Like I was toddler who is going to make bubble. It continued for quite some time but I didn&#039;t feel slightest sexual arousal. Then I offered her a signal system: bending my left elbow was a &quot;yes&quot;, bending a right one was a &quot;no&quot;.", "time": 1675566182, "resto": 34002617}, {"no": 34009269, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)22:04:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34008915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34008915</a><br><a href=\"#p34009257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34009257</a><br>I asked a couple of pauses, to take off my trousers, as soon as I did it, my right hand was moved to groin, so I grapped my cock. And hand began to move, jerking me off. It was stiff rough movement, kinda slow but with hard rhythm. Can&#039;t say I felt much pleasure , pace was so odd, strokes were so sharp that it hurt a little. But while I was jerking off (or rather something was jerking me off) pelvic thrusts became harder and sharper. About hour and half were passed, I asked her &quot;will you go away after&quot;, and my right forearm moved up and then dropped down three times. So it was a clear &quot;no&quot;. I freaked out. I asked it &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; And again, &quot;no&quot; . . <br>And if you read up to this point, I know ot sounds like fantasies of some kid who gone insane from puberty, but it happened mere hours ago as I type it. I gave her an offer &quot;If I will help you to satisfy yourself, will you go?&quot; My left forearm dropped one time, but I felt like it was very reluctant &quot;yes&quot;. So she again moved my right hand to groin, I grabbed to my cock, she started jerking off, it hurted as hell, so I pleaded to move it in my own pace. I felt how my arm relaxed a little, so I began to jerk. Pelvic thrusts became stronger and faster, my dick popped out of my fist a couple of times. Then there were climax. It was similar to orgasm, I felt spasm in all my muscles, though there was no ejaculation. Then I thanked her for this time with me, and asked to leave. To make sure I said something like &quot;job for which you were called is finished. You can go with peace. Thank you for your help&quot; Only then I felt I have full control of my body. Strange feeling. While this dry orgasm I didn&#039;t feel satisfaction or joy , rather annoyed <br>&quot;finally it&#039;s over&quot;. Feel like whatever it was just did feed off me and ran away.

And if those who recognise Mysticism as the highest truth are content to leave it in its original utter mystery, their conduct only proves that for them too, as well as for their antagonists, thinking means abstract identification, and that in their opinion, therefore truth can only be won by renouncing thought, or as it is frequently expressed, by leading the reason captive.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But, as we have seen, the abstract thinking of understanding is so far from being either ultimate or stable, that it shows a perpetual tendency to work its own dissolution and swing round into its opposite.

Thus the reason-world may be equally styled mystical \u2013 not however because thought cannot both reach and comprehend it, but merely because it lies beyond the compass of understanding.</span>", "filename": "hegel1", "ext": ".png", "w": 807, "h": 315, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1675586324312283, "time": 1675586324, "md5": "1HlMdfwzVnLo7JKdiFmSZQ==", "fsize": 392363, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hegel-the-rational-mystic", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34009868, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)23:48:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What`s the best book about ufos with ilustrations to read before sleeping?<br>Kinda looking for more narration than stuff like passport to magonia or the 8th tower.", "filename": "download", "ext": ".png", "w": 231, "h": 219, "tn_w": 231, "tn_h": 219, "tim": 1675572517490010, "time": 1675572517, "md5": "vqADKFENFHeeFcRFiCsgAA==", "fsize": 13007, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-the-best-book-about-ufos-with-ilustrations", "replies": 10, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 34010042, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)00:19:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34009868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34009868</a><br>Mothman Prophecies<br>Dr. David Jacobs&#039; books<br>Forbidden Science<br>John Mack&#039;s books<br>Flying Saucers of the Illuminati<br>Behold a Pale Horse", "time": 1675574359, "resto": 34009868}, {"no": 34010059, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)00:22:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34009868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34009868</a><br>Zoom-zoom.", "time": 1675574522, "resto": 34009868}, {"no": 34010089, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)00:27:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34010042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34010042</a><br>Thanks, I`ll check them out<br><a href=\"#p34010059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34010059</a><br>I`ve already read most Keel and Vall\u00e9e plus a bunch of report cases.

This comes partly from a belief that anarchical inter-elite competition (which existed before WW2) leads to too much instability. Elections are means for these factions to get a fair shot at having &quot;their turn&quot; in charge of the system. We really do have a democracy of sort, but it&#039;s a democracy for the elites, not for the masses.

Why there are untouchable &quot;golden calves&quot; that never go away regardless how much the public is against it. Because these are the untouchable policy pillars on which there is inter-elite agreement. Very rarely does the elite budge on these things.

This includes &quot;alternative news&quot; sources, such as more extreme &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;left wing&quot; sources.
