Rowling is an Illuminati Monarch slave - she is an actress who has hardly put pen to paper regarding the Harry Potter books. The original author of the first four books hasn&#039;t seen a penny from it. Rowling was only ever a puppet actress to dupe the media, and wasn&#039;t allowed to keep 99% of the money generated from this massive industry. The real author of Harry Potter created the hellish prison &#039;Azkaban&#039;, including \u2018the dementors\u2019, after horrific mind control programming. It was based on her experience in Azerbaijan. Another note, Rowling was also present at the Templar rite in which Madeleine McCann died - hence her offer of a reward in public, was all the more sickening. What have the Harry Potter books got to do with all of this? They are a thinly disguised allegory for the Illuminati PSI projects run by British Intelligence and immortalised in fiction. All of the torture and abuse prettified into a fairytale. Rowling was on one of the courses but is still under mind control and being used to write it all up for future generations as programming scripts. See Alice in Wonderland, Three Men in a Boat\u2026my aim is to expose the reality upon which this mythical and \u2018magical\u2019 story is based. The reality was the MI6 Illuminati mind control program, not located at \u2018Hogwarts\u2019 but Fort Monckton. The Harry Potter books are all about re-writing the most hideous torture and abuse which went on during the Illuminati mind control program.&quot;<br>- Ex MI6<br>https://textbin.xyz/?afa6f1bae070c6<wbr>13#6CusCHXyrs9gc4xRSY9tLYgLbXUNX2bD<wbr>2E4di6Gh9Fm6", "time": 1673452719, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33815330, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)12:56:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I feel the warp over taking me.", "time": 1673459761, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33815356, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)12:59:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33815330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33815330</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hold fast </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this will pass</span>", "time": 1673459942, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33815411, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)13:05:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33815356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33815356</a><br>It is a good pain.", "time": 1673460350, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33816349, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:02:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33801386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33801386</a><br><a href=\"#p33798514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33798514</a><br>The dudes who made 40k were history nerds and made soup out of anything they liked in their game lore. you can even find hints to religious or occult and such.", "time": 1673470949, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33816475, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:20:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of it is based on history so youre right just in a very dumb way <br>all the chaos gods are based on pagan gods <br>they even have a &#039;council of nikea&#039; for christs sake, how much more obvious could the inspirations be? youre not retarded are you? then again this IS /x/....", "filename": "images", "ext": ".png", "w": 187, "h": 270, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673472056770158, "time": 1673472056, "md5": "9e3xpfk7iCW9oqhB9PtUog==", "fsize": 10880, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33816522, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33804205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33804205</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Warhammer Fantasy is the world before the Younger Dryas.</span><br>normie take. the real truth is that warhammer fantasy is actually set even further into the future than 40k. its thousands of years after humanity started to win again in 50k and take back some land, the aliens and heretics all banded together and stages a mass invasion of terra, the incredible warp storm from all the demons and chaos fleets and all their crazy demon magic going off creates a warp storm that engulfs most of the galaxy leaving terra as the last uncontaminated world, now thriving with alien life forms (elves, orcs, lizardmen) failed astartes experiments (ogres, giants) mutated native life (beastmen and skaven) and the primitive remnants of the imperium of man and their chaos rivals (reikland, bretonnia, cathay, norsca and the other chaos tribes)", "filename": "1627615947422", "ext": ".png", "w": 1264, "h": 987, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1673472502769514, "time": 1673472502, "md5": "RkrpfhTrAh06Ujp2O4NrVQ==", "fsize": 1246747, "resto": 33798514}, {"no": 33817026, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)17:47:42", "name": "S.L.M", "com": "40K pushes the pagans bad narrative in their lore and they are very sutle about it, pagan deities are nearly all seen as bad in 40k, bu8t also pushes the orks bad and maries good narritive., and elder is netural chaos teir, and tau also netural good, and dark eldar is evil teir<br><br>even makes the forces of chaos seem less than against dark eldar or some of the inqustors<br>the inqustion.<br>the same people who destroyed my home<br>:(<br><br>well the character called the anicent is me ofc.<br>as you can tell i nver have a main role in any story<br>i think my son is the emperior.<br>the whole story shows my fall from grace.<br>its rather sad.<br>you humans calling hell the warp storm is funny af.<br><br>irl its not nearly as hostile as the game though.<br>but yeah all the chaos deities are real.<br>so is the eldar and the tau and all the others.<br><br>i think the only fake one is the orks.

I thought they were just stupid, but that&#039;s far too great a reduction. The reality is that they are more or less your garden variety conspiracy theory enthusiasts with a few noticeable differences. For one, they operate entirely emotionally. They literally don&#039;t care that none of their arguments stand up to scrutiny, because when you inevitably tear it down logically, that&#039;s just proof you are a fed or a disinfo agent etc. Another difference I have noticed is that many conspiracies emerge as what I would call an &quot;incentive rumor.&quot; Basically, everyone can agree there is more than enough incentive for something like Epstein getting killed before he blabs. Lots of conspiracies emerge because people will start speculating about precisely who the incentive belongs to and why. However, flat earth has no other incentive than something totally ridiculous like &quot;globe makers are taking your money!&quot; as if someone would create the most sophisticated conspiracy in existence just to keep raking in those fivers for the wish.com plastic globes. There&#039;s no logical incentive for their to even be a conspiracy. Yet, to flat earthers, it&#039;s the most important conspiracy because it potentially yields the most significance in terms of attacking an established orthodoxy; the probability of it being accurate is completely immaterial to them. Flat earth is essentially a matter of faith, and that&#039;s why you can&#039;t ever successfully convince a flerfer they are stupid.

Well, I guess in a sense it is, as I said in the OP, the &quot;equation&quot; must equal to zero, nothing, otherwise we need to add a seperate being to explain how anything exists at all, but then we need to explain that being which puts us in a loop. But things are not based on nothing, everything is based on consciousness, we can be sure of this because our own existence is the only thing we can know for sure, everything else might be an illusion but an &quot;I&quot; must exist. We may disagree on the definition of consciousness of course, but at the end of the day it must be conceded that there is some kind of awareness that exists.

Chicken and pigs store polyunsaturated fats due to how they are fed, if you&#039;re getting your meat from a farm where the animals are fed well, then there&#039;s no problem but if you&#039;re getting your meat from a market then you should go for leaner cuts.<br>My diet is focused on having as little inflammation as possible and keeping the metabolism running at full speed at all times.<br>Your condition is very unfortunate and the best option indeed seems to be to get rid of all inflammatory foods. You need to drop all seed oils immediately. All plant oils except olive oil and coconut oil are toxic, sunflower is one of the worst. Seeds are all toxic, they are the most defended part of a plant, they offer no nutrition at all and can even be deadly sometimes (cyanide). <br>The evil of these oils can&#039;t possibly be summed up in one post but here are some reasons. <br>They are bad because they are polyunsaturated. They slow down your metabolism, promote fat storage and unsaturate your overall fat composition. PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) cause free radicals to form in your body, think of it like a wave of fire consuming your cells and using them as fuel to spread further throughout your entire body, the inflammation caused by free radicals is directly responsible for atherosclerosis. Heart disease would decrease by 99% if humans stopped consuming PUFAs.<br>You should use saturated fats for cooking, animal fats like butter, tallow, ghee etc. Coconut fat is saturated and is very good for the metabolism. You can use olive oil to cook but try to keep the temperature as low as possible. <br>I&#039;m perfectly confident the diet advice I&#039;ve given so far is correct and I&#039;d definitely put my children on such a diet. <br>Wellbeing isn&#039;t all about diet, yes but diet is the foundation everything else is built upon, as long as your diet sucks, you&#039;ll come crashing down eventually.", "time": 1673472444, "resto": 33808289}, {"no": 33816524, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:28:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33815997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33815997</a><br><a href=\"#p33816513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33816513</a><br>Here&#039;s what I usually eat in a day to give you an idea:<br><br>-6 eggs, fermented sausage, white cheese, coffee and honey for breakfast<br>Orange juice and carrot salad in between meals<br>-100mg of magnesium, some milk and honey before work out<br>-Around 100g of honey mid work out<br>-1-2 litres of milk after work out<br>-Some healthy dessert, I&#039;ve been having lots of coconut cookies lately<br>-A cup of coffee and some honey <br>-700g of red meat, usually fatty ground beef, 500g of baked potatoes, carrot salad, orange juice and dessert for dinner OR a big serving of an organ meat like liver instead of ground beef.

I&#039;m pretty sure Catholicism has the same thing, that you can deny the faith verbally to save your life as long as you don&#039;t deny it inwardly.<br><br>Shias, Twelver Shias anyway, expand taqiyya waaay beyond that. Their books even say things like &quot;taqiyya is 3/4&quot; of the religion.

If you accuse a Sunni who didn&#039;t grow up in the West and isn&#039;t on the English speaking internet much of doing taqiyya, they&#039;ll be very confused.<br><br>Besides taqiyya, Sunnis can lie in 3 situations afaik.

It might suggest to become more reclusive and avoid that person. Maybe it will steer you to hate that person and attack them so that they go away. It could even make you think that you want the person dead. At the heart of it all, your ego is correct in that you don&#039;t want to be around that person, but your duty is to reel in the ideas that it creates reactively.</span><br>But the fact that I can both actually desire to either &quot;murder&quot; that person or have him move to another city where he has a nice life and I wont ever see him again, does that not imply the need for categorization of desires?

A grand piana, Boxes of old magazines and clothes. <br> Once emptied out I put my bed down their with my wife who didn&#039;t have a face or voice but just kind of existed. <br> The thing would walk around your bed when you weren&#039;t there or were gone and it would leave large water stained foot prints like that episode of Creepshow where the people come back to kill the mobster who drowned them.<br> There was also an infinite stair case that spiraled upwards and you would literally go insane if you went too far up their. It led to the spiral cone thing but no one made it to the top because it seemed to go on forever. no matter how far you went up you never reached the top but you could quickly just turn around and then be back at the base level even if you walked up a million stairs before.<br> There was so much to the atmosphere and the feeling of constantly being watched and knowing something evil lived their that fucked me up.<br> I&#039;ve had others before too.

They were the size of small cities each of them and they had ropes dangling from them.<br> In that same dream with some help I was able to cross the barrier into the other dimension to save my brother. The thing about the aliens is that they would fill the half of the universe missing with themselves shape shiffiting. So you could think it was your mom you were talking to but your real mom was in the other universe and your talking to an alien.<br> I saved my brother and his mom my step mom and our grandma was there.

Someone said no, but not much else.<br><br>So let me explain why I ask:<br><br>4 beings contacted me in my mind and energetic feeling when I was really high on weed a year and a half ago. 2 of which I was more drawn to. I was told to draw sigils for all 4 of them. They came out through automatic drawing to be pictographic and had their names on the outside like Goetia sigils. <br><br>One of the 2 I was drawn to had a sigil looked like a phallus ejaculating, and had energy of water and fire mixed together for transformation.<br><br>The other had a ghost woman with horns and a Trident pointed at a downward facing star with 5 candles on each point. She seemed to be about Earth, Moon and night energies.<br><br>They said they&#039;d help me or something, but I wasn&#039;t sure what they really were as there was no real major contact made in the first place and not much after.<br><br>Then I had a vision during meditation not related to the 4. Basically a white skinned human-like being with black eyes sat on a chair in front of a river at a cafe. He communicated with me telepathically and said he&#039;d &quot;download&quot; some information through the back of my head because I was seeking wisdom. I consented. A small energetic wave was felt and that was it. Not really abnormal. I thanked it and went to sleep.<br><br>Then a few months later I had the worst mental breakdown where I believed I was a Christian apostate that God decided to cast away for eternal damnation.

Excess of yang needs to dominate everything and assign it an exact role and box to fit into in order for it to be managed. Nothing can be &#039;outside&#039; of the box, because if it is, it has to be brought in and made containable and thus rigid. <br>What really makes this neat to me is that from my point of view it describes our modern world politics very well.

The tunnel awakened an ancient evil. When the rescue team arrived at Church Hill, they encountered a creature covered in blood and holding human skin hanging between its fangs as it leered over the workers. The creature quickly left the scene and ran towards the James River. It was then approached by a group of men, after which it escaped to Hollywood cemetery, where it was said to have hidden in the tomb of W. W.

She was young though I don&#039;t remember her exact age. My mom had me at 20 and she had my mom at a super young age too. I saw the murder but didn&#039;t really understand what happened - it was dark outside and my grandma was taking out the trash when he ambushed her. She was in the hospital for I think 2 days or so before finally dying. My mom always tells me about how I pointed out a woman in a red dress in her room at the hospital so I know this isn&#039;t just a weird memory I made up to cope with her dying. We weren&#039;t allowed in the room, so we were looking through a window at her last moments. For a few years before we moved out of the apartment, I&#039;d experience weird things like feeling something grab my shoulders or touching my hair. I was a sensitive kid physically, I&#039;d cry at like everything, and I remember really getting the shit scared out of me and screaming for my parents because some entity grabbed me. Fast forward to my teenage years and adulthood, and not sure if this has anything to do with my experience as a child, but I&#039;d regularly predict illness and death in the family. One moment I remember in particular was when I was around 15 years old and my aunt had cancer... I had a horrible feeling all day, knowing it happened, and came home to news about her death. She was not the only family member I have accurately guessed their death the day it happens. As an adult, I think about these things less so I don&#039;t really have any recent experiences like this. I am also very desensitized to death at this point in my life, perhaps that has a lot to do with these premonitions fading away, despite death occurring more regularly due to age.

The psycho-spiritual manifestation of you at one particular moment is responsible for the wellbeing and destiny of your soul which cannot readily make its bests interests understood and known to the canal mind. So much of our thought and behaviour is poison to the soul but the carnal mind cares more about immediate pleasure and comfort while being largely ignorant to its detrimental impact. Suicide is the carnal mind in a state of discomfort (pain) reacting by choosing death as a remedy in the erroneous belief that it will be a state of peace or non-existence and this not pain. However, the soul is eternal and will carry on in the spiritual realm and either go on astral safari for a while and eventually reincarnate or go down into captivity in &quot;the middle&quot;/hell. The suffering that was the cause of choosing suicide was being afflicted upon the person because of a large outstanding debt of sin/karma accumulated in their current life or possibly a previous one. Death doesn&#039;t wipe the debt and murdering yourself only incurs a whole lot more debt. The suffering will play out in life or in death and there is no escaping repayment. God&#039;s mercy and grace will discount the debt to a great extent for those who repent and change their ways, humble themselves, appeal for mercy and act merciful and forgiving towards others. Suicide is just a massive lose/lose in any situation.

When we have power over our own lives we are beholden to no power, and a full realization of this fact can unburden someone of a lot of undue suffering. Instead we have people who are afraid to commit suicide they won&#039;t even consider thinking about it and if they are burden as such that the idea arises they will despair at the thought and their fortunes.

We are created as souls from the eternal divine source and are placed in a state of separation from it. By being stripped of completeness and cast into a state of ignorance, impotence and finiteness we are given the gift of discovering and regaining our infinite, unified nature, experiencing all its beauty, awe and majesty as if for the first time. It is a long journey and transcends a single mortal life. From here you can&#039;t readily see the terrain beyond and the greater landscape and journey you are on. Reunification can only be done in the mortal, worldly existence and far from coming easy there are many trials and lessons to learn along the path and it is long and hard. Our one goal that counts is reunification - getting back home. It is unimaginably greater than any experience that can be had in this world and we must do it. So using every bit of mortal life you are granted to pursue the spiritual path is paramount. Suicide is throwing it away and achieves nothing good. It&#039;s not laudable or courageous it&#039;s exactly the opposite. Enduring life to its bitter end takes strength of will and resilience. If you feel there&#039;s nothing left for you in life and suicide is rational you have just lost your inspiration, drive and abundance of spirit. Your &quot;cup&quot; is empty so to speak.

Both were on patrol at 1:45 am, when they heard a noise similar to radio interference which later became an acute whistle. When it ceased five minutes later, they spotted an intense bright light in the sky, that lasted 15 seconds. Another guard arrived with a guard dog and all began searching around the area. Eventually, they heard the sound of eucalyptus twigs being broken. The dog was released and rushed to the place where the noise was coming from, but returned sick, a process which was repeated a couple of times. Eventually, the dog started to circle them, (a technique meant to protect guard dogs&#039; handlers). Trejo then allegedly spotted a human-shaped green light to his left. The being was about 3 meters tall. It seemed to be formed of small light points, and the brightness was more intense along its edges. The head was small and covered by something resembling a helmet. The arms were very long and had no apparent hands or feet. Trejo fainted; after which his colleagues opened fire at the creature. 40 to 50 bullets were fired, but the being simply disappeared. While Trejo was being assisted, the same sound as before was heard. The next morning, 50 men searched the whole area but found no bullet casings or bullet holes. However, the Air Force concluded that the soldiers did fire their guns.&quot;<br><br>3 years later, same place:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani<wbr>ses_UFO_incident</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falc<wbr>on_Lake_Incident</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8<wbr>5-tQ2lO_I</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.history.com/news/korea<wbr>n-war-us-army-ufo-attack-illness</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV<wbr>q7gBH70WE</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%<wbr>C3%B4nio_Vilas-Boas</span>", "filename": "1672086928491224", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1120, "h": 4048, "tn_w": 34, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673483765880515, "time": 1673483765, "md5": "0uSjPmg2L4hD/JzMgfd0iw==", "fsize": 996686, "resto": 33817114}, {"no": 33817788, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:40:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33817114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33817114</a><br>Aliens dont give a fuck about humans or earth, sorry. <br>Why would a civilization with superior technology and intelligence beyond our wildest dreams bother interacting with a random colony of ants which is basically what humans are to them?", "time": 1673484016, "resto": 33817114}, {"no": 33817802, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aliens dont give a fuck about humans or earth, sorry.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why would a civilization with superior technology and intelligence beyond our wildest dreams bother interacting with a random colony of ants which is basically what humans are to them?</span>", "filename": "1671044077668186", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1071, "h": 1056, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1673484109382505, "time": 1673484109, "md5": "alhVoNLNs+Pz9Kt3Gdcbog==", "fsize": 455491, "resto": 33817114}, {"no": 33817807, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:42:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33817788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33817788</a><br>Why do humans involve themselves with apes?

For all we know they may have approaches to doing things that are totally different than us or have found materials and energy states we don&#039;t see and as a consequence they developed a very different evolutionary or technology path.<br><br>So the first thing they are likely to do if they come to this planet is to study it as observers (mapping out earth, mutilating cows, etc.). Star Trek was filmed on the McKenna line of thinking that interspacial fungus impregnated the galaxy with humanoid like creatures that evolved over aeons, but there&#039;s no guarauntee that is the case. Life as we have it on this planet might be totally different elsewhere.<br><br>Once they can establish some cultural baselines and understand us, then the first thing they&#039;d do after that study is likely open trade. Humans might, for example, have traded weapons, microchips, radio technology, or fine jewelry, art, plants, animals, or other things the aliens might find precious and they may have traded us a few spacecraft or weapons. Once you get to a certain point of development you&#039;re going to be open to desperate sections of garbage species raiding your planet and that can produce the wrong message. Really depends on how quiet the neighborhood is.<br><br>And then you have the borealis here on earth. The northern and the southern lights. These look different here on earth as opposed to saturn and jupiter because our borealis is made from ionized particles that are charged from the solar wind, and not from gas giant volcanoes. This unique feature on earth is possibly the fuel for alien spaceships. You also have UFOs going into and out of our oceans. Maybe for water or sodium or mercury. Earth might just be their fucking gas station.<br><br>Zeta Reticuli: <br>https://astronomy.com/bonus/zeta", "filename": "Screen Shot 2023-01-07 at 10.00.30 PM", "ext": ".png", "w": 2652, "h": 1482, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1673484323454021, "time": 1673484323, "md5": "WZJoCw8OBFRsrGSZgTqhNA==", "fsize": 3555730, "resto": 33817114}, {"no": 33817837, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:45:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33817828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33817828</a><br>I accept your consnession.", "filename": "dc7p1qc-34b48f88-5ce8-4e2d-9ee1-f7258edf6621", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 645, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673484345285880, "time": 1673484345, "md5": "yq8nDwYEPC1PWXti2mWWYA==", "fsize": 342500, "resto": 33817114}, {"no": 33817850, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)19:48:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33817832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33817832</a><br>You are not remotely interesting to aliens.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

Taking the numbers from google, the moon exerts all of 3 newtons of gravitational pull on the earth. <br>A shit ton of mass, over a bigger amount of distance squared, throw in the GC.<br>That is all of 0.003 m/s acceleration towards the moon. No. You would not feel it.<br>Why do we get tides then? It&#039;s complicated, but basically it comes down to aggregate action on the water.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwC<wbr>hk4S99i4<br>Jump to minute 4 if you want to skip the pre-amble, but long story short: the water at the poles is pushing down towards the earth. But it&#039;s also, ever so slightly, pushing towards the moon because the moon is pulling it.<br>Which is pushing into water molecules that is, likewise, being pulled towards the moon. It&#039;s an aggregate force and that&#039;s why lakes don&#039;t have much of a noticable tidal affect. (The great lakes experience all of 5 centimeters of tidal affect. Amazing, innit?)<br><br>Now, as for the moon being tidally locked with the earth: That&#039;s also true for mercury, which is locked towards the sun.<br>And I think quite a few of Jupiter&#039;s moons. The reason is very simple, the moon is *not* perfectly even with the mass distribution. As such, in the past it may not have been tidally locked, but its rotation has slowed to the point that it is now. Now you might ask: Where did the energy go? The answer is the rotational energy is lost due to internal friction on the moon.<br><br>Also fun fact, the moon in fact does have a (negligable) atmosphere. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmos<wbr>phere_of_the_Moon", "time": 1673411575, "resto": 33808167}, {"no": 33811403, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:36:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33808917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33808917</a><br>...

Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

To give yourself in and let yourself go through the process. I need all of you to bear in mind that you need to know yourself GOOD before you do this, and it can practically be as risky as doing psychedelics. Just because there&#039;s a secondary approach doesn&#039;t mean you should take it, but it also means it&#039;s able to be taken into consideration.

Proponents of this idea should argue that by embracing and accelerating the process of psychosis (or other cognitive-related phenomenon, psychosis doesn&#039;t have to be the only thing that&#039;s involved but it also isn&#039;t really transhumanism), individuals can breakthrough their limitations and approach a better state of being. The most important part of this idea is that it shouldn&#039;t be a singular solution to all psychotic disorders, but rather as an option, unlike some of the other subsets of accelerationism that propose to be &quot;the only one&quot;.

It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs.

I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

Here&#039;s something I wrote a year ago:<br><br>&quot;Sometimes, I like to imagine a world with only men. Arguments would be solved by wrestling, while stating the logical errors in each other&#039;s beliefs to try to make each other falter; only those with sound reason, or great discipline and true dedication to their convictions, could maintain the will to fight, which they would back up with their physical prowess. Superstition would succumb to the muscles of the wise, and any and all endeavours of humanity would be performed with utmost efficiency. Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them. The irony is that I really just have to stop being afraid of myself.<br>I hope that you can overcome yourself, and your fear of men too. There is so much to gain in embracing people&#039;s unique strengths. By working together, we can create a better world; and for that, people have to be different. We have to accept who we are as individuals, and allow others to be, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no parts of men that are an improvement on the female form</span><br>What are you talking about? Men are beautiful. I love their strong muscles, how mature they look with all that facial and body hair, how tall they are.

The implication I&#039;d need a cage, I find insulting; there was no such impulse in me.

About 10 months ago, I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to frot with me, as I was deeply curious what male homosexuality is like, and I worried I&#039;d regret not at least trying it once while I still could. Touching it used to trigger my trauma, and I&#039;d break down crying and be unable to continue; but as I&#039;d recently had a breakthrough in meditation and overcame much of that, I wanted to explore the new possibilities in a positive way. He asked me to be on top since he wouldn&#039;t know what to do, so I lubed us both up, got on top of him, and began to grind my body against his. Having no refractory period and not being used to physical genital stimulation, I came 9 times before I got too tired and sore to continue.<br><br>As we cuddled afterwards, he said it felt very intimate, but not very pleasurable for him, and that he much prefers to stick his dick in of me.

Earlier today, someone asked me to pray for him, and it took me a few minutes to gather my resolve to request Lilith&#039;s assistance. I managed to stay calm by recalling that I&#039;ve never felt malice from her, and that she only helped me get what I wanted.<br><br>What I&#039;ve realised lately is that what I fear isn&#039;t really her, but rather things within myself that I&#039;m afraid of as I don&#039;t understand them, then project outwards onto her. And as those projections don&#039;t appear to be wrong, I come to fear her instead of myself. But then I see her expressing those things that I couldn&#039;t accept about myself in such positive ways instead, and I begin to realise it was my fears that caused those sides of me to come out in the wrong ways in the past. When it&#039;s coming from her in such a calm and dignified manner, she makes it look so natural, and I realise I can be like that too.<br><br>What I thought to be so monstrous and feared, turned out to be womanhood; in the most unapologetic sense, unfiltered by society&#039;s expectations. It&#039;s embarrassing to admit that I got those things mixed up, and it&#039;s honestly a lot to take in. But as I come to understand her, and myself, the fear fades away.<br>Of course, men nor women are inherently good or bad. But people can get so lost as they misunderstand each other, and themselves in turn. If they feel ashamed of things that are perfectly natural, it saddens my heart. It&#039;s useful to know what&#039;s socially acceptable, but people mustn&#039;t lose themselves.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if that relates at all to the fear in your own heart, but I feel like I understand it in a way.

I personally found out that what I thought was depression was actually a parasite feeding on me. Years of therapy and medication didn&#039;t help me but listening to /x/ schizos did. If you started to awaken your kundalini you should have more energy now and thus made yourself more of a target for parasites. Also notice where you get attacked/ notice which chakras they go for and try to close those. There&#039;s decent documentation on how to do that in the jos power meditation pdfs. I imagine turning the chakra around, stopping its spin and pushing it together in a single motion and that usually helps for a few hours although not perfectly. What stopped the attacks was attacking it back so make of that what you will. Also im not sure you can stop the kundalini once it started to awaken and doing nothing can lead to uncontrolled spill of its energy and that can seriously fuck you up.

Its crazy shit to see, but really seems like the polarization of the electromagnetic field. It vibrates at frequencies slow enough for my brain to process, and manifests in form of something like cloudy water, or shiny air. Hard to really describe.

In this particular form of perception I thought of her as Pleiadian, as that seems to be the general shape her mental waves of psychic energy are creating.<br>But in other forms of awareness while I am afk, I see it sometimes more as the arcturian. A formless cosmic conscious emerging from hyperspace to advise me about various telepathic experiences and perceptions that I tend to have. But its connected too, and perhaps exactly that same entity. I know that, because I astral traveled to Arcturus, and in the telepathic conversations since then, they told me about her, and told me she was my twin flame. <br>Once upon a time, I was an Arcturian, long ago.

The thing about the eternal creator/father is it was never created and so is nameless. &quot;Yahweh&quot; is just the phonetic form in english. The name very much refers to God the eternal father/creator in the monotheistic sense and is the same heavenly father that Christ speaks of. Trying to cast YHWH as a different deity to the Christian God is just ignorant, modern day revisionism based on false beliefs and perceptions of the nature of God. Yes God is good and God loves mankind and by this we have grace. By grace, life is good in its totality - it all ends well and is a desirable, precious experience. But its totality involves finite periods of experiencing great evil and severe suffering for necessary purposes - eternal life in blissful paradise has no meaning without having experienced everything that it is not. What seems so cruel, unfair and unjustified in life from our ignorant little incarnate perspective, is in the grand scheme actually our loving God&#039;s gift to us that we will later appreciate. God is both good and evil. All of the evil in life isn&#039;t just by accident - God devised it all. God does horrible, cruel, twisted things to humans, intentionally and without remorse. But they are temporary and even if we suffer death in this mortal form the soul&#039;s continues it&#039;s greater journey. So if YHWH&#039;s (God&#039;s) dealings with men and the trials he puts them through don&#039;t reconcile with a fluffy ideal of God people have conjured up for comfort that is just human ignorance. Modern human notions of entitlement and rights are rubbish. We take God&#039;s grace and mercy totally for granted and don&#039;t think for a second how terrible things really could be.<br><br>The Gnostic Gospel of Phillip summed this up well - &quot;In this world there is good and evil, but the good of the world is not really good and the evil of the world is not really evil.
