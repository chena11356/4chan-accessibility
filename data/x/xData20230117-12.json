But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

This can be done with any spirit. Possession is what happens when someone consciously or unconsciously does this to an extreme level. It&#039;s not really beneficial to do this.

You won&#039;t go wrong spending a year or two going through their books one by one. Other contemporary authors like corwin hargrove and etc. are okay. Older sources I&#039;m familiar with include the Lemegeton, Hygromanteia (sp), greek and egyptian magical papyri, and the heptarchic, elemental, and zodiacal systems of john dee. Generally these aren&#039;t &quot;demon&quot; focused in the christian sense, other than the lemegeton. The 72 demons popularized by crowley operate as part of a larger system involving angels to guide and constrain the energies of the demon, again, GoM has a good rundown.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other sites</span><br>No clue, just go on /omg/ and go into &quot;western occultism&quot; on the Mega, download and read the grimoires there.<br>Don&#039;t be desperate, don&#039;t be an edgelord, don&#039;t be pathetic, don&#039;t be impatient, and don&#039;t be self-deprecatory. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how to contact</span><br>You need to develop your perception. Meditation is a must. Laterally shifting your consciousness without drugs is, too. You can make a sigil of the entity, that&#039;s partly why people like the 72, they have sigils. Mantra works well to facilitate contact for me. Ritualistic trappings can help. You can make talismans to invite the energies for a purpose. eg I like to engrave brass discs with the seal of the daemon on one side, w/ seal of shem hamephorash on obverse.", "time": 1673888465, "resto": 33853543}, {"no": 33858093, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)15:12:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33853543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33853543</a><br>I can\u2019t make threads since I\u2019m IP blocked from doing so so I\u2019ll just post here.<br><br>Why are ancient-forums (JoS) users so offended by everything?

With that in mind:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how is spirit contact experienced?</span><br>depends on the person&#039;s aptitudes and inclinations. For me, there&#039;s 3 or 4 different &quot;levels.&quot;<br>1. do the magic, everything seems like regular, every day life. No feeling of contact, nothing. Purely imaginative responses.<br>2. do the magic, there is a shifting of my perceptions. senses are acute and muddled at the same time. This is usually where I am. If you do any neidan or energy work, and get in the zone, this should be familiar. No need for two way comms.<br>3. do the magic, definite sense of Presence. When I seek evocatory contact, this is where I am. Two way communication is clear, here, for me.<br>4. acute awareness of Presence, coincident with some sort of visual, emotional, and psychological contact. <br>Then there&#039;s 5, which is full power Behold, an actual physical real life entity in front of you clear as day. I&#039;ve never seen a humanoid or animal figure. At most it&#039;s a visual haze, a rushing in the ears, and so on. That&#039;s like 4. I&#039;ve only ever seen or heard what I would call angels, at specific blessed locations. It&#039;s usually more subtle than that, for me.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how do I differentiate between a voice in my head and spiritual contact?</span><br>That&#039;s why meditation is so key. Being able to observe and identify your thoughtstream in real time isn&#039;t hard. There is a distinguishable difference. Those times when I have had two-way communication, or have received inspired insight, and so on, it&#039;s been irrefutable. Example: I sought insight into my life path and what to do.

Unfortunately I don&#039;t feel I know enough about him to comment but you should definitely not be chasing money in my view and this is explained in all the religions. In the bible for example it says seek first spiritual things and then you will achieve everything else but otherwise I think you can take the middle path. I myself would like to be in a secluded place with a monastery but I would even want more privacy apart from other monks and I&#039;m not sure my &quot;style&quot; would get along with others even then as monks seem kinda strict to me. I find the universe will eventually provide for you one way or another.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end. Sometimes we just get too self conscious about it (which is what the mindfulness industry seems to profit off of).", "time": 1673854756, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33854306, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841531</a><br>Exactly.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

So, just in general, I wouldn&#039;t worry about free will, because everyone only has it to a degree (Neville talks about there being a level of &quot;agreement&quot; for any manifestation, Florence talks about how you and others influence and impress each other to some extent).<br><br>If you are thinking about it in terms of karma/morality, then the only thing I&#039;d be concerned about is coming up with the decision that you&#039;re best suited for that person.

I no longer need to associate breath with up and downflow, my breathing needed an additional correction. By expanding my belly out in all four directions in addition to out while keeping the slight vacuum on inhale, then pushing in all directions with exhale, it feels like enough stability if I relax more to feel it moving on its own. Though I got a bit of a quandary now. If you know more about this, it would be nice to help me out since I am going by intuition. This whole time I have been keeping track of like one &quot;bulge&quot; or energy that moves alone the chain/tracks up the spine and down the torso through the dantiens. At some point in the last few minutes instead of one bulge, I feel two now, one on each side at a time, like lower dantien sends one feeling out along my spine at the same time the upper dantien sends one out along my torso, and the enter along the opposite dantien around the same time. Also my limbs and body started feeling lighter after this happened. So is this still the same practice, or did I veer off course now and need some guidance back?

Next you will be telling me how devastating your Wing Chun is. <br>The real Chinese masters are from Taiwan now. This is because they were persecuted by the CCP, and had to flee mainland China. Maybe some of them ended up in Hong Kong, but the best all went to Taiwan. <br>There are some valuable principles in the internal arts but it is not the woo woo people here think it is. The term &quot;internal&quot; is referring to the internal muscles of the body, rather than the muscles of the limbs. It is a gross misunderstanding of Chinese language and philosophy to interpret these things as supernatural abilities. However, I found the Chinese way of describing and training these principles very helpful. The brief lessons I had with a legit internal arts instructor gave me an understanding of several principles that I applied to my own arts. One thing I noticed right away about Chinese internal arts, is that they are very well thought out training methods designed to give you as much ability as possible without damaging your body. They will never defeat someone like Tyson or a great muay thai fighter, but they won&#039;t be brain damaged or crippled by 50 either. They will also absolutely wreck an untrained street punk.<br>There are no magic secrets, Anons. Fighting takes a LOT of hard work, and to be a champion you will ultimately have to destroy yourself. There is nothing on this planet that will make a 98 pound weakling able to defeat a heavyweight MMA champion, empty handed.

As for eating Cro cop kicks, there were a lot of fixed fights in pride, and those kicks, while very powerful, were not necessarily the fight enders you were led to believe they were. In other words, Emelianenko was not using magic, but conditioning and breath control just like Mohammed Ali did to absorb absolutley devastating bodyshots from George Foreman.<br>All of this stuff is a lot easier to understand once you get to an intermediate or higher level in any martial art that involves actual sparring and competition.

Saturn and Jupiter in the 9th house of higher thinking reflect a positive and a negative influence and both of these planets have squares (adversarial relationships) with your 12th house placements that push you towards committing war crimes. The feeling of the worthiness of the cause makes you doubt yourself but also makes you a zealot. Perhaps you&#039;ll regret massacring those civilians in the future.<br>Your 12th house has a square with your 3rd house in which the 12th house is superior, pushing you towards committing war crimes in a practical sense. Your 3rd house placements would be more tied to the practical activities of organising the war crimes - a lot of politician have 3rd house placements. Your moon and your Mars are here, meaning that you put most of your energy into these war crimes and you derive emotional satisfaction from them. Massacres are very important for your emotional health. The square aspect might mean being emotionally conflicted about these acts, however.<br>(This is all a joke btw, I am not reading your chart seriously.

Family plays a very important role in this chart, but family life may be stormy or difficult at times. Please note that this is my own reading and by no means the definitive way to read the chart - many manifestations of a chart are possible. Perhaps you could be a politician or some kind of creator instead, too. Oh yes, the elements and modalities also suggest a very stable and consistent character and energy levels, so you may also prove quite successful, if a bit inflexible and stubborn in the things you do.

One of the people I deeply admire had very strong Taurus placements and he is the most idealistic person I&#039;ve ever seen, so it&#039;s certainly possible - for a lot of other people, &quot;idealism&quot; is just a word or something they think, but with fixed earth signs like Taurus, idealism means inflexibly adhering to your ideal through the greatest storms and arduously working towards its achievement, come what may. It&#039;s an idealism married to determination and hard work.<br>The red lines are called challenging aspects: squares and oppositions. Aspects are links between planets, excluding co-presence and conjunction, which do not have any lines - you have a ton of planets in co-presence, so only your squares from the 2nd to the 5th house light up.<br>There&#039;s a handful of aspect types: outside of conjunction, there&#039;s sextile, trine, square and opposition. The last two are difficult, the middle two are beneficial. Sextiles have a range of 3 houses, squares 4, trines 5, oppositions 7. Your 2nd to 5th house is a range of four, so you have squares between your moon and your 5th house planets. A square is a challenge, but it is not necessarily bad - it causes difficulties that result in events, developments, growth etc. It can produce both good and bad results depending on your actions. These moon squares are the only aspects you&#039;d have from a Hellenistic perspective, which is the perspective I use. They&#039;re the better &#039;negative&#039; aspect to have - oppositions are worse because there&#039;s no way to &quot;resolve&quot; them and there is no action generated from them, the only way to deal with them is to strike a balance between the opposing planets.

You might be onto something, actually. Keep in mind that I am trying to read your chart in Hellenistic whole sign (even though you posted your chart in Placidus). It is interesting though. You don&#039;t quite have a grand cross because the degrees don&#039;t quite align, but you do have a sign-based grand cross, I guess. It&#039;s all mutable signs too, actually - your only non-mutable placement is Venus in Taurus. Honestly, you could probably get a whole professional reading just on this aspect form.<br>Honestly, I am not sure where to start with interpreting this because I&#039;ve never done a grand cross (or a grand cross-like formation) before. I guess the most important things you need to know is that a square is a very energetically intensive placement - conflicts always breeds a lot of movement, and it can lead to powerful feedback loops of growth or destruction, depending on how you direct and control your life. There is definitely a ton of tension, but it can be highly productive tension, if you master it and put it to work for you. The square is the most energetically intense aspect, even if it is adversarial, and can lead to good results just as well as it can lead to bad ones. Here comes in a second concept: overcoming. When planet A has a square with planet B, if B lies on the right side of A, then A overcomes B. If B lies on the left side of A, then A is overcome by B.

Your moon, which governs the emotions and sensitivity, is in a strong conjunction with your ascendant (I assume within 3 degrees). This makes you very aware of your own emotions, and perhaps those of other people as well - you may be a natural-born psychologist. However, moon in 1st house can also make you emotionally vulnerable and inconstant, qualities already present within your rising sign. You will need to learn how to set hard boundaries, be firm, define yourself and defend yourself and your value. The presence of Saturn in this house may mean that trials may test your ability to make this change, perhaps especially in your youth. Saturn may also add a depressive tendency, which is undesirable in the strongly emotional Pisces - make sure to take care of your emotional health, not take on the burdens of others unless you really can handle it (no, REALLY!), and avoid addictive substances. Saturn is the house ruler of the 11th house, meaning that you may have more conscious freedom to pick your friends, groups, affiliations etc - use this freedom wisely. Your first house also benefits from a superior square with Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, who looks out for you. Rejoice!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Venus in 12th house Aqua: Not the most auspicious placement for Venus - you may not expect much help from this planet, I think.

The presence of the sun here suggests that social life, perhaps friendship, perhaps groups and affiliates (like a political party or music subculture or what have you) will play a very important role in your life. As mentioned earlier, your Saturn placement gives you more conscious freedom in choosing your commitments here. The sun marks this area as a central theme in your life. Mercury in Capricorn gives you a realistic, cool headed, arid and strategic intellect - you might want to make sure you balance it with your emotions appropriately so that they mutually support each other instead of distorting each other&#039;s functions or disrupting each other&#039;s work. Mars is also here - normally, Mars would be a mostly negative planet, especially in a day chart, but Mars is exalted in Capricorn and is more beneficial in the 11th house. You will have a lot of energy and drive in supporting the cause of your friends or your affiliates and comrades by heart. Depending on how close the conjunction between Mars and Mercury is, you may also receive intellectual benefits, like a strong, rigorous and incise intellect, with a drive to reach the bottom of things and express itself forcefully, but also strategically as a result of the Capricorn placement.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jupiter in 10th house: Jupiter is in its own domicile in Sagittarius, and this is the house of public life and career.

Reading it in whole sign:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sun, Mercury and Jupiter in 7th house indicate great fortune with relationships, a mind attuned to relationships, and a life devoted to your partner. You seek adventurous and open minded people, and in many respects are one yourself. Your career, day-to-day activity, family life and personality (1st house) all seem to tie in with the concept of relationships in some manner - you might be geared to working alongside your partner. Perhaps you&#039;ll get married to someone influential and get involved in their public life, like a family business or something? Jupiter here certainly suggests a fortunate marriage. There&#039;s a square with Saturn that might suggest clashes between career/public activity and love life at times, but it should be manageable. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mars and Venus in 8th house Capricorn: Mars is exalted here, which means your energy and assertiveness are well controlled and directed. I think this placement also ties into relationship life in some manner, and not just because Venus is here - the 8th house relates to other people&#039;s property (including the partner&#039;s) and Mars is also the ruler of the 11th house, which governs social belonging. The &quot;family business&quot; I mentioned earlier for your 7th house might be some sort of heritage foundation or antique stuff of some value and importance, since it seems to tie into so many things - at least that&#039;s my interpretation.

People may say that means God created it but I don&#039;t think so. In God&#039;s original creation, man didn&#039;t have to work and he could live for free. After the serpent came, God&#039;s curse was that Adam was going to have to work for a living (Gen. 3). Masons seems to adore this curse, however, and elevate employment to a noble status other than the literal curse of original sin which it is. Furthermore, it says in Judges twice, &quot;In those days, Israel had no king. Each man did as he pleased.&quot; Therefore, one may assume that the secret command hierarchy of the masons was something that crept in through the unceasing rebellion of the Israelites against God&#039;s intended creation: each man should do as pleased and he shouldn&#039;t have to work to pay the rent on his life. Masonry adores a model of society which is the opposite of the one God created. They like the one that Satan likes: wage slavery and each man doing as he is told. God subverted Satan&#039;s rebellion and put himself at the top of Satan&#039;s cult, i.e.: &quot;The Lord rules over Israel,&quot; but the cult is inherently Satanic, in my opinion, due to the above.<br><br>Although God&#039;s only complaint against the Israelites was that they would follow the ways of other nations, the Israelites demanded a king &quot;so they could be like the other nations.&quot; Even when God told them they would hate it, they would not heed God&#039;s wisdom (1 Sam. 8). After the kings started to choose some men as commanders and some as field hands, what is now called &quot;the pyramid&quot; eventually developed. God didn&#039;t create it that way. It was the result of the Israelites&#039; rebellion. In the way God wanted it, each man should do as he pleased without falling under the dominion of another man. God gave man dominion over animals but masons say that men have dominion over other men, which is 100% satanic.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham&#039;s hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan&#039;s descendant the Messiah.

Stress causes the body to tense. Sustained trauma and stress causes a perpetual state of tension in the body. Specific memories of traumatic events can cause the body to tense in certain areas. For example, being punched in the stomach repeatedly and unexpectedly can cause the abdominal muscles to remain tensed indefinitely in preparation for a surprise attack. This then creates a compounding effect where the pelvic floor and back become unbalanced. This imbalance then disrupts the flow of energy in the body. You can read &quot;The Body Keeps the Score&quot; if you are interested in the mechanisms behind this.<br><br>Most people who have difficulties in this area tend to have issues around the heart chakra/diaphragm. This is because breathing becomes shallow in anticipation of a threat. I&#039;ve actually noticed by taking long walks where the tension spots are in my chest area. I recommend trying that if you want to find your tension areas. Unblocking the chest through conscious deep breathing will make dealing with everything else that will come up much easier, so I think dealing with that first is probably the best route.<br><br>As simple as it sounds, it is not easy. You have spent years breathing differently so it takes conscious effort to make full, deep breaths. In addition the muscle tightness is actually going to inhibit your ability to do so. So it will take a lot of effort and remembering to breathe properly. As we know, the breath is tied to the flow of the body. If you can correct this then other things will become easier to deal with.<br><br>Besides TRE, another good practice is vagus nerve stimulation.

I had horrifying nightmares nightly, the likes of which someone that age couldn&#039;t imagine/comprehend, let alone most adults. Most were me being tortured and killed or toyed with by various demonic entities. One was a spider like woman who would pin me down and vomit something into my mouth as I screamed. One was a demonic entity who inhabited the hifi/music setup my parents had who had a deep booming voice and would interrupt whatever music was playing during the dream and start toying with me and telling me horrible things. Other things were hundreds of zombies breaking in and tearing me and my mum limb from limb, just to name a few things. The house particularly my bedroom used to have toys constantly activate in the cupboard. My mum told me when I was about 3 I suddenly barricaded my bedroom door shut and when she managed to get in I had drawn a picture of the devil on the wall, but way beyond my drawing ability. From then to my mid teens, I constantly had dreams that told me I was the son of satan and was put inside a mortal form. As I remember all my dreams I remember the original thing was that the original biblical Satan was my father but died, and I was being prepared to take up his mantle but cannot be seen until it&#039;s all ready or god will kill us. This made me worship the devil and reject god and Christianity for my childhood, ironically I went to Christian schools. Obviously I understand the antichrist isn&#039;t the child of Satan, but do you think it&#039;s possible that I have been possessed by him?

However, it is a cumbersome, time consuming process to get a Russian driver&#039;s license and I am delayed. Hopefully I will hit the road in March when my required two months of driver&#039;s lessons is over.<br><br>One concern I have is this, however. If I get out by driving to Siberia and it is a seamless transition from Antarctica to Siberia, meaning that an alien-abduction like event occurs in which I am transported into a hotel or onto a highway in the northern hemisphere, then that means my antagonists have free reign to operate in Russia and they will be able to take me back to Antarctica if I ever try to come back from Siberia. I think the prevailing authorities will not allow me to find the edge as in pic related. If I did hit &quot;the ice wall,&quot; however, I would be glad to finally see it even when faced with a new problem of how to get past it. I&#039;m sure the Lake Baikal area is replicated in Antarctica and I will probably have to stay in some other than first world locations if I want to avoid being taken straight back to where i came from, if I should get out, which expect to since Russia too large for replication in Antarctica along side the USA and Europe.", "filename": "TIMESAND___mdVef4DFHOsiUrK2d2hO16NWhTYI4V", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 476, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673894659961727, "time": 1673894659, "md5": "iw/TaJl2zUQc6Ku0tqjJmg==", "fsize": 21989, "resto": 33848113}, {"no": 33859461, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)18:15:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m an official from Antarctica Official Internal Affairs, the AOIA, i have extreme urgency in deleting these following messages <a href=\"#p33857305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857305</a> <a href=\"#p33857322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857322</a> <a href=\"#p33857454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857454</a>, whom does one contact to arrange the erasing of this posts?", "time": 1673910956, "resto": 33848113}, {"no": 33859845, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:07:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33850538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33850538</a><br>I&#039;ve talked to people on pol that claimed to be Japanese and Brazilian", "time": 1673914032, "resto": 33848113}, {"no": 33859887, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:12:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33850538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33850538</a><br><a href=\"#p33859845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33859845</a><br>I&#039;m the oldfag that got rid of gangstalking and wrote a document on it https://pastebin.com/KL02hVJb<br>I have been &quot;suicided&quot; with an OD dose but didnt took the full dose somehow and I&#039;m still here with my killswitch and documents.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project.

Weren&#039;t the jews God&#039;s chosen people?</span><br>Alright so the Israelites (Jews) were the chosen people of God, correct. The land of Israel was the chosen land that they found after a bunch of fighting wars and adventures after they fucked off from Egypt. During this time, in the Old Testament, it was made pretty clear that God only fucked with Jews and if you were a Gentile (aka a Goy) then he didn&#039;t fuck with you. You were not in his graces. <br><br>If you were part of a goy civilization that decided to wage war on the Jews, you will most likely loose since the old-testament Israelites could tap into God&#039;s power and do shit like change the weather, cause famine to their enemies and rain fire down from the sky. Now the Jews couldn&#039;t always do this and spam their God-abilities, cause sometimes God didn&#039;t fuck with them either &#039;cause they pissed him off a lot, but if he does fuck with anyone, he will fuck with ONLY the Jews of Israel and nobody else. And they are the only ones who get to go to Heaven when they die, everyone else basically got fucked for all God cared. <br><br>The bible didn&#039;t seem to make it clear whether in order to get cool with God you had to either be a true-blooded israelite, a descendent from the tribe of Abraham, or if you could convert from being a non-goy. I don&#039;t think conversion happened too much in those days but there are mentions of King David or Solomon conquering goy armies in battle and the former leaders of those armies are all like &quot;oh we realize that your God, the God of Israel is the true God&quot; and start to believe in him but considering they aren&#039;t israelites I doubt they got saved. <br><br>Now comes Jesus. Unlike God in the old testament, Jesus opened the path of salvation so that ANYONE could be saved, as long as they believed in him. Before it used to be exclusive to just Isrealites/Jews, so God sent his son down to open up Heaven for everyone as long as they believe in the word of God.", "filename": "1673708054858623", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673930650835837, "time": 1673930650, "md5": "AlV1UMlEkJTt8y7iqcl9EQ==", "fsize": 49467, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861518, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:45:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Shit my pant", "time": 1673930741, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861521, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:46:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33861514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33861514</a><br>You&#039;re forgetting the part where Jews actively denied the new covenant so it became open to everyone else instead.", "time": 1673930779, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861559, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)23:51:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33861521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33861521</a><br>Yes, thank you for mentioning that.

Nowhere in the Quran does it state anything about blowing yourself up. In fact, Islam has a very similar (and kinda vague) view on war and violence in which it preaches that violence and murder is sinful and encourages peaceful relationships between muslims and their neighbors. Similar to the old testament in the bible, Muhammad&#039;s armies do fight wars and it there&#039;s a verse stating that if muslims are threatened they can fight back, which is a little clearer than Christianity&#039;s new testament view honestly. <br><br>However modern Jihadist views really twist things up. Like &quot;Jihad&quot; in the Quran is never used to refer to any sort of warfare and instead its kind of like a personal struggle with oneself, like some kind of &quot;growing-up&quot; as a muslim or self-improvement shit. And the suicide bombing shit is another misinterpretation, because the Quran specifically denounces suicide of any king, and jihadist often refer to suicide as &quot;martyrdom,&quot; using the term &quot;shaheed&quot; from the quran but actually Shaheed/martyr is specifically used in Islamic scripture to refer to someone who is killed for their beliefs, not someone who kills themselves. So it&#039;s basically the same thing as Christian martyrdom <br><br>The 72 virgin thing is sort of true, though. However the verse uses a term that translates to &quot;beautiful women&quot; and even refers to their &quot;swelling breasts&quot; and not whether they are virgins or not, and it also states you&#039;ll have like ten thousand servants or some shit along with the big-tittied hot bitches. It never states that these are the rewards for war though.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related</span>", "filename": "1673801979879899", "ext": ".webm", "w": 576, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 70, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673934087947685, "time": 1673934087, "md5": "WvXTqc442Zye6KHt6IOqvQ==", "fsize": 594299, "resto": 33859281}, {"no": 33861864, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)00:53:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33861798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33861798</a><br>Just elaborating more on this but &quot;Jihad&quot; was popularized as a term for war, specifically &quot;holy war&quot; during the 1980s when the Afghan mujahideen (supported by American glowniggers) fought against the invading Soviets.

A drug addict gets a taste of something that feels good and is a forbidden fruit of sorts. He keeps coming back to use the substance. Not daily at first. He slowly justifies using more to himself. Before he knows it he needs more and more to get high. Soon he&#039;s not even getting high he&#039;s just maintaining and not suffering withdrawal.<br><br>I feel like these degenerate sex fantasies and acts are the same thing. Someone starts off with regular faggot shit. But it slowly progresses into more extreme sex and sometimes body modification. By the time they stop to think about what they&#039;re doing they&#039;ve become a troon. Except unlike a drug addiction it&#039;s encouraged by society and there is no going back. They can&#039;t undo the HRT and whatever else they&#039;ve done. They can&#039;t undo the years of being a megafaggot.

Fags are into taking drugs but the drugs don&#039;t become their entire identity. They&#039;re a fag first. The drugs are only there to enhance the faggotry (meth, MDMA, coke etc).

There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead.

Having practiced the previous rituals for no less than a year, and only if a magician feels a very strong affinity for the deity, he or she may wish to take steps to permanently bind themselves to the god. Such a choice must be pondered deeply as in order to become a true priest or priestess of the Saturnine deity, one must freely surrender one&#039;s own essence to the lord of chains. In other words, the magician must deliberately offer to the god his very soul, as well as his personal hopes and ambitions, as an act of sacrifice. The Saturnine deity will accept no lesser gift as the price of admission to His inner sanctum. One does not need to perform this ritual in order to practice the Saturnine cult, or Saturnine magic. This route must exclusively be taken by those who having tasted the bittersweet gnosis of the god, wish to bind themselves to the Black Cube, and to its eternal current. To the believers in the cycle of rebirth, this ritual creates karmic (or psychic) chains that cannot be broken, and commit the magician&#039;s future selves to the service of the god. It is one thing to sip from Saturn&#039;s black cup of gnosis \u2013 it is another to drain it to the dregs. If you have any doubts about performing this rite, then do not pursue it further.

But ancient and medieval cosmology usually had all the classical planets in their own fixed spheres, hermetically sealed ones (maybe where the term hermetically sealed comes from to begin with considering the role the spheres played in Hermeticism).

Keel claimed to have been a psyops officer in the Canadian military, and to have given propaganda broadcasts during WW2 from inside the pyramids. Also a notorious forger. Icke is 100% a theosophist with Gnostic leanings, reptilians are just archons for the sci fi age. And he was commanded by spirits to do things, he&#039;s said that himself. Maxwell is a Mason who specifically takes shots at the Abrahamic conception of sin, he says it&#039;s a corruption of sine, as in the sine waves from Saturn that generate our false reality.

For example, traditional Sufism is not antinomian, it&#039;s actually a lot more bound up with a traditional approach to the sharia than Salafism is since Salafis tend to want to revise Islamic law in an attempt to return to the early days of Islam. al-Ghazali&#039;s last book was on fiqh, not ego annihilation, and none of the great Sufi authorities thought you could get to a stage of spiritual development where you don&#039;t need to follow the sharia anymore. Sufi wine and romantic imagery is exclusive to a certain strain within Sufism, a basically nonexistent one these days afaik, and was just metaphor for the love of God in the same way that the Song of Songs uses erotic imagery to talk about the soul&#039;s approach to God. Sufism is not pantheistic, with some possible fringe cases of heresy. Most Sufis I&#039;m familiar with are Asharii but there have been some great Athari Sufis as well. Sufism is not pacifistic, many of the great Sufis fought in jihad themselves, many others wrote about it, and there are Sufi groups to this day fighting in Iraq. Sufism is ascetic but Salafism can be ascetic too, look at Sh. Ibn Uthaymeen.<br><br>Tldr, Western treatments of Sufism tend to try to separate it from more orthodox Islam, and to downplay its overlap with orthodoxy. They do this because of a bias that tells them Islam couldn&#039;t possibly have rich interior spirituality, that must come from outside Islam, because white wine moms love Rumi but aren&#039;t so sure about sharia, and on the part of 5 eyes, because Western spooks think they can defang Islam by promoting Sufism as an alternative to &quot;Islamism&quot;.", "time": 1673820623, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849448, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:15:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33846552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33846552</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians also engaged in genocide.</span><br>Ever consider that us human beings are universally retarded and such absurdities like genocide are just a perk of living in this gay, stupid ass world in the sufferings of the human condition that not even the greatest of worldly luxuries and escapism can cure?", "time": 1673820926, "resto": 33840699}, {"no": 33849568, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)17:30:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33848683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33848683</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t and I consider that a completely valid question. <br><br>Even if we were to accept the Christian narrative of the crucifixion, complete with death and resurrection, why should it be the death that gets the focus and not the resurrection? If you&#039;re a Protestant it has to be the former because most Protestants think the death and resurrection was a human sacrifice that allowed God to create a legal loophole in order to forgive people (subsititonal atonement). But that&#039;s not the only way it&#039;s been framed by Christians. Eastern Orthodoxy has an entirely different scheme of salvation, they go with christus victor theory rather than subsititonal atonement theory, and in the medieval era they criticized the Latin West for an excessive focus on Christ&#039;s suffering and death.

The end result of believing there is an anthropomorphized, personal god judging us for sins is ultimately not different from one&#039;s own deeply held subconscious beliefs, such as guilt and desires, determining what happens to us in the afterlife. To (poorly) paraphrase Christ, we allegedly are judged by God according to how we judge others. Christ really insisted on repeating this general concept over and over. Depending on how you look at it, this could simply be a different perspective or way of expressing the same idea.<br><br>The same general concept is arguably presented in the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead with the weighing of the soul and in Zoroastrianism with the crossing of the bridge. It&#039;s again not far off from the Buddhist and Hindu reincarnation based on Karma. I&#039;m probably not doing the best job of articulating myself, but what I&#039;m getting at is all of these feel like clues pointing to one truth about death and the afterlife.<br><br>If we entertain this as being true for argument&#039;s sake it raises some questions though. What about the concept of a shortcut to salvation through grace of a savior such as Christ or Krishna? Well, if it really is ultimately about our most deeply held (subconscious) beliefs, then the &#039;good Christian&#039; would have a clean conscious because they truly forgive the sins of everyone, and thus can accept the belief they are saved, this being &quot;saved by Christ&#039;s sacrifice&quot;. Similarly with believing karma is absolved/transfered to Krishna by believing Krishna has that power, clearing your conscious.<br><br>All of this begs the question of psychopaths. How do they fit in? By not having guilt, do they simply get a free pass? That can&#039;t be right, right? So I wonder if they aren&#039;t simply people who already &quot;sold their soul to a demon&quot; in some way.

I thought it was the Edict of Milan that ended Roman assrage over Christianity, at least officially. Maybe there was further persecution up to the time of the Council but if so this is a genuine gap in my knowledge of history. I&#039;d say the change in Roman attitude wasn&#039;t an abrupt about-face out of nowhere. Christianity had been getting steadily more popular by the time of the Edict of Milan, and prior to it Roman persecution was fairly uneven. Most of the Roman freakouts seemed to have been occasioned by the increasing popularity of Christianity in fact, usually in an indirect way. It seems this increasing popularity created the sort of environment in which a major Roman political figure, such as Constantine, could be won over to or just made sympathetic to Christianity so as to choose to end the persecution officially. <br><br>Most Christians sadly have nothing interesting or informative to say about their religion so I agree there. But it also seems to me that most atheists online live up to the caricature of redditors on 4chan lol. So I don&#039;t see it as unique to Christians. The sad reality is that most people aren&#039;t smart enough to gather and synthesize their own info. There&#039;s some IQ research out there claiming people are only able to do that from like 120-125 IQ and up, so we&#039;re talking about roughly 10% of people max.<br><br>I&#039;ve found gnostic takes on the difference between the OT and NT God appealing in the past, but the fact that Marcion had to toss most of the NT to make his version of Christianity work led me to believe that there is more consistency there than often claimed.

The New Word Order Nazis\u2019 use these beams not only as weapons, but also to transmit power to levitating aircraft, flying discs and various other stolen Tesla technologies below. The absorptive properties of the levitating aircraft allow their utilization of energy beamed from orbital plasma generators, optimally transmitted when the stealth aircraft are themselves plasma-cloaked for optical and radar invisibility (giving off only infrared light). A hazardous by-product of these space-based laser beams is radon gas. Radon is said to be an invisible gas that causes cancer and leukemia in humans and animals, but if you ask the US government about radon gas you will not get a straight answer. Native Americans on the nearby Blackfoot Reservation have suffered from extremely high rates of cancer and leukemia since the 1950s. The US government says that nothing is wrong and there is no reason to be concerned, yet suffering communities must be informed of the true cause of their severe ailments.", "time": 1673844570, "resto": 33850669}, {"no": 33852337, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)23:50:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33852320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33852320</a><br>The SR-71 Blackbird, B-2 Stealth Bomber planes and antigravity flying discs are constantly hovering just below 200\u2019 in the skies above Glacier National Park and the Blackfoot Indian Reservation. This explains why commercial flights are forbidden to fly below 200\u2019 in Glacier National Park; and why no one is allowed to bring firearms into the park for protection against the aggressions of the resident grizzly bears. There are many more secret CIA New World Order Nazi bases at other National Parks around the country, including the Grand Canyon. These planes are optically invisible and make no audible sound at all. The SR-71 et al. are periodically brought in to the secret underground hangers located in the hollowed-out mountain below Grizzly Peak on Going-to-the-Sun Road. These levitating airplanes are slowly lowered into the waters of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park, seen above. The planes are capable of traveling underwater like submarines for short distances. Once the planes are submerged in Lake McDonald they travel to the underground/ underwater hangers inside the hollowed-out mountain. Once inside the underground hangers the planes are serviced. There is a giant elevator inside the mountain that brings the planes up to a full-size hidden runway inside the mountain. During the night, when Going-to-the-Sun Road is closed, a large camouflaged section of the mountain is briefly opened for aircraft to exit the facility. Once the plane has left the mountain base, the secret runway bay doors are closed. Otto Skorzeny presented the photograph below, taken on August 27, 1997, describing the hidden stealth technologies active around Glacier Park\u2019s Lake McDonald. Skorzeny pointed out the flat, squared rock as being a hidden flat-panel radar array (circled), one feature among several secret installations enabling covert surveillance of the sensitive airspace.", "filename": "C29C8084-EE79-4E46-AE0E-7B8331CD6B37", "ext": ".png", "w": 1082, "h": 631, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1673844639180139, "time": 1673844639, "md5": "PXiN0CucE0Lne4qkm1xU0A==", "fsize": 841467, "resto": 33850669}, {"no": 33852350, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)23:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33852337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33852337</a><br>The disc-shaped cloud (upper left) is actually a plasma-cloaked stealth disc aircraft silently hovering above the CIA boat.

That line is disinformation \u2013 stealth planes spray mists of water on themselves while flying to create the illusion of optical invisibility by interaction with the electrified aircraft shell. Water vapor is used by stealth planes to disguise the aircraft in a white- colored artificial cloud that, when ignited, forms a plasma mirage envelope for complete optical cloaking.

The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: &quot;I&#039;m not going to help you make this record.

A lot of it has to do with emotions, anxiety, fears, past pain and the need to renew yourself. The universe will do its thing, but for now what is important is to focus on preparing yourself for what is coming. So that when it does come you are in the best place to receive it and to use it. An oppurtunity like this isn&#039;t just easy come, this is something major and you have to take care of yourself first. <br><br>As for the second one, I felt more as if the cards were telling me to tell you to adjust your expectations, or adjust the way that you ask the question or think about receiving love from others.
