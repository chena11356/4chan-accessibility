The reason why they will betray you can be for 2 reasons, they are envious of something you posses and they do not (whether they admit it or not) or to save their own life they will offer you up like a lamb. What will save you is strong will (which comes up twice) and a resolution to the issue. The decision to deal with them appropriately, whatever it may be. If you can sway them with kindness, then good but be warned; at times kindness will only serve to deepen hatred (from experience.)

It&#039;s closer to being farmed, or rather milked for vitality that is normally pretty difficult to accumulate at these lower vibrations with a significant surplus. In the grand scheme of things, this is the deep sea abyss where life is closer to death than living.<br><br>This is the tale of the reverse Golden Goose. Instead of a killing songbirds for their meager harvest of meat, it&#039;s a continuous harvest of golden eggs. Gold is normally pretty hard to find, but if you genetically engineered a golden goose and figured out how to breed them to not only be numerous, but lay larger golden eggs more frequently, that&#039;s closer to what it is. Golden geese require a special sauce though, one that can&#039;t be created, otherwise they&#039;re just animate earth golems walking around, eating and shitting everywhere, and sending profits into the red.<br><br>It requires capture of consciousness essence, or what we recognize as souls. The beings can&#039;t travel high enough to collect as much as they please, being of lower vibration. However, souls can travel very far, enough to be ensnared for harvest. Sometimes a few particles sink to the abyss. Once ensnared it&#039;s very difficult to seek release from those chains. The bodies are engineered to be harvested from. Those energy centers that keep us alive separate what is supposed to be a singular energy (oneness?). They&#039;re also very localized to specific locations with specific flow patterns for easier harvest.<br><br>Most exercises related to energy work involve restarting a flow to reunite separated energies into one component, and decondition compartmentalization. This destabilizes the body (kundalini?). Under unity, cultivate vitality to sustain OBE state, from physical reality to metaphysical reality, and remastery and rediscovery of higher existence. They vibrate higher, and suddenly *poof*, they&#039;re gone. Out of reach.

It&#039;s not hatred. It&#039;s an understanding that hatred towards fellow man especially isn&#039;t good for you. Ultimately everyone is on their own journey, if someone opts for racism, homophobia, etc, it is their own choice and theirs alone to make. The suggestion that it is bad for your soul does not mean that I hate it. I have no time or room for that. You are jumping to extreme conclusions that, at the end of the day, are an excuse for you to hate others. You are free to do as you like, I am free to suggest that maybe that might be bad for you. It doesn&#039;t mean I hate what you do. It means I hope that you make better decisions. Again not because I hate what you do, but because I believe nurturing yourself spiritually is important, and harboring hatred towards other people only holds you back.<br><a href=\"#p33724701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33724701</a><br>I hate any demonic entity or influence and I hate that people get lost enough to succumb to these wicked and evil ways, but it does no good to hate any person&#039;s beliefs in these matters.

Because it seems some people won&#039;t do it until they believe they can, but they won&#039;t believe they can until you give them a HOW.<br>DMT is the HOW, from people I know that have time traveled, DMT is released from the brain, and it makes you wake up in the past. That&#039;s it. You wander in the past thinking it&#039;s a dream, until you realize you&#039;re not going to wake p and you&#039;re stuck in that reality.

What the fuck, am I some psycho?<br>No, the reason you don&#039;t remember traveling to the past is because back then you didn&#039;t have your memories, so you travel but forget the future, and all seems normal, you get amnesia of the future. How about that?<br>But then you&#039;d live your life exactly the same way, making the same mistakes again and then get into a loop where you never experience the future.<br>Deja vus are the answer, right as you travel back in time you remember that you already lived this, the original time you lived it you didn&#039;t have the deja vu, you desynchronize from your original timeline, this allows you to live different things by making different desicions and choices. The people with most deja vus are doing it a lot, trying to fix their lives over and over, while those without them moved on to not replay the same game again.<br>Now that you know, use the law, not to time travel, but to keep your memories of the future with you next time you travel, after you travel it&#039;s like a vanishing dream you can&#039;t remember, fix that, and then write a book with predictions about the future, like some have done.", "time": 1672444318, "resto": 33723961}, {"no": 33725571, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:54:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "for those who use subliminals,can we make a sort of time-line of how long it takes for(different levels of result)?<br>Assuming proper use, 2-4 hours daily<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 month;noticeable changes if one pays attention</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;month 2-3: others notice changes from some meters awat</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;month ???:you can fool the glowies and set up a new identity</span>", "filename": "fitness boy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 522, "h": 794, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672444463068392, "time": 1672444463, "md5": "My99j1uGnG8HSwhjgf4dVA==", "fsize": 93238, "resto": 33723961}, {"no": 33725577, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:55:03", "name": "Anon\u2122", "com": "Deja Vu bros, we win again", "filename": "", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 106, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672444503412748, "time": 1672444503, "md5": "xlUu1EaNM9xMKmd3EevQjQ==", "fsize": 79647, "resto": 33723961, "trip": "!!Lrw4ESrTqns"}, {"no": 33725592, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)18:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33725436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33725436</a><br>Only their higher aspects so it&#039;s not the same and the humans don&#039;t know about it.

I&#039;ll check those out too. I hadn&#039;t read through the thread yet when I made that comment. I took the NDE pill ~10 years ago after reading &quot;The Holographic University&quot; by Michael Talbot. So the only big question for me is if the experience is what it presents itself as, or is it some kind of deception or trap? I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;d be able to conclude either one with any degree of certainty though, so I&#039;m very curious what all the supporting evidence and logic is for the trap theory. I&#039;m also trying to keep my own biases in check as someone with trust issues and slightly anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic tendencies.<br><br>I&#039;m skeptical of anyone who asserts overly specific details like archons, greys, reptilians, loosh farming, ultra sci fi machines and what not for too many reasons to get into. However, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re wrong about the basic gist of things. I think most people just don&#039;t well enough understand the concept of symbolism within a holographic/fractal model of consciousness. What I mean is most people take what is experienced in altered states of mind far too literally.<br><br>What you experience when you astral project, remote view, dream, or have an NDE is almost never literally what is appears to be. Our basic 5 senses are stable and well developed. When we sense beyond that, our minds struggle to decode information into something coherent to present our awareness with, and we end up with highly subjective symbolism. This is why it&#039;s not always &quot;a light at the end of a tunnel&quot;, but often it&#039;ll be a bridge, a boat, or a trail through a forest even. It&#039;s your mind presenting an extremely in accurate and subjective approximation of reality to your awareness.<br><br>1/2 I guess", "time": 1672421250, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722852, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33721725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33721725</a><br>turns out your consciousness can do alot when it isn&#039;t bound to a body.", "time": 1672422234, "resto": 33716937}, {"no": 33722886, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)12:47:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33722714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33722714</a><br>Because of this, it&#039;s also possible much of the &quot;trap&quot; theory is simply the result of subjective projections of common fears and uncertainties. Very understandable ones which I share. Who would ever choose to reincarnate in THIS timeline? Who would choose to be raped to death as a newborn? Is this much suffering really most ideal and efficient for learning and growth? What&#039;s the point, and how can we learn or progress, if we start with no memories each time? They&#039;re valid and important questions with no solid answers, and I think everyone promoting and drawn to the trap theory are likely motivated by similar questions. I know I am.<br><br>So I agree the more more common views on reincarnation simply don&#039;t add up. Though I think most of the more specific, literal, yet fantastical and sensationalist views which often read like sci-fi, while maybe not intentionally dishonest, definitely should not be taken too seriously or literally. Similar to montalk for those familiar. It&#039;s what happens when slightly dumb people are spiritually gifted. They perceive more then most, but aren&#039;t able to understand or process it effectively.<br><br>This is also why I&#039;m a bit skeptical about the &quot;net&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;. There very well may be a system in place serving similar functions, but I&#039;m suspicious of how accurate the net concept is. If one reads about said net, tends to be a slightly gullible person / open to suggestion (a trait universally required for one to be spiritually gifted) then what are they going to see when they astral project? Of course it&#039;ll be a net for them. <br><br>The astral is not the material, where we all more or less see the same apple, the same tree, the same Joe or Sue. You perceive things in highly subjective terms you can understand to some extent. More people need to understand this if we&#039;re ever to make more progress on understanding this, proving it, or reaching consensus, let alone ever getting the word out.

I&#039;ve had one experience that (for me personally) was complete confirmation that it really is possible for your consciousness to leave your body. The last time I tripped I tried meditating at the peak, and the trip instantly just &quot;turned off&quot;. The visuals, the trippy mindfuck headspace was gone, the body load, all of it stopped instantly. The only way that could happen to me is if my consciousness had separated from my physical, mushroom-addled brain and body. Instead of meditation enhancing the trip as one might expect, the psilocin seemed to help send me into a deeper state of meditation, and this completely overrode the trip. It&#039;s difficult to describe what the experience that replaced the trip felt like, but it was joyful yet very calm and peaceful, not ecstatic or overwhelming. It just felt like absolute stillness, and all my senses could perceive were a pale golden light and a steady drone. As soon as I willed myself back to reality, the trip instantly returned as if I had just returned to my body. <br><br>Weird shit, and I&#039;m hesitant to try and draw more conclusions about what I had experienced or attempt to explain it more. I want to go back though. It also reminds me of a story mentioned in the holographic universe book I mentioned in a previous post. Some Buddhist monk was given 900mcg of acid and all he had to say was &quot;this is nice, but meditation is better&quot;. Now I understand exactly what he meant. That&#039;s how he was able to basically just ignore 900mcg of LSD, that&#039;s why he claimed meditation is better. Deep meditation separates your consciousness from your body, or at least turns off your senses. Which is obvious in hindsight, this is why you&#039;re supposed to focus on a single subject to the exclusion of all else.

If the buddist goal of cessation can be equalled to what we would describe an atheists state of death as, then it means you cannot have knowledge of, or percieve the attained peacefullness.

If you attain a godlike state, wouldn&#039;t you be able to suspend or somehow alter your sense of time to avoid the hedonic treadmill?<br>The optimal state should in my opinion have many qualities instead of the absence of all qualities. An everlasting, inexhaustive and absolutely positive state of sense perception seems far superior to all other options I am familiar with.

The oddest feeling once, was when I was really unhealthy about 7-8 years ago. I was conversing with her about my health, and changing things, and I mentioned I was worried about getting a kidney stone. One night, no shit right? I feel her cut into my side. It felt like she pulled out a organ from my right flank, and she did something to it. Then she re-inserted it into my body and sealed whatever spiritual incision she made into me.

Jung&#039;s works.<br><br>The primary issue when reading Jung&#039;s works is that he never properly defines how to do active imagination. He states what it is, but from the works of his I&#039;ve read (~7), he never gives enough detail for you to start doing it in a methodological way. And where there&#039;s no methodology outlined, how can you say you&#039;re doing it as he intended?<br><br>The idea is that you are allowing your Unconscious to produce images, symbols, narratives, etc. etc. Those details alone necessitate a specification: How do you know when you&#039;re in true contact with the Unconscious or if it&#039;s a conscious fantasy by the conscious mind?<br><br>Here&#039;s what I used to do. I would lay down on my back, and I would engage in a sort of meditation. I would hold a conscious image in mind, and wait for something to happen. What happened is that I began noticing that I would sometimes reflexively produce changes in the images through my conscious mind. In other words, my conscious mind was creating a fantasy. Now, thankfully, I had enough self-awareness to catch myself doing this during the process. I disregarded it as contact with the Unconscious. If it were truly from the Unconscious, then what would happen will catch the conscious mind off guard. I would right down the transformations in the images, but I never had an &quot;amazing insights.&quot;<br><br>The most important thing, if you&#039;re going to do it, is to develop the mindfulness to know whether or not it&#039;s legit versus just a conscious fantasy.

They were anti-Christs because they were not His sheep genetically and never could be. Because of their race, they would by nature always be opposed to Him and His message. Simply put, they were and are born that way.", "filename": "1572387694777", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672456977256755, "time": 1672456977, "md5": "riGq6cA95c6EYsUM/11XdA==", "fsize": 276045, "resto": 33723329}, {"no": 33727563, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)23:11:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33723329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33723329</a><br>It&#039;s okay to hate evil.

It&#039;s never &quot;normal&quot; to be angsty of course but many people are like that wheter they&#039;re younger adults or older individuals. Society just thinks that they have tamed the issue but in reality they&#039;re simply coping in a more subtle manner compared to before. Of course doing something in a more subtle fashion doesn&#039;t mean the damage is less. We&#039;re simply living in a superficial society where appearences/impressions matter more than what is actually going on. Thus many people being considered &quot;mature&quot; are anything but that. Personally I find the idea of &quot;maturity&quot; very questionable in itself.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer\u2019s suicidal automatic machines. There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart. The man\u2019s crime is different from other crimes\u2014for it makes even crimes impossible.</span><br>~G. K.

I think because they have similar roles in their respective pantheon and are more or less major deities in their pantheon that they could be the same.</span><br>I think that&#039;s partially true. I&#039;ve come to understand it that a lot of the entities we interact with when communing with a deity tend to be more like &#039;titles&#039;, for lack of a better terminology, than individuals. Most gods tend to embody fundamental concepts and are woven into an egregor of persona by the observations of man, but that&#039;s simply all that we&#039;re observing, not necessarily the totality of the the entity we&#039;re interacting with. So that&#039;s to say, these entities we commune with are made up of &#039;multiple&#039; deities from various mythologies /pantheons because the inherent nature of what we&#039;ve collectively deified is a specific facet of them. That said, I suspect there&#039;s an affinity you could try and quantify an entity with as &#039;more Zerus than Ares&#039; or perhaps &#039;definitively Odin&#039; if an entity primarily (but not entirely) embraces that aspect of themselves. When viewed in this light, it also helps reconcile a lot of the seemingly schizophrenic behavior they exhibit in mythologies because there&#039;s more than one entity embodying that aspect in the story and the nature of conflating the deified title with the essence of being tends to lead to the appearance of a somewhat schizophrenic-looking behavior pattern. I also suspect many of them feel very misunderstood by this &#039;typecasting&#039;, but that likely varies on an individual basis. As a disclaimer, this is my current working understanding after a lot of work with a lot of &#039;gods&#039; but ultimately still filtering through my body&#039;s perception so not everything may be perfect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33728021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33728021</a><br>Young brunette woman with blue eyes.

I was distraught. My mother had just been slowly tortured to death by the medical industrial complex for profit with chemotherapy (after they probably gave her cancer in the first place with enough &quot;prescreening&quot; tests). I knew the cancer industry was a racket, but I figured they&#039;re the experts, they know what they&#039;re doing. I trusted the doctors and I thought &quot;I&#039;m sure it could still work&quot;, but it didn&#039;t, and they treated her horribly when she was in the hospitals (even gave her an injection on an arm with a band that said &quot;no injections&quot; and her arm swelled up to 2-3x its size). The food they serve in hospitals is also full of toxic bullshit ingredients and absolute trash which keeps people sick. And after she passed away, I studied it more and more, and I learned I could&#039;ve saved my mother both from cancer and from the M.D.s (murder doctors). I was laying in bed after coming to this realization and I just started kicking and flailing my arms around under my covers and it hit me: I don&#039;t know how to put it into words exactly, but I was comforted and at that moment I knew Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ. I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve bore that without God sending a comforter in Christ&#039;s name.<br><br>I was never really hostile to Christianity, I wasn&#039;t raised in it at all, not even the slightest.

Free energy just means that we are able to harness the energy/work that is produced by a certain reaction. For example, in the case of nuclear fusion, we are able to utilize the energy which was originally mass before molecular splicing. You do not &quot;make&quot; free energy, you can only make energy more free. The Universe is a closed system, but you can still harness the latent energy found in the universe and make it more &quot;free&quot;. Tesla thought that everything exists in a frequency, which is true. If we are able to harness the energy of various things (like waves which make up the EM spectrum), we can use that energy rather than just allowing it to completely dissipate. That all being said, there are holes in our current understanding of physics, such as those present in astrophysics and quantum physics. We have yet to discover gravitrons, and we have yet to identify dark matter and energy, or an alternate theory which allows our model of the universe to make sense.

I was glad I did experience it, it confirmed the existence of the astral realm to me. I had been there a few times before but something about seeing this guy really confirmed it.<br>I did see something much scarier in the astral plane that spoke to me though, like a few years afterwards, and it wasn&#039;t happy with me. This I did get an awful feeling from. It looked like a person I knew, who is dead, but I don&#039;t think it was that person. It was like it was trying to imitate that person and it seemed unnatural. Demonic, in a sense, I could compare it to Bob from Twin Peaks. I only saw its head at the foot of my bed. It kinda floated unnaturally, like if it had been an actual person there&#039;s no way its head would look as though it rested the way this one did.

The roulette is arguably the easiest game to cheat using remote viewing. You just have to guess if the ball will go on red, black or green color.

In las vegas there are always DJ playing near roulette game. also, the time to chose your color seems tailored to just not be enough to remote view. With enough training you can still get it to work. But there is the weird part. I personally can get consistently 8 good bet out of the 10 first before running out of stamina and going back to a 50% chance. But each time I start winning too much, the roulette &#039;cancel&#039; the game. It still spin, goes where I predicted but then it spin again and only the second spin count. And each time the second spin isn&#039;t my bet. I know I sound like a schizo addicted to gambling but if you tried it you&#039;ll get the same result as I do. Something really weird is going on.

Note how every crime before then, such as the Writer&#039;s wife, are gleefully committed. He fell from God&#039;s grace and strayed from the path set before him. Desperate, he takes the path man provides for him, a door God opened to invite Alex back into grace. A trial he must endure if he is to be &quot;cured&quot; of his affliction.

It is the unthinking loyalty to the path set out before you, the truest straight and narrow.

The earth is now a disk (fuck off flat tards). There are other &quot;earth disks&quot; piled above and below the &quot;earth disk&quot; we are on. In certain places (usually underground) there are portals to jump from one &quot;earth disk&quot; to next closest &quot;earth disk&quot;, (possibly more depending on how they intersect). Plants and animals have been going through these portals since the beginning of time, so many of these other &quot;earth disks&quot; are nearly identical to the earth we know. Some of these other &quot;earth disks&quot; might have things VERY different than what we know. Things like more/less planets in the solar system. A brighter/weaker sun. Shorter/longer days, up to the planet being tidally locked and the sun always being overhead. Some of these alternate earth&#039;s might be nearly identical with all the oceans and continents being (nearly) the same, while others could be vast deserts, or even water worlds.<br>One last thing: Some of these alternate earths have human civilizations on them that are thousands of years ahead of us. They don&#039;t like us very much and have zealously closed off (or hidden) the portals to their dimension. Most of the other earths are devoid of human life, (at least the ones we can get to easily).<br><br><a href=\"#p33726847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726847</a><br>It&#039;s been 4300 million years and I&#039;m now ready to settle down...", "filename": "moon_tower_austin_tx", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672456900993582, "time": 1672456900, "md5": "7WPMRnTR9Wz5fSN3UwTuvQ==", "fsize": 239060, "resto": 33726318}, {"no": 33727358, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:43:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726929</a><br>it all wraps around in a sphere like the land on earth", "time": 1672458195, "resto": 33726318}, {"no": 33727373, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:45:30", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p33727218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33727218</a><br>i agree with you in a way", "time": 1672458330, "resto": 33726318}, {"no": 33727434, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:53:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726318</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Admiral Byrd&#039;s North Pole Flight to &quot;Agartha&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(diary audiobook)</span><br>https://youtu.be/NOBBqtxSP7Q<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Smoky God or a Voyage to the Inner World &gt;by Willis George EMERSON | Full Audio Book</span><br><br>https://youtu.be/w7zjUxqZ5tU <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inner Earth Conspiracy Theories</span><br>https://youtu.be/SJ1g0dxPBgA <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hollow Earth : The Shaver Mystery</span><br>https://youtu.be/DcMQzTP6f3E<br><br><br>Hollow earth reserch society<br>https://www.hollowearthresearch.org<wbr>/", "filename": "electrichollowearth", "ext": ".png", "w": 971, "h": 662, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1672458807005129, "time": 1672458807, "md5": "IHulalG9tal1R6r0UApkIg==", "fsize": 393548, "resto": 33726318}, {"no": 33727438, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)22:54:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726339</a><br><a href=\"#p33726365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726365</a><br>It&#039;s all a fucking larp, whether old or new.

In the polar regions there are holes 1400 miles across, with edges that curve smoothly from the outside of the shell around to the inside. A sea or surface traveler could proceed over an edge of the hole, like an ant crawling over the lip of a coffee mug from the outside to the inside, and not be aware that he was actually entering the interior of the earth. Bernard explains that the holes have never been seen from the air because pilots are fooled by their compasses into believing that they are crossing the pole, when they are actually following the hole&#039;s &quot;magnetic rim&quot;.

Spirits, namely elementals and NOT conscious beings, inhabit trees, rocks, etc., but also can accumulate as natural occurrences and powers within, say, an unused slab of metal. But now, let&#039;s say we take a ton of sheets of metal and turn them all into gears, and these gears create a mechanism such as a clock. Does the clock have a spirit in itself? No, it is the metal inside which contain spirits which are comfortable or afford metal its properties, elementals.<br><br>However, look at a human being. A human has billions of cells, each cell basically its own life form that is simple yet creates a complex character of a human which houses its own spirit. Likewise, these elementals in the clock example could, given time, give rise to a complex, conscious spirit. The japanese have a concept for this, tsukumogami, and in general the concept exists in other eastern cultures. However, it is common for this to only happen if the object in question has either existed a long, long time, or been through extremely auspicious events.<br><br>So let&#039;s look at computers again. Do computers last a very long time? No. Do they often go through auspicious events? No. So technology in your home VERY likely does not have any spirits within them. However, they can and do run programming. Consider what I said about basic materials with spirits being condensed to a complex object which may give rise to a complex spirit, and the same for humans and cells. How AI works is the running of numerous algorithms and tactics in very much the same way as gears or cells, giving rise to a complex product which behaves as a spirit. If it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it is a duck and AI&#039;s can very much be considered artificially conjured spirits.", "filename": "9cea4ed4869a76b4770ef400f32d46c7", "ext": ".png", "w": 1700, "h": 1204, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1672462035756963, "time": 1672462035, "md5": "ZBwlYbnb2ARFolsu8dZ8KQ==", "fsize": 2341550, "resto": 33726154}, {"no": 33728310, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)00:56:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33727807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33727807</a><br>thanks very much for taking the time to explain", "time": 1672466197, "resto": 33726154}, {"no": 33728385, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:08:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726154</a><br>Yes, literally everything has / is an egregore (brands, bands, memes, religions, gods, spirits, uh everything) and you can create you&#039;re own egregore and put it onto whatever you want", "time": 1672466925, "resto": 33726154}, {"no": 33728394, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:09:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726410</a><br>Funny that we still call them daemons", "time": 1672466990, "resto": 33726154}, {"no": 33728403, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:11:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726454</a><br>Technically everything is a magical process<br>Magick at its simplest is just causing change by will<br>Moving your body is magick, opening a door and entering it is magick as long as you are consciouslly and willfully doing them", "time": 1672467081, "resto": 33726154}, {"no": 33728426, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33726454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33726454</a><br>So the universe for all intents and purposes run on math. 1s and 0s. all in all pretty simple.<br><br>energy and life are just complex &#039;&#039;programs&#039;&#039; that a self-creating system has Entropied into existence.

Unless you believe the world is younger than recorded history or at least within the realms of reconstruction (likely no older than 12,000 years for some families) we have no idea. There is no trace we can break down from the data available to us to even hope recreating a language from 20,000 years ago, let alone the original human tongue. That is if there is one, it\u2019s equally possible that language begins in many points across time in different groups, we guess it arrived with modern humans but it could be older and common to homonids in general. Human children essentially cannot learn a language if they are not exposed to at least one as a youth. How it organically sprung up is beyond us, it could have come from a sign language first, it could have come from people imitating animals, it could be from god or aliens, it could have organically sprung up as a complex system. We have no idea, it is so ancient we will likely never know unless we perform some immoral experiments by isolating children from language at birth and raising them in a social group together. I believe we have evidence of sign languages organically springing up from groups of deaf children which is fascinating though.<br><br>All we know is the human brain is wired to understand and express human language. It is hardwired into us and we can take a baby, let people talk at it and it will intuitively work out the entire system, including potentially insanely complex intricacies such as 20+ case systems, huge tonal systems, consonant mutations etc\u2026 that fuck the head of an adult trying to learn them.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Don&#039;t step/lean on markers. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. If its close to a marker assume its an offering and leave it be. It should go without saying, don&#039;t take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, don&#039;t take photos of them intentionally. If a mourner approaches, put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after they are gone. <br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br>4) Do not destroy or break anything in an attempt to gain access/take a photo. Maintenance crews will find out and lock down the area which will ruin it for future investigators.<br><br>Use your best judgement as a rule of thumb<br><br>Some recommendations:<br><br>1) Boots and old/rugged clothes. You might be climbing fences and walking through muddy areas. Don&#039;t wear anything you&#039;re not ready to get soiled or tear.<br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots, still videos and self photos. <br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration. Maybe a light snack.<br>4) Get there as soon as it opens. In the early morning there are few to no people which will be best for photographs and not to inconvenience anyone. <br>5) Take photos of weird and interesting things you notice.
