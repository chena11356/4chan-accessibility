And honestly I dont know how you can think something so stupid. Are you trying to say I cant violate someones free will? If I cast out my will to, lets say, to murder someone? If I go in to the park at night and rape a woman? If I traumatize a child, leaving them a broken adult, not knowing how to control their thoughts and emotions?<br>Of course, my agency is 100% up to me, right now. But before in my lifetime I have been fooled, manipulated, abused, as a child and teenager. Only after meditation and a sort of awakening, have I realized my true free will, my true agency. And every day I see how people manipulate eachother, push them down, incase them in a metaphorical box, if not a physical one. And I wont allow myself to see them as bad people, because I can recognize they are just people who have been abused and manipulated in a way that distorts their agency. If a girl is sexually abused as a child and ends up a porn star is that her agency? No, I really doubt it. If a boy is sexually and physica\u013ay abused as a child, gets put on medication as a pre-teen, gets shunned by his piers, etc. and ends up a school shooter, was that of his own agency?<br>I completely agree, basing a world view off of the \u201cdubious\u201d ability to override anothers free will is not smart. If someone is aware of their free will they cannot be affected by love magick, or any type of magick or torment, even physical. People aware of their free will can control their body functions, heartbeat, metabolism, etc. Sadly, most people are not aware of their free will. <br>Minimizing karmic load is one thing.

And that&#039;s the thing, billionaires are very powerful individuals, but they are POWERLESS compared to the few individuals and groups they serve. There are people who practically don&#039;t exist in any &quot;official&quot; capacity, yet have TRILLIONS in wealth.

It is this higher civilization which led humanity, and became its Shepard. This same group which was and is humanity&#039;s shepherd is still in power today, in both the underworld and overworld.

I knew there was no point in apologising for being stubborn, yet I felt guilt for running away from myself. Even so, I asked the questions on my mind, and was reminded how simple things are; that I overcomplicated things. For example, I&#039;ve been a vampire for a long time. Even if I ascend, that won&#039;t change. When acknowledging this side of me, I often added the disclaimer that I&#039;d like to be a &quot;good vampire&quot;. But my actions contradicted this: shying away from mutually beneficial ways to fulfil my needs, in favour of being an edgelord.<br><br>As I felt lost, I asked Lilith if she understands how I feel. To my surprise, she shook her head and said my internal conflict doesn&#039;t make any sense. I understood what she meant, and realised that figuring out what I want in this case isn&#039;t a matter of understanding how I feel, but simply of making a decision. She asked me what I truly want, to which I asked for a hug. Admitting that&#039;s what I want meant I&#039;d made up my mind: that I want to accept people&#039;s warmth, and enjoy their company. Thus, I finally felt comfortable with putting my intentions into clear terms.<br><br>Having been in denial for so long, all it took for me to become what I decided to be was to put my feelings into action.

My teachers said with my talents, I could be anything I wanted. But with a mind broken by loneliness, all I could long for anymore was to be a loving man&#039;s housewife. And such a meagre sense of normality seemed so far out of reach, that I was even willing to &quot;sell my soul&quot; for it, offering up everything I valued and believed in.<br><br>But Lilith didn&#039;t allow that. She granted my wish without taking anything in return, confronting me with an obvious question: &quot;So, what do you want next?&quot; And thus, I began to question myself: &quot;Why did I think I wanted to be such a normal person? In the first place, wasn&#039;t I just arrogant for thinking I wasn&#039;t?&quot; Perhaps on some level, I began to wonder if the great depths of sorrow and pain I&#039;d overcome were all that truly set me apart. Upon further reflection, it became apparent that I had already begun to think of people&#039;s foregone despair as the essence of who I truly am deep down. And who was to say that it can&#039;t be? It clearly shaped my development as a person tremendously.<br><br>Yet, the shallow wish I&#039;d once made came from the bottom of my heart nonetheless. I finally understood why Mother Lilith hugs me so often: no matter what kind of path one may be on, it&#039;s always better with company. And in understanding that, I began to remember what my true will once was, in the absence of boredom and despair:<br>I want to make people happy.<br><br>The difference lies only in what I choose to do.

Thousands of insects die to make vegan food too, is that also evil? If a forest was cut down to plant a farm and hundreds of animals lost their home, am I evil for buying vegetables in the store that came from that farm?</span><br><br>Your question is flawed. Most vegans like myself don&#039;t even necessarily think in such simplistic moralistic terms like &quot;evil&quot;. In my case, I was someone who was raised in an omnivore culture and socialised into eating animal flesh in various forms without questioning it, and I enjoyed it. Because of modern mass industrial agriculture I&#039;d never even seen an animal raised for slaughter. At some stage I made a mental, logical, emotional connection between eating this meat and the reality of the experience of animals who die for that food. Then I told myself that those animals probably lived pretty decent happy lives on farms and so on until a sudden and pretty painless death. At some stage, though, I looked into it and found that this isn&#039;t true - it&#039;s much more awful than any of that. It&#039;s simple empathy. I don&#039;t want others hurting or enslaving me. I wouldn&#039;t like someone firing a bolt-pistol into my brains, and my flesh being used for someone elses pleasure. Most of us are aware that humans transitioning to a different diet would involve lots of changes, and that there are moral issues including issue relating to the suffering of animals displaced by farming or insects killed in the production of food, etc. What we&#039;re doing is the most simple first step possible - we&#039;re saying &quot;I won&#039;t eat any of this&quot;, sometimes we do this as I originally did, thinking that others would follow and that I&#039;d send &#039;signals&#039; through consumer culture so that the world would change - and this definitely did happen to some degree, many of us just want like the idea of participating in it, even if we feel things won&#039;t change. Many anti-vegan posters think they have a &#039;gotcha&#039; moment with these questions, as if we aren&#039;t aware of them.", "time": 1671960005, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684019, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684004</a><br>Continuing...<br><br>The vegan diet still impacts animals, there is no debating this, it impacts in many many ways. Even when vegan food items are shipped anywhere, animals end up being killed as roadkill by those delivery trucks. Animals are affected constantly, in every little way. But the simplest point is that if anything is going to change, stopping killing highly complex animals like cows, pigs, and so on - who are clearly capable of not just sentience but high levels of intelligence, emotion, affection, fear, etc. I personally try to avoid killing insects but I would consider it a significantly worse thing to willfully kill a pig than even maybe many insects. This involves judgement and knowledge about what sentient and experience is, and all sorts of factors we can&#039;t claim to definitively know, but for the same reason most people wouldn&#039;t want to kidnap a human child and kill them, we don&#039;t want cows or pigs or chickens being treated so brutally or killed for their flesh, especially when it&#039;s not necessary.", "time": 1671960327, "resto": 33680960}, {"no": 33684027, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)04:30:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684019</a><br>The issue is mostly RELATIVE HARM. Humans have to survive, and we impact the environment and other animals. Is it so unreasonable to say that we should try to MINIMISE this harm and suffering? That&#039;s what vegans are doing. No matter what you argue - producing food for a vegan diet would never have to impact as many lives, and especially wouldn&#039;t have to affect highly complex animals capable of greater levels of suffering. Also most of these anti-vegan arguments like &quot;Oh rats and small animals are killed by harvesters producing plants for vegans!&quot; are just petty, fake attempts to spin the argument - vegans want to minimise harm, generally farmers kill animals in those ways because they were raised in this omnivore culture that thinks it&#039;s justifiable to do so to produce food for humans. If vegans had their way - all vegan food would also be produced in ways that animals aren&#039;t killed in the process. This is entirely POSSIBLE, it would just take more effort, and would &#039;cost&#039; more to the end consumer.

The simple reality is that the present system is incredibly brutal, but mostly concealed from the publics eyes. Sometimes the most innocent beings imaginable - like beautiful little calves or piglets, are torn from the security of their mothers and siblings, put in a terrifying situation like transported on a very noisy, shaking truck, and then killed without sympathy. It&#039;s also a statistical inevitability that even if you assume all parties involved are doing their utmost to make it painless (which they aren&#039;t), that many animals aren&#039;t killed instantly the way they&#039;re supposed to, and instead suffer significant head trauma and injuries, in other cases things are much worse - like chickens routinely being improperly beheaded, and then boiled alive. All of this takes place merely so that others can enjoy the pleasure of eating this flesh, and we know that it&#039;s not necessary - that we can get all of our nutritional needs without any of this. We can even eat very WELL without this. So the question is, do you want to participate in this? Can you use your imagination and put yourself in the place of these animals?

You can also try learning how to do a shamanic journey for yourself, to get your answers. Also, look into ways to further your spiritual awakening state, through Kundalini meditation (I don&#039;t find Kundalini yoga very helpful). Spiritual growth is a process, so it&#039;s hard to notice that you&#039;re already growing.

They also project a lot of peace and positivity in their life.&quot;blue is related to the throat chakra, which governs communication, expression, and truth. people with blue auras need opportunities to share their truth and ideas.

Sometimes you get them because you are doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, and sometimes because you&#039;re on the right path. <br><br>You should focus on trying to remember/lucid dream. This can open some doors to understanding synchronicity as a personal revelation. You will start seeing how the dreams are syncs with waking reality, your subconscious(preconscious) is how you tap into syncs, as that is effectively how your higher self/soul communicates(via tailored pattern recognition).

One of these stuck around and I could &quot;talk&quot; to it even in moments when I was not actively imagining my inner world. But one thing I did was write poetry. It was a bit like automatic writing where I was allowing my subconscious speak without interruption. It wrote little poems and songs and other things.

Neville Goddard is one potential teacher that you can incorporate, but I&#039;ll recommend these two practical ways to train as well:<br>The first is Psalm Magic<br>https://www.ariels-corner.com/learn<wbr>-psalm-magic<br><br>You select a problem in your life to solve, or something you wish to happen. You take a Psalm, read it out loud once. Then you read it again slowly, trying to dig for the occult meanings, reading the Psalm in a more symbolic way.<br>Here&#039;s an example to get a taste of it.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_id<wbr>5nMFZSuY<br><br>The reason why I recommend this is because when you do this with every Psalm, you are considered an adept, or Psalm Magician (and every time you do it again, you get another degree of initiation). You should do one Psalm a day, but you don&#039;t have to do them in order, and if a Psalm calls to you, feel free to work it multiple days (the magic comes from understanding the Psalm, after all). You shouldn&#039;t rush this, but it&#039;s a pretty straightforward way of going through a magical initiation, and should take maybe half a year or so.<br><br>The other thing I recommend is the book in pic related. You can get it off Libgen. It teaches meditation/visualization for magic (under the term &quot;psychotronics&quot;), as well as practical experiments to prove to yourself of your power, like getting animals and people to like you, or melting clouds away.<br><br>Stuff like tarot or astral projection depends on your schedule. I think it&#039;s better to master your meditation/visualization before branching off into other things. Instead of Hemi-Sync, I&#039;d start off with Liquid Luck, which is another meditation by the same people using the same sound technology, only it&#039;s short and focused on &quot;manifestation&quot; rather than astral projection.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5k<wbr>G--O7hk0", "filename": "Psychotronics", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 355, "h": 500, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672074623595238, "time": 1672074623, "md5": "EmRfgCIChIwVZXI5eBpPYA==", "fsize": 23547, "resto": 33690344}, {"no": 33690488, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:11:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33690344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33690344</a><br>To be a wizard requires 4 things.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TO KNOW</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TO WILL </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TO DARE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TO KEEP SILENT</span>", "time": 1672074694, "resto": 33690344}, {"no": 33690521, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:17:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33690482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33690482</a><br>Thanks for taking the time to post such a well thought out reply, this is all really useful stuff, and I\u2019ll be sure to check all of this out", "time": 1672075071, "resto": 33690344}, {"no": 33691025, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:49:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33690356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33690356</a><br>Lots of good places if you know where to look", "time": 1672080564, "resto": 33690344}, {"no": 33691052, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:53:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33690356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33690356</a><br>369<br>They will also seem oblivious when you start asking on philosophers stone and try guiding them into trying to start and make it", "time": 1672080794, "resto": 33690344}, {"no": 33691087, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)14:00:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33690344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33690344</a><br>I made a list similar to this before my journey....the most important part was to ask God/The universe a mission for me...once I set off on my journey and lost all fears, I started noticing how easy it is to do magic.............It just comes to you....start noticing angel numbers, synchronicities, do telekinesis, move people in your way with your mind, find fellow magicians (you will either see it in their eyes or they will appear/approach you) etc...<br>Good luck!<br>Oh yes the diet part must be the most important!

By using math, instead of having power outside of their self, they can use things like the power of logic or math in order to slowly cultivate power within themself. Extremely negative beings who are scared and afraid of connecting themselves to the light use math in order to make themselves feel more powerful because they decided to discard their light for more negative selfish desires. When a being throws away their light through acts of negativity- they have to resort to things like math because they have no power to draw from outside themselves. <br>That being said, math can be used as an advantage and a tool.

You have to find and figure out what works and resonates with you and what doesn&#039;t, not your mom not your dad not your teacher not your buddies an army friends. Your spirituality is no ones business but your own. Its a private matter. There&#039;s nothing you can call in that&#039;s not already in you. If saying an audible, verbal prayer helps you then do that but your guides already know your thoughts and protect you and know what your going to do and go with you every where no matter what religion you are or who you pray to. Spirituality isn&#039;t about making friends and being social, its about the state of your own individual soul. It&#039;s your connection to whatever you consider your higher power, if you have a higher power. Religion isn&#039;t spirituality, religion is a lifestyle. If I were you I&#039;d listen to binaural beats, meditate, do yoga, buy crystals, learn how to align your chakras and identify which ones are closed, open, spinning too fast or too slow and things along those lines which will help you waaaaaaaayyyy more than toaism and church. You don&#039;t have to pray to a god and give away your power to that god, you can pray to the Universe. You can ask the universe to protect you and by sending the message out into the universe its like a telepathic phone call or radio wave out in space. I myself don&#039;t pray to idols or avatars or ascended masters or angels or beings or saints or gods because I don&#039;t wanna give away my god given power, we are Gods. There&#039;s so much more better stuff you can do that can help you spiritually, but church for me isn&#039;t even an option anymore, that&#039;s like trying to get high off a cigarette.

Unless someone can provide an intellectual response on the metaphysics of Lucifer and his place in the cosmos, or at least adequate reading material, I refuse to believe Satanists are anything other than hedonistic edgy atheists who like the Satanic aesthetic", "time": 1671981128, "resto": 33672881}, {"no": 33684861, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:13:12", "name": "fellow nigger", "com": "Thought the greatest one was human antichrist", "time": 1671981192, "resto": 33672881}, {"no": 33684881, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)10:17:10", "name": "MercuryAttack", "com": "<a href=\"#p33684852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33684852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;imagine thinking you&#039;re better than god because of the gifts the big man gave you (which he also took away btw).

Meditation is a tool to understand the nature of the mind. To train ourselves to see things as they really are. It&#039;s really that simple. The reason we suffer so much is because we don&#039;t understand the nature of the mind. We don&#039;t realize how conditioned we are, the conditioning is the basis for stress and anxiety. When we watch the mind for a long enough time, we begin to understand it, we begin to notice the habitual patterns. We notice how external stimuli aren&#039;t the real cause of our anger, for example. The problem isn&#039;t that something is what it is, the problem is that we don&#039;t want it to be that way, or want it to be some other way. We learn that we&#039;re actually creating our own problems when we could just let it go. We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts. Thoughts are just there, the problems begin when we identify with and take them personally as &quot;these thoughts are me.&quot; Ultimately, your mind and thoughts are working against you, until you can break the conditioning and snap out of these delusions. This actually takes more work than anyone here is willing to do. Many people see &quot;meditation&quot; as a quick self help fix or relaxation technique, bit they won&#039;t have any meaningful or long lasting results from their efforts. Meditation has to be developed along side morality and wisdom. It&#039;s a tripod and none will work without the others. This means that probably 99.9% of people are wasting their time with meditation, because most people can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t bother with the morality and wisdom aspect.

I guess this is the part the scratches me wrong about the modern meditation movement. It teaches orthopraxy before orthodoxy, as if finding just the correct sitting pose or number of seconds to hold your breath will somehow undo all of your emotional problems, psychological baggage and preconditioning. There is no such thing, yet many want to believe it it since it&#039;s a much easier truth to accept (&quot;magic is real and I can cast a spell to fix everything!!&quot;) than the harsh reality that the base foundation of the way their mind works is shallow and needs to be torn down and built again. Not just in the flashy way, but in the rather messy normal way of confronting why they feel anxiety, anger and other nocive emotions. Which mostly stems from their previous inability to deal with those issues, which often provokes feelings of shame and anxiety so on and so forth.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We learn that we aren&#039;t our thoughts.</span><br><br>This is also super important.

Right as I pressed the shutterI heard a noise like footsteps behind me (homeless people sometimes camp in the park), so I moved causing the motion blur in the photo. Of course no one behind me. But in the photo there appears to be two figures in front of me which I could not see. When I first saw this I assumed it must be house lights as behind the tree and lamp is a fence and some houses. But upon examing the next photo I have (which I will post) taken at 11:35:41 pm, just 14 seconds earlier there is one light source, but it is no where near region of the photo where the two &#039;entities&#039; can be seen (try lining up the tree in each photo and the position of the lamp post).

I got it for a drug problem but I was also having this problem and I haven&#039;t watched porn or jacked off in years so it was really bothering me and making me depressed. I had been taking Suboxone since January but in October I stopped taking it and got the shot. The shot makes it to where you don&#039;t haver to take Suboxone everyday or every other day, you can just get a monthly Sublocade shot. It wouldn&#039;t happen when I was on the Suboxone until it wore off then it would happen again. But when I got the shot it stopped completely and hasn&#039;t happened since October. I think it has something to do with a bad prostate. I think drugs or masturbation or something else damaged or shrunk my prostate somehow and now when I&#039;m sleep an my bladder starts to fill, my dick will get hard and this will cause a wet dream and the wet dream along with my hard dick an weak prostate makes me (completely involuntarily) cum on myself then I wake up soiled and mad. I will note tho that when I had my girlfriend and was having sex everyday it never happened. Its also due to a suppression of sexual energy, its like your pipe bursting because the sexual pressure has built up too much and needs to be let out.", "time": 1672137654, "resto": 33688067}, {"no": 33696710, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:43:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33696698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33696698</a><br><a href=\"#p33693562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33693562</a><br>Meant to reply to OP", "time": 1672137788, "resto": 33688067}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33659346, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:07:34", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Big Ay Lmao Reveal in 2027", "com": "4 more years<br>https://twitter.com/528vibes/status<wbr>/1605409792209874944<br>What are the paranormal implications of this?", "filename": "AyLmaos2027", "ext": ".png", "w": 790, "h": 726, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 229, "tim": 1671660454844128, "time": 1671660454, "md5": "h7D2oFV67vQHsmsh933HRQ==", "fsize": 616198, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "big-ay-lmao-reveal-in-2027", "replies": 187, "images": 45, "unique_ips": 116}, {"no": 33659369, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:10:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "vid related is ufo community in 4 years<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx_<wbr>ZNn-_klk", "filename": "cdc", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 577, "h": 537, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1671660633366402, "time": 1671660633, "md5": "9EWmcn5xcw6hWidvWGAC2w==", "fsize": 33528, "resto": 33659346}, {"no": 33659425, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:17:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33659346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33659346</a><br>That is dumb.

Andrew Marr in a perspex box overlooking the Labour Conference at Blackpool - pretending to not know that 9-11 was happening - whilst the &#039;action&#039; was being played out in real time behind him - broadcast from another TV station. Firstly the anomaly of the BBC and their &#039;flagship&#039; Labour Conference coverage - with their BBC political editor Andrew Marr - standing in front of another TV station (as far as I can remember it was CNN) whilst doing a BBC broadcast. How &#039;peculiar&#039; is that? Do the BBC normally have a monitor showing CNN/ITV etc news behind their BBC broadcasters? Surely the Templars were over-egging the whole &#039;we do not know a thing and are certainly not responsible for anything to do with 9-11&#039;? Having that Templar, Andrew Marr standing there and trying to feign innocence, in front of that non-BBC monitor...a big mistake. Who was behind 9-11? The Templars/Royals and US bankers. MI5/MI6 knew all about the plan - many years before. I found out that they knew, in 1997. The CIA didn&#039;t know - even after the event. Who was behind the Asian tsunami? - pretty much the same &#039;cabal&#039;- facilitated by MI5 but with important additional players: Royal Dutch Shell and Adidas. Who was behind 7/7?

It is here that the Woman herself is raised above the natural law of sex (das nat\u00fcrliche Gattungsgesetz), to which, in the belief of even the wisest lawgivers, she remained so bound that the Buddha himself thought needful to exclude her from the possibility of saint-hood (However, the process of emancipation of the Woman takes place amid ecstatic throes.)</span><br><br>END", "time": 1672123567, "resto": 33694660}, {"no": 33695950, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)02:53:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "so what&#039;s the conclusion after reading the whole threadq", "time": 1672127620, "resto": 33694660}, {"no": 33695972, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)02:56:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33694660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33694660</a><br>bhagavad shita text which is as &quot;ancient&quot; as my ass", "time": 1672127819, "resto": 33694660}, {"no": 33696569, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)05:08:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "roasties absolutely seething itt", "time": 1672135712, "resto": 33694660}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33690889, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)13:29:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Which spiritual mentors do you personally follow?

Now point #2 is that if life used to be on Mars instead of Earth perhaps life was on Mercury as well. Why?

The next two things happened in an order that I can&#039;t remember, though I suspect it was in this order.<br>1.

I laid in bed for a while, processing everything that happened, then suddenly felt pins and needles all over my body, and became paralyzed. I possibly could have fought it and broken the paralyzation, but I was too focused on the sounds of thunder and flashes of white light peaking in through my window and door way, all the while what sounded like a kid&#039;s voice repeated the words &quot;Hey, listen1&quot; three times (sounding vaguely like a certain fairy from the Legend of Zelda)<br>The light show was trying to unnerve me, as the light that was coming through my doorway was shaping itself in such a way as if my door was opening letting in even more light and an implied &quot;something else&quot; along with it. I was smart enough to figure out that was just a trick of the light though, and so I regained my ability to move. I wasn&#039;t scared, but a bit uneasy.<br>After all that I didn&#039;t go back to sleep and just thought about it all.

She was basically implying I wouldn&#039;t have asked that on my own and that my sister put me up to it.<br>2a.) The concept of time holds no meaning. The only reason we have time on planet earth is due to the rotational spin of the globe. 1 day is 24 hours and 1 year is 365 days through pure chance. How does one keep track of what year it is on another planet, much less in a dream world where time can behave differently and people can dream a year or even more in just the short timespan of a night.<br>2b.)

Analogously, the Aquarian temperament is programmed to regard things from many points of view and to think on a global scale rather than in terms of the needs and desires of their own chauvinistic group. Abstract principles rather than outward appearances are sensed to be the enduring realities of life.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If many Aquarians seem aloof and detached, it is not because they are indifferent to others. Often they are too deeply concerned with the plight of humanity as a whole to expend themselves catering to the foibles of individuals. To the Aquarian, time is energy, and they are choosy about the people with whom they spend their precious gift.

If they have not evolved to the point of being able to express universal love in the impersonal manner of dedication to a cause, they may remain uncommitted to anything.

Symbolically, this shows that the desires of the individual personality must now be subordinated to the requirements of society as a whole.

They secretly pride themselves on their humanitarian nature. Despite a level of intelligence, they&#039;re often gullible to propaganda that uses empathy of the plight of humanity.

They can make for excellent friends but only at a distance (they&#039;re often social butterflies who disappear for extended time frames). They&#039;re often woefully politically inclined and need something to rattle their sabre at (of the ones I know, all of them are like this).

Also, they make for terrible lovers as they tend to sit themselves on a pedestal (the humanitarian ego). The honeymoon phase of dating an Aquarian is always a delight due to their individualistic nature but that quickly gives way to an almost petulant obstinance.

I was a bit younger than I am now. I was probably around 16 or 17 in this dream. Anyway it took place in this old looking city. Like there were Greek style pillars in the front of large baroque and Victorian Era buildings with small walled yards and the trucks were very old looking and parts of the city were abandoned. I was some sort of soldier with a dog. My job was to walk around check on the streets that were abandoned and make sure nobody was there. Sometimes I&#039;d see other soldiers kinda just loitering or going on their own patrols. There was this really fucking bad tension everywhere and me and the other soldiers had this fear of our officers. We stayed in what kinda looked like a trailer park about the size of a football field but the trailers were more like prefab box like buildings made of metal and were lined up in neat orderly rows and there was this massive ditch dug around the whole compound with tall razor wire and towers guarding it. In the center of it there was this concrete bunker thing where I was NOT SUPPOSED TO GO INTO and the officer inside got very angry if I even looked at it. There were always trucks and jeeps coming through. One night I have this dream where I hear sirens. They sounded so fucking awful I was sweating and the other few soldiers were sort of panicking as they hopped into their trucks and drove to their posts. It was about before sunset when this happened. I remember not having a truck and i just had my dog and I was really fucking scared and tried walking to the city to get to my post when suddenly things started exploding. Like the ground would randomly fucking explode sending huge chunks of dirt crashing down and shooting small bits of rock everywhere that stung even if you stood a block away. Of course the sirens were going off causing more chaos. I eventually ran through a wooded area and found some soldiers sorta deserting and cowering.", "time": 1672118905, "resto": 33663585}, {"no": 33695178, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)00:32:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "All I remember are bottomless test chambers and owning a superhuman body to endure endless testing.

Fucking. Mistake. I remember this shit when I woke up from the dream and it still bothers the shit out of me when I think of how bad it was. The ground in the cemetery exploded, sending bones and huge chunks of black earth into the sky sending chunks of corpses everywhere and I remember being so scared I literally shit myself when I saw a small jeep with the officer in it. He was with 2 other soldiers and he saw me and look surprised. He quickly grabbed me and took me with him quickly into the city where he said I would wait by a train and protect those trying to leave. He said we were being attacked and that the leaders should have known better than to send the main force away. He was very pissed off about the whole deal. I eventually got dropped off into the city where this mob of rich people were crammed into this weird looking metal artsy looking pavilion waiting for a train. Covered trucks were just unloading crying people and one of them saw me and started a riot almost. They were screaming at me and blaming my army for the attacks and one even laid this dead little girl at my feet. I remember her bloated blue corpse vividly and felt disgusted as the father kept screaming in my face and his wife stood by and wept. He kept screaming when the train was coming but I had no radio and didn&#039;t know. I tried calling the crowd when this sickening disgusting green light lit up the avenue and we looked up.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Don&#039;t step/lean on markers. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. If its close to a marker assume its an offering and leave it be. It should go without saying, don&#039;t take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br><br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, don&#039;t take photos of them intentionally. If a mourner approaches, put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after they are gone. <br><br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br><br>Use your best judgement as a rule of thumb<br><br>Some recommendations:<br><br>1) Boots. It gets muddy in some areas. Don&#039;t wear anything you&#039;re not ready to get soiled.<br><br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots, still videos and self photos. <br><br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration.<br><br>4) Get there as soon as it opens. In the early morning there are few to no people which will be best for photographs and not to inconvenience anyone. <br><br>5) Take photos of weird and interesting things you notice.

A few suggestions though:<br><br>1) Respect the dead. Don&#039;t step/lean on markers. Try to pick up trash whenever possible. If its close to a marker assume its an offering and leave it be. It should go without saying, don&#039;t take anything. It belongs to the deceased and it is punishable by imprisonment.<br>2) Respect the living. People are grieving, don&#039;t take photos of them intentionally. If a mourner approaches, put the camera down and clear out. Come back later if you wish after they are gone. <br>3) Do not trespass. Its locked for a reason. Keep out. <br>4) Do not destroy or break anything in an attempt to gain access/take a photo. Maintenece crews will find out and lock down the area which will ruin it for future investigators.<br><br>Use your best judgement as a rule of thumb<br><br>Some recommendations:<br><br>1) Boots and old/rugged clothes. You might be climbing fences and walking through muddy areas. Don&#039;t wear anything you&#039;re not ready to get soiled or tear.<br>2) Tripod. It makes for taking excellent panning shots, still videos and self photos. <br>3) Water. Running around a cemetery all morning is cause for dehydration. Maybe a light snack.<br>4) Get there as soon as it opens. In the early morning there are few to no people which will be best for photographs and not to inconvenience anyone. <br>5) Take photos of weird and interesting things you notice.

I think what a lot of people are picking up on about 2016 is that the world (on our original timeline) was actually supposed to end in 2016 from nuclear war based on the timeline we were on and headed in before that but they stepped in an fixed our timeline to where it didn&#039;t happen or we would already be another atlantis by now.", "time": 1672055519, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689456, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)06:54:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688273</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Believing in evolution</span><br><br>That&#039;s your first mistake.", "time": 1672055661, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689471, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)07:03:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688541</a><br>nah, those were the people who didn&#039;t make the cut. all the atheist eurofags are gonna be gooks next cycle.", "filename": "monkey_vidya", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1774, "h": 998, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672056228261936, "time": 1672056228, "md5": "OgtEhhjLZg8z9K9yezKubg==", "fsize": 209104, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689505, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)07:15:50", "name": "S.L.M", "com": "what if i told you altlanis was the last ice age city to fall.<br>and that civilisation has been desotied and rebuilt over 12,000 year period and that most of modern humans (whites) come from it?<br><br>note i&#039;m saying this because blacks and jews and other nonwhites ehere different human beings<br>not everything was moneral<br>after all I am Oyyesess the last atlantian<br><br>what would your reaction be?<br><br>I&#039;m surprised the gaints didn&#039;t tell you this.<br>some of the gaints where my friends.<br><br>I do not know what happened to them.", "time": 1672056950, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689801, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)09:16:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688273</a><br>Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state<br>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago, expansion started<br>Wait...<br>The Earth began to cool<br>The autotrophs began to drool<br>Neanderthals developed tools<br>We built a wall (We built the pyramids)<br>Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery<br>That all started with the big bang (Bang)", "time": 1672064219, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689810, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)09:20:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33688273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33688273</a><br>Project Exodus.", "time": 1672064449, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689820, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)09:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33689351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33689351</a><br>Now I jobunt instead of mammoth hunt.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TAKE ME BACK</span>", "time": 1672064609, "resto": 33688273}, {"no": 33689850, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)09:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33689440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33689440</a><br>This is by far imo the most intriguing area of research.<br>I&#039;ve intuited so much about it this year it&#039;s hard to remember all of it but I do prominently remember this;<br>Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim, Ziusudra, Deucalion, Noach...<br>They&#039;re all exactly the same soul, the exact same entity, in the exact same incarnation, doing exactly the same things.<br>Being an antediluvian entity, every single thing we know about him comes through oral tradition over the course of at least 10000 years.<br>The Sumerian source (kings list) marks Ziusudra as the last antediluvian king, and that he reigned for almost 13000 years.

It&#039;s an idea that has its roots in Lurianic Kabbalah and other forms of apocalyptic occultism. The basic idea is that man is God and hasn&#039;t realized it yet and that the end of the world will involve us having some sort of awakening to our divinity. In the Zohar, there&#039;s a mention of people in the last days eating the flesh of Leviathan to realize the unity of all things (Leviathan is a sea creature in the Bible, which has connotations of chaos if you know about ANE religious tropes, and by the middle ages Leviathan was considered a demon by Christians).

What are we progressing towards? Nobody is ever too explicit on that point, although it&#039;s always understood that this progression is related to technological advancement somehow.

Make the world as evil and chaotic as possible so that a &quot;savior&quot; figure can appear and lead us to the knowledge that we&#039;re all God. And some sort of singularity event could well play a big role in that. The groundwork for the end of strict materialism and scientism is already being laid by narratives like quantum mysticism, Perennialist one world religion stuff, the new age, eco-mysticism etc. All pushed by extremely shady people, including a lot of controlled opp figures in conspiracy circles.
