These elements sustain Iron but do not prevent rust, but prevent bacteria and infection. Quicksilver, when heated, extracts elements from Ore, specifically Gold. Under controlled situations, developed over certain periods. You can regenerate Iron, strengthening it over time indefinitely per regenerative process.<br><br>As a result, mercuric oxide will be produced, varying in quality depending on the procedure beforehand. This is the philosophers stone. Keep this in mind.

I personally found out that what I thought was depression was actually a parasite feeding on me. Years of therapy and medication didn&#039;t help me but listening to /x/ schizos did. If you started to awaken your kundalini you should have more energy now and thus made yourself more of a target for parasites. Also notice where you get attacked/ notice which chakras they go for and try to close those. There&#039;s decent documentation on how to do that in the jos power meditation pdfs. I imagine turning the chakra around, stopping its spin and pushing it together in a single motion and that usually helps for a few hours although not perfectly. What stopped the attacks was attacking it back so make of that what you will. Also im not sure you can stop the kundalini once it started to awaken and doing nothing can lead to uncontrolled spill of its energy and that can seriously fuck you up.

Before you ask, no, it was definitely just a dream and felt like one, i just watched and read too much ufo shit lately.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

I used to think that astrology is a more or less accurate personality test, then I listened to a Hellenistic astrologer break down the chart of a person I admire and even go through the various events of his life, and her interpretations were so rigorous, logical and extensive that I was immediately convinced there was something to astrology. As it happens, she was also a Hellenistic whole sign partisan, so the case was settled as far as I was concerned. There are also some extremely talented Hellenistic astrologers like Demetra George and Chris Brennan who stand out for their skill - it is doubtful that you will find modern astrologers that can match them IMO.

These forces overcome the inertia of the plane and make it take off.<br><br>On the other hand, the earth is at relative rest, since it is revolving around the sun at a constant speed. So when you jump, your body is being affected by inertia, causing you to continue moving in the same direction and speed you were before you jumped.

But wait...your NEW cope is that the aether moves like a solid spinning plate, such that the aether at the southern (outer) latitudes must cover more mph (move faster) than the aether at the northern (inner) latitudes. And...by COINCIDENCE...MM experiments kept moving north? Have you actually looked up each one and dropped a pin on a flat Earth map to see if that&#039;s true?<br><br>Except...THAT&#039;S ACTUALLY WORSE. Now c should vary wildly depending on orientation at the southern latitudes. Likewise RLGs should be all over the place depending on latitude. But we observe none of that.<br><br>This is no different than convoluted flerf &quot;models&quot; for sunrise/sunset. You claim A to solve problem X, then claim B to solve problem Y, not realizing that A+B is a greater contradiction than the problems you were trying to solve in the first place.<br><br>tl;dr - there is no aether.

In my state at the time, I was suicidal and depressed. <br>I took that dream to mean I should do the same as that statue. So I grabbed my knife in my room, wrote a note for my family and sat on my bed, knife up to my chest just like the statue. I was getting ready to plunge it in into my chest. I snapped out of it, thank God. I was ready to take my life. That was three years ago and I still think about that dream and that night.

A grand piana, Boxes of old magazines and clothes. <br> Once emptied out I put my bed down their with my wife who didn&#039;t have a face or voice but just kind of existed. <br> The thing would walk around your bed when you weren&#039;t there or were gone and it would leave large water stained foot prints like that episode of Creepshow where the people come back to kill the mobster who drowned them.<br> There was also an infinite stair case that spiraled upwards and you would literally go insane if you went too far up their. It led to the spiral cone thing but no one made it to the top because it seemed to go on forever. no matter how far you went up you never reached the top but you could quickly just turn around and then be back at the base level even if you walked up a million stairs before.<br> There was so much to the atmosphere and the feeling of constantly being watched and knowing something evil lived their that fucked me up.<br> I&#039;ve had others before too. I went almost a full year with nothing but Nightmares. <br>PT 1", "time": 1673510025, "resto": 33813965}, {"no": 33820256, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)02:57:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33813965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33813965</a><br>When I was 17 I had a terrible fever and couldn&#039;t go to school for almost a week.

I live in one of the largest cities in America. In this world everything was crunched down into a small town. What would take me an entire day and a half of walking I can do in 10 minutes. I tried to map it out in Minecraft once so I could explain it but no matter how I tried to do it nothing made sense geographically. Neither did the time line. I could be a 8 year old in one and then a 18 year old in the next.<br> One dream I had and really liked was were these &quot;aliens&quot; from an alternate dimensions came to us.

I looked out at the most beautfil thing ever. It was the destruction of man kind but I couldnt help but smile.<br> The entire city was on fire which lit up the night sky, This gorgoues Green gas was swirling around the streets and these large zepplin blimps were what the aliens were using to travel and they covered the sky. They were the size of small cities each of them and they had ropes dangling from them.<br> In that same dream with some help I was able to cross the barrier into the other dimension to save my brother. The thing about the aliens is that they would fill the half of the universe missing with themselves shape shiffiting. So you could think it was your mom you were talking to but your real mom was in the other universe and your talking to an alien.<br> I saved my brother and his mom my step mom and our grandma was there. But I knew she was an alien and when she tried to call the &quot;Control?&quot; On me I thrust my arm back and cracked open one of their skulls like a fucking grape and sent their green blood and gray skin everywhere. I caved in the others skull to so they must have been phyuscially weak when shape shifting because as aliens nothing hurt them. <br> The dream went nowhere really. Millions of years passed and we were trapped in our never decaying or aging bodies.

She finds us more than we find her, running up to us with this manic look in her eyes. She excitedly clamoring about how the scientists had done this &#039;wonderful operation&#039; on her. She was no longer pregnant, and we eventually figured out that the &#039;operation&#039; was to remove the baby to do who knows what with. The entire time, she was manic, insisting it was a good thing, asking us to come have an operation too.

I can&#039;t explain the torture I went through, and the images I was made to witness. I don&#039;t want to.<br><br>2.

I had entered this alternate timeline in Oaxaca, Mexico. There was a cafe downtown, in a neighborhood ran by what was once demonic royalty and had evolved into a sort of local cartel. A neighborhood gang. They were a cannibalistic demonic group, and their favorite snack was the scalps of victims, cooked in an oil like substance. I entered the cafe through the rear, an alleyway, and watched and listened to the conversations of a demon being tattooed by another demon. The markings on his flesh were signifiers of his status as &#039;collector&#039;, who brought those to be scalped. He was eating a soup of the scalp of a recent victim. The demon tattooing him was legless and had arms which went from flesh to bone, with one arm bearing a needle point tip out of which his blood acted as ink tattooing the demon talking. He was bragging about his ability to handle his job, and how he enjoyed watching his victims squirm. They had found a way to grow the scalps and flesh of victims back a certain number of times, so only x amount of flesh-food was needed per week, more or less depending on consumption. In front was a busy street. Young women walked by and I wondered how they felt safe here. Back in the cafe I went to exit, return home. Exited past the tattooed man seated on a stool and into the alley. A woman was throwing out garbage. I asked her how to leave. She said the bus arrives every x hours, you have 1 minute to get in, and when you get in, you MUST NOT LOOK AT ANY OF THE PASSENGERS, but I could talk to the driver, or you will be forced to endure the entire transportation and be brought back here. She also said between where we stood and the alley was a room, it sometimes appeared to be a church, typically whatever people leaving felt safe in, and I must not enter it no matter how appealing or I would be feasted on for eternity.", "time": 1673633676, "resto": 33813965}, {"no": 33830767, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)13:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33830722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33830722</a><br>2. cont&#039;d<br><br>She ran me to the train/bus through the dark, wet alley, and I saw the room like a church interior she mentioned, with bright colors, it appeared safe unlike where I was running. The bus door swung open after arriving like a train with bright blinding lights. The driver was absolutely horrific. She was a conglomeration of cannibalized flesh, fat, and gore, sewn together without string, as if it were all growing parts of different humans latched onto her, and she was fat, her face was many peoples faces, and she explained to me the same rules as the woman who ran me there. <br><br>I knew, I felt, and in the corner of my eye, saw the presence of what can only be described as the most horrific unsettling uncomfortable entity I have ever witnessed.<br><br>I sat down, and I knew it was behind me.

Tickling me. I could feel it carressing my back, the hairs on my body. As if it could touch the tiniest particle of electricity behind me to make me know it&#039;s presence physically.

It&#039;s heretical by necessity, having received most of its rituals from the ancient Mystery Schools, Jewish mysticism, Gnostic hereticism, Chaldean astrotheology, and Templar heresy.

People may say that means God created it but I don&#039;t think so. In God&#039;s original creation, man didn&#039;t have to work and he could live for free. After the serpent came, God&#039;s curse was that Adam was going to have to work for a living (Gen. 3). Masons seems to adore this curse, however, and elevate employment to a noble status other than the literal curse of original sin which it is. Furthermore, it says in Judges twice, &quot;In those days, Israel had no king. Each man did as he pleased.&quot; Therefore, one may assume that the secret command hierarchy of the masons was something that crept in through the unceasing rebellion of the Israelites against God&#039;s intended creation: each man should do as pleased and he shouldn&#039;t have to work to pay the rent on his life. Masonry adores a model of society which is the opposite of the one God created. They like the one that Satan likes: wage slavery and each man doing as he is told. God subverted Satan&#039;s rebellion and put himself at the top of Satan&#039;s cult, i.e.: &quot;The Lord rules over Israel,&quot; but the cult is inherently Satanic, in my opinion, due to the above.<br><br>Although God&#039;s only complaint against the Israelites was that they would follow the ways of other nations, the Israelites demanded a king &quot;so they could be like the other nations.&quot; Even when God told them they would hate it, they would not heed God&#039;s wisdom (1 Sam. 8). After the kings started to choose some men as commanders and some as field hands, what is now called &quot;the pyramid&quot; eventually developed. God didn&#039;t create it that way. It was the result of the Israelites&#039; rebellion. In the way God wanted it, each man should do as he pleased without falling under the dominion of another man. God gave man dominion over animals but masons say that men have dominion over other men, which is 100% satanic. In God&#039;s creation, no man would have dominion over another man but masons celebrate the opposite of that.", "filename": "TIMESAND___ThePyramid2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 499, "tn_w": 125,

For many people this causes sleepiness but for me I get insomnia and so forth. Also, thymoquinone, the active component in BSO, is also a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

That study you linked is studying a rat model, but epilepsy varies wildly by patients and many times MRIs and EEGs don&#039;t find the direct causes of it in JME. My theory stand that although BSO may alleviate tremor in *some people* through increase in GABA, the increase in serotonin &amp; acetylchline, and decrease in blood sugar probably negates this benefit for me. In my case, seems low blood sugar increases seizure threshold, but that doesn&#039;t hold true for everyone. My experience with herbs like st johns wort which increases serotonin and the racetams similarly seemed to increase shakes (very much less so with racetams).

There are plenty of materialist, charity focused lodges out there that are great if you just want brotherhood and meaningful contribution, but I assume since you&#039;re here you want something more esoteric. For that you&#039;ll need to shop around a bit more. I&#039;m a member of Le Droit Humain and I can recommend looking into whether there&#039;s a Lodge near you if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for. Mixed gender masonry in general is a bit more spiritually inclined I&#039;ve found. Otherwise there are plenty of male only lodges that would fit the bill, but you&#039;ll have to visit a few lodges before you find one chances are.<br><br>As far as whether it&#039;s worth it and if Freemasonry is any good, that&#039;s up to you. I personally have found a great group of sisters and brothers that are like another family to me now. Taking part in regular group ritual gives you good experience whether it&#039;s especially inclined or not. If you follow the intended curriculum of the craft degrees it will also give you a decent base line to work from in other endeavours, both in mundane and other matters. <br><br>It must be mentioned as well that to be a Freemason you do have to be initiated into a regular Lodge. The work you do as a Freemason though is mostly personal and interior though, and the group ritual is there to facilitate that. <br><br>I&#039;m happy to answer more questions if there&#039;s something particular you&#039;re interested or concerned about also.", "time": 1673646167, "resto": 33824191}, {"no": 33832236, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)16:43:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Which religion is best for helping me manage my BPD symptoms?", "filename": "magick fraction power", "ext": ".png", "w": 660, "h": 737, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673646220262953, "time": 1673646220, "md5": "HcbaDEEmvauGu/qKsMUVLg==", "fsize": 487750, "resto": 33824191}, {"no": 33832361, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)16:58:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33832183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33832183</a><br><a href=\"#p33831932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33831932</a><br>I would add that while Freesmasonry itself is mostly simply a fraternal organization, &quot;working its current without joining a lodge,&quot; from my perceptive, is ultimately bringing you directly into or parallel to what is/was brought together in the current of the Thelemic body of work.

But I have a related story. I was using phenibut as a sleep aid. Not the big doses and occasionaly only. So one evening I took a dose and went to my computer. The difference that evening was that I forgot I had a beer during the lunch and it is very bad to mix phenibut with alcohol. So I went to my computer and for some reason I took an interest in religion. I thought that Christianity and God is fucking weird. He doesn&#039;t look like a good guy at all if you read bible stories. He punishes seems angry and have all kinds of rules that you must follow or you will suffer unimaginable pains in hell. He even kills whole familly and tortures a guy who worships him. It&#039;s so weird are all people tricked by an evil entity? He even sends his alledgedly son to be tortured &quot;for people&#039;s sins&quot; which changes nothing, it makes no sense. Then I remembered that Lucifer means light-bearer and thought that if people are tricked maybe he is the good guy? He seems like a chill guy, something like libertarian deity lol. Then I started thinking why I am even officially Christian I should go back to my ancestor religion, they were fighting and killing Christians for a long time and we still have some parts of pagan culture so I should just go back to my roots instead of that retardedness. So it was my thoughts and I was googling and browsing and what not.<br>Then it begin, I felt that its a bit chilly. I put a sweater on but it got colder and colder to me. I put some warm clothes then went to bed but I was absolutely shivering. It was so cold like I was naked outside in the winter. Nothing helped. It wasnt fever either I was more or less normal just it was really really cold.

It has physical effects, even. If I think about coughing, people around me start coughing. This sounds like a bunch of BS, I&#039;m aware. I&#039;m also aware of the mind&#039;s tendency to pick out things that it is thinking about in order to support its worldview (cognitive biases). I have indeed been fooled by these cognitive biases in the past, but I know what I&#039;m experiencing is not always just an illusion of the mind, but oftentimes a real paranormal phenomenon.", "time": 1673697792, "resto": 33830913}, {"no": 33837228, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:07:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33837206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33837206</a><br>Now, I have a very important question for you guys.

Every soul is awaiting judgement day, some probably having awesome dreams and fantasies, while others have been wandering around for probably hundreds of thousands or millions of years as restless wicked spirits. There will be a 1000 year reign of Christ until we&#039;re destroyed. Is it instant destruction? No idea. I haven&#039;t looked through Strong&#039;s Concordance with a good Septuagint based Bible translation specifically on the cases of Hell, Hades, Sheol, etc. They could be lying, trying to simmer down the seethe of nonadamites. Because of course, if they don&#039;t, when people come out about this, Adamites are going to be horribly persecuted. I will tell you, I&#039;ve been praying to Yahweh and Yahshua for a long time, and he&#039;s helped me with addiction, helped me find a house, helped me with many things. Crumbs from the masters table for the kunarion (Koine Greek for &quot;little dog or &quot;puppy dog&quot;), as opposed to a street dog that eats trash. Matthew 15:27. The Canaanite woman is referred to as such first, by Yahshua. So, that&#039;s somewhat hopeful. Maybe there&#039;s crumbs to be had in a miserable afterlife? Yahweh never used to answer Cainites for the most part. Now he does. Some things have changed. However, I&#039;ve gone through some extreme bitterness recently, thinking on the mere fact that Cain even existed, how he probably wasn&#039;t even aware he was serpent seed, and the need for such self-awareness with blind people in particular. Seems like a cruel joke. I don&#039;t know what kind of answer Yahweh could give us that would bring us peace.

Who would have the biggest incentive to hate Yahweh? Canaanites. Simon the Zealot was also known as Simon the Canaanean. He was a Gnostic (reportedly), and Peter told him to GTFO after he offered money for the miraculous abilities that Peter had. That&#039;s classic Canaanite/idumaean behavior. Buying the powers of the Holy spirit. You have to have a serious lack of self-awareness to ask Peter to sell those abilities. Also, Gnosticism may have many sects that disagree with eachother, and they did carry on SOME old, forgotten traditions that the church scrubbed from the Bible (serpent seed stuff), but their stuff is so plastered throughout degenerative media that just makes everything worse in the world, even if there are some reasonable Gnostics, the ones in charge happen to hate Yahweh, and also happen to live child rape, adultery, etc etc etc etc. There isn&#039;t a lot of positive outcomes I can see from the Gnostics today, quite the opposite. If the Gnostics were in charge, there&#039;d be even more serpent seed everywhere, forced into existence, only to be destroyed and tortured because of generational cursed and bad blood. Seems like the actual would who would make up that religion would just lose in the end, so what&#039;s the point? Pride? Honor? You fought Yahweh aren&#039;t you so so strong and brave? That just seems like what Yahweh would want you to do. Playing right into his hands as the typical Canaanite enemy. We can see that everything is going according to His plan, can&#039;t we? He&#039;s obviously in charge of this place. There&#039;s no escaping that fact, for me. There&#039;s a side of Him that&#039;s so beautiful, that I feel like I&#039;ve seen, and the fact that someone gets to experience that love, his children, who have been terribly persecuted, makes me focus more on them instead.

If they used the method you describe that evidence would not exist. <br><br>Examples of that evidence include machining marks left behind in tubular bore holes, circular saw marks suggesting powered diamond-tipped saw blades with a diameter of tens of feet, micron and sub micron precision cuts in various stone blocks, perfectly cut granite jars that look to have been made with a powered lathe (including one example showing evidence of starting in the wrong axis, stopping, realigning the work, and continuing), and much more.<br><br>These are processes and levels of precision only found in modern CNC machine tools using modern materials like diamond tipped cutters. Some of the cuts seen such as the tubular drill hole marking even exceeds the performance of any modern tools. Christopher Dunn made a mold of one such tube hole and its corresponding plug in a granite block in egypt, and published his findings including the angle of the cut. He clearly showed that it was a continuous tool mark and that whatever tool made the marking had managed to cut several inches into the granite with just a few rotations of the tool. Making such a deep cut in so few rotations in a material as hard as granite is quite literally impossible for even our best tools using diamond cutting surfaces. He speculated about what kind of process could be used to achieve such a cut and thought that something using resonant frequencies to weaken the material while cutting could have been used. Machining of this type does exist today, but its usually used for machining very hard and brittle materials like cast iron. As far as i know there are no examples of this being done with granite, although it might be possible.<br><br>There are other things which I could get into but its a very vast topic.

If you tried to use the drag saw method that the egyptologists suggested, with a copper saw swung like a pendulum back and forth with sand in between the stone and the blade to cut through a granite block, not only would it take months of non-stop cutting just to make the facing cuts on a block of granite about 15 feet long and a third wide, you&#039;d also go through tons of copper in the process. The workers would essentially need to replace the blade every 13 hours or something, it would just get worn down so fast. it&#039;s completely impractical and makes zero sense. If there is one thing we know about construction, its that at no point in human history did people ever waste time on such retarded building method. If people built something, that means they had a proper system in place to do it efficiently and quickly. Using pounding stones, copper tools and sand to try to cut through the hardest stones found in nature is the very opposite of this principle. This isnt even factoring in the time involved, the amount of stones found, their sheer weight (even modern cranes could not handle the largest megalithic blocks which weigh upward of 1k tons, you would need special purpose built cranes just to maneuver such stones) making it a logistical impossibility to try to transport them miles away across deserts, through the fucking mountainous jungles of the andes, etc. and the huge amount of these blocks found vs the time during which they were allegedly made (especially the andes, seriously you expect us to believe the inca did all that in 300 years?

The first Indo-Europeans to reach Scandinavia were the Corded Ware people from modern Russia, Belarus and Poland, who are thought to have belonged predominantly to haplogroup R1a, with a minority of R1b and I2a. These people shared some similar maternal lineages as Scandinavian I1 inhabitants, including mtDNA haplogroups U2e, U4 and U5, but also brought many new lineages such as H2a1, H6, W and various subclades of I, J, K and T.<br><br>The second major Indo-European migration to Scandinavia was that of haplogroup R1b-U106, the branch that is thought to have introduced Proto-Germanic languages, as an offshoot of the Proto-Celto-Germanic speakers from Central Europe. R1b probably entered Scandinavia from present-day Germany as a northward expansion of the late Unetice culture (2300-1600 BCE). The oldest known R1b sample in Scandinavia dates from the Nordic Bronze Age circa 1400 BCE (see Allentoft 2015 above).<br><br>According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, first proposed by Sigmund Feist in 1932, Proto-Germanic was a hybrid language mixing Indo-European (R1b, and to a lower extent R1a) and pre-Indo-European (Mesolithic I2 and Neolithic G2a and I1) elements. This hybridisation would have taken place during the Bronze Age and given birth to the first Proto-Germanic civilization, the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-500 BCE).", "filename": "Aryanz", "ext": ".png", "w": 1342, "h": 663, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1673568628719450, "time": 1673568628, "md5": "Jx+4b7MF1+uaFfB0thfMyA==", "fsize": 771815, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825354, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:10:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825346</a><br>lurk more", "time": 1673568655, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825358, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:11:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a>", "filename": "Rapebabieggers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3238, "h": 3898, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673568693230058, "time": 1673568693, "md5": "ScwbbCyJi6+0Au7xXGff/w==", "fsize": 1655755, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825365, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:12:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a><br>The original Proto-Indo-European Proto-Pajeet", "filename": "fwlcap78rw871", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1962, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673568762091914, "time": 1673568762, "md5": "zi2fMEw/XJ2ZR8l0x6ukSw==", "fsize": 303092, "resto": 33824991}, {"no": 33825371, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:13:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825349</a><br>Pajeet rape baby with the light skin stare.

If Christians can\u2019t even agree among themselves, how can they make exclusive claims about absolute truth?<br><br>After a quick search online, it\u2019s not hard to find a plethora of blog posts commenting on the large number of Christian denominations and concluding all sorts of things: \u201cChristianity has splintered into pieces\u201d, or that there are \u201c40,000 groups contradicting each other\u201d and \u201c40,000 different interpretations of the Bible.\u201d<br><br>First of all, it\u2019s always important to do a fact check. The World Christian Encyclopedia, one of the two sources from which the 40,000 number is taken, has a very specific definition of \u2018denomination\u2019 for the purposes of its study. As you can see here, they define a denomination as an organized Christian group within a specific country. So, for example, although there is only one Roman Catholic Church, over 200 Roman Catholic \u2018denominations\u2019 are listed \u2013 one \u2018denomination\u2019 for each national body of Roman Catholics.<br><br>So it is quite misleading to say that there are 40,000 denominations worldwide, if by that we mean that there are 40,000 organised bodies of Christians who are divided against each other.<br><br>The actual number of denominations is a far smaller number (they count 300 major ecclesiastical traditions worldwide, grouped into 6 ecclesiastico-cultural mega-blocs), and even across denominations there is significant partnership and unity.", "time": 1673672288, "resto": 33833077}, {"no": 33835364, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:00:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33835348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33835348</a><br>bruh, 2 is too many", "time": 1673672404, "resto": 33833077}, {"no": 33835450, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:13:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33833088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33833088</a><br>Half the time they&#039;re worshipping Ba&#039;al without even realizing it.

Because of the fog I couldn\u2019t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid 20s, and healthy. My ultra-attenuated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5\u20196\u201d.

I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement.

I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY.

Steven Greer has wrote books on this shit an talked to THOUSANDS of alien abductees, psychics, ex area-51 employees, government people, and probably hundreds of people who can&#039;t even be named. He&#039;s in circles people like us could only dream of being in. Anyone who thinks Steven Greer is full of shit is a dumbass flat out whether you like it or not. Aliens are peaceful, do you think you&#039;d be here right now if they weren&#039;t. Can you look up in the sky and see evil angry aliens? Then wtf are you talking about. People who get abducted agree to it before even being born, they don&#039;t know that while in their body but when they die they do. When aliens come here and abduct people their doing it for hybridization programs and medical purpose. We&#039;re just lab rats to them but they aren&#039;t evil. Why are you mad at Greer and the ayys? Your government is the one who made the peace treaty with them an said You can abduct our people and use them for whatever in exchange for technology. But even then they aren&#039;t hurting anyone. Who&#039;s willingly gonna carry an alien baby? No one. But if the woman agreed to it before she was born an planned a life as a human alien abductee then that&#039;s what she signed up for and its gonna happen whether her human self that forgot likes it or not. She won&#039;t know while she&#039;s alive, but when she dies she&#039;ll realize this was her purpose. The whole reason abductees are born is to be abductees. The whole reason missing411 people are born is to be missing411 people, the whole reason the sandy hook shooter and kids were born was to do that shooting.

We can come to know God, to an extent, but it&#039;s beyond our cognition to actually understand God, IMHO.

They existed as Unity; containing within them all possibilities.<br><br>That being split itself apart into different pieces; some parts light and some parts dark. They wanted to experience the ecstasy of their reunion, and thus sparked the first big bang. The first lowercase &#039;g&#039; gods were created and imbued with tremendous cosmic powers, because they are in essence the &#039;bigger shards&#039; of the Unity; of God. We as humans are smaller pieces of the unity, and the atoms/energies of the physical world are still smaller pieces.<br><br>&quot;God is everything&quot; is literally true, in that we all are shards of the Unity and eventually we can all fuse back into that being to repeat the cycle. Someone suggested that perhaps the Unity is just death, and as soon as we die we return to it, but I get the sense when speaking to my guide that the true God is more than that. <br><br>The implication of this interpretation is that God is mostly indifferent to our suffering because life needs dichotomy in order to exist in the first place. God loves us the way we might love the flowers in a garden, but we don&#039;t jump up to serve them just because they&#039;re being eaten by another lifeform. Earth is a planet of change and conflict, and we are put here to engage in both.

I had woken up alone and confused as where my mother had gone. It was around 6 pm when I woke up. I yelled for my mom to check if she was still home. No response the house was quiet. The last thing I remember was coming home from school and going to sleep since I was exhausted. At 7:38 I started to get dress to go search outside the nearby neighborhood for my mothers where abouts ( sorry for any errors in my text ) By 7:45 I was leaving the house ( this is were the recording begins ) I know she was either at a close friends house or shopping but I had to comfirm. I wasn&#039;t able to contact her as my phone was dead since I hadn&#039;t charged it ahead of time before falling asleep. ( I used a camcorder and an old phone without service as a flashlight ) Not even a few minutes walking I hear a fant scream. I&#039;d describe it as a high pitch scream of pure terror like if someone had got caught or captured. Stupidly instead of walking back or continue walking my path I head straight to where I heard the disturbance. I barely made it out of the area after walking, stopping once in awhile as noises in the bushes would startle me, and most horrifying of all running for dear life. ( had to cut the video the moment my flight or fight kicked in ) I would&#039;ve been tackled if I hadn&#039;t responded fast enough.

The tunnel awakened an ancient evil. When the rescue team arrived at Church Hill, they encountered a creature covered in blood and holding human skin hanging between its fangs as it leered over the workers. The creature quickly left the scene and ran towards the James River. It was then approached by a group of men, after which it escaped to Hollywood cemetery, where it was said to have hidden in the tomb of W. W.

If you can&#039;t find any urbex specific sites or they do that shit where they refuse to give out locations I recommend looking at real estate sites for foreclosures and condemned buildings.
