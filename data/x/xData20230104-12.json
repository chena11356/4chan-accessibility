Not really, I&#039;m just getting older slowly. I can still stomach a few games of LOL per day. I&#039;m not ranking as hard as i did in highschool anymore. Relationships? Yes, voices called my e girlfriend a whore. Don&#039;t know if thats good or bad. Don&#039;t really have time to care or think about it, since like I said I have schizophrenia since the event and when off meds voices get crazy<br><br>Gender doesn&#039;t matter to the devil, apparently, because he can change into a womanly form/face at will. That&#039;s all I know and it&#039;s the last time I saw him. Maybe what I said isn&#039;t even correct.

I have this odd feeling I cannot shake off that she manifested me first, and I am just manifesting her in response.<br><br>While I cannot give you a real answer this made me think about one of Tom at Be Something Wonderful&#039;s latest videos (which was about SPs to begin with). He says that &quot;hot and cold&quot; behaviors happen because humans are multidimensional beings, with different iterations of themselves overlapping all the time. So maybe you and I feel we&#039;re being manifested because we ARE seeing those iterations of ourselves that someone else manifested.

At some point, after what felt like 2-3 hours at least of just playing the scene over and over again in my head, my body got sore and i kinda fell asleep while being awake (? Dont ask me how, it was a weird feeling). The next thing i remember is waking up in my room and being dizzy as shit, at that point i started talking with someone in the room in front of mine about taking sleeping pills or some shit and decided to take a shower. You know how you try to get your clothes off while drunk? It was like that but 10 times worse, ive become essentially blind and couldnt remember what ive done 2 seconds earlier.

The roulette is arguably the easiest game to cheat using remote viewing. You just have to guess if the ball will go on red, black or green color. In my experience, in big casino roulette are always situated in the most noisy place, making it really difficult to concentrate. In las vegas there are always DJ playing near roulette game. also, the time to chose your color seems tailored to just not be enough to remote view. With enough training you can still get it to work. But there is the weird part. I personally can get consistently 8 good bet out of the 10 first before running out of stamina and going back to a 50% chance. But each time I start winning too much, the roulette &#039;cancel&#039; the game. It still spin, goes where I predicted but then it spin again and only the second spin count. And each time the second spin isn&#039;t my bet. I know I sound like a schizo addicted to gambling but if you tried it you&#039;ll get the same result as I do. Something really weird is going on.

Leadbeater from their book &quot;The Astral Plane \u2013 It\u2019s Scenery, Inhabitants and Phenomena&quot; to describe them as:<br><br>&quot;...a formulated, definite wish or thought instantly shapes subtle matter, moulding it into an independent being. This mental form lasts as long as the power given to the original thought or wish allows it to. The thoughts of many people are indecisive and evanescent, so that thought forms created by them do not last longer than some minutes or maybe hours. However, a powerful wish or an often-repeated wish or thought can give rise to a mental form lasting for days.<br><br>These thought-forms seem to have an instinct or tendency to preserve themselves as all living beings do have. People\u2019s thoughts mostly refer to themselves, so that the thought form will stay with them and, in this way, it will provoke a tendency to repeat the thought or wish from which it was created so as to gain power and prolong its own life. Such a thought-form nourished by often-repeated thougths is able to haunt a person for many years, gaining strength and influence, sometimes with very negative effects.&quot;<br><br>The 4 usually attributed types of Thoughtforms according to the Western Magickal Tradition are as follows: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tulpas</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Servitors</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Egregores</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Godforms</span><br><br>What are your experiences with these, /x/?

Feelings inhabit your body and you can feel them better if you focus on them, they usually carry forgotten memories or various insights and blissful states if you focus on them enough.<br><br>Meditation is a paradox to me, it&#039;s like a means to an end but also the end itself, it&#039;s like a vehicle which takes you places but also it&#039;s just erasing all the unnecessary noise around you to realize that all those places were always here next to you.<br><br>So sit and watch your breath, feel your body breathing, your mind will make thousands of stories about anything but just let it be, don&#039;t even label those thoughts, don&#039;t even say &quot;I&#039;m letting them go&quot;, just let them be and focus on your breath, on the feeling of your body breathing, your mind will say &quot;that&#039;s stupid, analyzing these important things is better&quot;, but just focus on the breath.", "filename": "1512570456001", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672271330940214, "time": 1672271330, "md5": "c0bAcP9zk2u5OCdO2P9Msw==", "fsize": 123540, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33709115, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)18:59:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33707913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33707913</a><br>Lay but you may fall asleep so maybe be rested when doing laying down meditation, although you may AP or lucid dream if you are a bit tired which is also interesting.", "time": 1672271950, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33709288, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:21:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33699654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33699654</a><br>making the whole of mind one and making the whole of mind all have the same end result, and are in essence the same thing.", "time": 1672273278, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33710746, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:06:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33705612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33705612</a><br>What does your intuition say?", "time": 1672286772, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33710828, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:18:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33709021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33709021</a><br><a href=\"#p33709288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33709288</a><br>I find it difficult to accept that observe and focus states of mind are the same because observing is open to all experience while focusing hones in on one element to the detriment of the rest.

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind? That&#039;s too narrow, try to FEEL, like literally feel your whole body breathing, the breath fills your lungs only but it also moves your belly and your pelvic floor with its movements, your shoulder blades and clavicle may also move during inhalation/exhalation, feel your whole body sitting there and breathing.<br><br> - Speaking of the body, try to keep your head retracted (search about this head posture), also imagine a thread which is attached in the middle of your head pulling it lightly up, this head position helps with sleepiness.<br><br> - Again: Don&#039;t make a story about it, it&#039;s just you breathing, yes you will just sit there and feel yourself breathing, your mind will think &quot;What? Only that? That&#039;s too simple/stupid/whatever&quot;, but believe me: first achieving calmness and silence is the most important thing.<br><br>- And last: Coffee is not the only thing which may hinder your meditation practice, everyday cannabis smoking or regular pills may hinder it too.", "filename": "cantona-kick-kick-567223161", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 438, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672691017977960, "time": 1672691017, "md5": "gihIXsBjxxSx54w6mJG6DA==", "fsize": 72063, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746889, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FEEL, like literally feel</span><br>he means think about feeling", "time": 1672691075, "resto": 33698846}, {"no": 33746915, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)15:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33746889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33746889</a><br>Excuse me?

The best thing about all of this for me at least was I could say whatever I wanted and have gotten more positive than negative feedback. Tbh it truly is an art form. Setting up scenarios, questions, jokes, slight comments. Even down to facial expressions/reactions and evening understanding the person and knowing their reaction puts you steps ahead. It&#039;s a beautiful game. I&#039;ve been called all the names under the sun but desu I remember the compliments that made me feel good. Being called witty, having a very strange/interesting way of thinking/speaking. Told that I was very good at getting under peoples skin, but also doing it in a humorous way. Because I will say words are one of the most powerful tools we have and if you learn how to use them to the best of YOUR ability.

Ionizing radiation. There&#039;s a large amount of research already done on how radiation changes genetic properties of these fungi. Look up Chernobyl and Cryptococcus. That&#039;s the same cryptococcus neoformans that is proving to be a deadly pathogen by the way. There are other studies related to virulence increase after radiation exposure, I believe that was saccharomyces but it&#039;s another dimorphic and human pathogenic yeast so same logic applies. <br><br>Now put a species in space, where there&#039;s no atmosphere to shield against rads. The right conditions and spores could survive dessicated for an extremely long time. Meteor hits a water supply, just for example, and now you&#039;ve got panspermia. Difficult odds? Sure, but not anymore than the odds of a new species just popping up out of nowhere. The clades that were mentioned for Candida Auris are odd because they showed up roughly simultaneously but had already been through enough generations to be distinct genetically. <br><br>Vancouver 1999 that was mentioned a thread or two ago is another good key in for panspermia. A large scale Cryptococcus Neoformans outbreak (largest ever for overgrowth in immunocompetent population actually) that still has no satisfactory explanation. <br><br>And sure you&#039;re going to run into resistance in the settings of concern you mentioned. But that&#039;s very different than a species just popping up en masse in areas it shouldn&#039;t be in. <br><br>I really think that consideration needs to be given to the cave origins as well. I stand by the origin point of dimorphic fungi being potentially not here originally though. They don&#039;t line up with the other fungi very well and have some odd traits. Like keying in on 95F for certain biological processes, being able to survive environments that standard dimorphic fungi can&#039;t, and even having multi stage processes to obtain energy/ATP from a living host.", "time": 1672782661, "resto": 33750221, "trip": "!!vYxNKqsY1FK"}, {"no": 33754750, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)16:57:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33753273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33753273</a><br>Some anon posted several months ago about how they had put some oregano oil on their feet and then experienced some major die off reactions.

Concurrent use is about 360K years. And the oldest genetic material in all of Africa to date comes from that exact site. And for whatever reason they decided keeping pigeons was a good idea. The caves are known for it, and pigeons are specifically known as carriers of zoonotic yeasts - candida and cryptococcus in particular. <br><br>Here&#039;s why it&#039;s so key to what I focus on. I believe that humans were actually better at immune function in the past. For some pathogens like the type of fungi we&#039;re studying, that may not have been that long ago overall. <br><br>There&#039;s are specific immune responses that get leveraged by these fungi. Primarily th-17s are the cells affected and errors there allow inflammation to go haywire. The way this plays into the dates from Taforalt is the population that resided there had high 90% rate of dental cavities. Cavities and dental issues for inflammation and decay are now being tied to candida as the catalyst (and I&#039;ll bet a couple others show up under scrutiny). Candida started the party, the rest of the germs show up to join in. <br><br>Now here&#039;s the tally. You can&#039;t have tooth decay in its accepted definition without candida present. If your immune system is functioning correctly your th-17s should be able to take care of fungal spores way before tooth decay ever sets in. However, the population at Taforalt is the earliest record of a population having a massive amount of tooth decay at around 17,500 years ago. And at a rate of 97%. There is not an earlier record of these types of cavities at this scale available, once there is I&#039;ll be revising my research appropriately.<br><br>It all boils down to firsts.

I said it before on /pol/ and I will say it again. <br><br>there&#039;s no guarantee that aliens visiting us are technologically ahead of us. For all we know they may have approaches to doing things that are totally different than us or have found materials and energy states we don&#039;t see and as a consequence they developed a very different evolutionary or technology path.<br><br>So the first thing they are likely to do if they come to this planet is to study it as observers without interfering with anything. Star Trek was filmed on the McKenna line of thinking that interspacial fungus impregnated the galaxy with humanoid like creatures that evolved over aeons, but there&#039;s no guarantee that is the case. Life as we have it on this planet might be totally different elsewhere.<br><br>Once they can establish some cultural baselines and understand us, then the first thing they&#039;d do after that study is likely open trade. Humans might, for example, have traded microchips, or fine jewelry, art, plants, animals, or other things the aliens might find precious and they may have traded us a few spacecraft or weapons. Once you get to a certain point of development you&#039;re going to be open to desperate sections of garbage species raiding your planet and that can produce the wrong message. Really depends on how quiet the neighborhood is.<br><br>And then you have the borealis here on earth. The northern and the southern lights.

It probably depends on the person though, some people being more susceptible to being sapped than others. I&#039;m not sure if I agree with this at all. I know it&#039;s a common thing for people to say how they feed off of the energy of the room or the moment or whatever, but a lot of the times I don&#039;t feel that. For example: the times I&#039;ve been at concerts and everyone was into the music and the moment I couldn&#039;t help but feel uncomfortable, but also focused on the performance. I didn&#039;t get that feeling of energy leaving me. It was more the feeling of wanting to leave because it was too loud and there were too many people too closely packed together. It&#039;s possible that only certain types of individuals can actually &quot;give energy&quot; to others, while other people either cannot do it or subliminally don&#039;t do it.<br>I really doubt that every single celebrity enjoys the limelight and being the absorber of other people&#039;s life force like this joker is trying to say. <br>Quite frankly, the entire thing sounds evil, and I lost some respect for him that I didn&#039;t even know was there. It is obvious to me that he is an egomaniac with an overinflated sense of self worth who has completely given himself to this world of evil urges and desires.<br>I only have sympathy for the ones who follow what he says, they are very easily manipulated by people just because they have a sure-of-themselves attitude. <br>The problem is the usual issue: lack of a father figure.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do we get a stronger pull on the universe by witholding this attention?</span><br>If you subscribe to this theory of energy absorption then the answer would be a &#039;maybe&#039;.<br>It seems that people with this outlook don&#039;t choose to feed on others but *need* to.

I think because they have similar roles in their respective pantheon and are more or less major deities in their pantheon that they could be the same.</span><br>I think that&#039;s partially true. I&#039;ve come to understand it that a lot of the entities we interact with when communing with a deity tend to be more like &#039;titles&#039;, for lack of a better terminology, than individuals. Most gods tend to embody fundamental concepts and are woven into an egregor of persona by the observations of man, but that&#039;s simply all that we&#039;re observing, not necessarily the totality of the the entity we&#039;re interacting with. So that&#039;s to say, these entities we commune with are made up of &#039;multiple&#039; deities from various mythologies /pantheons because the inherent nature of what we&#039;ve collectively deified is a specific facet of them. That said, I suspect there&#039;s an affinity you could try and quantify an entity with as &#039;more Zerus than Ares&#039; or perhaps &#039;definitively Odin&#039; if an entity primarily (but not entirely) embraces that aspect of themselves. When viewed in this light, it also helps reconcile a lot of the seemingly schizophrenic behavior they exhibit in mythologies because there&#039;s more than one entity embodying that aspect in the story and the nature of conflating the deified title with the essence of being tends to lead to the appearance of a somewhat schizophrenic-looking behavior pattern. I also suspect many of them feel very misunderstood by this &#039;typecasting&#039;, but that likely varies on an individual basis. As a disclaimer, this is my current working understanding after a lot of work with a lot of &#039;gods&#039; but ultimately still filtering through my body&#039;s perception so not everything may be perfect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33728021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33728021</a><br>Young brunette woman with blue eyes.

Suppose he took of and quickly reached an altitude of 200 meters above the ground. Then he engaged autopilot and left the computer stabilize the plane at a vertical speed of exactly zero (meaning the plane should not be flying towards the ground or away from it). Then he left the autopilot on for like 10 hours and went to sleep. If the earth was a globe, when he woke up, he should see that the altitude of the plane was now orders of magnitude higher than 200 meters, even though the vertical speed had been zero all this time. (Why? Well, the plane was flying in a straight line, but since the earth is a globe the trajectory of any straight line starting at any given point on the globe, eventually has to leave the atmosphere and pierce out into space and beyond).<br><br>Obviously this does not sound like reality, intercontinental flights do not have to make constant vertical axis tilt adjusments just to keep a steady altitude.<br><br>Conclusion?

Flerfers often post it as proof the Earth is flat. Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

It felt like she pulled out a organ from my right flank, and she did something to it. Then she re-inserted it into my body and sealed whatever spiritual incision she made into me.

Unsure how to explain it, I asked her if she thinks nightmares can inflict trauma, or if they merely represent trauma that was already there. She said it&#039;s possible for nightmares to be traumatic if there is a disorder that disturbs the sleep, and that ADD could do that (she&#039;s a psychiatrist herself, so she would know). I mentioned I used to have nightmares that weighed on me heavily, and lately I&#039;m processing them as some repressed feelings are coming up.<br>She asked if I want to talk about the nightmares, but I declined, as I don&#039;t think it&#039;d help. Since then, she&#039;s asked me repeatedly to make an appointment with that psychiatrist to talk about it with him instead.

After the incident 5 weeks ago, I also understood she might have some non-selfish motives for it. Even so, it wounded my mind too deeply for me to forgive her.<br>One of those motives is to provide me with sexual energy that I needed. I&#039;ve mentioned before that energy is formless, and only appears to have a form as it&#039;s interpreted by the mind. Thus, spiritual experiences tend to be heavily influenced by a person&#039;s biases. I didn&#039;t do any form of meditation at the time and knew nothing of the occult. Who is to say that what I experienced in those nightmares is also what she did from her perspective? This morning, an idea suddenly came to mind: all she did was direct sexual energy my way, and what I suffered was a manifestation of my own sexual issues at the time.<br><br>What if that were the case? It wouldn&#039;t change what I went through, nor that she&#039;s responsible. It only changes her intentions back then. Maybe she didn&#039;t understand my situation as well as she thought. Maybe she didn&#039;t mean for it to make me feel so deeply conflicted. Maybe that&#039;s enough for me to be able to trust her if she were to apologise to me. Maybe forgiving her will give me the inner peace I long for. I still love her. As twisted as my views on gender may have been due to my confusing childhood, she embodies everything I admire about women. Maybe she can heal the wounds she inflicted on my psyche.<br><br>I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m too scared to even talk to her again; it&#039;s a miracle that I mustered the courage last week.

Public opinion can be manipulated, but in teaching the public how to ask for what it wants the manipulator is safeguarding the public against his own possible aggressiveness. The method of the experimental psychologist is not as effective in the study of public opinion in the broad sense as is that of introspective psychology. To create and to change public opinion it is necessary to understand human motives, to know what special interests are represented by a given population, and to realize the function and limitations of the physical organs of approach to the public, such as the radio, the platform, the movie, the letter, the newspaper, etc. If the general principles of swaying public opinion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific problem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitudes of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others. Group adherence is essential in changing the attitudes of the public. Authoritative and influential groups may become important channels of reaching the larger public. Ideas and situations must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span>", "time": 1672605878, "resto": 33734048}, {"no": 33740245, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)15:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33740220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33740220</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span><br><br>This is public:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The goal of the author in this chapter is to analyse through established psychological principles how torture-based mind control programming is installed and exerts continued control over victims.
