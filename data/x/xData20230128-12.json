There are two places in Scripture that say a day with the Lord is as a thousand years:<br><br> &quot;For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday when it is past.&quot; (Psalm 90:4)<br><br> \u201cBut, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\u201d (2 Peter 3:8)<br><br>Curiously, these verses do NOT say that a day is with the Lord as thousands of years (plural), ten thousands of years, or millions of years. It specifically states that \u201cone day\u201d is with the Lord as \u201ca thousand years.\u201d So, when the apostle Peter tells us that a &quot;day&quot; is with God as a thousand years, we should sit up and take notice!<br><br>2. Scripture also says that there still remains a day of rest for God&#039;s people. Paul tells us that \u201cthe whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now\u201d (Rom. 8:22), which means that the creation has not yet entered into the rest that the Scriptures mandate (Isa. 11:10; 14:7; 44:21-23; 49:13; 55:12). This rest will occur under the rule of Jesus when He returns and sets up the promised kingdom on earth for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-7)!<br><br>Interestingly, in Hebrews 4:4, 11, the seventh day of the week is pictured as a type of the peaceful &quot;rest&quot; on earth which will follow Christ&#039;s return! Being a time of \u201crest\u201d (Heb. 4:4-11), and lasting a thousand years (Rev. 20:1-7), it makes perfect sense that God would correspond it to the seventh day rest of Genesis 2:2. Since the last &quot;day&quot; of God&#039;s plan for mankind is 1,000 years, it is logical to conclude that the other six days of creation typify 6,000 years of man&#039;s government on earth.<br><br>Furthermore, the number 6 represents mankind and rebellion (6,000 years of man&#039;s self rule?).", "time": 1674908718, "resto": 33950351}, {"no": 33950393, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)07:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33950364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33950364</a><br>He gave the word to the Jews.

The fact that smoking is bad for you is pretty evident, and even a basic understanding of biology should make it intuitive that inhaling smoke into your lungs is going to damage them. It&#039;s unhealthy, and I can imagine that the drain on the economy from it was big enough to start some aggressive campaigns.<br><br>Anyways time for some more interesting theories. First of all, nicotine is definitely capable of improving the brain. It&#039;s a fast acting stimulant, and works on acetylcholine rather than dopamine like other stimulants do. Excess dopamine can be neurotoxic, but elevated acetylcholine is neuroprotective, and specifically improves memory and creativity. It&#039;s a subtly benefit, not aggressive like amphetamines, but I&#039;ve noticed I work better after taking nicotine, and will often use nicotine gum when I need a mental boost. <br><br>Another theory is related to the social component of smoking. There are very few times for people to just exist and talk in American society, especially with people outside your immediate family. The smoke break was one of these times, where multiple people would go outside together and just talk, all while under the influence of a substance that enhances cognition. The only other common time people talk with strangers is under the influence of alcohol which numbs cognition. Basically, by demonizing smoking, another avenue for people who normally would never meet to communicate was removed, and the remaining ways to meet people involve the use of substances which make you stupider, not smarter.", "time": 1674671095, "resto": 33926480}, {"no": 33928128, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:27:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You could change the world and still be a smoker.

We are all &quot;wired&quot; with certain codes, which is why people simply &quot;click&quot; with others, that&#039;s their codes clicking like a puzzle piece. This is why astrology and life path numbers make so much sense. We are all influenced by the way we were wired, there&#039;s no escaping it. But if we&#039;re going to talk about the people that are usually branded as &quot;NPCs&quot;, I believe that&#039;s a way of life/mindset where one has lost their spark and become a dull or bland human. One might be able to tap into or escape this state depending on their life force. Most people are going to be less &quot;NPC&quot; the younger they are, and modern life (toxin exposure, deficiencies, and stress) will drain their life force and send them into dullness permanently.

Physics and science does a good job to explain \u201chow,\u201d while philosophy endeavors to explain \u201cwhy.\u201d But while we\u2019re thing to find out the rules of nature, we\u2019re being subjected to these forces on a daily basis; the most prominent being the collective unconscious, which doesn\u2019t even have a representation in the physical world. Sounds can be perceived within a certain range, but when they emulate the sound of a human voice, they get your brain to think about imaginary pictures and concepts, some of which are loaded with connotations and meanings- and these are all supplied to you from experience and evolution. There\u2019s no other world than what you can perceive, but there\u2019s channels and layers of this world that you cannot perceive: fourth dimensions and higher, for example. The ability to question these things is also what prevents you from finding the answer; just as thought and consciousness is recursive, so is asking \u201cwhy.\u201d Humans can really only perceive the past, and the \u201cpresent\u201d is an infinitesimal point that we always miss, because it\u2019s so incalculably small- it may as well not exist. So, not only is your perception of space distorted by your corporeal body, but so is your sense of time distorted by your incorporeal mind. <br>That is why the tree of knowledge had the forbidden fruit, because wisdom is knowing how much you don\u2019t know.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here. As NDErs say, everybody on Earth is a star on the other side for having the courage and endurance to come to this nightmare hellhole.", "filename": "1615120187322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674865602418406, "time": 1674865602, "md5": "VSla6OBrWteYgUkZkobScA==", "fsize": 7568, "resto": 33942703}, {"no": 33947006, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)19:29:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33946953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33946953</a>", "filename": "FB_IMG_1670174481950", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1001, "h": 687, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1674865766931069, "time": 1674865766, "md5": "dDIcNJh+KeUPbp2Y8gkzfA==", "fsize": 39894, "resto": 33942703}, {"no": 33947027, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)19:33:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33946975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33946975</a><br>Just some old testament garbage.

That happens because of the innate feeling of correctness that comes with all thoughts and beliefs. <br>Most thoughts are automatic, so when you start feeling anxious, you can try to identify thoughts and beliefs about that situation that make you anxious and try to give yourself alternative interpretations of the event.<br>An example - if you are afraid of going to a bar and you think that people there will look at you, talk bad about you or think you are clumsy or something - remember that people forget faces all the time, that they are more concerned about themselves then you, that they dont know as much about you as you do, that they wont notice all the things you are feeling and so on. <br>After that its good to test your new thoughts about it, so that you can see that they are correct,

It has been known since antiquity as the astral plane, heaven, hell, and sheol. It was documented by the army in the gateway process as a holographic torus. Tesla knew about hyperspace and invented zero-point energy and scalar waves. The original maxwell equations were also hyperdimensional. Current literature on consciousness also describes a torus hyperfield. Telepathy is instantaneous and across space and time. Consciousness masters throughout time have used this field to manipulate reality. There are many accounts of levitation, astral projection, teleportation, non-locality, telepathy, and manifestation. UFOs and interdimensional beings have also been documented throughout history as objects in the sky and strange interactions. Names for beings include gods, demons, angels, faeries, djinn, and others. It is noted the consciousness field is a singularity and can be construed as god himself. In modern times, world war 2 is thought to have allowed the creation of anti-gravity and zero-point energy by the axis. Vimana may have been retrieved. Vimana have been documented historically by the hindu scriptures and include knowledge of pressurized mercury. Many extraterrestrial craft were spotted during world war 2 and identified as foo fighters, balls of light. Craft were downed by scalar wave weapons, including roswell. Alien bodies were recovered. Technology was reverse engineered. Such technology includes anti-gravity, kevlar fabric, and integrated circuits. Bob Lazar may have witnessed an alien craft and noted is was a single piece, indicating it was manifested upon manufacture using the transdimensional consciousness field. Victor from the alien interview documentary in 1997 provided footage of a supposed alien leaked from the department of navy intelligence. It may have been a black project robot.", "time": 1674878464, "resto": 33944228}, {"no": 33948161, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:02:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The kgb released footage of a greyling being dissected.

He also claims to have seen a short alien surrounded by a toroidal field, a humanlike alien, and an invisible alien who teleported him onto a ship. A recent disclosure witness from boeing noted the humanlike aliens are known as &quot;the orange.&quot; Synthetic telepathy has been in development since world war 2 when the frey effect was discovered. It was later updated to include radar EEG pings to read brain waves remotely. It is all AI encoding and decoding now, and involves hyperdimensional scalar waves. The nsa spies on aliens in their homeworlds and no SCIF is secure. Dr. Robert Duncan is a cia whistleblower who worked on such systems and has revealed many details of the technology used on targeted individuals. A us navy special operations disclosure document was released in 2013 and 2014 that documents the overall operations of these systems. It also includes synthetic timelines, teleportation, manifestation cloning, total weather microcontrol, remote force fields, cosmic ascension, non-linear spacetime generation, and contact with guardian angel interdimensional beings. This system or a similar extraterrestrial system was used on former marine kyle odom.

I learned meditation through the Goenka retreats where they teach a body scanning technique that allows you to tap deeper into your bodily feeling sense (kinesthetic sense) to the point that you start to see how this interacts with other layers that we would usually describe as psychological (i.e. thought) or feeling (i.e. emotional). I practiced very hard for a couple years a learned a bunch but ultimately it was not well suited for my psychology. The technique gave me to much to do. I think some people might benefit from a task oriented meditation like that but for my psychology it just provided too much opportunity to distract and obstruct myself through analysis.

I always end up wrenching myself out of these experiences all of a sudden but with this one I literally had to tear myself away from the bed with every ounce of strength I could muster and I genuinely screamed whilst doing so.

It was so unbelievably cool and I feel blessed to have had the experience and to share it. He was just this vast consciousness that exists within and beyond all things.

Vampires, lycanthropes, berserker druids, all manner of things exist where people change into entirely different beings. But there has to be some sort of bridge which causes a genetic trigger. I want to know these things. It&#039;s not even just a human thing, certain ayy species also have genetic triggers to evolve certain classes of themselves into something else. There is a whole mystic mystery here that is kept guarded and spread through different traditions but so secretive that there is barely an inkling on piecing the initiation portion of the process down to trigger actual change. It is only feasible to find magic which emulates this stuff, or only half-steps before the initiatory process.

I posted this footage a couple of weeks ago. I was filming a video about how to trap and capture an ayy and about two minutes and thirty seconds into the filming he burst through my wall, which mostly destroyed my computer. The only footage that survived was this clip, as everything else was fried. After he exploded my wall, a huge flash blinded me for several minutes, which was why I backed up to the wall scared and confused. After reviewing this footage, he appeared to be conducting a mating ritual that most ayys do when sexually aroused. When he finally left several hours later, as I cowered in the corner, I saw that he had taken my pants with him. Looking out of the hole in my wall, they were hanging out of the door in his ship as he flew off.

The bigfoots are being less openly confrontational. They don&#039;t pound the house as often. But now I&#039;m seeing lights in the sky at night. They move in a weird zigzag pattern with jerky acceleration then zoom off so fast I can&#039;t even imagine the speed. There&#039;s poltergeist phenomena in my house now.

They&#039;re using psychokinesis on her colon to make her IBS worse, they want her farts to be as loud and disgusting as possible for their atavistic mating ritual that they say is older even than humans. The bigfoots compete in a series of athletic games for access to the female, then in the final stage she farts in their faces repeatedly and whichever bigfoot is alpha enough to not faint or even flinch takes her. If farts aren&#039;t enough to separate the men from the boys the female must projectile shit at their heads. The smells coming out of my wife lately have just about made me black out, my eyes water and I have to run out of the house.

I was talking to her when her eye color changed. She started making whooping and howling noises and getting down on all fours to run. She started whacking table and chair legs with a stick, I think communicating with woodknocks. After smacking them she howled like a decerebrated retard. I had to cover my ears and started yelling back in rage. This started a screaming match like something out of African lion safari, which ended when she farted so bad I had to run out of the house to escape the smell. All the noise made my neighbors call the cops on me. Had to hide my wife while I talked to the cop. He picked up on the rancid fart stench permeating my home and asked if I slaughter livestock in my house. I just stared at him. After he left my wife looked at me with her yellow bigfoot eyes and spoke in a voice I&#039;d never heard before, way deeper than mine: &quot;where is my fart feast.&quot; I realized I hadn&#039;t fed her her brap meal for the day like the bigfoots told me. Before I could apologize she kicked my knees out and I fell on my back. Didn&#039;t even know what happened before she planted her giant ass on my face and pinned my head against the floor. I&#039;m flailing, shrieking wildly, it smelled like there was straight shit in her ass. Then I heard her say, in this lower than Barry White voice, &quot;Regards from King Bigfoot.&quot; I suspect I have brain damage from what happened next, so it&#039;s a bit hazy, but it felt like a volcanic explosion happened right on my face. I felt her asshole tear open, cheeks violently rippling, while this indescribable stench rockets up my nares, like burnt popcorn mixed with sewage. The heat was like baking on asphalt under the Georgian August sun. My eyes were burning so bad. I screamed my lungs out and it all went black. I woke up an hour later in a pool of my own vomit. My wife was yelling at me saying I puked on her ass on purpose. Her eyes are normal color again.

Like, your core belief about drinks is probably closer to &quot;most drinks are safe&quot; and not &quot;literally 100% of any drink or food that I come into contact with will be totally safe for me&quot;. Even some strong mystics/LoA practitioners Helen Hadsell (winner of 5000 contests) or Ernest Cobb (a.k.a. the Slot Guru, makes a living by winning tons on slots consistently) don&#039;t win 100% of the time, but they clearly have influence over their luck to be exceptional compared to regular people.<br><br>Now, I might have interpreted this passage wrong, but here&#039;s a Biblical example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, \u201cMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.\u201d And his disciples heard him say it.</span><br><br>You might as well ask, &quot;Why didn&#039;t the tree have a fig on it? Jesus clearly assumed that there would be a fig to eat!&quot;<br><br>From my point of view, just goes to show that even among masters, not everything goes your way unless you consciously take control over every aspect of your life.

Within this area of uncertainty in your beliefs, your ability to restain lustful desires will be challenged and this will almost be a test of your character as the universe will reward or punish you accordingly with the sort of women that will end up in your life. By choosing a more chaste path, you&#039;ll find women who have better self-respect and you&#039;ll be able to connect to them on an increased emotional level. You may even take a frequent backseat approach in the future where these women are energetically giving more to you where you might&#039;ve been used to taking the lead in that regard.

It&#039;s a good thing to keep in mind when pondering on these things. What I am trying to say with this opening is to not doubt your situation as to whether if you can, but as if you just need to find the right steps, like they are intuitive, inside you and do not be fearful of its uncertainty. Sometimes we lose more from indecision than the wrong decision. <br><br>First maybe we might look at what&#039;s preventing you from being closer to God, it seems that has to do a bit with how you assess things, sometimes perhaps leaning more on too much patience. Not exactly neglecting but you might be waiting for things to happen and come to you without much for a creative effort. This might not be exactly your case but the fact thay is portrayed is a warning that you have propensity for it. You also seem likely to sever the connection at perceived convenience, nitpicking what you want to feel. If we go for practical advice then it actually seems to go somewhat in hand with the warnings as it&#039;s advised to soak everything in, in a way that you feel more empowered for it. You might need to learn how to appreciate the parts that you might be more cynical about but not as if they are positives, but more in the sense that there really isn&#039;t anything you need to rebek about, you don&#039;t need to overthink things even if you do need to think about them. Counterintuitive perhaps, bur to put it in another way you need to be more embracing in your life, more willing to support and care for God&#039;s creation as a whole for when you care about what&#039;s around you, you care about God.
