Ever wonder why Islam spread like wildfire? It&#039;s because it wasn&#039;t radically different than the existing beliefs of the people that lived in the Arab world and the Indian Subcontinent (Zoroastrian monotheism variants). Islam really didn&#039;t start being the fuckstorm of stupidity it presently is until the Jews/Byzantines got ahold of it, and extremism is a relatively new concept with Jihad pretty much dating back to Sayyid Qutb (Western educated) in the 1950s.

House of the Holy (or righteous, take your pick, really doesn&#039;t translate). And yeah, Islam did have some preceding elements of the people that lived there, monotheism being one of them. Thing about Islam is, even though it may be a cult, Sharia brought peace and civilization to a lot of places. You have a pre-loaded system of government and moral code built into Islam and in a lot of places (present Afghanistan being an example) this moral code and system of government is the one thing bridging the multiple ethnicities and tribes living there. Also, the concept of &quot;the Mosque&quot; or the &quot;Al Jamaya&quot; is where the notion of Western Universities came from, Oxford being established after the Crusaders traveled East and saw that shit. Mosques aren&#039;t just places of worship, but also learning. Sharia really isn&#039;t bad, recent interpretations and Hadiths are what&#039;s bad. And for my two cents, this all started with the Ottomans (Gnostic Byzantine larpers is my book). The real Cult is the one that has infected all monotheistic religions with Pagan worship, Islam, Judaism and Christianity alike. Which is why Jews tie a black cube to their head and say their prayers, Christians gather in St. Peter&#039;s &quot;Square&quot; .. you know cube ... and pray next to a literal Egyptian obelisk, and Muslims march in concentric circles around a cube with a meteorite in it.

This cult has been experimenting with women and their unborn children for centuries and at every stage in process from conception to giving birth.

I lived in Northern California till I was 14 and both my parents worked for the United States Forest Service at separate times, and neither of them ever saw anything despite being out in the woods in state parks. The only reason that I say &quot;think&quot; is because I had one single solitary kind of strange incident. Let me preface this by stating that I was about 12 years old when it happened and, at the time, I was 100% convinced that it was a black bear. Basically, what happened was that my mother was driving us home, it was dark, probably around 8:00PM or so, and we were the only car on the road just slightly outside of town. Not that far from a supermarket at all, maybe half a mile away, so it wasn&#039;t deep woods or anything. Anyways, as we&#039;re driving, up ahead a ways, we see a large black animal run on all fours across the road. That was it. As I said, at the time, I was 100% convinced it was a bear. It&#039;s only many years later when I started to hear about certain reports about them running on all fours that I began to wonder about it in retrospect. It was probably a bear, but nowadays, I&#039;m simply not certain. Keep in mind that this is way up in northern California, total Bigfoot hotspot territory. I&#039;ve even been to Mount Shasta many times for fishing and stuff, and apparently people go missing there all the time. Pretty spooky in hindsight. As far as something that was clearly a bigfoot though, I never saw anything. My mother did once tell me with a totally straight face that she once saw a UFO rising out of the woods though, which was extremely uncharacteristic for her, since she had never expressed any interest in UFO&#039;s or anything of the sort before. She just kind of blurted it out at me one day and then never spoke of it again.

As a magician myself I have a personal definition of magic which crosses the supposed boundaries usually set by these faiths. Music is magic to me, art is magic, prayer is a type of spell, etc. If you develop this type of thinking it is quite easy to think it is okay to be a magician and a member of these faiths. However talk to any sort of religious leader or even just other members and they are likely to see you as a witch to be burned. It is worth noting that hardline sects of these faiths have prohibitions against the aspects of my holistic view of magic such as no singing, no dancing, rules on dress, restrictions on religious artwork, etc. I am the full belief that their &quot;God&quot; is real and well and truly hates all magic but feins tolerance in the modern era to avoid losing followers.", "time": 1669015846, "resto": 33419508}, {"no": 33419784, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)02:47:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33419508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33419508</a><br><a href=\"#p33419593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33419593</a><br><a href=\"#p33419625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33419625</a><br><a href=\"#p33419668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33419668</a><br><a href=\"#p33419739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33419739</a><br>Science is neat.

It is carnavalesque. It derives power from being feared and hated by Christians. You only fear the powerful. By not loving your fellow man, but hating him, Christians betray their own religious creeds. Becoming the focus of hatred by people who are supposed to be about love, you perform a Satanic ritual using Christians as your ritual aid. Laveyan Satanism is the ultimate troll. Feeding it with hatred is exactly making their point for you.<br><br>Satan is not your adversary. Satan is the urge in all of us to procreate (sexual energy) and to work towards material gains. So Christians who do not live celebate and have a nice car and clothes, are listening to their Satan, while trying to ignore that fact.<br><br>The adversary idea is captured in Diabolos. Christians all cobbled these currents together in a single entity, but these have subtle differences. So Loki, the trickster, Lucifer, the lightbearer, Baal, the other God, etc. these are all lumped into one. This makes Satan a monotheistic diety, while obscuring his polytheistic elements.<br><br>Diabolos is: another person who messes things up, throws your life in chaos. No sane person worships Diabolos. You acknowledge this, and ward against strife, envy, gossip. Christians who make life hard for Laveyan Satanists are taking up the role of Diabolos. By promoting union, love, and beauty, Laveyans succesfully troll Christians and siphon power and the knowledge that they are even more pious than Christians will ever be. Satan is the hearty laugh that results, and the fear and confusion of the Christians wondering why they cannot sleep soundly after attacking a fellow man with hate and naive bigotry.", "time": 1669005625, "resto": 33418742}], "last_modified": 1669005625}]}, {"page": 11, "threads": [{"no": 33418934, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)23:35:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Have you ever taken MMPI?
