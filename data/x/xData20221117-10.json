I lean towards the view prevalence of \u201cspooky spiritual stuff\u201d is linked to polar-magnetic &amp; solar-magnetic cycles. The Earth\u2019s magnetosphere = \u201cthe veil\u201d that occultists etc have alluded to forever. Weakening of the magnetosphere &amp; polar reversal coincides consistently with major climate change events, genetic bottlenecks in humans &amp; other animal &amp; mass extinction events. Solar weather for instance is being increasingly found to effect seizures, migraines &amp; neurological heart conditions, lunar cycles have been associated with behaviour &amp; similar neurological conditions forever (ie see the term \u201cLunatic\u201d or compare crime rates on full moons). Under an MRI or EEG, advanced meditative trances look almost identical to localised/frontal lobes seizures &amp; certain migraines &amp; most spiritual practitioners who keep note could tell you that astrological events, solar weather impact their practices, meditation etc. During a polar magnetic reversal earth\u2019s magnetosphere becomes extremely weak to the point Carrington type events capable of knocking out global electronics likely become a daily occurrence, earth would also be bombarded with gamma radiation &amp; other crazy shit. If the magnetosphere = the veil, this could also cause a massive increase in \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201cmagic\u201d phenomena with lowest levels of said phenols occurring end-cycle just prior to the re-weakening of the magnetosphere (which coincides roughly with the rise of enlightenment ideology, rationalism &amp; atheism in the late 18th &amp; 19th century - the carrington event likely signalled the beginning of the weakening of the magnetosphere). It\u2019s possible that roughly 12\u2019000 yrs ago we experienced a particularly rough early-cycle - if Neanderthals/Denisovans were indeed more sensitive, it\u2019s possible more dangerous stuff was drawn to them like beacons, although this is all hypothesis.", "time": 1668699836, "resto": 33390994}], "last_modified": 1668699836}, {"no": 33389012, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:47:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "/x/, what are the spiritual implications of wacky colored ketchup?", "filename": "4d4ad791cadcbb88262d0000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1668667648439554, "time": 1668667648, "md5": "z7NXOtETshqNamzsW/p0lQ==", "fsize": 52657, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "x-what-are-the-spiritual-implications-of-wacky", "replies": 11, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 6, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 33390090, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:22:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33389019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33389019</a><br>Those aren&#039;t recent.

Then the sand is removed just enough that your arms and hands are free at last. You can now move them and that means you can remove some of the sand by yourself physically. You&#039;re still buried but you can move now. Then you can free all the rest of your body and you&#039;re not buried anymore. <br>Start slow, have patience. Don&#039;t be discouraged because you aren&#039;t healed fully magically 3 hours after doing your method. Give it time. Relax and enjoy knowing you&#039;re healing. Enjoy knowing you aren&#039;t ill anymore.<br>And start meditating. Start taming your mind and yourself.

I started creating things like a foursome with three girls, bungee jumping off a jungle cliff, etc. I got so into these scenes I forgot I made them until I decided to change them.

a replacement for techniques<br>-WBTB is mostly mandatory for most people, if you struggle with your sleep schedule then ADA is your best option<br>-if you&#039;re just starting out you should be doing WBTB in addition to either SSILD or MILD as those two are the easiest techniques<br>-while WILD and it&#039;s derivatives [FILD, DEILD and CANWILD] may sound alluring to some of you, if you
