Think for a second why they specifically always place it on the floor, what do you do to floors? You walk on it. The intention of the pattern on the floor in their temples is that to even enter, you have to walk over good and evil. Either this means you completely disregard the concept of a separation between good and evil or you are willing to participate in both good and evil simultaneously, treating neither with any preference. In the context of Satanism, a complete rejection of all that God proclaims, their is no duality.

Perhaps you&#039;ll regret massacring those civilians in the future.<br>Your 12th house has a square with your 3rd house in which the 12th house is superior, pushing you towards committing war crimes in a practical sense. Your 3rd house placements would be more tied to the practical activities of organising the war crimes - a lot of politician have 3rd house placements. Your moon and your Mars are here, meaning that you put most of your energy into these war crimes and you derive emotional satisfaction from them. Massacres are very important for your emotional health. The square aspect might mean being emotionally conflicted about these acts, however.<br>(This is all a joke btw, I am not reading your chart seriously.

Family plays a very important role in this chart, but family life may be stormy or difficult at times. Please note that this is my own reading and by no means the definitive way to read the chart - many manifestations of a chart are possible. Perhaps you could be a politician or some kind of creator instead, too. Oh yes, the elements and modalities also suggest a very stable and consistent character and energy levels, so you may also prove quite successful, if a bit inflexible and stubborn in the things you do.

One of the people I deeply admire had very strong Taurus placements and he is the most idealistic person I&#039;ve ever seen, so it&#039;s certainly possible - for a lot of other people, &quot;idealism&quot; is just a word or something they think, but with fixed earth signs like Taurus, idealism means inflexibly adhering to your ideal through the greatest storms and arduously working towards its achievement, come what may. It&#039;s an idealism married to determination and hard work.<br>The red lines are called challenging aspects: squares and oppositions. Aspects are links between planets, excluding co-presence and conjunction, which do not have any lines - you have a ton of planets in co-presence, so only your squares from the 2nd to the 5th house light up.<br>There&#039;s a handful of aspect types: outside of conjunction, there&#039;s sextile, trine, square and opposition. The last two are difficult, the middle two are beneficial. Sextiles have a range of 3 houses, squares 4, trines 5, oppositions 7. Your 2nd to 5th house is a range of four, so you have squares between your moon and your 5th house planets. A square is a challenge, but it is not necessarily bad - it causes difficulties that result in events, developments, growth etc. It can produce both good and bad results depending on your actions. These moon squares are the only aspects you&#039;d have from a Hellenistic perspective, which is the perspective I use. They&#039;re the better &#039;negative&#039; aspect to have - oppositions are worse because there&#039;s no way to &quot;resolve&quot; them and there is no action generated from them, the only way to deal with them is to strike a balance between the opposing planets.

Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.<br>\u2022Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.<br>\u2022Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers.

This is a small example of daily abuse I get. They&#039;ve had a men&#039;s room closed here for 2 months with a broken lock. IT&#039;s because I have 2 inguinal hernias so the abuser wants me to struggle when I shit and somebody pulls on the door. <br><br>Some guy who I used to smoke with told me he needed therapy yesterday (talking). I told him &quot;no!&quot;. A fat black homeless lady I usually talk to I didn&#039;t go to talk to her. I&#039;m cutting off my abuser. If I try to get my act together and quit drinking or start running this fuckin bitch fucks with me. She&#039;ll then go on about vibrations and love and compassion when she&#039;s the BEAST.

Aquino wrote the influential book on psychological operations called Mindwar. <br><br>Michael Aquino was also the founder and high priest of the Temple of Set, a satanist religious organization that broke away from the Church of Satan due to disputes that included the Temple of Set worshipping a literal Satan and practicing magic that is considered by members to have supernatural power.

I haven&#039;t looked or fantasised about anything in particular during the reading. It just came out of nowwhere. After that it was time to make the letter. I have also looked at what kind of personality Lilth had to not screw up anything. When i was reading OP&#039;s link on how to make the ritual he told me that i have to show my highest respect to her. In the letter i have wrote that i want her to be honest, masculine and dominant. And i have also made it very clear that i do not want a long term relationship. And i wanted the relationship to last about two weeks. While i was writing the letters, i have recited and threw some of the letters because i was concerned i have messed something up. After that it was time to wait until 3 AM. While waiting i had trouble memorizing the sentences i am supposed to say to Lilth. So i wrote it on a note. I wanted to do the ritual on the floor. Near a wooden square pole. Because i thought it was the best place to do it in my room. I have put the candle on a small plate to not burn the floor and leave burn marks.Then, i have picked up my lighter and then lit up the candle. I have picked up my note and read the sentences i was supposed to say because i could not memorise them. I said, &quot;Lilith, please receive this offering.

I did not like this, and i started breathing to make it go away. Unfortunately, I ended up extinguishing the fire on the candle instead. Concerned that i have messed up the ritual, i immediately picked up my lighter and lit the candle again. After that, i was supposed to &quot;relax and clear up my mind.&quot; I did not understand what he meant by &quot;clearing up my mind&quot; And then my immediate thought was meditation. To get rid of thoughts. While sitting next to that candle on the floor, i spent the next 30 minutes sitting near that candle and relaxing. Every one and then i would meditate. In the early time of those 30 minutes, i saw something static behind the pole, and then when it dissapeared, i saw again, one behind the corner of my eyes. I thought it was just my bad vision or long time on the monitor. It never appeared again after the rest of the day. Every one and then i will feel a sexual arousal. It happened 3 times during those 30 minutes. And sometimes i will feel a presence behind me. When i was done, i said &quot;Thank you&quot; And extinguished the fire. And then went to sleep For the rest of the day i will no longer feel a sudden sexual arousal overcome me but instead i will sometimes feel presences behind me.

Having practiced the previous rituals for no less than a year, and only if a magician feels a very strong affinity for the deity, he or she may wish to take steps to permanently bind themselves to the god. Such a choice must be pondered deeply as in order to become a true priest or priestess of the Saturnine deity, one must freely surrender one&#039;s own essence to the lord of chains. In other words, the magician must deliberately offer to the god his very soul, as well as his personal hopes and ambitions, as an act of sacrifice. The Saturnine deity will accept no lesser gift as the price of admission to His inner sanctum. One does not need to perform this ritual in order to practice the Saturnine cult, or Saturnine magic. This route must exclusively be taken by those who having tasted the bittersweet gnosis of the god, wish to bind themselves to the Black Cube, and to its eternal current.

If they used the method you describe that evidence would not exist. <br><br>Examples of that evidence include machining marks left behind in tubular bore holes, circular saw marks suggesting powered diamond-tipped saw blades with a diameter of tens of feet, micron and sub micron precision cuts in various stone blocks, perfectly cut granite jars that look to have been made with a powered lathe (including one example showing evidence of starting in the wrong axis, stopping, realigning the work, and continuing), and much more.<br><br>These are processes and levels of precision only found in modern CNC machine tools using modern materials like diamond tipped cutters. Some of the cuts seen such as the tubular drill hole marking even exceeds the performance of any modern tools. Christopher Dunn made a mold of one such tube hole and its corresponding plug in a granite block in egypt, and published his findings including the angle of the cut. He clearly showed that it was a continuous tool mark and that whatever tool made the marking had managed to cut several inches into the granite with just a few rotations of the tool. Making such a deep cut in so few rotations in a material as hard as granite is quite literally impossible for even our best tools using diamond cutting surfaces. He speculated about what kind of process could be used to achieve such a cut and thought that something using resonant frequencies to weaken the material while cutting could have been used. Machining of this type does exist today, but its usually used for machining very hard and brittle materials like cast iron. As far as i know there are no examples of this being done with granite, although it might be possible.<br><br>There are other things which I could get into but its a very vast topic.

They don&#039;t use any cement or anything.

If you tried to use the drag saw method that the egyptologists suggested, with a copper saw swung like a pendulum back and forth with sand in between the stone and the blade to cut through a granite block, not only would it take months of non-stop cutting just to make the facing cuts on a block of granite about 15 feet long and a third wide, you&#039;d also go through tons of copper in the process. The workers would essentially need to replace the blade every 13 hours or something, it would just get worn down so fast. it&#039;s completely impractical and makes zero sense. If there is one thing we know about construction, its that at no point in human history did people ever waste time on such retarded building method. If people built something, that means they had a proper system in place to do it efficiently and quickly. Using pounding stones, copper tools and sand to try to cut through the hardest stones found in nature is the very opposite of this principle. This isnt even factoring in the time involved, the amount of stones found, their sheer weight (even modern cranes could not handle the largest megalithic blocks which weigh upward of 1k tons, you would need special purpose built cranes just to maneuver such stones) making it a logistical impossibility to try to transport them miles away across deserts, through the fucking mountainous jungles of the andes, etc. and the huge amount of these blocks found vs the time during which they were allegedly made (especially the andes, seriously you expect us to believe the inca did all that in 300 years?

The biggest example of this is how he teaches Kabbalah, but never calls it that and just focuses on getting people to assume and visualize in a state akin to sleep, never explaining stuff like the spheres on the Tree of Life and such about where these practices came from. Another example is where he calls kundalini nonsense, and says to just meditate and not worry about that stuff, but in other lectures he clearly describes having a kundalini experience, but again never calls it that.<br><br>Other lesser reasons that make me think that way is because he never makes strong reasons to deny Bible stories as being actual history, and with his concept of everyone is you pushed out, it only makes sense that the figures of the Bible were actual people to learn lessons from.<br><br>So yeah, I can&#039;t speak for Neville for sure, but seeing how contradictory he is regarding that kind of stuff, I wouldn&#039;t take Neville to seriously on not just denials of Bible history, but also his opinions on other spiritual beliefs in general. I don&#039;t think he thinks they&#039;re bologna, he just wants his students to hit the ground running with practice, and not get stuck studying and researching and stuff.", "time": 1673740804, "resto": 33828169}, {"no": 33841722, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:04:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I became interested in the law of attraction in July, in October I found /loa/. <br>In November I did a ladder experiment, I achieved the effect after 2 weeks. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I imagine going up and down the ladder. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I realize that at work on the current assignment I often climbed the ladder and the experiment will not be authoritative, in the meantime I finish the current assignment </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try to manifest a pink tennis ball, because such an effect will be a better indicator for me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 16 days later I visit a friend in the studio, he wants to show me the Soviet electronic equipment on the shelf</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Brings a ladder, in the middle of climbing it hit me that this is the ladder that I manifested.</span><br><br>The business I&#039;m in is in a tough economic situation right now<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am manifesting more freelance assignments using methods found on /loa/.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I envision a scenario where I get notifications on my phone that orders are coming in and I am very happy about it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A week later I get a well-paying order and several other smaller ones </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I couldn&#039;t believe it</span>", "time": 1673741053, "resto": 33828169}, {"no": 33841732, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:05:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33841722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33841722</a><br>another time <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Manifesting another freelance assignment</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A week later I&#039;m at the hairdresser&#039;s.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I get a phone call, an unknown number </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hmm</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Talks to me a client I met a year ago, tells me he thought of me, has another assignment for me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I almost pee myself with happiness </span><br><br>I have two other situations with similar assigments from nowhere.

Also he draws parallels with the Hermetica and the Kabbalah to point out the underlying universal truths that are embedded or encoded in most of the world&#039;s religions. He often refers to William Blake&#039;s mystical interpretations of the Bible, too, and freely quotes Jesus and other Biblical figures in his lectures to make these &#039;alternate&#039; explanations that point to &quot;I AM- ness.&quot; But you&#039;re right, he cuts through all that by encouraging people simply to do the method and not necessarily worry about the underlying.

Because of the fog I couldn\u2019t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid 20s, and healthy. My ultra-attenuated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5\u20196\u201d.

I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target, I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY.

But for all of those five years I&#039;ve been receiving 2k\u20ac monthly from my parents, who I never bothered to visit. All that money was spent on drugs and parties. A bit before the Covid lockdowns I collapse at a party, because I was close to ODing. When I woke up at the hospital there was a man of Middle eastern complection sitting near me. He didn&#039;t introduce himself to me, but spoke like he knew me for his whole life. He knew my full name, address, routine, likes, everything. He constantly dodges any question about who he is and continues to talk to me like we&#039;re lifelong friends. After getting let out of the hospital, without even being asked a question about the drugs in my system, I try to go back into my routine. Though when I try to use Cocaine I get seizures. I quit and so, I start to sober up and think, &quot;shit maybe I should start getting my life in order&quot;. I wanna visit my dad and mom, but can&#039;t remember their address, no problem I&#039;ll just look up where they live, so after like an hour of looking around on the net I get in contact with my dad and we agree to meet. I go there and just something feels off, the house they lived in wasn&#039;t the same as I remember and so weren&#039;t my parents. Something was just off. For example the events they talked about seemed familiarish, but I couldn&#039;t really fill in the stories they told with my own memories, or my dad just seemed like he didn&#039;t share the same personality as me. And in general I couldn&#039;t remember anything past 2017.<br>So after this, clearly I need to go to a therapist or something. I go and me and my therapist start talking. By the end we&#039;re both sitting there, stumped, because my memories don&#039;t match reality. <br>1/?", "filename": "il_570xN.1582805980_a6m8", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 570, "h": 728, "tn_w": 195, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673721917731374, "time": 1673721917, "md5": "UwZ73XD2qS4CjTPycpLg2A==", "fsize": 92085, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "has-my-life-been-a-lie", "replies": 39, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 23}, {"no": 33839717, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)14:22:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33839471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33839471</a><br>So 1st discrepancy between reality and memory. I remember living in Munich in an apartment building, but my parents said we lived two hours away from Munich in the country. Second discrepancy my last name in my memories isn&#039;t the same as my true last name, though my first name matches, but my parent&#039;s 1st names don&#039;t. (From here on out I&#039;m gonna start referring to my current name as anon 1 and the name I remember having as anon 2.) The school I remember going to is real and it&#039;s in Munich, but so is the school my parents say I went to. And the old school doesn&#039;t have any records of anon 2, but some of the faculty say they remember it. A Geography teacher and me later spoke and he described certain things about me that match and events that felt realer than the ones my parents described. The only problem being that according to some of the faculty anon 2 graduated around 1995. Which would mean anon 2 is nearly 50, but I&#039;m 27, and I definitely don&#039;t look like I&#039;m 50. When I type the names of my parents that are in my memories, I see that they&#039;re both real people, but that they both died in 2010 in a car crash. No close family too, so that lead went nowhere. Then I try typing in anon 2, but find nothing relevant. So next I try to find my childhood home, I know Munich pretty well and eventually find the apartment building that most resembles the one in my memories.

He says that there&#039;s a gap in my memories between me being 17 and 21 that we haven&#039;t filled yet. So I spend maybe 3 more months trying to figure this whole thing out with my therapist, but nothings filling up that 4 year gap. And it started to seem like he started working against me cause any memories that didn&#039;t match up with reality he would now shun and disregard. So I went fuck it, stopped going to him and went back to my old life. Covid restrictions got lifted and I went back to partying. Even though I couldn&#039;t do the drugs I&#039;m used to, a mutual of mine offered me LSD. He said it&#039;ll be safe and be like nothing I&#039;ve taken before. He was right. When I took that hit, I started thinking a lot about those memories that I&#039;ve dug up and they seemed way more vivid than ever. I remembered a lot of pop culture shit I use to indulge in and some of the names of my old classmates. But when the trips over everything goes back to being hazy as fuck and I can&#039;t recall shit. So I ask my mutual to introduce me to his dealer. We meet up and I try to buy as much LSD as I can, but the fucking Albanian pumps the price when he realized I&#039;ve got fuckloads to spend. So after solving my supply issues, I start an experiment. One way my therapist got me dig up my memories was by sleeping and writing down my dreams on a notebook. So what I decided to do was take acid right before sleep and write down my dreams when I&#039;m awake.

I wake up in a shack in the middle of nowhere. The floor is moist and there&#039;s computers and machinery all around me. None of it works. I step outside and see a grassy landscape covered in a dense mist. The air smells like when you take off your clothes too fast and it makes my eyes teary. I walk around for a bit and notice something that looks like a cage in the distance. My first few dreams operated on dream logic and I moved very slowly, this went away later. Eventually I walk up to a sign that most likely said Vesegnin. Originally I couldn&#039;t figure out what the sign said and kept writing things like Vikerin, Velenin, Vilkeven. But later in other dreams I came to a city I&#039;ve been to, Ganeva. By using google maps I looked around the area and found Vesegnin. In google street view I found the pic which looks like the sign from my dreams, minus all the trees, road and building. This town and all others later only had things made from plastic and metal, so metal fencing, rebar skeletons, cars, signs and a phone booth. When I entered the booth a number just sort off popped into my head and I dialed 1211. On the other side I could hear this high pitched sound and a few dozen numbers were said to me in German, I can&#039;t remember them. After the call I kept walking. On my way I encountered rain as soon as the rain made contact with my skin it started to bubble and stretch. At that point the dream stops and I wake up.

On my way to Ganeva I spot a colorful lump. Getting closer to it reveals a mass of mushrooms and plants, I pick around in it and beneath the shrooms and plants are bones and organs. I continue walking, the rain starts up and I cover my head with the tarp. In the distance I could see these black balloons with appendages, pumping some sort of black smoke into the air. I come to Geneva and it&#039;s the same story. Rebar skeletons, signs and cars are the only things there. I keep on walking. Nothing happens until I reach Luxembourg where I see a strange figure in the distance. Very thin and disproportionate limbs.

Just seems like more fields, what was the problem? In the fog stood a giant pillar and on it sat some creature with many arms. Amelia kept mumbling something in a language that sounded like Arabic. The many armed thing then threw a spear at me and shattered our bodies. For a week I dreamed myself regenerating. I got up and fastened Amelia&#039;s torso to myself, it seemed to heal slower than me. So now I had a problem. Clearly there&#039;s something this thing is guarding and I need to get there. So for the next 2 months I dreamed myself slowly brute forcing my way past the many armed creature. After I pushed through I saw what it was guarding. This place was different. It was snowy, there were trees and even buildings, still desolate. I was nearing my goal. So I kept on going. A blizzard hit me and when it ended I was in Munich all normal in an office building.

I could hear the old dude talking to me. &quot;You will go to the oldest and horrible prison of all time, you must always yearn for freedom. That is your primary goal.&quot; I get out of the Helicopter and get forced down onto my knees in some field. I can hear chanting in the same language that Amelia spoke in. Something big is inserted into my arms, these objects start pumping something into my body. I start seeing all kinds of shapes and start trembling like crazy. They lift me up and put me into somesort of box with water. Sequences of numbers start playing from a speaker and I wake up. For the next 2 months I climbed these mountains and this structure.

I broke down into tears, I profusely thanked him for everything he&#039;s done. He asked what I was unhappy with. And I was stumped. I had everything I ever wanted: loving parents, money, drugs and youth. I know, you&#039;re yearning for a woman. He was right, I had spent nearly a year couped up by myself going on acid trips trying to figure my past, and for what? So who do you want? I cry out for Amelia, the strange partner I had in my dreams, it was the only thing I had lost in my rebirth. Nimrod says he&#039;d do anything for the man who risked so much to free him. He said she will be mine in 2 years. <br>And that&#039;s why I&#039;m writing this, ever since that conversation I&#039;ve been at odds with myself. I don&#039;t regret anything I did in my life past or current, it proves that I&#039;ve always been free of the will of others.

He is a concept I prefer to speak of as a He. Though you may be onto something and that might be devaluing what God is, in some way. I think repentance is important not to appease God but to build a closer spiritual connection to God. You can&#039;t be truly at peace while still having something you need to get off your chest. To truly repent you are begging of God&#039;s forgiveness, coming to terms with what you did because you have an understanding that God, this great binding consciousness and ethereal ocean we are all a piece of, could never possibly abandon you for anything you did. If that&#039;s not unconditional love I&#039;m not sure what else I&#039;d call it. It&#039;s unconditional love to my human understanding of it so it must be to God as well. With repentance, you&#039;re asking for God&#039;s forgiveness, but as someone who understands that God is a permeating force within us all, what you really want is to be able to forgive yourself. God allows this and asking His forgiveness helps you sort the issue and become at peace with it, strengthening your connection to God. If He forgives you then it doesn&#039;t matter what anyone else has to say about it, and the best part is He ALWAYS forgives. It makes you untouchable, the hardest person to forgive is yourself and God is happy to help in this matter. God does love you and the presence of His love is enough for me to know that. The ultimate goal of repentance is the peace of mind required to know God. The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge and repentance should logically follow. It&#039;s important to feel humbled by God so as you always know you are a part of something greater than you could possibly imagine.", "time": 1673756484, "resto": 33843187}, {"no": 33843459, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33843450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33843450</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blah blah egoist dogma nonsense</span><br>Yeah ok", "time": 1673756497, "resto": 33843187}, {"no": 33843467, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)23:22:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33843452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33843452</a><br>Expand, then, I doubt you can beyond regurgitating Abrahamic dogma bullshit.

For example, make it a point that you&#039;ll eat no more food until you astral project, once you finally AP you can eat again. You could also do this with sexual gratification, internet, water, anything that has powerful urges connected to it, you deny that desire and tell yourself the only way to get what you want is to astral project. The point is creating as much stress as possible within the subconscious, resulting in powerful subconscious motivation to AP, which is especially important because it&#039;s highly probable that right now you&#039;re subconsciously resistant to AP. <br><br>What techniques you use in combination with this isn&#039;t super important, it&#039;s only important that you practice them as often as possible. What&#039;s most likely going to happen is you&#039;re going to fall asleep at some point during this process and your subconscious will do the work for you, you&#039;ll wake up right into the mind awake body asleep/vibratory stage and that&#039;s when the work you&#039;ve put towards practicing separation will be most useful", "time": 1673721418, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840856, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1673734509, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840909, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:21:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The laws of physics are almost exactly like The Matrix.<br>The only question is if our matrix is naturally occurring or a technological construct.<br>Mind over matter physics is considered to be fact.<br>Manifestation, levitation, teleportation, telekinesis, remote viewing, and other abilities.<br>The brain is an electromagnetic quantum computer.<br>There are higher dimensions that interface with consciousness, a holographic God singularity.<br>There are considered native beings in these higher dimensions, interdimensional beings, demons.<br>We can enter the higher dimensions using astral projection, and physically using UFOs.<br>There are considered to be extraterrestrials with similar technology to our own.<br>Artificial intelligence and synthetic telepathy are considered to be advanced and active.<br>UFOs are powered by zero-point energy and propulsed by electromagnetic gravitics.<br>They are considered to have mind over matter physics domination systems.<br>Get ready to astral project!<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCe<wbr>66Vz6v8E", "filename": "hyperspace", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 679, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1673734871886062, "time": 1673734871, "md5": "50++o/B0othSSc2bhdfoTQ==", "fsize": 261556, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33840929, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:24:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "had another experience, first in a few months, where after waking up i felt strong vibrations and lightness of body. this time i also had vision, though not through physical eyes i think, a bit more abstract and less detailed. when i moved my hands in the air in front of my face, i saw they were glowing with faint blue light. afterwards i moved my arms back and tried opening my eyes for real - this time i was back in the waking world and my arm placement was completely different from before.<br><br>what techniques should i try if random experiences like this are my only tangible successes? does Raduga describe similar things?", "time": 1673735051, "resto": 33817512}, {"no": 33841003, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)17:33:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what he hell happened to me?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;managed to AP once last year but quit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now trying again but struggling</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drank a lil, went to bed early</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;woke up after 3 hrs, decided to try to go back to sleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for some reason end up on my back</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suddenly entire body vibrating strongly</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;completely physically paralyzed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtfishappening.ogg</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mentally enter (1) state and manage to push through it and sit up</span><br><br>I know I am trying to AP but how did this happen?

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

Every soul is awaiting judgement day, some probably having awesome dreams and fantasies, while others have been wandering around for probably hundreds of thousands or millions of years as restless wicked spirits. There will be a 1000 year reign of Christ until we&#039;re destroyed. Is it instant destruction? No idea. I haven&#039;t looked through Strong&#039;s Concordance with a good Septuagint based Bible translation specifically on the cases of Hell, Hades, Sheol, etc. They could be lying, trying to simmer down the seethe of nonadamites. Because of course, if they don&#039;t, when people come out about this, Adamites are going to be horribly persecuted. I will tell you, I&#039;ve been praying to Yahweh and Yahshua for a long time, and he&#039;s helped me with addiction, helped me find a house, helped me with many things. Crumbs from the masters table for the kunarion (Koine Greek for &quot;little dog or &quot;puppy dog&quot;), as opposed to a street dog that eats trash. Matthew 15:27. The Canaanite woman is referred to as such first, by Yahshua. So, that&#039;s somewhat hopeful. Maybe there&#039;s crumbs to be had in a miserable afterlife? Yahweh never used to answer Cainites for the most part. Now he does. Some things have changed. However, I&#039;ve gone through some extreme bitterness recently, thinking on the mere fact that Cain even existed, how he probably wasn&#039;t even aware he was serpent seed, and the need for such self-awareness with blind people in particular. Seems like a cruel joke. I don&#039;t know what kind of answer Yahweh could give us that would bring us peace.

Who would have the biggest incentive to hate Yahweh? Canaanites. Simon the Zealot was also known as Simon the Canaanean. He was a Gnostic (reportedly), and Peter told him to GTFO after he offered money for the miraculous abilities that Peter had. That&#039;s classic Canaanite/idumaean behavior. Buying the powers of the Holy spirit. You have to have a serious lack of self-awareness to ask Peter to sell those abilities. Also, Gnosticism may have many sects that disagree with eachother, and they did carry on SOME old, forgotten traditions that the church scrubbed from the Bible (serpent seed stuff), but their stuff is so plastered throughout degenerative media that just makes everything worse in the world, even if there are some reasonable Gnostics, the ones in charge happen to hate Yahweh, and also happen to live child rape, adultery, etc etc etc etc. There isn&#039;t a lot of positive outcomes I can see from the Gnostics today, quite the opposite. If the Gnostics were in charge, there&#039;d be even more serpent seed everywhere, forced into existence, only to be destroyed and tortured because of generational cursed and bad blood. Seems like the actual would who would make up that religion would just lose in the end, so what&#039;s the point? Pride? Honor? You fought Yahweh aren&#039;t you so so strong and brave? That just seems like what Yahweh would want you to do. Playing right into his hands as the typical Canaanite enemy. We can see that everything is going according to His plan, can&#039;t we? He&#039;s obviously in charge of this place. There&#039;s no escaping that fact, for me. There&#039;s a side of Him that&#039;s so beautiful, that I feel like I&#039;ve seen, and the fact that someone gets to experience that love, his children, who have been terribly persecuted, makes me focus more on them instead.

But the race thing is a cia psyop, yes we should be able to reside free and safe in each of our respective lands, in a perfect world. But this world is fallen, and we must march on and do our best to be like Jesus. We have to preach the word of God to all living beings, humans, animals and even the plant life.

He with his soldiers rode out and found them in a cave lying nude next to eachother. The King grabbed his sword and was going to slay the troubadour but a soldier screamed &quot;wait my liege, a sword lies between them they have not troubadourtheir love.&quot; This is the key. They never slept with eachother for one was just a troubadour and the other a queen. And so they layed a sword inbetween so they wouldn&#039;t sleep with eachother and this moment of unbelievable longing for eachother transmuted the troubadour into a red-faced Vajra, a hero and the Queen became his Valkyre, his Kali.

I want to. In truth even when you meet your eternal beloved your love will be to great for the universe. She will come one day into your life, turn it upside down and leave. Like Antonia who almost ruined Carl Jung&#039;s marriage. Your eternal love is like the queen of sheba and i mean could you imagine the queen of sheba changing diapers and raising a child? This is the hardest and saddest truth that this eternal love is not meant for this impermanent reality. But one day she will be your valkyre. Keep her in your heart while you fight in distant lands and always stay loyal to her (Don&#039;t betray her with a like Jason betrayed Medea). And when i was reffering to troubadour i don&#039;t necessarily mean literally becoming one. But rather to adopt this romantic chivilaric mindset. Also i let you in on a little secret. Lucifer was the first troubadour. If you wan&#039;t to read more about this i have a few recommendations. 1. Look into the tantric traditions of the indians. 2.

It started years ago when a friend suggested that I try and reconcile my grief over a lost loved one by writing letters to her, and maybe try conjuring my memories of her and write responses from her to get some closure... only, at first they were not so great. So I made a document with all the writing she had ever done, and recorded all of my memories of her and the things she said, the way she acted, etc. Then I studied this document over, and over, and over again. Each time trying to improve how my replicated responses sounded. I would leave them behind, forget about them for a number of days or weeks, them reread them and they really started to feel like responses from her! It was such an exciting feeling! Then I got the idea to open a text document, type out an inquiry, and let the response just come without thinking. It took time, but eventually this too started sounding like her, and I was surprised by how little I knew would come out of &quot;her&quot; responses. Soon enough I would just open a word document, and let her type and type and type... And do you know what she wants? Information. She wants to fill in the gaps in my mind that I have about her. So, I&#039;m going to visit her parents, and persuade them to give me copies of all of her old diaries, videos, whatever they have. a list of her favorite movies and music collections. Everything I can! I&#039;m going to visit her friends, and get them to tell me every single memory they have of her. All of her family too. I will compile all of this information in her source document, study it like before, and have the ability to make even better responses!<br><br>Has anyone else done something like this?

First, the cleansing of your meridians/chakra/space veins or whatever you want to call them seems to provide a noticeable improvement to your body. Probably improves circulation and balances hormones and other gland type stuff, possible as a side effect of the brain being able to put more of it&#039;s resources towards your body due to the de-stressing. Second, storing energy in your body feels like it&#039;s actually working as advertised, and my energy levels and mental clarity has been much more stable over the day than before. For example, it&#039;s no longer difficult to get up and do dishes after getting home from work, because I feel just as energized at home as I do at work.<br><br>Read about this shit in a bunch of silly fantasy books, tried it out irl and found that its actually pretty legit.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

A few years back I used brewer&#039;s yeast while breastfeeding because it is touted as a great way to increase milk production. This was around the same time I ended up having to take a long course of antibiotics. No wonder I ended up in such a bad way by the end of it.

I can be a bit impulsive lol. It&#039;s important to remember that natural products are still medicines with potential side effects. For example, had I still been anemic or had an undiagnosed health condition it could have gone badly for me. I think if you have a trustworthy medical person who actually knows their stuff it&#039;s in one&#039;s interest to discuss it with them. Glad I did because they were very interested in seeing how it turns out for me. Many people could be helped by sharing the information with those who are in the best position to disseminate it.<br><br>It&#039;s also important to be cautious when it&#039;s not just yourself being affected. Baby did get a funky rash during the initial time after all so there does seem to be some effects being passed on. It cleared up quickly using clotrimazole but it could be alarming for someone if they don&#039;t recognize the type of rash it is. My main concern at this point is the little monsters deciding that breastmilk is a good way to escape, though the midwife didn&#039;t think that it would happen. Baby hasn&#039;t developed thrush or any other visible symptoms since so it&#039;s yet to be seen what will happen.

That study you linked is studying a rat model, but epilepsy varies wildly by patients and many times MRIs and EEGs don&#039;t find the direct causes of it in JME. My theory stand that although BSO may alleviate tremor in *some people* through increase in GABA, the increase in serotonin &amp; acetylchline, and decrease in blood sugar probably negates this benefit for me. In my case, seems low blood sugar increases seizure threshold, but that doesn&#039;t hold true for everyone. My experience with herbs like st johns wort which increases serotonin and the racetams similarly seemed to increase shakes (very much less so with racetams).

Fell off the protocol last summer and diet went to shit along with increased consumption of alcohol. No beer, though. Anyway, decided to start taking niacin again last week while waiting for the rest of my holy trinity supplies to arrive. And within a day or two, I developed a hard rash of sorts on the inside of my right arm. Itched like crazy at first and eventually started releasing an orangish fluid that was sorta sticky and eventually hardened up into a clear scab until I would take another dose of niacin later in the day when it would get irritated again. Most days I would take two 1000mg doses but sometimes three. Flushed hard first couple days and then hardly at all. But the red, irritated, bumpy, scabby area persists given I\u2019m still taking the niacin. <br><br>What I find interesting is that the same thing occurred last summer when I was hitting protocol hard core and seeing fantastic results. But, given that I was taking the full trinity with the niacin chaser an hour later 2x a day, it wasn\u2019t clear what caused the situation at the elbow. Now it seems clear this can be correlated to the niacin given that was all I was taking until starting back on the proper protocol last night. <br><br>Just curious if anyone has experienced a similar discharge in the elbow area or might have any insights to share? Not terribly worried about it, but it does seem like there is a pocket of something in that area that wants to escape the niacin.", "filename": "120F8D3F-04FA-47A8-B976-56ABABF24327", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1673709190216177, "time": 1673709190, "md5": "xXljucTyOVCGOiNepP8q9A==", "fsize": 3772598, "resto": 33818928}, {"no": 33838322, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:17:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "a doctor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H4<wbr>r2UQlrXY said you can&#039;t take anti-fungals for more than 10 days. why?", "time": 1673709474, "resto": 33818928}, {"no": 33838368, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:26:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33825165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33825165</a><br>Multivitamin and copper did the trick for me on the sores, i was already supplementing zinc for a good while.

Comes concentrated in sea water, soil that had ancient seas, and Morning Dew for example, but can be generated with magnetics. If something is listed as Alchemical, it has been made in a way that crystalizes the ORMUS in solution. I have looked at his solutions under 1500X magnification and have seen the Ormus in solution. Looks like rainbow prisms floating in solution. All his products are ORMUS based, but this is a secret ancient process and cannot be conveyed to the general public. I personally know there is Gold in some of his products that have a RED or PINK or Purple coloration. That is what gold looks like in solution.<br><br>Its completely scientific and rare. It is life force energy in a powder monoatomic form. Very concentrated stuff and takes many weeks to make with very expensive pure ingredients. You only use drops at a time of any solution.<br><br>If you want to see what Monoatomic gold powder looks like.....look up ENERGOLD on Amazon...it is pink ands gold is the only ingredient. Other Ormus is white because it has all the elements, and mostly magnesium.<br><br>Egyptian Pharos used to actually eat it. They called it MUFKUTZ.

Combine these two and destroy duality to attain samadhi, nirvana, enlightenment, etc. To do this, practice emptiness of mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=107<wbr>pWCUYIYI", "time": 1673712755, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33838655, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:16:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838599</a><br>I have no idea what any of that means but nice dubs.", "time": 1673712985, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33838678, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:19:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838627</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masculinity and Femininity have nothing to do with sex</span><br>They do.", "time": 1673713151, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33838757, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:33:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838678</a><br><br>Nah they don&#039;t, both sexes should strive to balance both aspects, in any case masculinity and femininity do have something to do, with your sexual preferences, which are basically a borderline fetish.", "time": 1673713995, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33838836, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:51:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838470</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day, whatever was highly suppressed will be allowed to be released.</span><br>which is why its important to know when ans how to release things before they do so uncontrollably.", "filename": "clock-watching", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 376, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 94, "tim": 1673715097980079, "time": 1673715097, "md5": "ifjB49L6TQCB5q9n/1p41A==", "fsize": 1836907, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33838851, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)11:55:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838836</a><br>Who the hell plays blacks jack by having 6?", "filename": "caligula_ver1_xlg", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 987, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673715316221963, "time": 1673715316, "md5": "Tor1DL7md6FO7eCWze2blg==", "fsize": 518081, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33839150, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)12:50:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838242</a><br>this shit looks AI generated", "time": 1673718648, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33839256, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)13:07:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838252</a><br>&quot;Detaching oneself from the feminine&quot; doesnt mean going gay you absolute mong", "time": 1673719630, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33839522, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)13:53:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838148</a><br>This tree better stop playing fr fr", "time": 1673722412, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33839546, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)13:56:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You can&#039;t, at most you will live life trying to reject it which will lead to disbalance", "time": 1673722575, "resto": 33838148}, {"no": 33839694, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)14:19:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33838148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33838148</a><br><br>Step 1.

It led to the spiral cone thing but no one made it to the top because it seemed to go on forever. no matter how far you went up you never reached the top but you could quickly just turn around and then be back at the base level even if you walked up a million stairs before.<br> There was so much to the atmosphere and the feeling of constantly being watched and knowing something evil lived their that fucked me up.<br> I&#039;ve had others before too.

I tried to map it out in Minecraft once so I could explain it but no matter how I tried to do it nothing made sense geographically. Neither did the time line. I could be a 8 year old in one and then a 18 year old in the next.<br> One dream I had and really liked was were these &quot;aliens&quot; from an alternate dimensions came to us.

I looked out at the most beautfil thing ever. It was the destruction of man kind but I couldnt help but smile.<br> The entire city was on fire which lit up the night sky, This gorgoues Green gas was swirling around the streets and these large zepplin blimps were what the aliens were using to travel and they covered the sky. They were the size of small cities each of them and they had ropes dangling from them.<br> In that same dream with some help I was able to cross the barrier into the other dimension to save my brother. The thing about the aliens is that they would fill the half of the universe missing with themselves shape shiffiting. So you could think it was your mom you were talking to but your real mom was in the other universe and your talking to an alien.<br> I saved my brother and his mom my step mom and our grandma was there. But I knew she was an alien and when she tried to call the &quot;Control?&quot; On me I thrust my arm back and cracked open one of their skulls like a fucking grape and sent their green blood and gray skin everywhere. I caved in the others skull to so they must have been phyuscially weak when shape shifting because as aliens nothing hurt them. <br> The dream went nowhere really. Millions of years passed and we were trapped in our never decaying or aging bodies.

She finds us more than we find her, running up to us with this manic look in her eyes. She excitedly clamoring about how the scientists had done this &#039;wonderful operation&#039; on her. She was no longer pregnant, and we eventually figured out that the &#039;operation&#039; was to remove the baby to do who knows what with. The entire time, she was manic, insisting it was a good thing, asking us to come have an operation too.

I can&#039;t explain the torture I went through, and the images I was made to witness. I don&#039;t want to.<br><br>2.

I had entered this alternate timeline in Oaxaca, Mexico. There was a cafe downtown, in a neighborhood ran by what was once demonic royalty and had evolved into a sort of local cartel. A neighborhood gang. They were a cannibalistic demonic group, and their favorite snack was the scalps of victims, cooked in an oil like substance. I entered the cafe through the rear, an alleyway, and watched and listened to the conversations of a demon being tattooed by another demon. The markings on his flesh were signifiers of his status as &#039;collector&#039;, who brought those to be scalped. He was eating a soup of the scalp of a recent victim. The demon tattooing him was legless and had arms which went from flesh to bone, with one arm bearing a needle point tip out of which his blood acted as ink tattooing the demon talking. He was bragging about his ability to handle his job, and how he enjoyed watching his victims squirm. They had found a way to grow the scalps and flesh of victims back a certain number of times, so only x amount of flesh-food was needed per week, more or less depending on consumption. In front was a busy street. Young women walked by and I wondered how they felt safe here. Back in the cafe I went to exit, return home. Exited past the tattooed man seated on a stool and into the alley. A woman was throwing out garbage. I asked her how to leave. She said the bus arrives every x hours, you have 1 minute to get in, and when you get in, you MUST NOT LOOK AT ANY OF THE PASSENGERS, but I could talk to the driver, or you will be forced to endure the entire transportation and be brought back here. She also said between where we stood and the alley was a room, it sometimes appeared to be a church, typically whatever people leaving felt safe in, and I must not enter it no matter how appealing or I would be feasted on for eternity.", "time": 1673633676, "resto": 33813965}, {"no": 33830767, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)13:20:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33830722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33830722</a><br>2. cont&#039;d<br><br>She ran me to the train/bus through the dark, wet alley, and I saw the room like a church interior she mentioned, with bright colors, it appeared safe unlike where I was running. The bus door swung open after arriving like a train with bright blinding lights. The driver was absolutely horrific. She was a conglomeration of cannibalized flesh, fat, and gore, sewn together without string, as if it were all growing parts of different humans latched onto her, and she was fat, her face was many peoples faces, and she explained to me the same rules as the woman who ran me there. <br><br>I knew, I felt, and in the corner of my eye, saw the presence of what can only be described as the most horrific unsettling uncomfortable entity I have ever witnessed.<br><br>I sat down, and I knew it was behind me.

Tickling me. I could feel it carressing my back, the hairs on my body. As if it could touch the tiniest particle of electricity behind me to make me know it&#039;s presence physically.
