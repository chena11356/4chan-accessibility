And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real. And if both orbits and time dilation are real, that pretty much guarantees that gravity is real.<br><br>No single instrument completely shatters all of flat Earth mythology quite like the GPS constellation.

The answer of course is because a rock paper scissors match or a coin flip would not appease the corrupted man\u2019s need for senseless violence to inflate their overgrown egos. and if it was a bloody battle that these brothers desired, could they not have fought it amongst themselves rather than sending thousands of men into battle to kill one another under the justification of settling the dispute for them?? absolutely ridicoulous that Evola fails to see the hypocrisy and senselessness of it all.<br><br>Although Evola does credit the terms of this specific battle as being more civil and humane than most, since they agreed to not loot and pillage, and also they agreed to care for wounded soldiers; the problem is that he begins with the faulty axiom that men must do war in the first place, so therefor it\u2019s best that they do war in the spirit of the Gods.

Your entire write-up is built on an erroneous foundation anyways: the idea of the &quot;Holy War&quot;, or that there is metaphysical meaning in martial prowess, did not originate with Evola or any of the traditionalists. First off, a warrior &quot;creed&quot; that abided by a higher law was central to the warrior caste in every traditional civilization. Samurai, Knights Templar, Teutonic Order, The Kshatriyas, I could go on and on. Secondly, this phenomenon was not the result of the ruling classes propaganda like you are claiming, as if the kings in these societies made up a bunch of wacky spiritual stuff to justify war. To these men, combat was something that resembled a spiritual experience: overcoming fear of death and all human instincts of self-preservation. Aligning oneself with an &quot;unshakable courage&quot; that is the foundation of illumination as the Buddhists said. Combat was a &quot;contest&quot; in the highest stakes game known to man.

You mean...THIS box paradox?<br><br>The Box That Killed The Dome<br><br>If you remove the lid of a pressurized box of air inside of a vacuum chamber without gravity, the air will violently rush out of the box to fill the vacuum. The air pressure will then be the same at every point in the chamber. It will be the same at the top, bottom, middle, and at all sides. Just like the air pressure in your car tires or a balloon or a SCUBA tank.<br><br>This thought experiment debunks the entire flat Earth model. If the air does not cling to the bottom of the chamber, then it certainly would not cling to the bottom of flat Earth. If the air does not leave any part of the chamber still in vacuum, then it certainly would not leave any part of flat Earth in vacuum. And if the air creates equal pressure at all points in the chamber, then certainly the air creates equal pressure at all points in the flat Earth dome.<br><br>Yet there is no denying that air thins as you climb in altitude. At 100,000 feet, somewhere near the top of the theorized dome, the air pressure is so low that it is effectively a vacuum. <br><br>This alone debunks all of flat Earth.<br><br>Note: no flerfer has ever provided a workable answer to this. They immediately sperg out if you even mention it, and rant and rave that the box thought experiment actually kills the globe. The only way they can do this, of course, is to deny gravity.

Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

Violence IS NOT prohibited by the Golden Rule. Treating others how I want to be treated completely allows for the justification of a well-deserved asswooping. If someone were to infringe on my personal boundaries or physically assault me or my loved ones, it is in their best interest that i stand up for myself and do everything in my power to take control of the situation and teach them that there are consequences to violating the Golden Rule themselves. if I were to be unjustly transgressing on someone else&#039;s wellbeing, it is in MY best interest that i be taught a lesson, be that thru physical or social consequences for my shitty behavior. <br><br>When you choose the golden rule as your highest virtue, you intrinsically develop a sense of right/wrong that is not able to be manipulated by the trends of the times. what is best for your wellbeing is to respect others in the same way you expect to be respected. if you dont want another person to force their worldview upon you by means of manipulation and/or physical force, youre not going force your worldview on them by means of manipulation and/or physical force. As soon as the Golden Rule is violated by either party, the transgressor has immediately opened themselves up to whatever consequences are necessary to correct that specific behavior, and as long as those consequences themselves do not violate the Golden Rule, they are justified.<br><br>obviously there are subtle nuances to the Golden Rule, and its not always quite as black and white as the examples i provided above, but the paradigm IS robust enough as a guiding principle of one&#039;s life to act as compass pointing them towards the kingdom of heaven.", "filename": "the golden rule", "ext": ".gif", "w": 780, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 97, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675205268706338, "time": 1675205268, "md5": "wLWrl/qL403PHBgBzUi9lQ==", "fsize": 121461, "resto": 33961266}, {"no": 33976826, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:52:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33975973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33975973</a><br>Look dude, I don&#039;t have the time or patience to respond in several successive posts to everything you said.

You seem to focus a lot on hypothetical circumstances where the ruling class is corrupted and feeding out lies to its military for its own purposes. While I would never claim that this has never happened, such an attitude of the royalty represents a deviation from the primordial &quot;soul&quot; that animates a civilization during its apex, its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, or when it can be truly considered &quot;traditional&quot; from the point of view of the perennialists. When this happens, it represents a decline in the quality of that civilization. In a type of civilization that is more aligned to this primordial purity (which is absolutely a real thing, the only thing might I add that can be said to bestow legitimate power onto a being or entity, being itself ultimately synonymous with God), war has an entirely different character than what you&#039;re describing, and is not embarked on recklessly in pursuit of material gain, for desire of material wealth already represents the decline of royalty.<br><br>There are certain peoples that are by their inherent nature more prone to violence and martial action.

The answer revolves around the concept of &#039;precision vs accuracy&#039;. Look at a few birth certs and you may notice that almost all of them are either on the ten or five minute mark, i.e. 11:15, or 02:20, or something like that. You will rarely if ever see one like 13:42 or other odd minute. There are several reasons for this. When I started learning astrology I went around my local hospital and looked at the clocks, most of them had a different minute. Some were even close to fifteen minutes difference. You can do the same now and I would bet you will see the same variations in clock times. Secondly when a record of birth is recorded it is done sometimes hours later after birth and hospital staff largely could not give the smallest rats ass about accurate birth time, so they estimate and round off. This is usually good enough for our work. And let us be realistic here, no one except maybe a dedicated astrologer is going to be right there listening to the navy&#039;s atomic clock on shortwave to time a birth.<br>Another thing to consider is that the location, latitude and longitude is generally not at the hospital or w/e the birth occurs. It is usually centered on the town or the capital building or courthouse or w/e. Depending upon the size of the town/city this can amount to a fair distance. And that effects the time adjustment needed from ephemeral time.<br>For all the talk of &#039;scientific method&#039; thrown around in astrology, precision simply does not exist.

How the ancient astronomers did rectification is somewhat different than how it is mostly done now. Valens explains in several places how he determined the ascendent, see book 6 section 9, book 8 sect.3-4, book 9 etc. <br>My advice is to not stress over precise timings too much, especially when doing a natal chart, getting the ascendant and the places of the Sun and Moon is really all you need for that. The only time to get anal about it is if it is setting really close to a house cusp, and then you have to do progressions and know dates of significant events to do a proper rectification. If you are doing a horary then you have exact time right at hand WWV is your friend here. Similar remarks also apply to doing an election.

Shortly after I introduced my best friend to it. There have been a few times when we have recognized each other anonymously over the years. We browse similar boards and have similar interests. When this happens one of us will usually reply to the other one inside the thread and then send a text and say &quot;this was you wasn&#039;t it?&quot;. The 10~ or so times this has happened 8/10~ times we&#039;ve guessed correctly. We&#039;ve each done this to each other 5~ times each. However there has been a couple of times where we&#039;ve made a guess and the other person has said &quot;nope, wasn&#039;t me but that post is based / funny&quot;.<br><br>Now of course over the years I have seen other people across 4chan do the exact same thing. Someone will reply to a post and say something like &quot;[Name], go to bed&quot;. So there&#039;s nothing paranormal here. Other people do this as well not just my friend and I. <br><br>However, one time I witnessed two anons on /x/ have this exact type of playful interaction with each other but each of them had the exact same posting style and mannerisms as my friend and myself. I immediately texted him the thread and he had the same exact reaction as me. &quot;What the fuck that seems like us&quot;. We tried replying to the posts and neither of the other two anons would respond.<br><br>I honestly and genuinely believe that we witnessed some type of paranormal event. Like phantom or alternate dimension versions of ourselves interacting with each other.

The neanderthal (esau) was created by God. The melonhead is an elder race that was also created by God millennia ago but is now distant. The melonheads, by virtue of being &quot;old&quot;, have more abilities than the Neanderthals, foremost being their large cranial capacity and their ability to control hominids (via expression / speech / word / deed). The neanderthals were made out of the earth itself by God. The Neanderthals were secluded, private, and in time came to bother the melonheads a little too much. Note that there were other &quot;lesser&quot; races around but they would perish regularly, as the Earth has extinction events. The melonheads hence made a robotic / barely-sentient hominid to counter the neanderthals and released them on the southern tip of Africa. The Neanderthals, you must understand, were also very gifted. They were master craftsmen and had very, very good intuition and were very smart. To this extent, they thought they were the rulers of their domain, but did not express any sentiment towards other hominid species unless they were of a similar affect. They could hold back the diminuitive sapiens for a while, but slowly Neanderthal settlements started getting pillaged and burnt. These Sapiens would rape the females and eat the men. The offspring would kill the mother during childbirth. Turns out that this offspring, half neanderthal and half sapien, was a real danger to the melonheads, because he was powerful (not as powerful as a neanderthal) and could not be controlled as effectively as a sapien.", "filename": "LambandLion_T", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 700, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675500053575380, "time": 1675500053, "md5": "iUNVsxQwBKVuLMsJBBs4NQ==", "fsize": 114946, "resto": 34000740}, {"no": 34003167, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)03:41:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34003163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34003163</a><br> Hence in time the melonheads suffered the same fate as the neanderthals, and to this day the mixed lineages of the three groups continue to tussle in war, interspersed by peace.

Disney\u2019s favorite film was Fantasia, in which he took classical music that was used to program young children with, and developed highly occultic themes in the cartoons that accompany it. To the untrained eye, Fantasia seems a bit odd; but the individual in the occult understands that the themes of a mage in training (&#039;the sorceror\u2019s assistant&#039;) who must turn to his more powerful mentor for help, and the Greek pantheon (in the famous rain sequence), mythology and even the depiction of an occultic ritual and then the famous strains of ave maria (a Jesuit programming tune) end the film. Fantasia is blatant occultic imagery throughout, and was used extensively in the 1950s through 1970s to program individuals with. It was superseded in recent years by movies such as the Matrix, which depicts high-level programming, Labyrinth, and others.&quot; - Svali<br>https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.<wbr>com/2022/06/11/vatican-book-part-10<wbr>/<br><br>A very in-depth article:<br>http://pseudoccultmedia.blogspot.co<wbr>m/2009/06/disneys-programmed-prince<wbr>sses-selena.html", "time": 1675457996, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 33999029, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:06:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33998993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33998993</a><br>you do realize that the whole story of &quot;the apprentice&quot; was already made to a poem by a known illuminati-member: goethe.<br>the original story itself apparently comes from old greek myths - \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd<br>his name is lukiavos, or in english lucian.", "time": 1675458364, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 34000916, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "snow_white_and_the_seven_dwarfs_portrait", "ext": ".png", "w": 1296, "h": 730, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675473736245985, "time": 1675473736, "md5": "VkYTB8UPEpHWSVVKWhkNgA==", "fsize": 1035391, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 34000969, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:29:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33998993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33998993</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesuit programming tune</span><br><br>You can&#039;t be in good standing with Freemasonry and the Jesuits (the Catholic church) at the same time, Catholics forbid all church members from becoming Masons and claim that if you are one you&#039;re in a state of grave sin", "filename": "Brother Walt Disney", "ext": ".png", "w": 321, "h": 388, "tn_w": 103, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675474163415112, "time": 1675474163, "md5": "bT6gPzno77/DbBJm7GuudQ==", "fsize": 225848, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 34001143, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33998826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33998826</a><br>who is Christ then?", "time": 1675475488, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 34001237, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:04:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Google alleges there are 169,000 results for the search query &quot;Walt Disney Rosicrucian&quot;, yet it only returns a couple hundred of them before not loading any more. </span><br>Google is a Potemkin village, search any obscure topic and it only returns like 50 pages while claiming a few billion results.", "time": 1675476275, "resto": 33996409}, {"no": 34001332, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:24:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Dis means demon god of trickery<br>Ney is a flute in Arabic.

There is also Magic Mountain programming, and programming using the Around the World Dolls, and its theme song. Some of Wizard of Oz and the Cinderella programming was also done at Disneyland using costumes. Preverbal children are taken to Disneyland to get them ready for the scripts.

I do have to elaborate on that though.<br><br>tl;dr, regardless of past tense or present tense, you have to consider whatever your manifestation as being in your possession &quot;now&quot;.<br><br>So one technique the Bible uses, is to declare things in the past tense, even when they haven&#039;t happened yet. This reinforces certainty in your mind, where you&#039;re not &quot;waiting&quot; for anything, or unsure of what will happen in the future, you just declare it in the past tense because when God&#039;s working with you, there&#039;s no doubt. It&#039;s done not when you see it, it&#039;s done the moment you even say it. This is used a lot in the Psalms, and Matthew 8:5-13 is another example of this with Jesus.<br><br>However, you can still do it in present tense. It&#039;s the same principle, and if I had to give an example of when you would use present tense over past tense, it&#039;d be when you don&#039;t really have an end goal. For example, if you just want constant improvement, like you just want an endless stream of money, you would affirm something like &quot;money flows to me&quot; in the present tense.<br><br>The important thing to know is that there is no &quot;future&quot; when working with God and receiving things, you have to take it &quot;now&quot;. Read the story of Moses, and pay attention to how God says that His name is &quot;I AM&quot;. When you look up the Hebrew, it&#039;s not just &quot;I AM&quot;, some people might translate it as &quot;I am that I am&quot;, this is because it uses a present tense and future tense, but when it&#039;s future tense it doesn&#039;t mean &quot;will be&quot;. When it has the future tense, it means &quot;I am, now and forever&quot;. So that&#039;s what you have to understand about God. There&#039;s no waiting, there&#039;s no future, you have it now, and God is eternal. So regardless of using past or present tense, you just have to remember to not think in terms of future tense.", "time": 1675452027, "resto": 33996453}, {"no": 33998297, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)14:25:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33997529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33997529</a><br>huh, someone already posted it. see pic in <a href=\"#p33997371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33997371</a>", "time": 1675452352, "resto": 33996453}, {"no": 33998318, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)14:30:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33996829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33996829</a><br>same boat. decisions are hard to make, but they are a requirement. we both just need to persist.", "time": 1675452616, "resto": 33996453}, {"no": 33998320, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)14:30:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33997123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33997123</a><br>Live in the feeling of what you would feel when you guys reached the summit of a mountain together.

If you&#039;re trying to study with mainly the Bible, and just want to get practical stuff, I would say any of the Gospels and paying attention to Jesus&#039;s adventures and parables is probably the best starting point.<br><br>Matthew 14:22-33 is what I recommend reading first. Basically, Peter starts to walk on water, but then gets afraid by the wind and starts to sink. Why did he sink? Jesus says it&#039;s because he doubted. So it&#039;s not like God was like, &quot;Hm, I guess I&#039;ll let Peter sink now for fun&quot;, no, it all came down to Peter&#039;s faith.<br>(1/2)", "time": 1675470317, "resto": 33996453}, {"no": 34000536, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)19:26:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33999823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33999823</a><br><a href=\"#p34000526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34000526</a><br>If you&#039;re trying to get into the deep mechanics, then that&#039;s a life-long study with the whole Bible (which is how LoA writers got their ideas). For example, the concepts of the conscious mind and subconscious mind are hinted at in Genesis, even just the first few chapters. Note how God is referred to in plural in the first chapter (&quot;Elohim&quot;, &quot;Let us make mankind in our image&quot;), and God made humans in God&#039;s image, &quot;male and female&quot;. Male and female become one flesh to procreate, and that&#039;s basically how God and the minds work.

Just know that you are worthy of redemption and manifestation is like prayer. We are made in gods image and he wants us to be happy and create.

This game is this shitty early 2000&#039;s platformer with the most busted graphics.

The cutscenes are delivered in the most stilted ways and loading screens between the gaps always hang for a second too long. It&#039;s just built wrong!

These balloons fly very high. In the stratosphere.

And their availability on aircraft is under great question. In the USSR special planes were allocated for destroying such targets, and special planes with special armament were developed. Well, the most effective (and in fact the only) method remains an attack by infrared homing missiles in an attempt to capture the side of the balloon that is being heated by the Sun.

So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall.

Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft.

It gave me a weird feeling like it was not enough people and too many strippers but I liked one of them a lot and I was really drunk so I spent a long time in a private session like a few hours. They asked me if I wanted any drugs and I asked for some coke and some MDMA. The MDMA did absolutely nothing so I figured just a sugar pill for some free money for them. After he took me to some hotel that was almost empty and we spent a couple hours there. Ok I know all very irresponsible what can I say I was very drunk and I&#039;ve never had great impulse control. It happened.<br><br>Ever since getting back things have been weird. The first night I woke up at 2am and was thinking to myself but was like a demons voice telling me I&#039;m going to Hell and laughing at me. It told me this entire world is just a soul farming factory, they create evil temptations for people and confuse them with this material world so that most end up losing their souls and having them harvested for the elites. I prayed but found myself confused if I should be praying to Jesus or if he&#039;s just in on the game, or the old Jewish god from before Jesus came but he seems to demand sacrifice. Like is the only way to avoid Hell to step on someone else and send them there instead? I just can&#039;t believe that won&#039;t have karmic consequences.<br><br>Anyway I fell asleep eventually and had the most vivid dream of my life. I watched an entire movie, it was called Greatest Story Ever Told and it was a modern adaptation of the Bible maybe a couple years old. It was very modern and well made but like it was from an alternate universe where the Bible belt controls the USA and it&#039;s culture and Hollywood. It was a cautionary tale and mostly like an anti LGBT propaganda film. The message was basically that God DOES hate fags and you better obey him and his ways.

God&#039;s existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham&#039;s grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God&#039;s chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God&#039;s Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan&#039;s children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan.

Do I see people buying more of a good, eggs for example, when they are cheap and less when expensive? Yes and I do the same. If a good is sold cheaper in A shop than B shop people will go to A shop. Do I see from my own experience that if prices of a good are too high then more will be supplied than bought, and there will be a surplus? Yes. And that if prices are too low than more people will buy than suppliers are suppling, and there will be a shortage? Yes.

Eating sugar can feed the bacteria in your mouth that feeds on it and, along with tarter, becomes a film called plaque. The plaque will eat away at your enamel and irritate your gums, leading to oral problems down the line. While plaque may sound scary, everyone will deal with it in life. <br><br>Even healthy foods that are a part of a balanced diet, such as fruits and grains, contain sugar that affects bacteria and acid in your mouth. However, if you\u2019re following a keto diet, you cut out almost all foods that contain enough sugar to feed bacteria. Carbs are mostly responsible for all of the sugars in your bloodstream and mouth. You\u2019ll experience much less tooth erosion and decay if you aren\u2019t eating sugars. Of course, you still need to brush and floss regularly to keep your mouth healthy, but it\u2019s never wrong to reduce the factors that can harm you. <br><br>Less plaque also means fewer cavities. Sugars that stay on your teeth lead to dental decay. The bacteria that causes decay thrives in a sweet environment. Avoiding dietary sugars can reduce the likelihood of developing dental cavities.

I would recommend looking up what die off symptoms can be expected in the archives of these threads so you know what is and isn&#039;t normal. Additionally if you have any underlying medical conditions, are at risk for any, you should do your research on what effects the protocol can have on those conditions.

Witches who belong to covens are usually not the friendly ones, and have sinister motives. This is because when witches gather in covens, their powers increase exponentially to their numbers. Witches in covens become magically dependent on each other (their mentral cycles will even sync) and if one is seperated from the coven for an extended period the seperated individual will weaken and so will the overall coven due to having one less member. Most succesful covens usually adhere and support the goals of a secret witch triumvirate. This trio consist of three very old and very powerful witches who manipulate world affairs in their favor and are supported by the Illuminati. The triumvirate was popularized in horror movies because Dario Argento read a collection of esoteric essays which mentioned the contrasting element to Levana goddess of childbirth and giving life (three fates and graces) and told of the Three Sorrows instead. The ladies of sorrow each personify an element of death. Sighs, Tears, and Darkness. Together they make up the opposites of life, fate, and grace. They are very evil and very real. <br><br>The non-evil witches are usually just individuals who don&#039;t belong to coven and get into witchcraft from family culture and either spend time making herbs and collecting crystal or using their magic to make a little cash through fortune-telling, being spirit mediums, or doing cleansings. These good or neautral witches however are less magically powerful than the evil ones that belong to the covens because of their individuality and their lack of spiritual/magical proximity to the Three Sorrows.", "time": 1675487038, "resto": 34001963}, {"no": 34002200, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)00:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34002129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34002129</a><br>How do I become a witch?

Elections are means for these factions to get a fair shot at having &quot;their turn&quot; in charge of the system. We really do have a democracy of sort, but it&#039;s a democracy for the elites, not for the masses.

Because these are the untouchable policy pillars on which there is inter-elite agreement. Very rarely does the elite budge on these things.

Telepathy requires a state of complete nonattachment to the illusory world, and a solid center of Being. This instantly disqualifies you from possessing this ability in every conceivable way. What you are experiencing is a literal delusion.<br><br>Even the &quot;mechanics&quot; of this telepathy do not lend itself to be abused easily by profane and disturbed individuals like OP. It&#039;s not a Marvel superpower. Telepathy is synchronized perspective. Language and words no longer need to be spoken, for there is a union of understanding between two individuals. In normal interactions, a thought is formulated, converted into language, and then verbalized to another person. The other person, through receiving this information using language as a vessel, receives the other person&#039;s &quot;perspective&quot;, or at least a fragment. And this force is in play when a person loses their train of thought, and then regains it once you put your maximum focus on their train of thought.<br><br>I tried experimenting with this with an ex-girlfriend. When we discovered this &quot;telepathy&quot; after taking LSD, we tried &quot;empirically&quot; testing it with playing cards. Except the very act of withholding information (in the form of a card that I am supposed to guess) from the person creates a barrier that prevents the synchronization, the &quot;telepathy&quot;, from taking place. I do believe there are ways around this, but they are fairly advanced developments of this faculty, and OP sure as hell is nowhere remotely close to having developed it to the point of being able to ask someone to come over to his house.<br><br>I would tell you to seek help or treatment, but this post is so laughably absurd that not even the most qualified psychiatrist will know what to do with this level of deviancy.", "time": 1675490678, "resto": 34001815}, {"no": 34002527, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)01:06:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34002506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34002506</a><br>Okay, have fun", "time": 1675490790, "resto": 34001815}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 34001870, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:10:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the whole manifestation thing for real, or should one just pray to HaShem?", "filename": "1619487529355", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1074, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1675483823278536, "time": 1675483823, "md5": "pFIwBIxaWwY6SAwqYEwYdQ==", "fsize": 614698, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-the-whole-manifestation-thing-for-real-or", "replies": 11, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 34001896, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:15:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34001870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34001870</a><br> it&#039;s real and you can thank hashem", "time": 1675484119, "resto": 34001870}, {"no": 34001995, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve tried both and neither work", "filename": "pleeaassee", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 424, "h": 636, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675485137559543, "time": 1675485137, "md5": "tJxdJ63J0u0OmThiwk2rpA==", "fsize": 65226, "resto": 34001870}, {"no": 34002060, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p34001870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;34001870</a><br>I actually wonder about this.

The above is love in abundance, it&#039;s a place free of suffering with constant pleasure for every sense. You&#039;ll even gain new senses, you&#039;ll see new colours, you&#039;ll feel things beyond human comprehension.
