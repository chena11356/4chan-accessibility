Suppose he took of and quickly reached an altitude of 200 meters above the ground. Then he engaged autopilot and left the computer stabilize the plane at a vertical speed of exactly zero (meaning the plane should not be flying towards the ground or away from it). Then he left the autopilot on for like 10 hours and went to sleep. If the earth was a globe, when he woke up, he should see that the altitude of the plane was now orders of magnitude higher than 200 meters, even though the vertical speed had been zero all this time. (Why? Well, the plane was flying in a straight line, but since the earth is a globe the trajectory of any straight line starting at any given point on the globe, eventually has to leave the atmosphere and pierce out into space and beyond).<br><br>Obviously this does not sound like reality, intercontinental flights do not have to make constant vertical axis tilt adjusments just to keep a steady altitude.<br><br>Conclusion?

Flerfers often post it as proof the Earth is flat. Why do I want you to look at it? Because it&#039;s a lie.<br><br>&quot;The Australian Black Swan&quot; tells you that the maximum line of sight for a 5.5ft tall observer is 2.35 miles. But the cliff is 7.8 miles away. So what&#039;s wrong with this flat Earth &quot;proof&quot;? *** Line of sight depends on both observer and target height, as well as on atmospheric refraction. *** The lighthouse is at least 100ft tall which means the visible cliff is at least 400ft tall. LoS for a 5.5ft observer of a 500ft (combined height) target is 35 miles.<br><br>What about the oil platforms? Ocean oil platforms have an &quot;air gap&quot; between the ocean and the first deck of 40-60 feet. Observer height was listed as 1ft (camera on the ground?). With a 40ft first deck the line of sight is 10 miles. With a 60ft first deck it&#039;s 12 miles. With a 5ft observer and a 60ft first deck it would be 14 miles.<br><br>At 6.21 and 9.41 miles you would still see the entire structure above the first deck even if the first deck was only 40ft off the ocean and the camera really was on the ground at 1ft. For the closer platform you would see some structure below the first deck.

But it cannot.<br><br>Why? I&#039;m glad you asked.<br><br>In tracking mode GPS receivers use Doppler signal analysis to determine receiver velocity. It is impossible for a transmitter to fake Doppler signal shift across 360\u00b0. If the transmitter was lying about its speed, then the receiver would think that it was moving at high mach based on the incorrect Doppler shift in the signal. And since GPS is computed in 3D space from four satellite signals, if the satellites were lying about their positions (altitudes) the resulting location and altitude on the receiver would be off by thousands of miles.<br><br>This means that GPS satellites are provably at orbital altitudes and speeds, because GPS could not function at all if the satellites were lying. And if the satellites aren&#039;t lying, then space is real. Orbits are real. But the dome is not real. Not unless the satellites punched through it.<br><br>What about Earth&#039;s shape? GPS receivers use a spherical model of Earth. If Earth was really flat, then receivers would report altitudes literally thousands of miles off. This means Earth really is a sphere.<br><br>Furthermore, both Earth&#039;s rotation and time dilation must be accounted for in GPS. If either one was not true then, once again, receivers would give obviously false and useless results. That means Earth really is rotating. And time dilation is real.

It is also the fastest moving planet which is a major reason among many that it has traditionally been associated with emotions. When we look at a natal chart the first things we pay attention to is the Sun, Moon, and rising sign, then the conditions of the house rulers which will tell us how the planets in those houses will act. The moon is important for reading the major emotional and spiritual tendencies of the native (among other things of course). But because it ~is~ the closest planet its influence will be more, but not exclusively, on the mundane side. For spiritual and magical leanings of the native we must look at other aspects because spiritual and magical stuff is considered beyond the mundane earthly sphere, even if the aims of the magician are for sex and money or earthly power, the power for that comes from &#039;beyond&#039;. I say that the moons influence for this topic is fleeting because IMO the changeableness of the moon and its connection to the changing emotions makes for unsustainable effort that is required for serious spiritual and/or magical pursuits. It certainly has some bearing on whether one is magically inclined, but it is only one minor piece of the puzzle and other factors can greatly modify its influence or completely nullify it.

This is like being totally present, you are focused on the present, your mind isn&#039;t wandering outside of your control, thoughts may pop up but they don&#039;t take you away in daydreaming (which most people have but don&#039;t realize).

Maybe you just sit and you hope that something happens? Maybe instead of trying to focus on your breath you half-ass it and your mind takes you over all the time? You have taken notice that you are indeed mind wandering, you have taken the first step of observing this - a step which many humans never take in their whole life - so why you don&#039;t act? Why your mind keeps on being the leader?<br><br> - Maybe your thoughts seem like they are extremely important and you can&#039;t ignore them? If yes then write them down after each session and really ask yourself: Is this important now? Most of the time it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s most likely a past semi-traumatic event which keeps on repeating in your head, or a worry about the future, ignore them both, the now is the most important thing.<br><br> - Maybe you are trying to focus on your breath through your thinking mind?

Take Moses, who clashed with Pharaoh, or Daniel, who had to face a king&#039;s punishments, or David, who fought Goliath and many other battles. The point is, anyone that serves God, and thus, becomes mentally strong enough to witness miracles, must first prove themselves by overcoming great trials in their lives.

What these are telling you is that to reach God, your mind has to be lifted and raised. Then, once you train your mind to be higher, holier, then your conflicts will fall apart. It&#039;s not that you won&#039;t face conflict when you become more enlightened, but your problems will be easily dealt with.

Ionizing radiation. There&#039;s a large amount of research already done on how radiation changes genetic properties of these fungi. Look up Chernobyl and Cryptococcus. That&#039;s the same cryptococcus neoformans that is proving to be a deadly pathogen by the way.

Concurrent use is about 360K years. And the oldest genetic material in all of Africa to date comes from that exact site. And for whatever reason they decided keeping pigeons was a good idea. The caves are known for it, and pigeons are specifically known as carriers of zoonotic yeasts - candida and cryptococcus in particular. <br><br>Here&#039;s why it&#039;s so key to what I focus on. I believe that humans were actually better at immune function in the past. For some pathogens like the type of fungi we&#039;re studying, that may not have been that long ago overall. <br><br>There&#039;s are specific immune responses that get leveraged by these fungi. Primarily th-17s are the cells affected and errors there allow inflammation to go haywire. The way this plays into the dates from Taforalt is the population that resided there had high 90% rate of dental cavities. Cavities and dental issues for inflammation and decay are now being tied to candida as the catalyst (and I&#039;ll bet a couple others show up under scrutiny). Candida started the party, the rest of the germs show up to join in. <br><br>Now here&#039;s the tally. You can&#039;t have tooth decay in its accepted definition without candida present. If your immune system is functioning correctly your th-17s should be able to take care of fungal spores way before tooth decay ever sets in. However, the population at Taforalt is the earliest record of a population having a massive amount of tooth decay at around 17,500 years ago. And at a rate of 97%. There is not an earlier record of these types of cavities at this scale available, once there is I&#039;ll be revising my research appropriately.<br><br>It all boils down to firsts.

Public opinion can be manipulated, but in teaching the public how to ask for what it wants the manipulator is safeguarding the public against his own possible aggressiveness. The method of the experimental psychologist is not as effective in the study of public opinion in the broad sense as is that of introspective psychology. To create and to change public opinion it is necessary to understand human motives, to know what special interests are represented by a given population, and to realize the function and limitations of the physical organs of approach to the public, such as the radio, the platform, the movie, the letter, the newspaper, etc. If the general principles of swaying public opinion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific problem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitudes of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others. Group adherence is essential in changing the attitudes of the public. Authoritative and influential groups may become important channels of reaching the larger public. Ideas and situations must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span>", "time": 1672605878, "resto": 33734048}, {"no": 33740245, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)15:48:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33740220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33740220</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; must be made impressive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.</span><br><br>This is public:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The goal of the author in this chapter is to analyse through established psychological principles how torture-based mind control programming is installed and exerts continued control over victims.

I realized Selena was so damn horny, she threw all courtesy to the wind and had grabbed me and tried to flip me on my back. She has never done this!<br><br>So we had words and I chewed her out. She didn&#039;t like it, got in my face and tried to intimidate me again. We stared each other down for something like 5 mins. Then, I remembered that succubi mirror you. Aggression is met with aggression. So I stuffed my anger down and let go of it. She immediately softened as well. A few minutes later we were cuddling and just fine again.

My attention was particularly attracted by the enneagram. The explanation of the enneagram had clearly not been finished and I felt that there were in it hints at a possible continuation. I very soon saw that a continuation must be sought in connection with the wrong situation of the &quot;shock which came into the enneagram at the interval sol-la. Then I turned my attention to what the Moscow notes, in connection with commentaries on the enneagram, said about the influences of the three octaves on one another in the &quot;food diagram.&quot; I drew the enneagram as it had been given to us and I saw that it represented up to a certain point the &quot;food diagram.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The point 3, or the &quot;interval&quot; mi-fa, was the place where the &quot;shock&quot; came in which gave do 192 of the second octave.

Point 6 showed the entry of the &quot;shock&quot; in the second octave and the &quot;shock&quot; was the do which began the third octave. All three octaves reached Hi 2. In one it was si, in the second sol, and in the third mi. The second octave which ended at 12 in the enneagram ought to have gone on further. But si 12 and mi 12 required an &quot;additional shock.&quot; I thought a great deal about the nature of these &quot;shocks&quot; at that time but I will speak of them later.</span>", "time": 1672888117, "resto": 33744808}, {"no": 33764433, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)22:11:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33751754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33751754</a><br><br>isnt this what every thread about occultism and mysticism boils down to? its all about self knowledge, inner strength, confidence, and projecting that into the world with enough humility to continue to learn and grow?<br><br>it always seems to be where we end up. we are all gods. god is in us", "time": 1672888303, "resto": 33744808}, {"no": 33764436, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)22:12:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33758333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33758333</a><br><a href=\"#p33764416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33764416</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I felt that there was very much material in the enneagram.

According to this the direction of the inner lines 1428571, that is, the content of fraction 7, showed the direction of the flow or distribution of arterial blood in the organism and then its return in the form of venous blood. It was particularly interesting that the point of return was not the heart but the digestive system which indeed is the case since venous blood is first of all mixed with the products of digestion, it then goes to the right auricle, through the right ventricle, then to the lungs to absorb oxygen, and from there goes to the left auricle and then the left ventricle and then through the aorta into the arterial system.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Examining the enneagram further I saw that the seven points could represent the seven planets of the ancient world; in other words the enneagram could be an astronomical symbol. </span><br>Basically that is supposed to be how energy is transformed in a person with foods.

But ordinary digestion only goes so far at certain points, until greater efforts are needed, as explained above.

This difference has the tendency throughout history to form a hierarchical distinction of casts that are codependent. When I say swim I do not mean dog paddle or like Michael Phelps, but as a method that is only possible with a fully upright resting posture more like a frog.

So we can say it is a complex mixture or hybridization of types and can be reproduced as such and is. What we call Homo Erectus is therefore the event we point to in which the ape survived by standing upright and this event is still occurring. Uprightness is the most robust configuration for optimal cognitive function. He is the ape that can swim away from the lion and was often the only one to survive.

You may not be Christian, but I\u2019d definitely use the prayer of the Archangel Michael if I were you. Psalm 23 has a good track record of keeping people\u2019s minds straight, too.

Now put down the pipe, sober up and come back to my post it will make more sense. There is thing called reality (it blows) drugs do not &quot;free you mind&quot; they spiritually imprison you. Tricking you into believing what is not really there. Yes they make certain experiences more enjoyable but it is temporary; a fleeting vapor in the wind. Used for but a brief time and nothing more. So because you don&#039;t like to feel pain (because you do not know how to physically overcome it) you mask it. Once your high burns out your pain and your problems come right back (reality it blows.) So you get high again causing an endless cycle (imprisonment.) <br>Now let&#039;s talk about your imprisoned mind floating off into space. You are constantly in this altered state. Not knowing/caring that you have real problems to deal with. So you are like a three year at Christmas time wanting to play with every new toy laid before your eyes; not being the adult that you are supposed to be. Being bored becase you have forgotten about the problems in reality you start daydreaming; playing pretend; the only problem you have is being imprisoned so long that it has become the only reality you know. So the fantasy has become your and only your reality. Thinking and playing pretend are fine when you are a child. But when you pass the age of accountability (which there is a serious problem in most first world countries with this since there are no ceremonies to tell a child you are now an adult.) You have to put those things away, deal with your problems and solve them hanging them on your wall as a trophy; instead of getting high and pretending. You will never cast fireballs to level towns.

Once you get to a certain point of development you&#039;re going to be open to desperate sections of garbage species raiding your planet and that can produce the wrong message.

Since working with her recently, I&#039;ve been confronted with bisexual urges, and I&#039;m still unsure how to reconcile them. It hasn&#039;t gotten to the point of feeling attracted to women in person, but nonetheless, my spiritual experiences lately have me questioning my sexual orientation.<br><br>It&#039;s embarrassing to admit, but I used to find women somewhat repulsive. I&#039;ve always admired those who exemplify masculine virtues, and often saw women as the opposite, taking advantage of men&#039;s strength like parasites, subconsciously seducing their will just to satisfy their own needs. And I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality as I recognised that same neediness within myself.<br><br>Even so, I still had to deal with gender dysphoria somehow. I already sought help from others when I was 14, but even then I could only wait as I lost things that felt important to me. But when I was 17, perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I turned to the occult. It was just a prayer to attempt to form a pact, and not even directed towards anyone in particular. But since then, my life began to change drastically, and I found relief that I didn&#039;t even think was possible.<br><br>As the wish I&#039;d once made reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Lilith offered to guide me towards a new purpose, I thanked her and began to show my appreciation for her more. I thought I accepted myself now that I&#039;m finally at peace with my body, only to feel lost again as spiritual experiences confront me with all sorts of sides of myself that I don&#039;t know how to reconcile. I&#039;d have been content to ignore them for the rest of my life, but now I&#039;m unsure how I&#039;m supposed to proceed anymore.

Arguments would be solved by wrestling, while stating the logical errors in each other&#039;s beliefs to try to make each other falter; only those with sound reason, or great discipline and true dedication to their convictions, could maintain the will to fight, which they would back up with their physical prowess. Superstition would succumb to the muscles of the wise, and any and all endeavours of humanity would be performed with utmost efficiency. Becoming the strongest and healthiest one can be would be encouraged, but even if some men are naturally a bit weaker, they would still be taken under the wing of a stronger man and protected and guided towards developing themselves the best they can in spite of that.&quot;<br><br>To be perfectly honest, I used to be afraid of women. To an extent, I still am. I thought of the men I admire as a shield to shelter me, but there was no escape in my nightmares. But Lilith is making me face those fears, and overcome them. The irony is that I really just have to stop being afraid of myself.<br>I hope that you can overcome yourself, and your fear of men too. There is so much to gain in embracing people&#039;s unique strengths. By working together, we can create a better world; and for that, people have to be different. We have to accept who we are as individuals, and allow others to be, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no parts of men that are an improvement on the female form</span><br>What are you talking about?

About 10 months ago, I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to frot with me, as I was deeply curious what male homosexuality is like, and I worried I&#039;d regret not at least trying it once while I still could. Touching it used to trigger my trauma, and I&#039;d break down crying and be unable to continue; but as I&#039;d recently had a breakthrough in meditation and overcame much of that, I wanted to explore the new possibilities in a positive way. He asked me to be on top since he wouldn&#039;t know what to do, so I lubed us both up, got on top of him, and began to grind my body against his. Having no refractory period and not being used to physical genital stimulation, I came 9 times before I got too tired and sore to continue.<br><br>As we cuddled afterwards, he said it felt very intimate, but not very pleasurable for him, and that he much prefers to stick his dick in of me.

It&#039;s basically saying all future choices suck, and while it wants you to take the Helios choice, it in no uncertain terms tells you it sucks and they all lead to roughly the same outcome besides the Templar ending.

So start there and then do all the things you should never do on psychedelics. Spend the entire trip in a dimly lit room, staring into a mirror. Maintain eye contact. Wait until you start feeling the slightest impulses to &quot;act&quot; possessed. It&#039;s just &quot;acting&quot;, silly fun. Contort your face, make creepy smiles, twitch, contort your body and move erratically. If you start getting too scared, embrace the fear, and masterbate to comfort yourself. Put something up your ass. Focus on the feeling that something isn&#039;t quite right about all of this, that something is trying to get in, and then let it in, invite it, and embrace it. Give it your consent to inhabit your body with all of your being.

They say that someone who enters into samadhi can become &#039;possessed&#039; by their skandha. Essentially obsessed with it.

Which continue to get more and more upsetting and extreme, as well as obtuse. And the more you cannot meet the urge, the more drastic measures you must resort to in order to gratify it.

I&#039;d like to know what lies ahead in the coming months. I had gotten a rune reading from one of you guys around november and it was terrifyingly accurate, My gf of 7 years and I split up due to exactly what was predicted (infidelity, or intentions to do so was the reading, when confronted about her situation she admitted she no longer loves me and was contemplating cheating. I think she went through but she insists it never happened), regardless I am now broken in spirit and all alone. I feel terribly weak, have been consistently contemplating suicide and have broken down crying almost daily since it happened. and i attacked her with vile words and insults in a subconscious attempt to bring her pain the way she brought it to me, as she was being very cruel to me after the breakup. I haven&#039;t spoken to her since Dec 19th. Anyway, I&#039;d like to have a reading for the next bit of time. Will I find someone to help me? Should I go through with therapy? What entails at work? Should I focus on bettering myself or finding a woman? I am 29 and really have an urge to start a family. I&#039;m just lost and would love some semblance of guidance on any of those subjects. I would really appreciate it.

A woman might go for a wealthier man out of wanting to upgrade her lifestyle, but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean she&#039;s all that into him. She usually is though and I&#039;ll explain why. Women aren&#039;t sexually attracted to money, it&#039;s the way the wealthier man carries himself, the exciting experiences that he can afford which can be replicated through other risky/fun activities, having the social IQ to tap into anxieties while letting the tension sit before soothing them (this happens constantly within flirting, think of comedic relief). All of what&#039;s outlined plays in with intelligence when it comes to manipulating a the emotions of women. I was close with a guy who fully embodied the archetype of a wealthy, attractive man except he wasn&#039;t one. Not only was he poor but physically unnattractive too. He got with more females than any of the stereotypical &quot;Chads&quot;. It was very funny to witness. His only friends were females because the guys were all jealous of him. By him figuring out how to find success in this area, he short-circuited their brains when it really shouldn&#039;t be a shock at all.

Levitation is completely possible but it usually requires the energy of more than one person. This is why you don&#039;t just see people out randomly levitating. It requires more energy than one person but it is possible for one person to be able to levitate on there own. Don&#039;t get me wrong levitation doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll learn to fly across the sky like a witch, it&#039;s just levitating. Some people have had near death experiences or have been sleeping and reported waking up with their bed floating or their body floating up almost touching the ceiling. When humanity begins to understand levitation and how it works then they&#039;ll begin to understand themselves more and how the earth was created more and how powerful we really are together. Just like the saying goes &#039;&#039;two people can accomplish something quicker than one&#039;&#039;, well the more people you add, the stronger your intention becomes and the more energy you put into believing in something the more real and possible it becomes. Universes are created by spawning the energy together of multiple beings. If a group of people put their energy together they can do anything even move a mountain, levitation is just the beginning.

Hermetics is initiatory activities: the actions in the system that allocates empowerment to the other experiments that you run. The metaphysics of Kybalion is an essential part of a mystical system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete mystical system. Hermetics is normally used in combination with the Kybalion mystical system: the whole system is basically Kybalion with Initiation into Hermetics added, or Kybalion/Hermetics.
