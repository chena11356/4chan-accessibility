Meditation to still the mind can help with this. When you meditate simply attempt to maintain focus on your breath or some object. You will see firsthand how your attention switches to the thoughts you have. This is fine and normal. Observe the thoughts and let them go. Give no emotional energy to them. Look at them as just things that exist in your mind then return your attention to your breath or object.<br><br>You need to get to a point where you can look at a thought, feel it out, and let it go throughout your day. This is not easy as I\u2019m sure you are aware but it will get easier over time. You also need to get to a point where you internalize this concept: you are not your thoughts, and your thoughts are not you.

I suspect that&#039;s what wars majorly are because after it someone always gains. They learned that you don&#039;t have to directly be in front of your victim but if there is massive opposition to their acts or wishes there&#039;s a good chance they&#039;ll need a lot of killing but this is their beliefs in things. Regardless, going back to what I said about authors remaining anonymous and placing blame on the reader, it&#039;s easy for people dying to curse someone with their last breath since they&#039;d be surrounded by death energy that&#039;s active. It&#039;s why in blood ritual sacrifices they kill the person slowly until they literally don&#039;t have the mental capabilities to even think so it&#039;s not possible for them to curse their torturers. Religions like Christianity and Judaism even make up characters to protect the true authors from such things because if someone did grow up going to church but stopped later on in life and then they find them breathing their last breaths and as their life begins to pass before their consciousness and they get triggered and simply knee-jerk react to the religion it&#039;ll bounce back on top of them instead of stick to the authors. Even a mere question of, &quot;why didn&#039;t they make this religion more accessible? Damn that guy who wrote the it!&quot; could be enough to rouse anger out of a dying man and apply a seriously powerful curse against the authors.

In addition to defining a wrapping monadic type, monads define two operators: one to wrap a value in the monad type, and another to compose together functions that output values of the monad type (these are known as monadic functions). General-purpose languages use monads to reduce boilerplate code needed for common operations (such as dealing with undefined values or fallible functions, or encapsulating bookkeeping code). Functional languages use monads to turn complicated sequences of functions into succinct pipelines that abstract away control flow, and side-effects.[1][2]<br><br>I didn&#039;t read the rest as I have little interest in the subject but, you could ask /g/ and bombarded with Install gentoo threads and other worthless shit.", "time": 1674389797, "resto": 33900352}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33898363, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:08:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How many of you are sociopaths?", "filename": "1D4D9745-E105-483F-BDD2-964DEE1B9C6B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 875, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674338930994973, "time": 1674338930, "md5": "06/3bHQzfvhL/W6zqnHiKw==", "fsize": 111937, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-many-of-you-are-sociopaths", "replies": 37, "images": 10, "unique_ips": 31}, {"no": 33898401, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:15:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33898363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33898363</a><br>People say I am, but I&#039;m not.

I really wish I could tell someone about all of this but unfortunately that would land me in the looney bin so all I have is this place. I did put some thought into everything that happened since I did the letter on my way back home. The incubus hasn&#039;t done anything malicious to me or anything that would make me feel unsafe. He seems to watch me from afar most of the time unless I sit down. When I got home I sat down on my couch with a beer again and said that I would talk to him. I felt the incubus come near me this time but could feel him a little better. It&#039;s like a cloud of energy that falls on my lap. I told him no sex only talking. Most of the questions were yes and no type since he can only talk to me in single words. He gave me some insight on lots of things I was wondering about but who knows if he&#039;s being truthful. What did stand out was when I asked him what he wanted from me and I got this sudden feeling within me of love coming from him it&#039;s like he injected me with his feelings or something. I told him not to do that again because it kinda freaked me out. We talked some more and in the end I agreed that he could stay for a while but I don&#039;t know if I want this as a permanent thing and he agreed. I let him know that I&#039;m still semi terrified of the idea of him and he said he would help me figure things out with time. I watched some TV after and I will admit it was nice having him there. It felt like he was curled up under my arm while he fondled my junk. I went to bed and laid on my stomach. I felt him come over and it felt like he was trying to turn me over for a while but then stopped and laid on my back. I somehow woke up on my side with my arms around the incubus.

Sexual energy is the single closest manifestation of one&#039;s primal energy, pure from potential. This is why a healthy, as in an &quot;accepted&quot; as well as &quot;not debilitating to you&quot; sexuality is important. Darker sexual fetishes and desires have their place here, and simply reflect how one&#039;s spiritual energy works and part of how they are seen on other vibrational planes by entities there. You can literally consider your sexual proclivities as your &quot;energy signature,&quot; and yes, this is why when you go on nofap that signature signs brighter and women magically seem to notice you more.<br><br>In a kabbalastic representation, sexuality and sexual energy is often connected to Yesod, but the darker and fetishistic impulses are actually a dark, shadowy reflection closer to Daath and linked towards darker &quot;spheres,&quot; which is not bad in itself, but is seen in the signature because often such fetishes are more &quot;rooted&quot; in manifest things than higher ideals, thus linked more to lower planes than higher.

Before you ask, no, it was definitely just a dream and felt like one, i just watched and read too much ufo shit lately.

The humans helping them seemed to be there to bridge communications and calming or explaining what&#039;s going on to the abductees. There was a middle aged short man helping them to take me to their ship, at the start of this i was hiding and then rebelling to them, because who tf wants to be abducted, but i realized there was nothing i could do realistically, so i thought to just cooperate and minimize the damage. I curious about what their ships were like but at the same time i was scared and didn&#039;t want to be bombed with radiations, so i asked if they could test me at my place/house, they were understanding and with the middle aged man help i was able to stay. There were a few other people being abducted to whom i speak to every day, like relatives. They were brought into the ship instead. After the testing or whatever was done they returned the other people to the house, we were feeling weird but alive and fine.

Yes, it is feminine, yes, can&#039;t say my intentions are COMPLETELY innocent, but it sure isn&#039;t a succubus and much closer to a demon.

It is like working with an entirely different breed of animal here compared to manifesting the other types of things, which all would result in partial manifestations anyways.<br><br>Again, these things are all still honestly hard to describe succinctly and I am aware it might appear nonsensical. I won&#039;t lie that I have borrowed power and favor from it and that bringing it closer to manifest would 100% benefit me directly too, but the only thing I have found which appears to strengthen its connection to this plane is feeding it things, and I neither want to go on the extreme end for that nor wait the very long time for some &quot;manifest/big&quot; progress through the little things.<br><br>I am aware it might sound larpy at this point, but do pretend it is not.

The reader must question whether he could have been privy to the outcome of the Russian workers\u2019 movement before those workers themselves had ever heard of Marx or formed the movement to oppose their masters? And if he was, how could he have such foresight to suggest a World War could simply be brought about and that it could be controlled in such a manner to accomplish his goals? It\u2019s not only highly unlikely but there is nothing of substance to suggest it actually happened. No testimony from anybody else associated with Pike, no other correspondence or writings from Pike himself - literally nothing other than this alleged letter. It should also be noted that other than the general enlightenment movement the only &quot;Illuminati&quot; organization documented within decades of the time-frame of the letter was the Bavarian Illuminati which officially disbanded in 1785. Though conspiracy theories flourish to this day and the term is used in the abstract, serious accusations of the group\u2019s secret continuation had died out at least 50 years before the letter was allegedly written. Out of all the verified Pike literature, only Morals &amp; Dogma makes a fleeting and abstract use of the term Illuminati and this certainly ins\u2019t in he context of some all powerful secret society. So if Pike believed a war must take place for the Illuminati, who are they and what evidence is there to support that they existed and he was a member? Of course some irrational proponents of the &quot;letter&quot; will say they\u2019re a secret. But if they are such a well kept secret, how do (you) know they are/were real?

Terms like Fascism, Nazism and Zionism were never used in Pike&#039;s lifetime. Zionism as a word was coined in 1890 by Nathan Birnbaum and would not take root for several more years. There is no record of Pike knowing or meeting Birnbaum or having any connection to the Zionist movement. The ideological roots of Fascism were only in their infancy during Pike&#039;s final years, and the term was not used publicly until Mussolini took his position in the 1920s. The term Nazism did not emerge until the 1930s with the rise of Germany&#039;s National Socialist party.

As the third sign in the zodiac, Gemini also invokes the symbolism of the number three, which symbolises the emergence of self-awareness and the manipulation and control over other things. A lot of the active and masculine archetypes you find in modern fiction, like the lovable rogue, for example, can be much more closely identified with Gemini than with Sagittarius. At its best, Gemini is an insightful and strategic sign, and at its worst it is a cunning and malicious one. It seems unfair to me to reduce it only to the ideas of superficiality and unreliability - it entirely depends on the situation and the manifestation (like which house and what planets are involved). In mutable-type situations I think you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a sign that does better than Gemini.", "time": 1674253183, "resto": 33888585}, {"no": 33891390, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)17:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are Scorpios one of (if not) the most volatile signs?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

I&#039;ll look into it.<br><br>The thing regarding Pessoa is he did believe in it. Extensively. The prediction of his death was off by just a few months. He predicted the year of death of one his friends, in one of his horoscopes. A death that occurred 20 years after Pessoa&#039;s own death. This at a time where calculations where all hand made.<br>Concerning the points you brought up, regarding (1) he says this as for the intimate (i misspelled before) as in, you cannot know the inside of a specific person through astrology, that is, their feelings. Of course, that matters little when he himself says that &quot;The horoscope reveals, little more or less, what he worlds sees&quot;. So even if your intimate self sees itself in a certain way, the world will not see it like so. <br>Concerning point (2) is just a matter of logic as in you can&#039;t decerne from a birth location and time alone the material wealth of a certain person starts with or his family connections he/her was born into. You can say the person will grow to be wealthy or that he/she will fall on disgrace in the context of his/her life. A pleb at birth can become an aristocrat in his lifetime and a millionaire at birth can fall into poverty. The horoscope doesn&#039;t know your starting wealth but it knows where it is headed.<br>Astrology does spook me a bit, but that is why must look further into it.<br>Honestly think the auspicious future I can have depends entirely on me, specifically on leaving my lethargic ways behind, but I feel like I have inevitable bad omens around me, so better to foresee them and prepare than just wait for them to hit me unannounced.", "time": 1674308038, "resto": 33888585}, {"no": 33895958, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)09:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33893190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33893190</a><br>It&#039;s decent, I think.<br><a href=\"#p33893234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33893234</a><br>Bro, both your ascendant ruler and the ruler of your 10th house are in your 1st house.

Your sun in the 7th house means a central meaning of your life is relationships. You express yourself and fulfil yourself through relationships with others. Saturn is also here - this can introduce difficulties, struggles and delays, but you also have both benefic planets - Jupiter and Venus here - so you should be fine. Jupiter and Venus both bring great fortune to your relationships. All of this occurs in the sign of Venus, meaning that she governs this area of your life and guides the other planets in its sign. Your public life, practical activity, family life, creativity/children and finances will also be drawn into the field of relationships, since these are all governed by planets in the 7th house.

I have found many ways to fly or float in dreams, but the most common and easiest to work with involve motions or principles that are rooted in reality or easy to grasp in the moment - like pretending to swim in the air or flapping ones wings like a bird. <br><br>I&#039;ve also become very good at moving objects with my mind in a way that a comic-book or anime character might, specifically moving stuff towards my hands in a way one might recall a yoyo (I love yoyos) or moving it around as though my arm were some sort of wand directing it where to go. However, all feats of wonder in dreams lucid or otherwise are tricky in that they generally require absolute faith you&#039;re able to do them when you attempt them. If I am tricked even for a moment that I &quot;believe I can&#039;t&quot; or if the effect falters at all, the instant I lose motivation, it stops working. I&#039;ve trained now to keep trying; so that steels my resolve. <br><br>I think this is why many newbies and even relatively excited lucid dreamers get a power once and then let it go quickly and can&#039;t do it again - without the motivation trick and good recall, it&#039;s a bit like catching sand until you get a good foundation. Many might attribute their powers in dreams to gifts and lessons etc and I think that&#039;s a marvelous way to reframe the trick of motivation (because you will remember you were &quot;given&quot; that power and own it) but in reality, at the most basic level, any well-experienced lucid dreamer knows that literally anything can be done in a dream purely by wishing it so. I can close my eyes and start a dream over from scratch, direct it exactly as I want it, teleport, or summon anything. <br><br>It gets boring if I do this, but it&#039;s great to be able to stop a nightmare. Great to start a bad dream off right.

The same war still rages between servants of the Olympians and servants of the Titans, and this explains the conflict between occult societies that has underpinned nearly all political conflict and war in recorded history. The Titans\u2019 lackeys have been building egregores as vessels for them to manifest here again. They\u2019re just waiting for the opportune moment, when the energy harvesting system that supports the Olympians is destroyed. That was set in motion with the plandemic and is hurdling us toward world war.

Mindfulness is a word that was taken from western spiritual traditions to translate the word &quot;Sati&quot;, and it was re-adopted by western society for largely marketing purposes. It&#039;s a cozy word. Really, meditation (samadhi) is a focused application of mindfulness (sati). There is no meditation without mindfulness; samma samadhi is the result of samma sati. The Satipatthana sutta is the frame within which all other meditation methods occur in. To be mindful is to keep something in mind, and in Buddhism that&#039;s within the framework of the four satipatthana.<br><br>I haven&#039;t been trained in Zen but I have experience serving retreats at Thai Forest monasteries, where I did read some books on Zazen... the gist I got was that we &quot;just sit to sit&quot; or &quot;sitting is good for nothing&quot;. While I can&#039;t say how accurate my understanding is, I think this is helpful for times when you get too caught up in goals to the point where you&#039;re stressing yourself out, in which case it may be wise to just get back to the bare bones: sitting. But doing that for a while, your mind gets a bit listless or confused, in which case it&#039;s helpful to remember why you&#039;re practicing in the first place. But sometimes to go deep you have to put aside the part of the mind which is constructing goals and reasons for focusing attention. In a way you have to &quot;just do it&quot;. Think Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid: &quot;Don&#039;t think, shoot!&quot;<br><br>But in any case, there is mindfulness: remembering to &quot;just sit&quot; or remembering the 16 steps of Anapanasati. You need to read your own mind, so to speak, to see what&#039;s good for you. But mindfulness is always there until the end.

You do this through sitting, eyes closed, breathing, and every time you stop paying attention to your breath, you recognize it and pull your attention back to your breathing. It starts with that. Eventually, feel free to let yourself off the leash a little and mentally wander around during your meditation. Something to be cautious of is accidentally developing a dissociative disorder. Be mindful of when that feeling starts to develop and work through it in a healthy way. If you navigate that properly, you have crossed a really powerful milestone in building your skill. If you don&#039;t arrive at that point, you haven&#039;t been meditating long enough or seriously enough. It&#039;s worth getting into, but don&#039;t let it consume you. Meditation for me has been at its most beautiful when it feels spontaneous and unplanned. It&#039;s ugly when you treat it like it&#039;s something you have to pencil in: &quot;oh it&#039;s time for my 5 minute 4:00 PM meditation!&quot; When it&#039;s just like &quot;hmmm I feel like this is a good time to meditate&quot; that&#039;s when I tend to have my best sessions.", "time": 1673935578, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33862327, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:56:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33857923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33857923</a><br>There&#039;s a point in that kind of goal-less practice where you&#039;re actually kind of just feeding whatever is going on, if you aren&#039;t considering your input in the experience.

E.g. thinking of kindness as hard as we can won&#039;t generate good feelings and get rid of all of our anger. First we need to be patient and stick with basics, which may just be chanting or repeating phrases from the Karaniya Metta Sutta. Then we need to see what the results are of that over a period of practice. <br><br>I often compare it to Tai Chi. In the beginning we must learn basic choreography as well as postural basics. If we speed through the form without basics we can injure ourselves no matter how much we talk about &quot;moving meditation&quot; and &quot;flow&quot;. The basics must slowly, gradually, and patiently be developed over time. Then we find that the appearance of flow is only external, and the real internal stuff has to do with our mind and connection to the body, and what we do with that. At first it seems like a lot, but after continuous development it all comes together naturally.", "time": 1673981935, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33865782, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)14:20:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33865632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33865632</a><br>To simplify: If you&#039;re up in your head a lot, just try being more mindful of the body.

First of all, I think he does a great job at teaching anapanasati, and that by itself takes one a long way. That being said, the book (and I checked out his other material, they are the same) falls short in two ways. One, he seemingly uses metta in his practice heavily, yet the way he teaches that is not great because he tries to teach it exactly as described in the suttas. Second, from what I understood, he exclusively uses kasina meditation in specific ways to go into certain jhanas, yet he only mentions that in passing, as in &quot;oh by the way some people think about circular things while meditating,&quot; which makes no sense in the context so you probably brushed that off (I&#039;m not saying that kasina meditation is important and you should do it but rather he doesn&#039;t practice what he teaches). This is mostly because how kasina meditation is supposed to be done is not elaborated in the suttas and he doesn&#039;t want to go off the book. Both of these issues are caused by the same thing, he&#039;s dogmatic about suttas, as most serious Theravadan people.<br>So to someone who has read that book, I would advise two things. Metta is important, try to find a way to make that work for yourself, both the exact method to do it and how to incorporate that into your sessions. If you&#039;re having trouble stilling your mind, this is especially relevant. The second thing is notice the importance of jhanas and the fact that the main goal is to spend as much time as possible in jhana. My understanding based on research is that this is the case and Bhante Gunaratana also teaches this in his other material, but he probably didn&#039;t dwell on it in a beginner&#039;s book considering that it&#039;s an advanced subject.", "time": 1673990041, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867477, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does anyone have a good explanation for how meditation is supposed to help depression/negativity?<br>I can sometimes use it to feel neutral briefly, but I don&#039;t see how it can fix anything longterm", "time": 1673996274, "resto": 33841202}, {"no": 33867790, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:36:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33867477</a><br>When you perform shamatha meditation, if you do it for a certain time you will enter blissful states.

The other planets have some influence, but it&#039;s marginal. Everything else is too far away to have any meanginful influence on people&#039;s lives and is just wishful thinking, coincidental, throwing-chicken-bones, etc.. <br><br>-The Moon can influence moods and mental health. It does this in the excact way it&#039;s gravitational pull affects the tides; by influencing the salty cerebreal fluid your brain is immersed inside your fish-tank of a skull. The tidal jostling and waves created by a good lunar phase can causes eccentric, unusual, and unpredictable behavior. <br><br>-The Moon also holds influence over the weather. The Moon pulls and pushes on the atmosphere and this causes changes in the season, winds, barometric shit, etc.. The Farmer&#039;s Almanac is famous for their accurate weather predictions precisely because they take into account and consult the phases and movement of the Moon into their methods. <br><br>-The Moon, also, has a positive influence on the growth of plants. Moonlight effectively allows plants some very small, minute, ability to continue growth and development in what would otherwise be complete darkness. Plants grow towards the light given to them by both the Sun and the Moon and people have historically noticed this and planted going by phases of the moon. <br><br>Also, generally speaking: <a href=\"#p33897869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33897869</a> most of our circadian and natural rhythmes are dictated by the movement and presence of the Moon.

My buddy shot up first, he took a huge shot, I mean, I don\u2019t know how he survived it. I took a small shot, almost 1/4 of what he did. I could hear him laughing while I fell off my chair onto the floor. I felt like I was falling for hours. Every time I said a word in my inner monologue I felt my soul fall deeper and it felt like it was being crushed, or like I was falling through weak floors, it hurt terribly. Finally I saw a light in the ceiling and my inner monologue started to scream towards the light, screaming the light got closer. Screaming in my head and clawing towards the light hurt worse than falling. I realized it was the rectangular light in the ceiling I was clawing my way towards. I could see it perfectly though my eyes were closed, it was pitch black, and the light, but the light was white and didn\u2019t emit light into the black. I felt myself being judged. I was being judged harshly and I felt my inadequacy, I felt deep shame, regret, and also fairness. I wasn\u2019t being judged unfairly. Then my eyes opened, i completely forgot where I was for about thirty seconds. I saw my friend dying and rushed to get him help. It must\u2019ve been a cardiac arrest or something from shooting up.

It is hard, especially around other people, or in suffering and pain, and when entering thought to play with concepts. You forget. But forgetting is okay. Because it exists. The blessing is acceptance. You have to accept everything exactly as it is. Then you go ahhh. There it is. There I am. There we are. Here. There. Everywhere.<br><br>When you feel it and you know it, and you actively want to stay there, it will keep coming. You opened up a little crack in you, a little void, and God is going to keep filling you over time. The thing is that you can&#039;t find &#039;a way&#039;. You can&#039;t say &quot;I will look at my hands and remember God when I feel the blood pumping in my fingers&quot; or &quot;sunlight comes and I remember shadows and feel God arrive in me&quot; or whatever. Because God is mystery, unknowable, unborn, unmanifested, unspoken, unspeakable. When you put him in a word, a concept, a way, that is when you lose him, because then you look at that thing instead of God. You say &quot;well last time I felt God in the sunset so I will wait for sunset and then I&#039;ll feel God again&quot;. Okay maybe that works for a bit but a time comes when you are just looking at the sunset.<br><br>DO you know what clich\u00e9 is? That is how we forget God. We use some sort of conceptual scaffold to feel God, and then we try to share it and use it ourselves over and over. But eventually it becomes routine, old, and we lose the vital essence. We forget. Soon we just have the scaffold empty of God. We have the clich\u00e9 that is empty of meaning.<br><br>The way to God is no-way. God is no-God. Austin Osman Spare mentioned the way as neither-neither. Not this and not that. If you define the way, you lose the way, because the way can&#039;t be defined. So you need to accept everything. Or deny everything. Or neither. Neither-neither. Everything is a reminder of God then. The whole world and the negation of the world is God&#039;s pledge to you that you will not be forgotten, and so it is that you can also not forget.", "time": 1674333308, "resto": 33896520}, {"no": 33897828, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:41:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33897002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33897002</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;these bad thoughts are literal demons that inbedded themselves into your mind and make it go haywire with worries and fears.</span><br><br>&quot;The only thing that burns in hell is the part of you that won&#039;t let go of your life: your memories, your attachments.<br>They burn them all away, but they&#039;re not punishing you, they&#039;re freeing your soul.<br>If you&#039;re frightened of dying and you&#039;re holding on, you&#039;ll see devils tearing your life away.<br>If you&#039;ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth.&quot;<br><br>--Meister Eckhart<br><br>Every time you face a wall in life, a challenge, an obstacle, all you need to do to find your way through is to look directly at it and accept it for what it is without desiring it to be any different.

This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You\u2019ve been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today\u2026 Welcome.. to the desert.. of the real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.<br>AI? You mean artificial intelligence?<br>A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don\u2019t know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTUs of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion, the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born. We are grown. For the longest time I wouldn\u2019t believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.<br>No. I don\u2019t bel<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5b<wbr>0ZxUWNf0", "filename": "morfeo-the-construct", "ext": ".gif", "w": 220, "h": 123, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1674381823478926, "time": 1674381823, "md5": "qMFRvFjYF5ko+yh5xmr94w==", "fsize": 42770, "resto": 33900354}, {"no": 33902347, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)05:09:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33901913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33901913</a><br>not the anon you&#039;re responding to<br>so it&#039;s not like I&#039;m part of you conversation or anything<br>and am basically just interjecting my own opinion because I was reminded of something <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what if the only way for 100% of everyone to just mind their own business without trying to make anyone else&#039;s their own business unless it as consensual</span><br><br>and one example of how it could be consensual for someone to make someone else business their own<br><br>is a &quot;co-dependent relationship&quot;<br>where one partner takes care of the literal reality kind of stuff for the other<br>who takes care of the metaphorical life kind of stuff for their partner<br><br>instead of someone like me who is independent instead and exist on my own just guessing how other&#039;s do things based on what I&#039;ve observed to date<br><br>learning as I go<br>including from ever post<br>I read in these threads<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how ya doing stranger?</span><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO-<wbr>_3tck2tg&amp;list=RDlMbRhoQPJ6I&amp;index=2<wbr>", "time": 1674382164, "resto": 33900354}, {"no": 33902348, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)05:09:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Neo: I can\u2019t go back, can I?<br><br>Morpheus: No. But if you could, would you really want to?

Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious. Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world. Where none suffered. Where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization which is, of course, what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time. The future is our world, Morpheus.

Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

The people in Hell keep themselves in there and the Demons that dwell in there are happy to torture them, but anybody who doesn&#039;t think they deserve Hell can&#039;t *actually* be kept there beyond just being convinced to stay. <br>-Animals seem to have more of an influence on this then people expect. Lots of people are dragged out of Hell on horses, dogs, even pet birds, they&#039;ve kept in life, and Heaven is reported to be occupied by Animals. Animals seem to come and go wherever they please or are needed. <br>-The Godhead uniformly hasn&#039;t been condoning homosexuals. The singular barometer of divine judgement really does just seem to exclusively be how empathetic you were in life and the kindness you had for others.

I&#039;m not a glowie i just like pathetically larping, but it really made me kind of evaluate the nature of glow jobs and<br><br>&#039;specifically, the job of a case officer. A case/operations officer is a type of glowie which deals primarily with HUMINT, which is basically just human intelligence gathered mostly through interpersonal human contact. In other words, these glowies deal with people. Oftentimes, they are usually tasked with recruiting natives (called agents) of whatever region they are operating in and turning them into either informants, or having them infiltrate a circle of people the glowie is targeting, called &quot;running an agent&quot;<br><br>At first, my hypothetical larp qt glowie case officer would probably take a different approach to the usual way of dealing with agents. The usual way being through fear or coercion, &quot;I&#039;ll give you to the (insert corrupt police or security agency here) and they will hurt you bad and arrest your family unless you tell me what I need to know&quot; etc and while this method can get results, it&#039;s not always the most accurate method because it is based on a relationship of fear and mistrust. Instead the glowie went for an alternative approach. Glowie saw the &quot;agents&quot; as humans. And as humans they each had fears, desires, goals, everything that the glowie had the source/agent had as well. But most important to the glowie, the agents have intelligence or access to intelligence that she requires. She NEEDS these human beings. Not the other way around. So her goal was to empathize with these people, learn what they wanted. Protection, money, escape etc. all of them had something that drove them and she latched onto that something and convinced these people that the best way they can get what they wanted was to tell her or do for her what she wanted. They would trust her. Depend on her. She empathized with them.

She needed to form a connection with these people. Be their hope. Become their light at the end of a dark tunnel. But as time went on, she began to realize, she couldn&#039;t exactly do everything for these fuckers. Maybe they wanted too much money. Maybe they wanted immunity or whatever, immigration visas for their whole families. Either way they wanted something and sometimes the glowie couldn&#039;t always provide. But even when she couldn&#039;t provide, she still needed from them what was required. This is when she realizes that all the empathizing and befriending and human connection shit was all just fake, no matter how real even to her it felt because at the end of the day, her job was to get something from them, and that was the most important of all. Once that intelligence/task from them was given, their actual compensation wasn&#039;t necessary unless they had future use. She couldn&#039;t save everybody, but she had to pretend to, so they would tell her what she wanted or do for her what she needed. A hypothetical situation like this probably fucked with glowie a lot, and she would probably see this human interaction as more of a game, with trust as a marker to tell who was winning. If they trusted her, then she had them. She had to get them to trust her, and many times she had to betray their trust after using them. <br><br>The reason why in this hypothetical OP situation that I didn&#039;t just empathize with the whistleblower and convince him to not leak the information is because in order to do that I&#039;d have to place my trust in him that he truly wouldn&#039;t. That would give him the upper hand. Because he very well could leak it, despite what he says. Hypothetically, this would probably be projection from a hypothetical glowie &quot;i&#039;m so used to betraying people&#039;s trust in this job that I won&#039;t give people the opportunity to do it to me&quot; but it is what it is.

Contrary to popular conception, Glowie always believed that she had a firm moral compass and righteous goals. Even if the means she took to achieve them were unsavory or manipulative, she rationalized this by saying it was necessary. Maybe in the end, Glowie ended up losing her morals too, and in losing her morals, lost sight of any sort of goal or righteous endgame to whatever it is she was doing. <br>If my imaginary glowie gf was real right now, even the words of a simple stranger on the internet were thought-provoking.

I pull up to the house and honk, and my cousin opens up the door and waves at me through the screen door. I can see clearly into the house and he goes and finishes up talking to his sis and gets a plate of food or something. The whole time he&#039;s doing this I can clearly see his daughter bouncing around him excited to go home. She&#039;s in one of those little onesies with the white padded feet, and got a big puffy purple jacket on. Nothing out of the ordinary. So I dick around on my phone for a bit til I see them come out, and the baby girl comes out right behind her dad and I lose sight of her as she runs up to the SUV I&#039;m in. My cousin opens his door and greets me as he settles into his seat. And as he closes his door I just look past him into the side mirror to see where the baby is and don&#039;t see jack. Then I look at him like, &quot;Dude, are you gonna just leave your baby outside?&quot; And he looks at me like I&#039;m nuts and says &quot;She&#039;s at her mom&#039;s.&quot; I wasn&#039;t really creeped out by it at all but it still kinda blows my mind to this day how I legit saw something that wasn&#039;t there, supposedly.", "time": 1674365998, "resto": 33899171}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 33892025, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)18:55:31", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I think I might have psychic powers", "com": "I can often feel things before they happen.

If you answered no, then that means you&#039;re one of the 99.99% of people that live on this planet. Why is that? What even is IPv7? Well... let me quickly tell you before it&#039;s too late. I am a whistleblower and currently posting this from a public WiFi (since 4chan blocks most VPNs and proxies) and I am fearing for my life. So in short, IPv7 is the network that allows extremely rich, powerful and influential people to communicate with each other. Top government and organization leaders all use it in some way. You may call it the real &quot;Mariana&#039;s Web&quot;, but unlike any alternative networks, it is impossible to access IPv7 in normal ways. First of all, it&#039;s an entirely proprietary and secret protocol, requiring special software and networking hardware to access. One of the first things to do is to get in contact with one of the few ISPs that support the protocol, namely very large ones like Comcast. You need to ask them to get you in touch with &quot;the higher-ups&quot; after which you discuss with them about &quot;seeking Xanadu&quot;. Depending on your social and influential status, they may or may not provide you with the networking equipment required for access to the network. The equipment itself consists of a modem that connects to the network not via a regular coaxial cable, but a special wireless frequency. The other parts included in the package are network cards (either USB or PCI-E) and a flash drive containing a proprietary UNIX operating system that has full support for the protocol, along with what seems to be a custom fork of Firefox designed for the IPv7 network named Xanadu Browser.", "filename": "IPv7", "ext": ".png", "w": 2518, "h": 1688, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 167, "tim": 1674332241836482, "time": 1674332241, "md5": "OQrwDfNzME9k7uTaEW/WRA==", "fsize": 4001154, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ipv7xanadu", "replies": 25, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 33897684, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)15:18:10", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p33897680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33897680</a><br>Now... here&#039;s the part you&#039;ve been waiting for, what and how do you actually interact with the network?

I have personally never been in contact with such a modem and all the information I am giving right now is from some of my powerful connections, however from what they are describing the experience is something truly magical that &quot;let&#039;s everyone forget all their problems and differences and let&#039;s you be able to think, work and philosophise like never before&quot;.

Popular culture continues to define and conform to stereotypes and as a result people appropriate this so that they can declare their sense of difference from main stream society. At the more serious end, the practitioner may attempt to do something very different and yet without questioning contingencies which pre-figure the course of action, it is almost impossible to not end up almost at the same place as the populist witch approach. The only way to possibly stop the cycle is to question and study the formation of contingencies, so that one might understand how the relationship between the existential witch and the self develops.&quot; <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.patheos.com/blogs/byth<wbr>epalemoonlight/2019/05/exploring-th<wbr>e-existential-witch-with-peter-hami<wbr>lton-giles/</span>", "filename": "Witching+Other", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674343451361159, "time": 1674343451, "md5": "tvWpc8MB10Ww2nYgn9M+mA==", "fsize": 184297, "resto": 33879654}, {"no": 33898900, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:27:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p33898876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33898876</a><br>Is this the latest overpriced book on witchcraft fetishism?", "time": 1674343635, "resto": 33879654}, {"no": 33898968, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:38:26", "name": "The Ape of", "com": "<a href=\"#p33898876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33898876</a><br>Andrew talks about this with Darque Fluffe.
