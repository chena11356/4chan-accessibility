Here&#039;s the first thing you should know though: DC comics runs on a floating timeline that is constantly being offset by &quot;crisis events&quot; which reset and rearrange the timeline. The point I&#039;m making is simply: don&#039;t get TOO caught up on continuity and &quot;proper order.&quot; A lot of people go into comics thinking they&#039;ll start with book one, and it will be the origin of the hero, and then it will progress in a linear way until the end. That&#039;s not the case. Often, characters are introduced with no origin at all, and only later is an origin given to them. <br>Anyway, peak Batman is the 80s work of Frank Miller, The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One. The Dark Knight Returns isn&#039;t canon and was never meant to be, it was meant as a tribute to Batman&#039;s long (40 years, at the time) history, as well as a reimagining of a lot of aspects of his story. Like I say, it&#039;s non-canon, but it is so great that it influenced basically every Batman story after, and there was a definite time in the 80s/90s where Batman comics did seem to be working towards The Dark Knight Returns as an endpoint. If you&#039;ve seen the Batman movies, 90% of reading The Dark Knight Returns will be going &quot;oh, that&#039;s where that comes from.&quot; I highly recommend it.<br>After The Dark Knight Returns was a huge success, Frank Miller was called in to write Batman&#039;s canon new origin. Batman: Year One. This is, as the title suggests, his first year as Batman. It&#039;s one of the most acclaimed comics, and was a huge influence on Batman Begins and The Batman. <br>You said &quot;ideally, something in print.&quot; Unfortunately, Legends Of The Dark Knight is largely out of print, but it was a 90s comic line set as a bunch of early Batman stories, many tying into Batman: Year One.<br>Batman: The Man Who Laughs (do NOT confuse it with The Batman Who Laughs, different thing) is intended to be a direct sequel to Batman: Year One, about Batman&#039;s first confrontation with the Joker.", "time": 1673935815, "resto": 1307548}, {"no": 1307666, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:26:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1307659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1307659</a><br>Batman: The Man Who Laughs is also a kind of rewrite of Joker&#039;s first appearance from 1940 in Batman #1. There are a few comics that try to rewrite early Batman adventures in the continuity after Year One. Batman and the Monster Men and Batman and the Mad Monk are both rewrites of early early Batman comics from 1939. Unfortunately, not collected.<br>You said &quot;preferably in print.&quot; The things I&#039;ve listed so far that are definitely in print are The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Man Who Laughs.<br>Batman: Venom is an early adventure from Legends Of The Dark Knight, and I believe it is still in print (I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m wrong). It was written to introduce the drug venom for the origin of Bane.<br>Anyway, enough early adventures. The next stuff you oughta read is the 90s work of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. Haunted Knight is optional, that is just a collection of some comics they wrote together. Batman: The Long Halloween and Batman: Dark Victory are not optional. They present Batman&#039;s second year and the origin of Robin. They&#039;re also acclaimed as some of the best Batman comics ever. Some people would tell you to skip all that other stuff I mentioned, and just read Year One, Long Halloween, then Dark Victory. <br>After Dark Victory, there&#039;s a direct sequel by a different team named Robin: Year One. The sequel to Robin: Year One is Batgirl: Year One. The sequel to Batgirl: Year One is Nightwing: Year One. I believe all of these are in print.<br>Now I say you should go back in time a bit. Read Englehart and Rogers run in Detective comics, which was collected together as Strange Apparitions. And read either the full O\u2019Neil/Adams run (I think there\u2019s an omnibus now), or at least read the saga of Ras Al Ghul (which is collected in various books, such as Batman Arkham: Ra&#039;s Al Ghul or Batman Vs Ras Al Ghul).", "time": 1673936789, "resto": 1307548}, {"no": 1307669, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:40:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1307666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1307666</a><br>Also, try to get any kind of collected best of edition, there are many. I really like the decades collections, &quot;Batman In The Forties&quot; &quot;Batman In The Fifties&quot; &quot;Batman In The Sixties&quot; etc. They go up to the 80s. DC recently reprinted and expanded on Batman In The Fifties, I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re going to do every decade. There&#039;s also collections that are specific to certain characters, like &quot;The Joker: His Greatest Jokes&quot; which collects Joker stories from the 40s to the modern age. &quot;Batman: The Bat and the Cat: 80 Years of Romance.&quot; &quot;The Joker: 80 Years of the Clown Prince of Crime.&quot; &quot;Detective Comics: 80 Years of Batman.&quot; These collections will help fill in gaps you&#039;re missing.<br>Two major comics I haven&#039;t mentioned yet, both from the 80s: Batman: The Killing Joke by Alan Moore, and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth by Grant Morrison. The Killing Joke is, to many, the definitive Joker story, and it influenced heavily Batman 1989, The Dark Knight, and Joker 2019. Arkham Asylum influenced the video games of the same name, it&#039;s a surreal dreamlike story about the history of the famous asylum.<br>A Death In The Family (don&#039;t confuse with Death Of The Family, different things) shows Joker killing the second Robin, Jason Todd. Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying, isn&#039;t in print anymore, but it introduces the third Robin, Tim Drake.<br>Dick Grayson was Robin from 1940 all the way up to the mid 80s, and he still appeared in comics set in the past. Tim Drake was the Robin of the 90s and 2000s. Jason Todd was only Robin for a brief few years. Later, Jason Todd came back from the dead. <br>Knightfall is the major event of the 90s, where Tim Drake is a hugely important character. After Knightfall, No Man&#039;s Land. Hush goes here. Under The Hood brings you the return of Jason Todd. Grant Morrison&#039;s seven year Batman run (collected in three Omnibus books) basically set the status quo for Batman stories going forward.", "time": 1673937620, "resto": 1307548}, {"no": 1307671, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1307669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1307669</a><br>In 2011, DC rebooted again. New 52. So you have Scott Snyder&#039;s run. The Court Of Owls is the first story of this era. After that, Death Of The Family. Then there&#039;s Zero Year, which was meant to replace Batman Year One and The Killing Joke as the definitive origins of these characters. I&#039;m gonna be honest, I wasn&#039;t a fan. I read them, I wasn&#039;t a fan. But a lot of people are fans, so it&#039;s hard to just say ignore it all. After the new 52 came Rebirth in 2016, which made the new continuity be a mix of new 52 and pre-new 52 comics. <br>Batman: Black And White is an anthology series of black and white Batman stories by a variety of writers and artists. It&#039;s non-canon, some are reinterpretations of the characters, some could be canon they just happen to not be officially, but they&#039;re great. Also, collected, well worth reading.<br>Gotham By Gaslight is a Batman story set in the 1800s. Batman vs Jack The Ripper<br>Batman Year 100 is a futuristic reinterpretation of Batman in a far off dystopian future.<br>There are tie-in comics for every cartoon. Batman: The Animated Series actually has three. The Batman Adventures, Batman And Robin Adventures, and Batman: The Adventures Continue. The Batman cartoon had The Batman Strikes. Batman: The Brave And The Bold had one with the same name. Beware The Batman had 13 issues. Batman: The Animated Series cartoon spawned a whole continuity called the DCAU, the DC Animated Universe, comprising itself, Batman Beyond, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, and a few spinoffs. The DCAU has its own fanbase, who consider it the definitive version of the characters. It&#039;s pretty good.<br>There is a really great Batman 66 series. It\u2019s comics based on the Adam West tv show. It\u2019s definitely a labor of love. It also had an issue adapting an unused script for a Two Face episode. They used William Shatner\u2019s likeness to \u201cplay\u201d him.

Both are comics from 1939 and 40. After, these origins were slowly added to over the years, culminating in 1980\u2019s The Untold Legend Of The Dark Knight, which mixed every single origin together into one story.<br>In 1986, Batman Year One came out. Okay, so Batman has a new origin. Robin didn\u2019t get a new origin for a few years, so the canon was Batman\u2019s origin from Year One, Robin\u2019s origin from the earlier, pre-crisis comics.<br>So then, they made a sequel to Batman Year One, called Batman Year Two. A sequel to that was named Batman Year Three, and Batman Year Three was the new canon origin of Robin.<br>Later, they made The Long Halloween. The Long Halloween details Batman\u2019s second year as Batman, with no reference to the events of Year Two. Because The Long Halloween was so popular, it replaced Year Two as the definitive \u201cyear two\u201d story. Year Three was still canon. But then, Dark Victory, a sequel to Long Halloween, was made, and it presents a different version of the events of Robins origin. So Dark Victory replaced Year Three as the definitive \u201cyear three\u201d story.<br>Frank Miller later wrote a sequel to Batman Year One, named All Star Batman And Robin The Boy Wonder. It was received terribly, people didn\u2019t like it. It failed to replace Long Halloween and Dark Victory. <br>However, you can read any series you choose. Start with Year One, then decide what sequels you want to read for yourself.

Your story sounds kinda familiar to mine. A while back I really just did not have what I needed to get the sort of jobs I wanted. Here&#039;s a bit of what I learned - hope it helps.<br><br>1. tl;dr Lie about your accomplishments, not your abilities.<br>I got turned down pretty frequently cuz I wasn&#039;t sure how to sell myself to an employer. You want to start getting interviews while also feeling better about your abilities, try this: exaggerate a little about your accomplishments, but be brutally honest about your limitations. I&#039;ve been part of the interview process for several of the developers on my team and mentored several of them too, and it&#039;s ALWAYS easier to work with someone who can recognize when they&#039;re in over their head. Employers aren&#039;t scared off by someone if they don&#039;t have a degree, they&#039;re scared off by someone who&#039;s ambiguous about what their abilities are. If I can clearly see you&#039;ve got the bare-ass fundamentals of C and jack shit else, I at least know that I can put you in some low-risk position while you learn so you don&#039;t fuck everything up. On the other hand, if you brag about socket manipulation but start to falter if I ask you about memory scope, you&#039;ve demonstrated that you have just enough knowledge to introduce massive vulnerabilities into production code, without any of the knowledge required to even recognize them, let alone avoid them. No one&#039;s gonna take that risk. <br><br>2. tl;dr Prove you can back up your claims.<br>A degree matters probably a lot less in compsci than you would imagine if an alternative means of assessing your ability is available. A public GitHub or other easy-to-access repository of real work that you&#039;ve done can neatly substitute for a degree. Do demo projects, do personal projects, submit a link to them with your resume. Formal education is certainly going to give you a big advantage, and also demonstrates that at minimum you&#039;ve probably been introduced to coding best practices, but you&#039;re not...", "time": 1673938944, "resto": 1307398}, {"no": 1307674, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)02:03:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1307673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1307673</a><br>...out of luck without it. If you REALLY want to grab an advantage on the same level as a degree, though, start doing some certifications. Some of these come with courses, some with costs attached, but if you&#039;ve got them, anyone can tell at a glance how much of your resume is bravado and how much you can actually deliver on. LinkedIn also offers a lot of free &quot;certifications&quot; - they&#039;re just short tests on some of the principles and concepts that are important to a given coding language, but they&#039;re surprisingly in depth, and I look for them when I&#039;m doing interviews. (Also, if you don&#039;t know how to use GitHub, learn! It&#039;s really easy - Google &quot;git no deep shit&quot;, and use the guide in the first link to get started. Version control software is a staple of pretty much any tech company you want to work for.)<br><br>3. tl;dr Pick what you want and chase it.<br>I don&#039;t know if this is a problem for you like it was for me, but I&#039;m a hardcore C/C++ developer (SDL fuck yeah, I&#039;m making a game too) and I was absolutely inundated with job offers for JS, Java, .NET, and a whole slew of others. Applying for them early in my career was one of the worst mistakes I ever made, and led to a lot of very embarrassing interviews, several unfulfilling stints in shit positions, and two soul-crushing, zero-warning terminations. Just cuz there&#039;s a ton of options doesn&#039;t make them worth your while. If you want to work C, you&#039;ve got to go find jobs that are coding strictly in C, and make it clear during your application, interview, and second interview that you&#039;re ONLY looking to code in C. Ditto for SQL or whatever you want to do. If you happened to make an update to some .NET code years ago, don&#039;t sell yourself as a .NET developer. You&#039;re going to undermine yourself that way by pretending to be something you&#039;re not, and it&#039;s going to bite your ass and shake your confidence in the languages you actually know how to use.

Fundamentally, a torrent is just a &quot;secret&quot; link to a file on someone else&#039; device. <br><br>We torrent using clients that can help your computer find other people downloading the same &quot;secret&quot; link so you can help each other download the file faster. I can&#039;t recommend a specific client to use since I don&#039;t actually torrent all that much, but generally doing some research on google and reddit can help you find a decent one. Just do your homework and make sure the program you intend to use hasn&#039;t been linked to malware or scams of any kind. <br><br>So, let&#039;s say you have a torrent client and now want a movie. You&#039;re gonna need one of those &quot;secret&quot; links. People track these links on sites called &quot;trackers&quot;, where thousands are saved and categorized. You usually have the option, when choosing a link to download a torrent file directly or use a magnet link, most of the time either one will work but I legitimately don&#039;t know which is better to use. <br><br>Finding a tracker can be tricky, and obscure subjects can be pretty hard to find, but one of the best ways to find a high-quality torrent community is to use private trackers. They&#039;re private to keep out undesirables: people that don&#039;t seed and bots that reports the swarm to the ISPs. Usually you&#039;ll needed to be invited or buy your way in, sometimes smaller ones that need users will have open sign-up periods but they&#039;ll close right back up in the blink of an eye. I don&#039;t even know of any good private trackers to try and get into, but I&#039;ve heard that they&#039;re out there. <br><br>I&#039;ve mentioned a couple times that I don&#039;t torrent, but I do get nearly any movie I want a few clicks away. I&#039;m a part of a private filesharing group that uploads files onto the various free file upload websites like MEGA, Pixeldrain, and Anonfiles. Instead of having a tracker, we have a forum and a discord, and invites must be bought.
