The goal is as few pixels and colors as possible. The reason is because of how fast Maid Space numbers get bigger. If you draw a maid, the Maid Address for her is somewhere between zero and the number of colors you used raised to a power equal to the number of pixels in the image, minus one. So counting can take a long time and make a huge book, or be beyond practical limitations of the computer. <br><br>Imagine you need four colors and drew the maid in a eight by six image. A radix four, eight by six Maid Space counts from zero to seventy-nine octillion two hundred twenty-eight septillion one hundred sixty-two sextillion five hundred fourteen quintillion two hundred sixty-four quadrillion three hundred thirty seven trillion five hundred ninety-three billion five hundred fourty-three million nine hundred fifty thousand three hundred thirty four.", "filename": "(Us)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 667, "h": 800, "tn_w": 104, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675943343968664, "time": 1675943343, "md5": "yi1kUteQEHd1MhNBFkgTYQ==", "fsize": 56285, "resto": 1317102}, {"no": 1317225, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)07:27:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1317223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1317223</a><br>alright.
