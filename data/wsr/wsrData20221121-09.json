Think along the lines of a new hobby, or a skill to learn. I&#039;ve written fiction for over two years but somehow am completely stuck and can&#039;t get into it any more for the moment, so looking for something else to do in the evenings.<br>I&#039;m already learning a language, but can&#039;t do that for hours on end. <br>I&#039;ve tried getting into programming languages a couple of times, but either I&#039;m a brainlet or haven&#039;t found the right entry yet.<br>I would like some suggestions that aren&#039;t games or watching videos on youtube. I&#039;m on a Win7 PC with 8 GB Ram and a seven year old CPU, just in case there are some hardware hungry things to do. <br>I would be grateful for any suggestion, so whatever comes to mind, toss it out and I have a look.
