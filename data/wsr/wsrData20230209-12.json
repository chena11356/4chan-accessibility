Then the maid can get counted.<br><br>I plan to put the Maid Space books and Senko MaidHelper into CC0.

I therefore will not enter into a debate about taste - (meaning though I did not say so: horrible colours and foul lettering) - but I must ask this about the vignette: what has it got to do with the story? Where is this place? Why a lion and emus? And what is the thing in the foreground with pink bulbs? [ed. - he would later call them &quot;pumpkins&quot;] I do not understand how anybody who had read the tale (I hope you are one) could think such a picture would please the author. ...&quot;<br><br> It&#039;s a good question ? and he was right to ask it. Remington never got a chance to read the books and &quot;didn&#039;t know what they were about&quot; when she designed the Hobbit cover, as she said in an interview with Andwerve.<br><br> After the first five editions of the paperback, as noted by the Tolkein Library, Ballantine finally removed the lion.
