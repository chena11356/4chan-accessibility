Youtube tutorials and practice have been fine so far, but I feel like there&#039;s no way there aren&#039;t better resources out there. Most of these repeat content so I feel like I&#039;m just wasting time while looking for new stuff, and even the best ones feel quite basic.

However, where do I go to find these high quality paid courses? I don&#039;t know. Is Udemy trustworthy? Can I just look up courses on there, then look them up on 1337, and then watch and follow along and I&#039;ll be alright?<br><br>Basically, where can I find high quality (probably paid) courses for any skill?
