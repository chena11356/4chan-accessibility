If you&#039;re curious about non Canon/Filler episodes, watch random ones. Filler is cute sometimes, unnecessary most though. And if you&#039;re really curious, watch some of the movies. But with time management, the manga is faster. I went from Volume 85(Chapter 849 - 858) to 98(Chapter 985-994) in 6 months. Yes I took breaks, I&#039;m a college student and serve/work for a handful of places. but there was a period in those months where I was speed reading multiple volumes for a few weeks.
