It is an analog VGA monitor, resolution is that weird 1360x768 and it does not have that functionality to convert analog output to digital (that is a feature some VGA monitors have... right?).<br>So I bought an adapter to convert VGA analog to display port digital and I hooked it up on my graphic card (RX460, the display is 1.4 HDR in case that matters)<br>Now that I have both monitors on the GPU I can use that function to make one big monitor out of two monitors and I can play split screen like a king. It is working perfectly. Except that there is a NIGGER of a box roaming around the monitor saying &quot;Input Not Support&quot;, like in the image. This box does not show on a PrintScreen so I can only assume the monitor is directly writing the thing on top of a perfectly fine screen. It is also constantly on when I use the monitor on the digital port instead of plugging in the motherboard where the double monitors works fine (but can&#039;t make big monitor if they are not both on GPU...

For Fuzziness and Range, I adjusted them as I went. The selection doesn&#039;t have to perfect at this stage. Then I made a Black &amp; White adjustment layer with that selection as a layer mask. I cleaned up the mask with the standard soft edged brush, using varying opacities until the edges of his hair were clean but fuzzy enough to blend into the sky and his skin. That part was just detail work and trial and error. I also made sure to mask out anything that Color Range selected that wasn&#039;t hair, specifically his eyes and shirt.<br>Next, I made a Curves adjustment layer and copied the edited layer mask onto it. I used Curves to lighten up his hair so it looked closer to white than grey. This exposed the flaws in my layer mask where edges weren&#039;t blended enough, so I &quot;painted&quot; corrections onto the first mask and copied the fixed version onto the Curves layer mask (or, that&#039;s what I should have done; what I actually did was edit the masks separately, adding more work but also letting me fine-tune the details).<br>Here&#039;s the PSD file: anonfiles dot com slash oaa1eeY2yf slash 1676396665812736 underscore psd (Sorry, spam detection)<br>I hope this wasn&#039;t too wordy and made sense.", "time": 1676413823, "resto": 1319401}, {"no": 1319469, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)17:42:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1319463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1319463</a><br>Thanks for the explanation and the file!
