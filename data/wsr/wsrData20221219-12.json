When you post in a thread you bump it, making it go to the top. When a new thread gets made, the one at the bottom, which is the one to be bumpped the longest time ago, gets archived or deleted, depending on the board. Archived threads last around 7 or more days but this may vary by board or by the speed of the board, not too sure about this. You can&#039;t see all archived posts in the archive section, only recent ones.<br>You can only bump your own thread once with the same IP. You can post without bumping by typing &quot;sage&quot; in the options field. Moderators can &quot;autosage&quot; threads, making them unable to be bumpped, making them get bumpped off the board faster.<br>There are plenty of external archives but they don&#039;t last forever.

I can give you all the details I can remember.<br><br>Plot: A little boy and his sister somehow get lost in a big, trashy city. At some point in the movie, the little boy loses his sister in a huge group of people during what looks like rush hour. The sister is swept away in a big, dramatic scene as they both frantically try to find each other.<br><br>The people clear and the boy realizes that his sister is nowhere to be scene. The boy then goes on a journey through the city to find his sister and meets a bunch of weird throwaway characters along the way. I remember one of the characters being a rude hotdog vendor smoking a comically large cigar and ashing in the hotdog water.<br><br>Eventually, the kid meets a man in a subway station at night. The boy was startled by how gruff and intimidating the man looked, but was calmed when the man turned away from him and laid down in a pile of newspapers. I remember a sappy, sad orchestral song began to play as the kid realized that the man was homeless.<br><br>The two of them talked, had a heart-to-heart, yadda yadda yadda, then the kid revealed that he lost his sister in the city and had been looking for her all day. The homeless man then decides to join the boy on his journey to find his sister.<br><br>The two leave the subway and a montage of them meeting more strange, rude and &quot;wacky&quot; characters plays. The montage ends with two of them ending up at the entrance of a dark, &quot;spooky&quot; alleyway. The boy is too scared to go inside the alley, but the homeless man tells the boy something like he&#039;s been in lots of alleys like this one, so he&#039;s got nothing to worry about.<br><br>The two of them walk into the alley. The kid looks really nervous as he hesitantly walks behind the homeless man. A scuttling sound echoing through the alley and makes the kid turn around. When he looks back, the homeless man in gone.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont</span>", "filename": "dbkkvu6-a90bc180-04fb-4432-a1a5-bb7d872765bd", "ext": ".png", "w": 901, "h": 961, "tn_w": 234, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1671184535073675, "time": 1671184535, "md5": "he7gfoHJLSEZk0vQ1f8eAg==", "fsize": 88945, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "animated-movie-about-a-kid-losing-his-sister-in-a", "replies": 11, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 1295251, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)05:12:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A voice says something like &quot;up here, child&quot; and the kid looks up to see a giant spider wearing a black suit, a top hat, and what I remember as four monocles on half of his eyes. The spider asks why the kid is scared, then the kid answers that he lost his friend in the alley.<br><br>The spider slowly crawls down from the alley wall and says something like &quot;if he was a friend, why would he leave you hear all alone?&quot; I should also note that the spider had a posh English accent and a deep voice.<br><br>The spider starts to sing in a kind of slow, opera-esque voice. These are the lyrics I remember, but not sure how accurate they are after so many years.<br><br>&quot;Don&#039;t you want a friend? A special kind of friend? I will be there &#039;till the end. I&#039;m just that kind of friend. I may look a bit scary, perhaps a tad too hairy, but a gentleman&#039;s cane I carry. But I understand why you&#039;re wary.&quot;<br><br>The giant spider then weaves a piano from his webs and starts playing an upbeat, jazzy sounding song about how he can be the boy&#039;s new friend and how lots of people in the city wouldn&#039;t make good friends for the boy.<br><br>The musical number was full of visual gags, the one I remember the most was the spider playing the drums, the piano and a saxophone or trumpet all at once. The song starts to pick up in speed, the kid is playfully picked up by the spider and set on his back, and they both start dancing.<br><br>The song gets faster and I think the lyrics get more revealing about the spider&#039;s intentions, then the spider crawls up the alley wall with the kid still on his back. The music crescendos on a shot of the kid&#039;s shocked face and then cuts to a shot of the homeless man stuck in a giant web with webbing covering his mouth.<br><br>That&#039;s right about the time my little brother would start whining about how the movie was scaring him and that he wanted to turn it off.

Specifically, I am seeking some information--fictional and / or factual-- regarding what the &quot;Satanic Elites&quot; supposedly believe. I mean the core tenets of what they believe in, the weirdo fucko things in their religion that they use to justify all the evil shit they &quot;supposedly&quot; do. <br><br>Example: I remember hearing a conspiracy theory that says they put clues about irl terrorist attacks in movies before the terrorist attack occurs, because as part of their religion they have to &quot;warn&quot; people they&#039;re going to do something before they do it, thus absolving them of guilt somehow. <br><br>Once again, this is for writing inspiration, so I am accepting conspiracy theories, conjectures based on fact, and even other fictional stories based on the topic.
