Looking for a song, group of songs:<br><br>Song is hip hop/rap with a kung fu theme (NOT Wu Tang)<br><br>The songs tell a story of a guy finding a file on his computer showing corruption within his company. He plans to turn it over to the cops, but the company kidnaps his family and beat him up, but a super kung fu master steps in and takes the beating and dies, telling the guy to go to a mountain top to learn from his master so he can rescue his family. The guy masters his kung fu, infiltrates the bad guys, rescues his wife and daughter, and exposes the company, but the last line of the last song says they never found the big boss&#039; body, cliffhanger style.<br><br>I thought the song series was called &quot;The Ballad of...&quot; someone... Jimmy Lee? Something like that. I found it in a WSG thread like 5 years ago. Had it until a hard drive crash and now I&#039;m trying to get my music again.<br><br>PLEASE!", "filename": "kungfu", "ext": ".png", "w": 558, "h": 434, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 194, "tim": 1670118731697070, "time": 1670118731, "md5": "CmUzPgCrrhb0/OaA/TNBkQ==", "fsize": 489492, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "looking-for-lost-music", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1290314, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)07:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1670155744, "resto": 1290186}], "last_modified": 1670155744}, {"no": 1290312, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:59:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "sauce on this? ibyd returns nothing, and neither does saucenao", "filename": "1669769149000446", "ext": ".png", "w": 820, "h": 690, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 210, "tim": 1670155148363297, "time": 1670155148, "md5": "p7q2l9YzQggzayzFaQwSAQ==", "fsize": 305023, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sauce-on-this-ibyd-returns-nothing-and-neither", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1290313, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)07:04:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1290312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1290312</a><br>use yandex<br>https://booru.allthefallen.moe/post<wbr>s?tags=moyori", "time": 1670155475, "resto": 1290312}], "last_modified": 1670155475}, {"no": 1290310, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Requesting anyone with editing skills to remove the horns from his helmet.", "filename": "ChaosLord", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1606, "h": 2137, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670153571832869, "time": 1670153571, "md5": "KMIjBlT2g8ukg/1n7geRBw==", "fsize": 685942, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "requesting-anyone-with-editing-skills-to-remove", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1670153571}, {"no": 1290306, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)06:21:39", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Models", "com": "I was going to ask this on /fa/ but I think it&#039;s better here.<br><br>I am looking for pictures of models with a similar look to this pic.

I remember vividly that you play as a male author moving into an isolated colonial looking house somewhere in the woods in the U.S. with your wife so that you can finish your book. It starts of first person walking simulator but the graphics are actually good (not PSX) as you unpack your stuff from the moving van. One of the first puzzles is figuring out how to open some sort of combination locked box you find in a drawer. I believe contained inside is a journal that when you read sends you into a playable flashback sequence of the house in like civil war times or something. Your wife feels like someone is watching the house from the woods but beyond this my memory is very fuzzy. I believe at one point your wife gets tortured and killed in a basement and that someone suspects the PC of knowing something or being a spy. I dont even remember if the game had combat or not. I remember the timetraveling flashback sequences happened several times throughout the game all to around the same time period and place as the first. <br>Sorry if this is incredibly vague but if someone played this game it should be enough info already to identify it. I can try to think of more details but my memory is quite hazy and I don&#039;t want to add false info in case I misremember something.
