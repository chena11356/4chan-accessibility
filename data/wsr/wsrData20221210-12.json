The moral dilemma that Hamlet faces weighs heavy on his decision to seek revenge, thus it automatically slows down his progress. Moreover, Hamlet is unsure if the ghost\u2019s information is accurate and does not want to take any risks if it is not.

In addition, Hamlet must face his mother and his love of his former childhood with Ophelia. Although they all have a degree of influence on his delay of revenge, Hamlet\u2019s most difficult battle is with himself. He is debating back and forth in his head, trying to overcome his moral dilemma and determine what action is necessary to properly avenge his father\u2019s death.
