The inode can also use extents, this is an improvement over ext3.<br><br>In either case, allocating a small file means marking a block as used, and creating a directory entry that points to it. On ext3/ext4 you also need to write to an inode, this extra layer is necessary because ext supports hardlinks (FAT also supports hardlinks, but only as a form of filesystem corruption, not as an intended feature).<br><br>Are you maybe thinking of NTFS? For small files, NTFS can pack the data stream (which conceptually on NTFS is just another type of metadata, just like the filename) into the directory entry.
