For Fuzziness and Range, I adjusted them as I went. The selection doesn&#039;t have to perfect at this stage. Then I made a Black &amp; White adjustment layer with that selection as a layer mask. I cleaned up the mask with the standard soft edged brush, using varying opacities until the edges of his hair were clean but fuzzy enough to blend into the sky and his skin. That part was just detail work and trial and error. I also made sure to mask out anything that Color Range selected that wasn&#039;t hair, specifically his eyes and shirt.<br>Next, I made a Curves adjustment layer and copied the edited layer mask onto it.
