Private servers have a decent playerbase considering how old the game is. <br><br>There&#039;sa also a PSP game called Phantasy Star Portable 2 that is still active. This game has a japanese exclusive version called Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity which is basically a sequel except it contains all the content from the previous game. So it&#039;s more of an upgrade but with as much content as a sequel (both story and gameplay wise). As the name implies it&#039;s designed to be played indefinitely.

I am trying to find some articles (journal publications or news articles, to be specific) talking about how difficult it is to forecast demand in the book publishing industry. It would help if the article(s) also has some statistics such as &quot;for every X% over or underestimation of demand, a book publisher on average incurs Y dollars in inventory losses&quot;. 2. I am looking to see if there are any articles (again, academic or news) that talk about how effective advertising is towards children (for example: &quot;for every X dollars spent on advertising to children, a company (preferably book publisher) has on average gained Y dollars in increased sales or sales increased by a certain amount.&quot; 3. Specifically, I am wondering if there is some data around how effective the animated movie &quot;Bad Guys&quot; was in increasing sales for the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; book series (not how much it made at box office, though it would help to know how much Scholastic got paid for the rights to make the movie).<br>I would be very appreciative if someone could help me find anything regarding these three things.
