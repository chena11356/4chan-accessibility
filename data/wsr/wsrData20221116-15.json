Specifically, I am wondering if there is some data around how effective the animated movie &quot;Bad Guys&quot; was in increasing sales for the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; book series (not how much it made at box office, though it would help to know how much Scholastic got paid for the rights to make the movie).<br>I would be very appreciative if someone could help me find anything regarding these three things.

This game has a japanese exclusive version called Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity which is basically a sequel except it contains all the content from the previous game. So it&#039;s more of an upgrade but with as much content as a sequel (both story and gameplay wise). As the name implies it&#039;s designed to be played indefinitely. The english patch have been completed only a year or two ago (after 10 years working on it lol) so good time to try it out https://gbatemp.net/threads/phantas<wbr>y-star-portable-2-infinity-english-<wbr>localization-v2-update-released-aug<wbr>ust-2022.576943/ <br><br>Everything you need is on this page https://psp2i.wiki/w/New_player_gui<wbr>de and there&#039;s a link to a discord server on the left if you&#039;re interested in multiplayer.", "time": 1668531640, "resto": 1282265}], "last_modified": 1668531640}, {"no": 1282277, "now": "11/13/22(Sun)08:23:18", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Looking for a specific CoD: WaW video essay/retrospective", "com": "YouTube&#039;s search algorithm has been fucking me for the better half of an hour now.<br><br>Basically a few years ago I watched a fairly long video essay/retrospective by a British YouTuber regarding World at War.<br>I&#039;m after it to find one clip where he mentioned a scene from an older CoD where you were running up a hill and taking damage, and it reminded him of how many real people died in the real battle, BUT the most distinguishing part of the essay/retrospective itself is his criticism of the Pacific theater campaign of WaW, wherein he claims the Japanese were demonized and it felt as though the campaign was like something made during the war.
