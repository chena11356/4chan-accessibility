answer<br><br>Late for the show, but got to ask and this is going to be a stupid one.<br>The pin in a zipper of my jacket got accidentally bent and a tiny bit of the pin cracked and fell off. Along with it, the bottom slider (it&#039;s a two-sided zipper) also fell off (it can be easily put back with minimal tinkering). As a result, the zipper can&#039;t engage properly, because the hole in the pin prevents proper alignment of teeth. The hole is easily a 2x1x1 mm thing. The pin is made out of some plastic.<br>The jacket is off the warranty for 15 years, so bringing it back to store won&#039;t do anything for me (already asked, they&#039;ve stopped doing the post-warranty repairs in 2018). I have now a choice to either replace the whole fucking zipper using off-brand zipper, which will cost me quarter of my monthly pay, or get a new jacket, which will cost me my quarterly earnings (assuming sales). Nothing else is wrong with the jacket, I&#039;m having it since &#039;02 and it&#039;s one of those &quot;build to last&quot; things (including having originally a 5 year long warranty, rather than regular 2) plus I&#039;m really attached to the thing.<br><br>So my bright idea right now is to simply buy epoxy putty and fill the tiny crack, so it will get back the whole surface of the pin.
