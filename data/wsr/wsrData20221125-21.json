Anyone know what I&#039;m talking about?", "filename": "717ERE1WHmL[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 598, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 149, "tim": 1669418499120046, "time": 1669418499, "md5": "rW9RQiE9ROfm64lc4p9Mzw==", "fsize": 193381, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-saw-a-clip-online-from-a-film-or-tv-show-looked", "replies": 4, "images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 1287054, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:02:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286996</a>", "filename": "FdqG9lEUUAAq5A3[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 960, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669424536726997, "time": 1669424536, "md5": "AbpyZk4plONLgYqhue/nMA==", "fsize": 137559, "resto": 1286996}, {"no": 1287065, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:36:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1287054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1287054</a>", "filename": "FdqG_JtVEAETrWq[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1669426582940732, "time": 1669426582, "md5": "5rZjRyoenV9JZAlNADAi1Q==", "fsize": 121968, "resto": 1286996}, {"no": 1287079, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)21:02:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1287054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1287054</a><br>wtf that looks like ryan gosling", "time": 1669428126, "resto": 1286996}, {"no": 1287081, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)21:13:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1287065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1287065</a>", "filename": "FdqHDMyUoAcvqcE[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 960, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669428801267572, "time": 1669428801, "md5": "eKLgU/odJkecBqV2dWi11w==", "fsize": 96556, "resto": 1286996}], "last_modified": 1669428801}, {"no": 1287056, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "where the hell I can find the rest?", "com": "It&#039;s a couple of day that I looking for the other part (I, III, IV, V), but I&#039;m seriously struggling to find them.

I tried stretching strings to mount on my dirt bike (I stretched the springs from 2 inches to about 3, trying my best to stretch and heat them evenly with a MAPP torch.) but after heating I noticed that the zinc plating burned off. After dipping the springs in oil the springs were brittle and the oil coating wouldn&#039;t stick. Is there some cheat code to making sure that steel isn&#039;t so brittle when forging? IS there a process where I can remove the zinc plating?", "filename": "Ghostlogo", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 633, "h": 634, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669325590026185, "time": 1669325590, "md5": "yxfbbsG+XGiXe9xttKxQRw==", "fsize": 20194, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-anyone-here-know-how-to-properly-heat-treat", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1286574, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)16:53:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286570</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is there an idiot-proof process</span><br>No, you have to know stuff<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brittle</span><br>You need an annealing pass<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I inhaled zinc fumes</span><br>Not good, OP.

Though with 4chan there is of course the thing that norma\u00f6\u00f6y if people visit the site with a VPN and COULD post, they will use it for sth that will get you banned, so the site learn about new VPNs pretty much organically, once a at that point free address had been discovered and used it is burned and cannot be used anymore.<br>WIth sth like Steam or Epic that is probably not that much the case, but the system probably still over time detected addresses via inconsistencies - and once a user connected and was caught using a VPN by other means you can derictly add his IP to the pile of blocked ones, rinse and repeat. An obvious sign is if completely different accounts you from earlier logins know are located in different countries share an IP address, then it must be sth like a TOR exit node address or sth. Over time this lead to there building up a database of VPN/TOR IP addresses.<br>There surely may be some VPN connection from for example lesser known obscure providers that would work for your purpose, but you never know, and it may not STAY that way.", "time": 1669324320, "resto": 1286149}], "last_modified": 1669324320}, {"no": 1286545, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)15:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Identify this song", "com": "No way AHA Music is correct here<br><br>https://files.catbox.moe/tbiq57.mp4<wbr>", "filename": "knowledge", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3321, "h": 3702, "tn_w": 224, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669321860295299, "time": 1669321860, "md5": "Dk1rJNIbvvGJr4pncVpGXw==", "fsize": 3144596, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "identify-this-song", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1286546, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)15:38:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286545</a><br>sounds like an edited version of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVb<wbr>lOqZBlJw", "time": 1669322316, "resto": 1286545}, {"no": 1286555, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)16:10:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286546</a><br>Thank you", "time": 1669324249, "resto": 1286545}], "last_modified": 1669324249}, {"no": 1286375, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)00:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Vice realized Lolis Exists!", "com": "https://youtu.be/Ky3HqvT3M8E<br><br>Hello, I was hoping someone could help me make a Crying Chopper Edit tailored to the presenter of this Short Documentary.<br>Vice usually doesn&#039;t deal in pop culture, so is kind of amusing to see her reaction to Lolis, I would think that it would be well represented through a chopper meme<br>of Lolis are REAL!<br>.<br>Thanks in advance!", "filename": "lolisarereal", "ext": ".png", "w": 718, "h": 352, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 122, "tim": 1669269099243521, "time": 1669269099, "md5": "ylPsqEyixZOvKveTk4zFGQ==", "fsize": 382284, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "vice-realized-lolis-exists", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1286415, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)04:30:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286375</a><br>The Saul Goodman version they have on gelbooru would be the best starting point imo.<br>It&#039;s onve of the most humanoid versions and it&#039;s not as cluttered as other versions like Leon&#039;s or the TWEWY guy.", "time": 1669282209, "resto": 1286375}, {"no": 1286466, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)10:21:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "there is a kino shot of the trashcan with used tissues iirc", "time": 1669303310, "resto": 1286375}, {"no": 1286542, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)15:28:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286466</a><br>Glad that something caught your attention.<br>:.)", "time": 1669321710, "resto": 1286375}, {"no": 1286544, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)15:29:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1286415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1286415</a><br>Thanks for the advice.
