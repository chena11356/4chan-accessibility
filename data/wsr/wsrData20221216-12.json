At some point in the movie, the little boy loses his sister in a huge group of people during what looks like rush hour. The sister is swept away in a big, dramatic scene as they both frantically try to find each other.<br><br>The people clear and the boy realizes that his sister is nowhere to be scene. The boy then goes on a journey through the city to find his sister and meets a bunch of weird throwaway characters along the way. I remember one of the characters being a rude hotdog vendor smoking a comically large cigar and ashing in the hotdog water.<br><br>Eventually, the kid meets a man in a subway station at night. The boy was startled by how gruff and intimidating the man looked, but was calmed when the man turned away from him and laid down in a pile of newspapers. I remember a sappy, sad orchestral song began to play as the kid realized that the man was homeless.<br><br>The two of them talked, had a heart-to-heart, yadda yadda yadda, then the kid revealed that he lost his sister in the city and had been looking for her all day. The homeless man then decides to join the boy on his journey to find his sister.<br><br>The two leave the subway and a montage of them meeting more strange, rude and &quot;wacky&quot; characters plays. The montage ends with two of them ending up at the entrance of a dark, &quot;spooky&quot; alleyway. The boy is too scared to go inside the alley, but the homeless man tells the boy something like he&#039;s been in lots of alleys like this one, so he&#039;s got nothing to worry about.<br><br>The two of them walk into the alley. The kid looks really nervous as he hesitantly walks behind the homeless man. A scuttling sound echoing through the alley and makes the kid turn around.

But I understand why you&#039;re wary.&quot;<br><br>The giant spider then weaves a piano from his webs and starts playing an upbeat, jazzy sounding song about how he can be the boy&#039;s new friend and how lots of people in the city wouldn&#039;t make good friends for the boy.<br><br>The musical number was full of visual gags, the one I remember the most was the spider playing the drums, the piano and a saxophone or trumpet all at once. The song starts to pick up in speed, the kid is playfully picked up by the spider and set on his back, and they both start dancing.<br><br>The song gets faster and I think the lyrics get more revealing about the spider&#039;s intentions, then the spider crawls up the alley wall with the kid still on his back.

This is a supply/demand graph, which is basically a simplification of the aggregate process of all the consumers &quot;negotiating&quot; with all the producers, mainly through the mechanism of the producers offering products, and the consumers either buying them or not buying them. The &quot;S line&quot; represents the supply side: the further upwards* the price of the thing, the more suppliers will be motivated to produce it, and the more things will be produces. The &quot;D line&quot; represents the demand side: the lower the price of the thing, the more parties are interested in buying it and the more things you can sell. The area above D, the price is too high, and no-one will buy. The area below S, the price is too low, and anyone who sold would lose money**. The only useful quadrant is West/left: this represents the section where there are products being offered for sale and people buying them. If you&#039;re somewhere in the left-most quadrant, you can increase your price and people will still buy your products in the same quantity (go up on the graph until you hit the D line), or sell more products at the same price (go right on the graph until you hit the D line), though that price might not actually support the level of capital investment required to create that production (go right on the graph until you hit the S line). The aggregate of all the sellers trying to do that means the market finds the intersection point between S and D, and that is how much stuff is being made and what people are paying for it.<br><br>This is of course a massive abstraction, and only really useful for asking questions that can be expressed by moving one of these lines, like &quot;what would happen if there was less consumer demand?&quot;.", "filename": "0C7362DE-86AA-4BAB-A383-177705C39CF1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 237, "h": 213, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 112, "tim": 1671144782171543, "time": 1671144782, "md5": "b5fFMjNKMz+qsA4Ez3VIVw==", "fsize": 12540, "resto": 1295040}, {"no": 1295082, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)17:57:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1295068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1295068</a><br>If the consumers all have less money, then the D line moves downwards.

These games were usually newer ones, but not necessarily intensive (Valheim, DMCV, apex legends). But playing older games like Dota 2, DMC HD collection, or Minecraft did not shut down my PC at all. The shutdowns were instantly turning off; no error or blue screens. It only happened when playing a game, never when working on my desktop or doing other stuff. I checked event viewer and only saw &quot;the previous shutdown was unexpected&quot;. This led to me believing it must be a hardware issue and not a software one, or else a log would show up I thought.<br><br>So knowing this, I replaced my PSU, thinking it was going bad, with a 1000w gold cert PSU and it still shut down. I changed my storage to an m.2 drive, I changed my outlet choice, changed my power extender, changed my fans, cleaned out the PC, reinstalled my drivers, reset bios, nothing worked. I came to a point where I just rebuilt the entire PC and did an entire fresh install of windows 11. The only single part now in my PC that is from my old one is my AMD 6900xt GPU. Everything else is completely brand new parts. So I booted up Valheim on my pretty much brand new PC and it shut down in 5 minutes while talking on discord while playing. It is easily replicated too.<br><br>So it now comes down to either being the GPU or my apartment is simply haunted. I did try changing the outlets before and just now I tried changing to a completely different room in my apartment with another outlet and it still shut down in the intro to Valheim. I have owned this GPU for about 1.5 years and I have no idea how to check if the GPU is failing, but I never had these shutdowns when I first got it. I don&#039;t really remember when these shutdowns started occurring either, maybe a few months ago. Does anyone have any ideas?
