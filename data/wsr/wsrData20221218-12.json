I can give you all the details I can remember.<br><br>Plot: A little boy and his sister somehow get lost in a big, trashy city. At some point in the movie, the little boy loses his sister in a huge group of people during what looks like rush hour. The sister is swept away in a big, dramatic scene as they both frantically try to find each other.<br><br>The people clear and the boy realizes that his sister is nowhere to be scene. The boy then goes on a journey through the city to find his sister and meets a bunch of weird throwaway characters along the way. I remember one of the characters being a rude hotdog vendor smoking a comically large cigar and ashing in the hotdog water.<br><br>Eventually, the kid meets a man in a subway station at night. The boy was startled by how gruff and intimidating the man looked, but was calmed when the man turned away from him and laid down in a pile of newspapers. I remember a sappy, sad orchestral song began to play as the kid realized that the man was homeless.<br><br>The two of them talked, had a heart-to-heart, yadda yadda yadda, then the kid revealed that he lost his sister in the city and had been looking for her all day. The homeless man then decides to join the boy on his journey to find his sister.<br><br>The two leave the subway and a montage of them meeting more strange, rude and &quot;wacky&quot; characters plays. The montage ends with two of them ending up at the entrance of a dark, &quot;spooky&quot; alleyway. The boy is too scared to go inside the alley, but the homeless man tells the boy something like he&#039;s been in lots of alleys like this one, so he&#039;s got nothing to worry about.<br><br>The two of them walk into the alley. The kid looks really nervous as he hesitantly walks behind the homeless man. A scuttling sound echoing through the alley and makes the kid turn around.

These are the lyrics I remember, but not sure how accurate they are after so many years.<br><br>&quot;Don&#039;t you want a friend? A special kind of friend? I will be there &#039;till the end.

But I understand why you&#039;re wary.&quot;<br><br>The giant spider then weaves a piano from his webs and starts playing an upbeat, jazzy sounding song about how he can be the boy&#039;s new friend and how lots of people in the city wouldn&#039;t make good friends for the boy.<br><br>The musical number was full of visual gags, the one I remember the most was the spider playing the drums, the piano and a saxophone or trumpet all at once. The song starts to pick up in speed, the kid is playfully picked up by the spider and set on his back, and they both start dancing.<br><br>The song gets faster and I think the lyrics get more revealing about the spider&#039;s intentions, then the spider crawls up the alley wall with the kid still on his back.
