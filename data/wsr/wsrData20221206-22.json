So cool. The picture itself is from 1985. Grandpa (on the right) is basically dying. Coming back from the hospital in two days after he got Pneumonia at 88 years old. Also has late stage Dementia. He fell in the hospital, got a knot on his head, and they did a CT scan to see if there was damage. They found that he must have had a stroke or multiple strokes in the last few years affecting his frontal lobe. Major personality changes. Was such an easy-going anf fun guy. Now he gets mad often. During the CT scan, they found a mass in his neck. It is causing aspiration into the lungs. Nothing they can do. Too old for surgery or other things. Too ornery coupled with the brain damage/dementia to put a breathing tube in his neck. He would just pull that shit out! He kept pulling his IVs out trying to leave the hospital on his own, lol.

Here&#039;s what I imagine to be the important parts of the code. The rest of my code is just the text which I want to be changed into another text I have. <br><br>I&#039;ve tried a few methods such as a location.hash method and a video tutorial, but something didn&#039;t work out. The only different thing between my code and the hash tutorial one was seemingly that I tried changing the text of a h2 rather than a p, but I didn&#039;t test to see if that was the problem. Anyway, here&#039;s the code I&#039;ve set up which works when I click the buttons:<br><br>https://paste.ofcode.org/RH3ERE5SVp<wbr>84UfmUJHZeLw<br><br>What do I need to do add to make this work so that clicking the buttons swaps one text into another, or perhaps a roundabout way, turn the opacity of one language down to zero and a second one to a hundred?", "filename": "pepe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 225, "tn_h": 225, "tim": 1670309413536306, "time": 1670309413, "md5": "sJyumrDHpiwZQxl/w5bX4A==", "fsize": 8513, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "htmljavascript-help-with-onclick-button", "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1291098, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)02:38:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1291079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1291079</a><br>maybe try having all three languages in separate sibling divs, and when you click a button it applies a &quot;invisible&quot; class to all of the divs except the one whose button you clicked on.", "time": 1670312330, "resto": 1291079}, {"no": 1291134, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)07:21:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1291079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1291079</a><br>Lets say we go for the hash change method:<br><br>I see what you have here is 3 functions for each language.

Not C# or C++, just C. It is a very small language, and stripping you of the features and safeties that you got used to in Java forces you to think and program more strategically and efficiently. It&#039;s very nice, and for added learning benefits, I highly recommend not using an IDE for C and instead just using a command-line compiler and learning to read the error messages generated by your compiler, plus learning to use command-line tools like gdb and valgrind for debugging and memory checking, respectively. Also try to make decently large projects in C by learning to use makefiles. Digging into this lower-level way of development will help you later in your learning path after you&#039;ve ditched the lower-level stuff and start using Visual Studio and things--it teaches you what&#039;s going on behind the scenes. Having a greater understanding of your build process is invaluable, in my opinion. <br><br>Also look into learning Data Structures, which are basically patterns of programming that allow for more efficient storing and retrieval of data. At this point any book and language will do, and you should be proficient enough to look at the patterns of whatever language and learning resource you&#039;re referencing and apply it to your own programs.
