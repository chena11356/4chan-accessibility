It would help if the article(s) also has some statistics such as &quot;for every X% over or underestimation of demand, a book publisher on average incurs Y dollars in inventory losses&quot;. 2. I am looking to see if there are any articles (again, academic or news) that talk about how effective advertising is towards children (for example: &quot;for every X dollars spent on advertising to children, a company (preferably book publisher) has on average gained Y dollars in increased sales or sales increased by a certain amount.&quot; 3. Specifically, I am wondering if there is some data around how effective the animated movie &quot;Bad Guys&quot; was in increasing sales for the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; book series (not how much it made at box office, though it would help to know how much Scholastic got paid for the rights to make the movie).<br>I would be very appreciative if someone could help me find anything regarding these three things.
