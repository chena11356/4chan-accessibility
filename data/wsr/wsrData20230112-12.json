Looking for empirical evidence of a miracle means treating it as a natural phenomenon, i.e. something that you could be wrong about and therefore need to gather and examine evidence for.

So, no amount of empirical evidence is going to help. Even if you did find a video of a miracle happening, it would be better for you to not watch it. There&#039;s nothing new that it could teach you, but there is some risk that examining a piece of empirical evidence (e.g. a video recording) could end up leading you into changing your mind.<br><br>There&#039;s nothing to be gained.
