You can do that in one of three ways:<br>- in a breeder reactor, the downside of which being you need to already have enriched uranium and a nuclear reactor<br>- in a Calutron, which is basically a factory-complex-sized mass-spectrometer.

It&#039;s ideal to already know programming because it&#039;s going to be that much harder for you to grasp new concepts and design your own robust systems if you don&#039;t even know what a function is. If you already know some programming and have worked on some projects in the past then you already have a pretty big leg up<br><br>Unity has a lot of tutorials, like A LOT a lot, some of them good and some of them... well some of them just tell you to download plugins from the asset store, which hurts you more than helps you in the long run. If you chose to start with Unity, I recommend Ruby&#039;s 2D Adventure: https://learn.unity.com/project/rub<wbr>y-s-2d-rpg<br>Because it&#039;s a small tutorial with easy to grasp concepts. Don&#039;t worry if you&#039;d prefer to make 3D games, because it will give you enough to learn the basics of the engine and go your own way. There are a lot of 3D tutorials also.<br><br>If you don&#039;t want to use Unity then I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m sure there are decent learning materials for other engines too. If you&#039;re especially cool and want to learn games programming &quot;the spartan way&quot; there is something called Raylib, which I really enjoy but is admittedly not for everyone: https://www.raylib.com/<br><br>Ultimately games development is about what you&#039;re willing to put into it and you have to be in it for life basically lol. It will take a lot out of you so you have to really want it unless you&#039;re content with making dumb little game jam demos. Approach it with a learner&#039;s mindset because you&#039;re always going to be learning new things even after your 3rd or 4th game release.
