The snowflake ID is generally serialized in decimal format and is used in the post URL.<br><br>For example,<br>https://twitter.com/i/status/158167<wbr>4019991916545<br>Decoding 1581674019991916545:<br>{&#039;creation_time_milliseconds&#039;: 1665935447105,<br> &#039;datacenter_id&#039;: 10,<br> &#039;machine_id&#039;: 337,<br> &#039;sequence_id&#039;: 1,<br> &#039;server_id&#039;: 17}<br><br>The filename of a Twitter photo also contains a base64-encoded snowflake ID. This can be decoded into a regular snowflake ID, although it contains three &quot;extra&quot; unknown bytes.<br>For example,<br>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdMR2WD<wbr>aMAMPt2q?format=jpg<br>FdMR2WDaMAMPt2q -&gt; 1572620320212922371<br><br>It is unknown if the filename of a Twitter video also contains a snowflake ID.
