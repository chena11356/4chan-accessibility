These games were usually newer ones, but not necessarily intensive (Valheim, DMCV, apex legends). But playing older games like Dota 2, DMC HD collection, or Minecraft did not shut down my PC at all. The shutdowns were instantly turning off; no error or blue screens. It only happened when playing a game, never when working on my desktop or doing other stuff. I checked event viewer and only saw &quot;the previous shutdown was unexpected&quot;. This led to me believing it must be a hardware issue and not a software one, or else a log would show up I thought.<br><br>So knowing this, I replaced my PSU, thinking it was going bad, with a 1000w gold cert PSU and it still shut down. I changed my storage to an m.2 drive, I changed my outlet choice, changed my power extender, changed my fans, cleaned out the PC, reinstalled my drivers, reset bios, nothing worked. I came to a point where I just rebuilt the entire PC and did an entire fresh install of windows 11. The only single part now in my PC that is from my old one is my AMD 6900xt GPU. Everything else is completely brand new parts. So I booted up Valheim on my pretty much brand new PC and it shut down in 5 minutes while talking on discord while playing. It is easily replicated too.<br><br>So it now comes down to either being the GPU or my apartment is simply haunted. I did try changing the outlets before and just now I tried changing to a completely different room in my apartment with another outlet and it still shut down in the intro to Valheim. I have owned this GPU for about 1.5 years and I have no idea how to check if the GPU is failing, but I never had these shutdowns when I first got it. I don&#039;t really remember when these shutdowns started occurring either, maybe a few months ago. Does anyone have any ideas?
