No, I did that and it would not boot, saying no OS was found on the drive.<br>Whatever, let&#039;s just go back to LTSC then and try some other method, to do that what I tried was to put a different hard drive with OS on my computer, boot through it, then go on disk management and revert what I did by setting the Win10Pro partition as inactive. There was no option for that in sight, so I looked it up and did it with admin cmd.

I don&#039;t plan to pick it back up, but there&#039;s one part of the math I&#039;m still frustrated I couldn&#039;t figure out. In the game, skill progress was based on the yrs trained / yrs to master. So training 5 years in a martial art that takes 20 years to master would be 25% mastery. For simplicity, everything was calculated in reference to years, so half a year would just be 0.5 yrs, rather than 365/2 days.<br><br>However, the yrs to master would also be modified by growth rate. 1 is the baseline, so a growth rate of 2 would means it&#039;d take half as long to master. This is simple enough with 2, a skill that takes 10 years to master by default would instead take 5. That&#039;s when I got overwhelmed. I couldn&#039;t figure out how to calculate the yrs to master with anything other than a growth rate of 1 or 2. For instance, I couldn&#039;t figure out what the yrs to master would be if the growth rate was something awkward like 1.3, 2.2, or anything like that.

Christianity is something I&#039;ve thought about a lot and I understand that probably all miracles that are necessary for anyone are already written in the Bible. However if footage of miracles are needed to strengthen someone else&#039;s faith, or my own, I do not see what the problem is.

Thanks for posting it.<br><br>The problem I&#039;m seeing is that you&#039;re mixing up different paradigms. Looking for empirical evidence of a miracle means treating it as a natural phenomenon, i.e. something that you could be wrong about and therefore need to gather and examine evidence for. But the paradigm of faith is the opposite of this. In faith, you begin with your conclusion, and intentionally pass over the rest.<br><br>The fact that you perceive *any* value in empirical evidence means you actually aren&#039;t thinking in terms of faith in the first place. So, no amount of empirical evidence is going to help. Even if you did find a video of a miracle happening, it would be better for you to not watch it. There&#039;s nothing new that it could teach you, but there is some risk that examining a piece of empirical evidence (e.g. a video recording) could end up leading you into changing your mind.<br><br>There&#039;s nothing to be gained.
