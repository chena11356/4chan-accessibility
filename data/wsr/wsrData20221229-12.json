You can do that in one of three ways:<br>- in a breeder reactor, the downside of which being you need to already have enriched uranium and a nuclear reactor<br>- in a Calutron, which is basically a factory-complex-sized mass-spectrometer. This is what was used in the Manhattan Project, and the whole process was so complicated and fascinating it&#039;s worth reading the whole thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calut<wbr>ron . Spoiler: they used 6,000 TONS of silver, because the war couldn&#039;t spare 6000 tons of copper<br>- centrifuging Uranium Tetrafluoride. This is how it&#039;s done nowadays. UTF is probably the worst chemical that can possibly exist, it&#039;s worth reading the Material Safety Data Sheet if you&#039;ve got a thing for dark nerd humour. I particularly liked &quot;Observe all Federal, State and local Regulations when disposing of this substance&quot;, given how it&#039;s controlled as a precursor to nuclear weapons, radioactive, poisonous (because of the uranium), poisonous (because of the fluorine), corrosive, carcinogenic, and borderline explosive.<br>https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/f<wbr>iles/2020/11/f80/SDS-Uranium_Hexafl<wbr>uoride_UF6_2020.pdf<br>You have to heat it until it&#039;s a gas, then centrifuge the gas. Heat it but don&#039;t let it catch fire, there&#039;s very few substances that will put it out.

reviewing Tiger Electronic type games of the time, one being the one in my OP image. The premise of the article was that a kid had asked his grandma for videogames and she got him a bunch of those electronic games. The article had photos of the kid and the grandma, actually two guys in costumes, the guy playing the kid was kneeling to look short and had one of those propeller hats. Grandma of course looked like an obvious hairy guy in drag.<br>-This last one I&#039;m not sure, probably was a different magazine altogether. In any case I remember an import article on pokemon gold and silver, overviews of the cities and routes in particular. I say import because they were still using the japanese names for the cities and pokemon. Probably even had a list with images of all the new Pokemon but I can&#039;t recall.<br>-Perhaps it was a dedicated handheld console magazine? Or a special issue on portable consoles?<br>-Had some ads for games published by 3DO.

Yesterday i had a system crash (didn&#039;t even go to BSOD, just froze and shut down) and since then i&#039;ve been having a hell of a time booting up. It seems the motherboard is failing to boot from the m.2 slot. At first i naturally suspected that it was the drive that was faulty (Samsung SSD 980 PRO 2TB) but since i had my old computer around i put the new drive in the old computer and it was detecting it (and booting) up just fine, so my suspicions kinda shifted to the Mobo. Additionally, the old drive in the new computer is also detected but won&#039;t boot either. Most of the times the BIOS will show that no drives are connected (i just have the one m.2 slot filled, no sata ssds or hdds), from time to time, the drive will apear but the computer will still go straight to bios, no booting, even when recognizing the M.2 drive. I have updated the BIOS, to see if that made any difference, but it didn&#039;t.
