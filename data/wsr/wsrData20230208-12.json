You might be around some like minded people who want to do good and do it well. You&#039;ll also be with real people and that&#039;s much better than the anonymising effect of Internet interaction. Instead of hiding behind your anonymity you&#039;ll have to deal with people more appropriately and there are people who will punch you in the face if you get too fresh with them which is good incentive, even if you do go to the gym.

Tolkien[3] <br><br>Later in the same year and writing on the same subject, Tolkien more specifically points out a source of dislike with Hompen to Rayner Unwin:<br><br> &quot;May I say now at once that I will not tolerate any similar tinkering with the personal nomenclature. Nor with the name/word Hobbit. I will not have any more Hompen (in which I was not consulted), nor any Hobbel or what not.&quot; <br> \u2015 J.R.R. Tolkien[4] <br><br>The translation of the name &#039;Hobbit&#039; to &#039;Hompe&#039;[note 1] was not the only thing that annoyed Tolkien about this edition.

So, if anyone gets the okay to gripe about cover illustrations, and walk around in a tattered robe cursing in Elfish, it&#039;s him.<br><br> Here&#039;s a quote from a letter he wrote to Raynor Unwin (from The Letters of J.R.R.

It was a short hasty note by hand, without a copy, but it was to this effect: I think the cover ugly; but I recognize that a main object of a paperback cover is to attract purchasers, and I suppose that you are better judges of what is attractive in USA than I am. I therefore will not enter into a debate about taste - (meaning though I did not say so: horrible colours and foul lettering) - but I must ask this about the vignette: what has it got to do with the story? Where is this place? Why a lion and emus? And what is the thing in the foreground with pink bulbs? [ed. - he would later call them &quot;pumpkins&quot;] I do not understand how anybody who had read the tale (I hope you are one) could think such a picture would please the author. ...&quot;<br><br> It&#039;s a good question ? and he was right to ask it. Remington never got a chance to read the books and &quot;didn&#039;t know what they were about&quot; when she designed the Hobbit cover, as she said in an interview with Andwerve.<br><br> After the first five editions of the paperback, as noted by the Tolkein Library, Ballantine finally removed the lion.
