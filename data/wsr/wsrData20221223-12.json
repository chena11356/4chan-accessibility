My current TV is a Panasonic LED TV TX-40DX600E. The pricier TV is a Loewe One 40 56404W72. <br>I compared the two, here are the differences I noticed:<br><br>- Panasonic is less bright<br>- Panasonic has worse shadows in videogames (shadows are blue sometimes, solvable by using cinema mode)<br>- Panasonic has better shadows when watching videos (true black)<br>- Panasonic has much more vibrant colors (Loewe can become almost the same if I play with settings)<br>- Loewe has shit audio (but I can just use headphones)", "filename": "loewe 2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 858, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 214, "tim": 1671749968483140, "time": 1671749968, "md5": "Wx0xAyZ+Avq9mTwWNO3JZg==", "fsize": 75679, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-have-the-opportunity-to-upgrade-my-tv-with-a", "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 1296806, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:34:21", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "image edit", "com": "Can someone edit this so it looks more like a R18 doujin?<br><br>I&#039;m too dumb to get a credible one myself.", "filename": "doujin", "ext": ".png", "w": 1024, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 177, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671492861098648, "time": 1671492861, "md5": "lyeCHeoJjl1RqkrCaJjfjA==", "fsize": 795962, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "image-edit", "replies": 11, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 1296807, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)18:35:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1296806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1296806</a><br>this is the &quot;original&quot;

The sister is swept away in a big, dramatic scene as they both frantically try to find each other.<br><br>The people clear and the boy realizes that his sister is nowhere to be scene. The boy then goes on a journey through the city to find his sister and meets a bunch of weird throwaway characters along the way. I remember one of the characters being a rude hotdog vendor smoking a comically large cigar and ashing in the hotdog water.<br><br>Eventually, the kid meets a man in a subway station at night. The boy was startled by how gruff and intimidating the man looked, but was calmed when the man turned away from him and laid down in a pile of newspapers. I remember a sappy, sad orchestral song began to play as the kid realized that the man was homeless.<br><br>The two of them talked, had a heart-to-heart, yadda yadda yadda, then the kid revealed that he lost his sister in the city and had been looking for her all day. The homeless man then decides to join the boy on his journey to find his sister.<br><br>The two leave the subway and a montage of them meeting more strange, rude and &quot;wacky&quot; characters plays. The montage ends with two of them ending up at the entrance of a dark, &quot;spooky&quot; alleyway. The boy is too scared to go inside the alley, but the homeless man tells the boy something like he&#039;s been in lots of alleys like this one, so he&#039;s got nothing to worry about.<br><br>The two of them walk into the alley. The kid looks really nervous as he hesitantly walks behind the homeless man. A scuttling sound echoing through the alley and makes the kid turn around.

The spider asks why the kid is scared, then the kid answers that he lost his friend in the alley.<br><br>The spider slowly crawls down from the alley wall and says something like &quot;if he was a friend, why would he leave you hear all alone?&quot; I should also note that the spider had a posh English accent and a deep voice.<br><br>The spider starts to sing in a kind of slow, opera-esque voice.

But I understand why you&#039;re wary.&quot;<br><br>The giant spider then weaves a piano from his webs and starts playing an upbeat, jazzy sounding song about how he can be the boy&#039;s new friend and how lots of people in the city wouldn&#039;t make good friends for the boy.<br><br>The musical number was full of visual gags, the one I remember the most was the spider playing the drums, the piano and a saxophone or trumpet all at once.

The music crescendos on a shot of the kid&#039;s shocked face and then cuts to a shot of the homeless man stuck in a giant web with webbing covering his mouth.<br><br>That&#039;s right about the time my little brother would start whining about how the movie was scaring him and that he wanted to turn it off.
