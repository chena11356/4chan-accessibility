A toothpick end if the gap is big enough or some paper (foil is pretty good if you are careful not to make new connections, disregard one side rule in this case). If you managed to balance everything out so that every pin touches metal of its hole reliably, superglue every hole (don&#039;t apply too much so it doesn&#039;t go on other components). Then you have to be very careful inserting it in as superglue is brittle, maybe help it go in by gently applying pressure to all the pins from the top. Then you never disconnect it if you want it working, assume first disconnect will break it.<br>If you are not in immediate need of a bodge job just buy a cheapo chinese soldering iron, they are very good for the price.", "time": 1670731589, "resto": 1292877}, {"no": 1292955, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:39:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1292877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292877</a><br>paper clip and a lighter can make a &#039;piss with the cock I got&#039; soldering iron.", "time": 1670737161, "resto": 1292877}], "last_modified": 1670737161}, {"no": 1292938, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:50:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Source?", "filename": "1670630725699675", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 840, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670734221947237, "time": 1670734221, "md5": "G2I6ZJTesCJ+v/1TG+NEjQ==", "fsize": 184628, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "source", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1292944, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)00:06:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ascii2d says the sauce is \u6027\u98df\u9b3c 8\u5dfb<br>but i can&#039;t find the exact panel", "time": 1670735208, "resto": 1292938}], "last_modified": 1670735208}, {"no": 1292157, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)21:58:05", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "looking for song", "com": "In the movie &quot;The lost boys&quot;, there&#039;s this &quot;cry little sister&quot; song, but it is just the &quot;kids chorus&quot; part.<br>Does anyone know if if it&#039;s a special version used only for the movie?, or did they just cut out the chorus?<br><br>I have been looking for that version, but I&#039;m not really good at searching", "filename": "music_icon", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 600, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670554685963006, "time": 1670554685, "md5": "UCm0ei2l+fSun2nr/VACvg==", "fsize": 9581, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "looking-for-song", "replies": 5, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 1292575, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)00:21:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1670649674, "resto": 1292157}, {"no": 1292776, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:19:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1670707149, "resto": 1292157}, {"no": 1292785, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1292157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292157</a><br>tell me what time in the movie you&#039;re talking about", "time": 1670708367, "resto": 1292157}, {"no": 1292786, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)16:41:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1292157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292157</a><br><a href=\"#p1292575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292575</a><br><a href=\"#p1292776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292776</a><br>i literally seached song title + karaoke<br>https://youtu.be/NSVJtZTpXRs", "time": 1670708507, "resto": 1292157}, {"no": 1292937, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)23:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p1292786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1292786</a><br>thank you, this sounds nice, but I was just wondering if the movie used some special version (like this one) or what happened..<br><br>like in this scene<br><br>https://youtu.be/F5g7u8WRwqQ?t=73<br><br>the &quot;tempo&quot; (I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s tempo, I don&#039;t have good musical knowledge, but I mean the speed of the chorus) seems slower, also sounds kinda different than the released song.<br>I was wondering if that &quot;special version&quot; actually exists somewhere", "time": 1670734089, "resto": 1292157}], "last_modified": 1670734089}, {"no": 1292798, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)17:10:16", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Sauce", "com": "Where is this from?
