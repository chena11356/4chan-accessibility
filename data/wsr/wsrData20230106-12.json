You really should have given up on that poor approach well before you got to the stage you&#039;re at. You&#039;ve already badly damaged the head and you&#039;re not far off stripping it completely.

Chalk all that up to experience. <br><br>If you persist on going the way you&#039;re going you won&#039;t be able to try other methods, after heating it, like tapping a screwdriver in gently with a hammer before turning or using a piece of rubber like a a small section of inner tube, or a penetrating lubricant, but don&#039;t use that around heat as it may be flammable.<br><br>You main options, after heating it and normal use of a screwdriver fails, are pliers or vicegrips since it looks like the head is above the frame, cutting a slot for a flat head, or screw extractor. Since you&#039;re probably only going to use it once, a cheap screw extractor would probably be okay but you&#039;d need to check with someone who&#039;s seen your bike.

Same as tvs you have to code in networking options including broadcast announcements. Developers could include an option to turn them off but again, why? Who does it help? How much trouble would it make for the phone manufacturer and app provider when a stupid consumer turns it off and breaks functionality and claims the phone is faulty? Too much.<br><br>Either you disconnect the devices from the network, turn off WiFi or unplug ethernet, or they will broadcast their presence to everything and everything else that is designed to respond will respond.<br><br>You could mess around with firewalls blocking certain addresses, if firewalls exists for your phone or tv, or set up network rules on your router to block certain devices but router rules will only apply to your router, not a friend&#039;s.
