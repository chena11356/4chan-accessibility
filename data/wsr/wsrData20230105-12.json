In olden times that meant plugging things in and making an electrical circuit. With networking devices instead send a broadcast packet to announce their existence.<br><br>Broadcast packets are by definition intended to be received by every other device on the particular network or subnet.

Finding local ip addresses, that could change everytime the tv is turned on, and entering them manually is a step backwards.<br><br>Phone apps work like the tv apps. Same as tvs you have to code in networking options including broadcast announcements. Developers could include an option to turn them off but again, why? Who does it help? How much trouble would it make for the phone manufacturer and app provider when a stupid consumer turns it off and breaks functionality and claims the phone is faulty? Too much.<br><br>Either you disconnect the devices from the network, turn off WiFi or unplug ethernet, or they will broadcast their presence to everything and everything else that is designed to respond will respond.<br><br>You could mess around with firewalls blocking certain addresses, if firewalls exists for your phone or tv, or set up network rules on your router to block certain devices but router rules will only apply to your router, not a friend&#039;s.
