The obligatory friend who is just a friend and does very little, but highly social people need that no strings attached relationship to stay sane and evolving to lack the need for one at all would make them worse in other ways. Pets are a symbiote that allows us to remain highly social and replace potentially dangerous and resource intensive non-productive humans with something exponentially safer and cheaper. Objectively less unneeded human contact lessens your risk of being killed or stolen from. All of your human friends should be productive enough to make up for that risk, but that creates stressful obligations and friendships that can never be relied on. The useless friend is the best one to confide in and rely on just to fulfill your instincts.<br><br>They are an inevitable and essential part of an efficient high trust society but they must be that. Friends, fwbs. Not children. Or they stop being a symbiote.

Especially if you get a kitten. There&#039;s a chance if you get a cat he will be a house plant you need to feed, but theres a bigger chance the cat is a much larger part of your life then you think it would be. <br><br>I got my cat during covid when he was 3 months old, and I spent every second with him. We grew a huge bond because he was the only living thing I saw daily, but he imprinted on me to such a degree where he is extremely comfortable around people (when I go to the vet they can&#039;t believe how well behaved he is, he isn&#039;t scared at all to be picked up or examined) and is very social. But I know he&#039;s like this because I was in his life constantly. <br><br>Anyways, because of this, he needs love and affection, not just food. He wants to play, cuddle, be pet, etc. I talk to him and he talks back, and we spend time at my apartment together a lot. I care about his health and weight so I feed him wet food every 8 hours, so thats definitely a routine I have to follow for his sake. But when I get home he&#039;s happy, and I&#039;m happy to see him. I feel like the answer to your question is more how much you want your cat to be part of your life. Assuming you get a kitten (which you need to have a lot of time for at the beginning) every cat can become fun little kitties. Older cats usually are more set in their ways, but they have their routines and know what they want, so you dont have to constantly analyze and raise a kitten. I&#039;ll say this, watching him grow up was truly surreal. Seeing how small he was when I got him where he had to climb up his scratching post, to being taller than it. Him being able to make jumps he couldn&#039;t before, getting stronger while playing, there truly is nothing like it.

Oftentimes the trap breaks the lower spine, not the neck and causes the little vermin a great deal of pain before it finally dies. It is absolutely necessary to kill them as soon as you can, and in my mind, if you must kill, do it quickly and cleanly as you can. If you can see one, there are probably several you don&#039;t see, so keep setting traps until it&#039;s been days since you got one. Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can. If you hesitate or show mercy, not only will they fuck your world, you will end up having to kill far far more of them in the future. I am listening to rat scratches in the ceiling right now. I didn&#039;t have the heart to kill a rat, and now I&#039;ve been killing scores of it&#039;s descendants every week for the past six months. The whole property is lousy with them.

They&#039;re basically a mass of photosynthesis capable cells that can regenerate from even a tiny cutting. <br><br>If you want to gain an appreciation for plants, I&#039;d look into their history foremost. They were the first living things to leave the oceans and conquer the land, in the process they literally terraformed the whole planet. Mosses covered the world, pumping the atmosphere full of oxygen. For fifty million years trees ruled the continents, there weren&#039;t even organisms capable of breaking down wood yet. Dead trees simply built up on the forest floor, their mighty corpses totally impervious to other life (this is the origin of coal btw). All complex life relies on plants binding the suns energy through photosynthesis. <br><br>Human culture itself only really came about once we settled down and started tending to plants. Surely this is also where some part of our fascination with them stems from. For ten thousand years, our lives and civilizations were (and continue to be) dependent on people living in sync with their crop plants.

Cats are prey animals to any medium or larger canine, as well as prey animals to other felines. Everything eats cats - cheetahs, jaguars, servals, painted wolves, hyenas, lions, crocodiles, birds of prey, etc. It&#039;s why they&#039;re always skittish and try and remain undetected, not just when they hunt. This has nothing to do with pitbulls. The only way pitbulls are special here is they will continue killing a cat if it stands up for itself and fights back, when most dogs will fall for the bluff and give up.<br><br>Greyhounds are considered gentle natured, non-aggressive dogs ideal for families but are major cat killers. Even herding dogs will kill cats. A dog doesn&#039;t recognize the difference between a cat and a rabbit unless purposefully socialized to, and even then they will slip up and act out their instincts. Both are small, edible, and kick and claw when cornered.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I swear my dog is meant to be nice</span><br>If you would not raise a cat with a rat without expecting the cat to kill the rat you should not place cats with medium and larger dogs.

This mindset is masked behind a love for animals over humans who are capable of genuine maliciousness and conscious evil, unlike animals, but in truth it\u2019s never about the animals. These people don\u2019t care about animals, they are simply using animals to signal and harbour an excuse for their self-loving narcissistic sociopathic self-superiority over others. They love seeing others suffering because it makes themselves feel that they are better, but in truth if they were hurt by an animal they would probably try to fucking kill it. I despise these hypocrites so much.<br><br><br>Now of course if someone does something stupid around an animal and they get what you would expect, they have it coming to them, but I would never celebrate that person\u2019s life being taken from them in their stupidity.

There isn&#039;t a fundamental biological rule that states that &#039;reptiles don&#039;t have fat&#039;, because, conversely, they do. They don&#039;t have the same level of extensive fat deposits that mammals have because A) modern reptiles are generally smaller so require less on demand energy and B) surviving reptile taxa are all ectotherms, meaning they can&#039;t survive on burning their own calories alone, they need to warm themselves with the sun. Most of their fat deposits are for reproductive purposes primarily. However, we now know it&#039;s unlikely that a purely ectothermic regulation method could&#039;ve supported the metabolic rates of most dinosaurs, which were generally larger than modern reptiles, more active, and grew a lot faster. They had four-chambered hearts (all modern reptiles except for crocodiles have 3 chambers, crocodiles require 4 chambers because they are aquatic and probably inherited it from archosaur ancestors), likely a sustained aerobic metabolism (indicated by chambered air sacs), and ecologies that do not reflect ectothermic lifestyles (the ratio of the total mass of predators to prey in dinosaur communities was much more like that of modern and recent warm-blooded communities than that of recent or fossil cold-blooded communities.) <br>They were either wholly warm-blooded endotherms like their modern bird descendants, or they had intermediate mesotherm metabolisms somewhere between full ectothermy or full endothermy, perhaps with different lineages covering different types of metabolism.", "filename": "mesotherms", "ext": ".png", "w": 1284, "h": 944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1674414734563651, "time": 1674414734, "md5": "b0+iUWOkYm1uHC9FX84VGQ==", "fsize": 365327, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416774, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><a href=\"#p4416761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416761</a><br><br>Whatever the combination, the evidence shows that many dinosaurs were homeotherms and could independently maintain body temperature and metabolism in a way that modern reptiles can&#039;t. Now, if they were indeed endotherms, then they might have a different relationship with their adipose deposits than modern reptiles do, ie they might require them to maintain a high metabolic rate.<br>You don&#039;t have to undo the entire Dinosaur Renaissance just because you hate modern paleoart. It&#039;s very much the case that there&#039;s a lot of retarded stuff out there but that doesn&#039;t bring us back to the conclusion that dinosaurs were just &#039;muh big lizards&#039;. They were a lineage of reptiles that developed a collection of traits that made them wholly different from other reptile groups, including modern taxa. That&#039;s why they were so SUCCESSFUL for 165 million years, because these adaptions allowed them to dominate Triassic ecosystems in a way that other archosaurs or lepidosaurs or just other diapsid reptiles weren&#039;t capable of doing. Which is why their only surviving descendants, birds, are so totally different from any other line of reptiles.<br>Just admit this modern paleoart rubs you up the wrong way because you think it looks retarded. There&#039;s no shame in that, I&#039;d agree with you on a lot of it. But that doesn&#039;t justify trying to ignore some of the very unique things we know about dinosaurs that means that modern reptiles are NOT a good analogue for reconstructions, in much the same way that modern birds or, even further afield, mammals are also not a good analogue. Dinosaurs, as a lineage, were entirely sui generis and their only surviving non-avian reptile relatives are highly specialised aquatic predators that are very different from what we know about dinosaurs. With regards to other modern reptile groups, like squamates and testudines, they aren&#039;t all that helpful in understanding dinosaurs because they differ in fundamental ways.", "filename": "_112434394_mediaitem112434313", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 976, "h": 549, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674414997420460, "time": 1674414997, "md5": "E3h304rClKTTYRgMyhV5ng==", "fsize": 174064, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416777, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:17:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chamelons are the only type of lizard</span>", "filename": "78656_1610462814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1847, "h": 1300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674415060038119, "time": 1674415060, "md5": "SJyDErlYPZnriJsH4tj54Q==", "fsize": 1160801, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416780, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:18:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416777</a><br><a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><br>vs the skeleton", "filename": "120781153_2886762624757142_4164605624018825197_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674415122155261, "time": 1674415122, "md5": "2koPDLK0DhCChBFWRFfMdQ==", "fsize": 159155, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416786, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:22:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416611</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

Throughout the nymph stages they aren&#039;t even that bad, they just need it hot and dry in a well-ventilated cage. Once they are subadult it gets more tricky because they need a lot higher humidity and the final molts are just generally risky and ultimately involve some luck to not go badly, which is why keeping a bunch of them helps so that a mismolt doesn&#039;t completely screw you over. When I kept them I self-built netcages with branches glued to the top for better gripping during molts, that worked quite well. Breeding just didn&#039;t work out for me because I ended up with only one male, who grew faster than the females and was already a geriatric by the time they became ready to mate and he couldn&#039;t connect despite his willingness to do so.<br><br>Other empusids like Blepharopsis mendica and Gongylus gongylodes are cool alternatives that are less expensive and demanding, but somewhat similar to them.", "filename": "IMG_1249", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1815, "h": 1361, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674918435197686, "time": 1674918435, "md5": "VfEzYHp/ThB09S66oX3qyA==", "fsize": 565058, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422502, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:09:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422419</a><br>no i made the thread!<br>my thread is for cute bugs only i am racist against the scary bugs!", "time": 1674925785, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422510, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:25:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422502</a>", "filename": "3d8ea12af24b19a6827f5497d6cc2ec54701a49dr1-1024-768v2_uhq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674926722874865, "time": 1674926722, "md5": "I3XlwU7eowD7bIJxL3zFNA==", "fsize": 40559, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422747, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422445</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve seen Americans ask for like $40</span><br>Shit last time I saw them for sale they were $100 each, $40 is what I&#039;d expect for something like an orchid mantis but that would seem incredibly cheap for Idolomantis", "time": 1674952455, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422750, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:44:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422747</a><br>mantidkingdom.com sells them for $40, according to their store page they&#039;re gonna have hatches in the coming months.", "time": 1674953076, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422763, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:09:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422750</a><br>Interesting, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s where I&#039;d seen them for $100 a while back I guess they must have had more success breeding more of them since then", "time": 1674954560, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422913, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:47:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I walked around my garden and picked up insects that have been infesting my plants recently<br>I flung them into some spider webs and I saw the spiders come out of their leaf and bite them<br>Feels good man, fucking bastards deserve it", "filename": "1661690336064", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 473, "h": 366, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1674964055647611, "time": 1674964055, "md5": "j0oj/4giKn62uzVeV0FeOA==", "fsize": 20861, "resto": 4413075}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 4421896, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)16:01:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Me when I steal all the honey lole", "filename": "FB_IMG_1674852756120", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 850, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 221, "tim": 1674853313443982, "time": 1674853313, "md5": "bjFRpgZ7l9VRQLAHUzDkBQ==", "fsize": 84051, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "me-when-i-steal-all-the-honey-lole", "replies": 40, "images": 18, "unique_ips": 27}, {"no": 4421915, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)16:23:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "NOOO YOU CANT JUST TAKE ALL OF OUR HONEY WE WORKED FOR THAT YOU HECKIN&#039; DUMB IDIOT!

Medaka get the most/best colors to them in the natural sun light. <br>2. for the most part due to how they are kept in Japan they are bred to be viewed from the top and look kind of plain from the side. Less of an issue for the fancy ones im sure but I would need to look to make sure.<br>3. This one is the biggest and perhaps hardest one to overcome. Lifespans in an Aquarium that never has a cold season is shorter. The way I had it explained to me is &quot;Two people are running a 10m track, one blasts off at full speed and keeps that pace the whole time. The other Walks some, Sprints some, Goes at full speed at other times. They both have the same goal but the first one got there alot faster&quot;.

Yahweh is the amalgamation of two or more pagan deities (yahweh, who shares a name with the vedic word yahvah that was also used as an epithet for the vedic fire god - and el of the mountain). Judaism is the amalgamation of various local pagan faiths from the age that ultimately became monotheistic as the most powerful city in the region declared that their native god was supreme god and demoted the other gods to angels and demons to concentrate religious and therefore legal power. Later some cheesy fucks wrote the new testament based on a personality clt, the book of mormon of its day. Don&#039;t forget the gotchas:<br>&quot;People used to practice another religion, but now they don&#039;t because el is the only god now, so don&#039;t say we just changed our minds&quot;<br>&quot;The book is right, and it is so right that it predicts that people will say the book is wrong. If people deny the book then this is proof the book is right.&quot;<br>It has the veracity of joseph smith swearing the tablets were real, or mohammad swearing he must be divine because he beat some pagans in battle and had partially memorized the OT.<br><br>This really isn&#039;t the board to school you on how christianity emerged from canaanite paganism (which came form north india being glorified gypsies) with clear influences from the ancient vedic faith, or how the bible is essentially a corruption of the original monotheistic vedic faith that replaces the supreme divinity with the fire demon that is an aspect of him - yahvah/yahweh.

The monkeys will certainly type at random and even if they are just typing one character at a time instead of just hitting the keyboard with their hands they will never achieve more than a few words and even that is super unlikely.

Ever heard of them? That&#039;s where we came from. We simply migrated to other places and adapted. It was our brains that allowed us to migrate to and survive colder climates. We had already evolved to our current, relatively hairless, form well before then.<br><br>And finally, for other posters in this thread, religion (both modern and ancient) is entirely based around confirmation bias.

The russian military is notoriously corrupt and incompetent. The dogs are sent out without trained handlers and then the vatniks get mad and abuse them when they can&#039;t figure out how to get the dog to do what they want. if the dog is sent with a trained handler, low quality russian training (hardly any better than that of russian infantry) results in the dog not doing what they want anyways, so they abandon it. Did you really expect more from a country that can&#039;t make it even halfway through a country 1/28th its size if said tiny nation is given not technological parity, but just less of a technological disadvantage?<br><br>Ukraine does not actually consider these dogs particularly useful because a good military dog must be bred as such and trained from birth, and the abuse they suffer at the hands of the vatniks makes them incapable of fulfilling that role regardless.
