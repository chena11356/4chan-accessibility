After it&#039;s been dry for a couple of weeks/months, fill up a bowl with lukewarm water, just put your Tillandsia in there, and let it swim for a day, maybe two if it&#039;s been a long time since it last received water. After it&#039;s had a nice long bath, shake off the excess water and let it dry upside down. Repeat the process in a month or two and it&#039;ll grow just fine.

All NGOs have already experienced corporate capture and are just parroting what corporations want and all state based agencies like DNR or F&amp;W work for lobbying groups like hunters and farmers.<br><br>None of these organizations gives two shits about the environment. NGOs do when small, but once they reach a certain size they start getting all HR-y. I don&#039;t know how they are now, but the International Rhino Foundation even proposed rhino farms for horn. This is a popular midwit take because it pleases lobbyists. The members OVERWHELMINGLY said FUCK no, because they know what was up. That&#039;s just one example. I don&#039;t even think there was malice behind that decision. But once you get to a certain size, fucking Wormtongues start infiltrating your group all over the place. Eventually, once you become large enough, you&#039;re basically just a mouthpiece for neoliberals and your policies start sounding amazingly like everyone else&#039;s in corporate burgerhell.<br><br>As for ecology - that mostly doesn&#039;t exist anymore. &quot;Ecologists&quot; even in name are extremely rare these days. And most of them are midwits weened on hunter lobbyist propaganda that don&#039;t know a fucking thing about how ecosystems actually work. This is a fight I&#039;ve been fighting for literally decades and it&#039;s never going to get better so long as america exists.<br><br>Global warming is another fake issue. Anyone who has even a passing interest in the environment is obsessed with 2 fucking degrees of warming Celsius. This is idiocy. Global warming literally isn&#039;t even in the top three threats to the planet.
