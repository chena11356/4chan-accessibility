These libtards who think yelling at a dog is abuse or the over weight dykes who only let the dog out once a month for a walk and are surprised when it mangles some poor kids pug (True Story). they are the issue. I had a pit bull boxer mix as a family dog that was the biggest sweet heart. My mom tried to keep me away from her but my little toddler ass always found a way to climb over fences or unlock doors and she&#039;d find me and the dog sleeping together. In the couple years that dog lived before it died (Someone ran it over) she never once bite anyone. Some dogs will never bite people and some dogs are pure evil assholes who want to murder everything. The difference is a chihuauas bite at worst will draw blood and maybe a monster sized one will take a finger tip where as a small pit bull can tear a chunk from your calf.<br> Dogs are domesticated not civilized, They demand a certain level on respect.
