We can define &quot;fox&quot; as something like &quot;warm-blooded, medium-small quadrupedal furred omnivore with slit pupils, a long pointed muzzle, a long bushy tail, etc&quot;. Any animal that evolves into this bodytype /is/ a fox. Here&#039;s a mindfuck: genus Vulpes may not have even been the first to evolve into foxes, and certainly won&#039;t be the last. If animals evolved on other planets, some probably evolved into the fox bodytype too.<br><br>What I dislike about binomial nomenclature is how crappy many of the name choices were. Translating a dumb name choice into Latin doesn&#039;t make it smart.

Even when it&#039;s all shed their pawpads are much hairier than dogs&#039; - fur actually grows out of the edges of the pawpads.

In 1931, people gifted Mohan to a maharajah in India, and in 1958, they bred him to one of his daughters and created the first litter of white tigers born in captivity. They transported one of those cubs, Mohini, to the U.S. and gave her to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo later bred her to one of her offspring, continuing the inbred line.</span><br>https://www.worldwildlife.org/stori<wbr>es/the-truth-about-white-tigers<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Captive tiger cubs, including white tiger cubs, generate a large amount of revenue for the facilities that own them, and that funding often does not reach the field conservation projects they say that they support. Small tiger cubs are relatively easy to care for, but the constant stream of new cubs needed by many facilities for photo ops or cub handling for paying customers creates a bigger problem when they reach adulthood. Adult tigers are expensive to care for and require larger and more secure enclosures. To reduce their numbers, some captive facilities kill their tigers once they reach adulthood and sell their parts to supply the illegal tiger trade, making a profit for a second time.</span><br><br>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02<wbr>-19/white-tigers-inbred-for-beauty-<wbr>and-tourism-dollars/7182594<br>More info,", "filename": "de0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 426, "h": 364, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671417809077550, "time": 1671417809, "md5": "abFuWRGN36w0v0XMdgobjA==", "fsize": 44418, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384615, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:51:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384280</a><br>NEVER!!!", "time": 1671421895, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384627, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384144</a><br>Holy based!", "time": 1671422484, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384704, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:59:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384142</a><br>Go to Egypt and hit the tourist markets.

But then it also depends on how large the windows are and what type of glass they&#039;re made of, and the colour of your walls and even your furniture also plays a role, and so on.

Moisture is the ultimate killer of bees. Where I live most bee keepers take their bees into the interior for the winter where it is much dryer, even though it\u2019s much colder in the interior because it\u2019s drier the bees are much better off. When the bees get wet they are unable to heat up. A wet cold is very very bad. The beekeepers that keep their bees here typically have a setup to reduce as much moisture as possible from entering the hive. They do things like reducing vegetation around the hives and having a pad that is rock or concrete or anything that doesn\u2019t hold as much moisture as grass or dirt, the best is a bee house. A little shelter that has a floor that is raised off the ground a good amount and a big roof, that way there is alway a large dry perimeter around the beehives and the bee boxes don\u2019t ever get wet. Even though the bee boxes are by design to keep moisture out the second layer of defence of a bee house ensures that minimum moisture gets in and is necessary in areas where there is lots of precipitation", "time": 1670869210, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378766, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just bee yourself", "time": 1670869317, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378767, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Did they get ahold of some fentanyl?", "time": 1670869319, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378768, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Very difficult but I would avoid syrups entirely and look into biodynamic beekeeping and use smaller cap sizes to limit the amount of mites in your hive.

You know that phone in your pocket can be used to do voice calls? One of the biggest professional tips I can give all of you zoomers and maybe even fellow millennials is to pick up the damn phone. It doesn&#039;t matter even if you&#039;re working at one of the FAGMAN as software developer remotely. Guaranteed you will have a leg up on your peers if you just learned how to call people. Calling people will put them on the spot and force them to answer you immediately. It gives you immediate power over people. You could have had your question answered faster than the time it took you to sperg out and type that post. Double pro tip: in a job setting, after you&#039;ve called someone, follow up with an e-mail stating all the answers you got and CC others.

Those breed in fresh water so try breeding them and see what you get. It seems like they eat the babies so you might need to separate them. Try a setup with many different plants and see if they eat no living plants, only eat some species or eat everything. Also since they seems to eat the babies (crab was found in the stomach content in a study) they probably are not safe for dwarf shrimp. You could risk some guppies to see if they attack fish as well. There is also the chance they will be chill if well fed.<br><br>I was thinking on picking some before I researched and after researching I thought I might look for the more aquatic species first and see which one is less aggressive. Then I found different species in other countries that seems more promising so I&#039;m currently trying to figure out how the fuck I can get my hands in some exotic crabs that weren&#039;t introduced in the hobby yet. What would be the paperwork etc. I wish I had thought about that before moving to Japan. It would be easier (not easy, just easier than now) to get some species native to my country to check if they are good or not and how easy it is to breed them, then I could try to bring those to Japan, if successful I would have monopoly over a brand new cool aquarium species in a country that likes aquariums a lot. Still want to try some day. I might check with relatives and friends, maybe I can convince some of them to start a business breeding and exporting those legally and I will work as their branch in Japan.", "time": 1671532131,

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items. This guy breeds most of the mentioned species in this post (esp the Knobby Newt) and will probably have them ready in 4 to 5 months (assuming you&#039;re in North America): https://www.tritonnewts.com/availab<wbr>ility", "filename": "IMG_0930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671474788638776, "time": 1671474788, "md5": "RrpZxv+XR/hruaVr7XoARA==", "fsize": 127714, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385111, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hawaii totally forbids importing foreign reptiles</span><br>Note also that there are no native reptiles in hawaii unless you count oceanic ones like sea turtles and sea snakes.", "time": 1671474806, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385131, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br>I thought Florida only banned a handful of them like Niles, which you&#039;d never really want to own anyway", "time": 1671476090, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385157, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385131</a><br>they&#039;re working on banning literally everything right now. not joking", "time": 1671478570, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW no 1500sqf basement to turn into an ultimate animal room like Canadians and east coast people</span><br>It&#039;s not fucking fair", "time": 1671478898, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385168, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:52:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385160</a><br>Yea I&#039;ve always been butt hurt that basements aren&#039;t a thing here.

And we see them enjoying new activities they could never get to do in the wild, such as playing with other foxes and forming friendship with them (as adults), playing with toys, having personal interactions with humans, and getting restful sleep that isn&#039;t broken every time they hear a twig break nearby.<br><br>It is our moral imperative as humans to step in and create a disease-free, stress-free, paradise for foxes with free infinite food and guaranteed safety so that all kits survive into adulthood and where every fox dies of old age.", "time": 1671133140, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381416, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)14:40:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw foggers</span>", "filename": "1671130278371437", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 633, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1671133240261958, "time": 1671133240, "md5": "oumtPo9Hiwd32TkmqaBZ8A==", "fsize": 101063, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381438, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)14:53:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381416</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;femboi foxes</span>", "time": 1671134028, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381441, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)14:57:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381438</a><br>all foxes are femboys", "time": 1671134236, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381472, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:23:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Foxes are basef", "filename": "wash_foxe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 818, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671135832287885, "time": 1671135832, "md5": "TQMcIWp/N2UkL9LnOXgOSQ==", "fsize": 127089, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381637, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)19:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381416</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally a wewuz in the fox phylogenetic tree</span><br>SHIEEET", "time": 1671149176, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381642, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)19:09:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381637</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what are the otocyon and nyctereutes genuses</span>", "time": 1671149362, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381646, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)19:13:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381642</a><br>They&#039;re subvulpines<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr durr what about the grey fox</span><br>Imagine a human-like lifeform that evolved from spider monkeys", "time": 1671149637, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381661, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)19:52:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381441</a><br>is this really true? what if i want a dom daddy fox bf?", "filename": "1658118645740", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1450, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 77, "tim": 1671151978704394, "time": 1671151978, "md5": "Wvdh8R957pH5nCooOLnnSQ==", "fsize": 224842, "resto": 4380861}, {"no": 4381767, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:46:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4381661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4381661</a><br>What you want is an older fox.

They like having their coat scratched, start with the head. Making sure we had eye contact, I scratch my cheek, then scratching theirs. Took a few tries, but after that they know what is meant by scratching, and they associate this with itch removal. Got a few occasions where they would walk up to me, present their head side on, and expecting some brushing. Actively moving along to make sure the itch was found. After a while, started to remove ticks and stuck plant matter in this way. The ears are super sensitive, and provide them with communication. Getting their ears cleaned, they really love the result. Not the cleaning though.<br>Got a young stallion bro who just races up to me when he sees me, just to get his chin brushed.<br><br>There are a few nasty sides to it too, sadly. For example there is a mare with a lot of visible tumors, and when they fight, they can get quite deep scarring, or trample foals. Had a good friendship with the leading stallion going, but he got kicked in the head during a fight, and his jaw got horribly infected. The last time I saw him, he had passed away, singled out from the herd. No hoofprints but his own, leading to his final destination, deep in the woods.

If they don&#039;t want a human inbetween their hierarchy, respect that.

Start over, by letting the situation settle for a few weeks. Don&#039;t buy your way into their hearts as well, a carrot is a nice treat, but wild horses have their food. Provide them food and they&#039;ll expect that. Don&#039;t have enough or feed the wrong horse? The rest gets angry. Don&#039;t have anything after that, and they&#039;ll ignore you. Just like genuine human friendships, equine hearts can&#039;t be bought.<br>Even with something like scratches, the haremleader gets them first. After that, the stallions and the more adventurous foals. The mares with foal want to inspect you before they let their foal near you, but once you passed that, you&#039;re in the herd. If you don&#039;t, respect them. They are protective, and if they don&#039;t trust you, they will let you know that.<br><br>About breaking trust, the horses I know will at first flee. Thats in their gentle nature, but there are other responses, your herd may differ greatly. Prezwalski may react very different from mustangs, or exmoor ponies for example.<br><br>Last but not least, if you go into the wild,take some survival kit with you. A flashlight, enough water and food, and a first aid kit. If you break a leg or something, make sure you can reach for help.

Yes hormonal development is important, but their development is done after a few years, and most vets (who are a lot more aware of the risks and benefits of fixing) advise them to be fixed at less than a year old.<br><br>The hormone changes a female dog goes through is NOT the same hormone changes that let her develop healthy. After every heat cycle (twice a year) her body reacts as if it&#039;s pregnant. Her vulva swells during heat, she bleeds, she gets mood swings, they often get fidgety and aggressive, have less energy, need to pee more, and it&#039;s generally uncomfortable. After heat she&#039;ll have varying hormone changes for two months, which cause her even more discomfort. Estrogen and progesterone levels tank and soar, her uterus physically changes, all of which is not only annoying but it can be painful. After the two months of constantly feeling bad (the length of a normal dog pregnancy) her hormone levels will abruptly change to the &quot;normal&quot; levels as opposed to the gradual leveling she&#039;d experience if she were nursing pups. This whole thing is basically a &quot;crash and burn&quot; mega-PMS experience that you&#039;re forcing her through twice a year, every year, because you&#039;re worried about her going through surgery. This is actually one of the reasons why ethical dog breeding professionals will breed their dogs every year - it&#039;s easier on the female physically (if she is a good mother and pregnancy is not hard on her) to have a litter every cycle.<br><br>I&#039;m also not saying you&#039;re going to &quot;let your dog get raped&quot;, because who the hell would? They&#039;re called *unwanted* litters because they&#039;re accidental - a dog escapes the yard or house, slips their leash, you (or someone watching your dog for you) makes a mistake, etc. Don&#039;t you have your dog chipped or keep a collar on her that has your phone number on it?

Despite these advantages, the analyses of the present study suggest that neutering is associated with increased risk for certain autoimmune disorders and underscore the need for owners to consult with their veterinary practitioner prior to neutering to evaluate possible benefits and risks associated with such a procedure.</span><br>But earlier you said<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most vets are utilitarian fuckwads who think they&#039;re serving the &quot;greater good&quot; because they more less assume</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Same reason actual trained vets will want puppies neutered the day you show up with them.</span><br>So are we trusting what vets say, or are they full of shit and will lie to you for the &quot;greater good&quot;?<br><br>Now the second link is actually really interesting. I legitimately had never even heard that fixing your animal is discouraged and unpopular in Europe. I have been told by literally everyone that the only responsible thing to do with your pet (any pet, from a rabbit to a cat to a dog) was to have it fixed as soon as possible. I always delayed getting my pets fixed until they were well into adulthood, and was chastized by friends, family, and vets for this decision. I always felt that putting an animal through surgery so young, and before they were done developing, wasn&#039;t the best idea and that I could keep my animal safe for long enough to get it fixed later. I wonder why? This is most definitely a cultural thing and I&#039;m fascinated by how it happened. Though, European countries do predictably have higher rates of the aforementioned illnesses, and they have stray dogs just like the US does (there are ~200 million stray dogs in the world and half of them are in Europe). Maybe the cultural difference is that pets are common and cheap here, but in Europe they&#039;re more expensive, rare, and welfare laws are far more strict?

He loves playing tug of war and having me toss it, so he can catch it mid-air.<br><br>What I&#039;ve found with Leo is that he is really good at heeling when in familiar low distraction environments, but in new places, and when he wants to go somewhere specifi, he pulls a lot and only heels for a minute if I ask him to. I&#039;m okay with that because he&#039;s still a puppy and I don&#039;t want to go too hard on him. More practice in lots of different environments should help with that a lot as well.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;between legs</span><br>That makes perfect sense not to want him to do that. I think having commands that require lots of movement is what he likes, so maybe just teaching him to spin in both directions would be a good start, or hop on/off a platform kinda thing, or walking backwards.<br><br>The other fun alternative fetch game is &quot;stay fetch&quot;. You have him stay, for Leo I have him go between my legs, throw the ball, and have him wait and give him a release command to retrieve the ball.<br><br>Apparently normal fetch can raise a dogs cortisol levels, which is counterproductive to the exercise. He doesn&#039;t full sprint to chase the ball either. It helps train impulse control and is a more mentally stimulating version of fetch because he goes out and has to sniff and hunt for the ball.<br><br>You can practice recall simultaneously as well.", "filename": "20221218_083230", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1382, "h": 2213, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671385629758904, "time": 1671385629, "md5": "VwyF/ihk6A2Z1hQpnK1QNA==", "fsize": 864824, "resto": 4377782}, {"no": 4384208, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:07:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384139</a><br>Her mom was a red husky, her dad was a border mix.", "time": 1671386875, "resto": 4377782}, {"no": 4384224, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:28:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384190</a><br>That&#039;s really depressing", "time": 1671388132, "resto": 4377782}, {"no": 4384229, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I regularly dunk on AKC pure breeder types because their organization has been breeding their dogs for decades/centuries and struggle to have them live as long as a tame wolf.", "time": 1671388523, "resto": 4377782}, {"no": 4384235, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)13:44:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384229</a><br>Dying early equals more sales.", "time": 1671389068, "resto": 4377782}, {"no": 4384283, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)15:32:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384084</a><br>I had a somewhat similar situation.

There are exceptions - mole rats - but they&#039;re stupidly inbred. Social spiders are seemingly a hair&#039;s breath from eusociality, but again, stupid inbreeding rates.

Coloniesof a couple dozen to a couple hundred individuals, maybe a few thousand (requiring multiple gynes), building immense communal nests either in trees or as underground burrows in riverside cliffs and similar (again, bee eaters as my go-to probable candidate). Reproductive suppression would be an issue, particularly for tree-nesting species, as hormonal suppression becomes difficult, but raw aggression by the gyne is oftentimes sufficient. Burrowing species would have it easier in this regard.<br>End result is nests hosting thousands of birds with maybe a dozen gynes living along the Amazons or in the African savannah, the workers always busy containing seeds, insects, and occasionally bullying big cats and vultures off large carcasses to make off with the meat. Any animal getting too close to the nest risks being divebombed by a few dozen birds with sharp beaks, unless it&#039;s one of the trapping species that just wait for herbivores to step into one of their tunnels and then pick meat off the trapped zebra&#039;s calves.", "time": 1665689444, "resto": 4321695}, {"no": 4326093, "now": "10/13/22(Thu)17:15:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4325986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4325986</a><br>I think I&#039;ve heard birds can&#039;t be eusocial because of their sex determination? but honestly they could just be making like gamergates and sterilizing workers directly", "time": 1665695715, "resto": 4321695}, {"no": 4326596, "now": "10/14/22(Fri)06:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4326093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4326093</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think I&#039;ve heard birds can&#039;t be eusocial because of their sex determination?</span><br>Haplodiploid sex determination as a necessity for eusociality is a terrible meme.

I personally think it overuses the colonial organism trope and has way too little sealife that doesn&#039;t just fit within the human size range. However, many of the animals, like the sea wheel and the sponge that has a chain of drones wheeling through it, are legit fascinating and cool.

The only thing I didn&#039;t like was that the biosphere was way too limited.

What a cool site. Im 22 and i used to work at a local vet last year as a cashier. I mean i only got the job because my brother was an intern, nevertheless i cleaned and accommodate customers appropriately. It was my first job and i enjoyed it. The fun part is that we could smoke weed when anyone wasn&#039;t around and it felt really gratifying buying mid shelf weed with my own cash. Not only that i worked with my brother&#039;s classmates inside the clinic and their a little older and more mature.<br><br>Somewhere around the 4th month of working there i was exposed to the ugliness of that business. I became a pervert and started and we started staring at hot customers ass and stalking their social media sites. The head doctor was the biggest pervert. Whenever he or the assistant hand over the pets, they would shrug their elbows upon the breasts of hot owners. It would make their day as they have shitty wives. <br><br>After my brothers 13th month pay they left and i was the only gen z left there. The staff began to treat me differently, which is understandable. Didnt worked my way up there to begin with. So i manned up, cleaned the cages and washed the dishes did what they told despite the gaslighting im poor your rich routine. Overtime i pondered.. wtf am i doing with my life, i quit college to help my dad out with the bills for this? Fuck this 9-7pm job, fuck the weed im getting outta there. At my final months i could even sit at the receptionist, the groomer occupied it so i had to sit tat the operating table. One time the fucking groomer was so brazen he asked to take a hit at my thc vape, all the while sitting feet up at my desk. So i awoled one day after rigorously cleaning the place up being treated like a maid. Im going back to college again and enrolled to a Bs IT course. Ill make sure i wont end up like those assholes. Ill treasure my youth, go to gym and study hard for my future.

While I agree Lions are truly incredible predators, Tyrannosaurus rex is the one predatory animal that will almost always win these kinds of fights. For one, archosaurian neuronal density far exceeds that of mammals (crows and crocodiles are smarter than their EQ, encephalization quotient, would traditionally suggest). The Tyrannosaur could kill lions by walking around the arena, and be able to disorient or outright cripple vast swathes of them with movements of the legs and tail. There are no easily accessible weak points for the lions to exploit, and even if they are all black maned high-T brother lions in perfect form and 100% cooperative, there is no strategy that would grant them the upper hand except Zerg rushing the dinosaur. Dinosaurian muscles are both lighter and stronger than something like a cat or an undulate. The Tyrannosaur could stomp and swing around, biting and throwing lions for as long as it wants. The elephant comparison is fair, but ultimately incomparable. T. rex is a biped that weighs as much as the quadrupedal African elephant- a carnivorous biped whose ancestors were mostly speedy, intelligent hunters that are great at administering a specified bite. If the dinosaur in question were a carcharodontosaurid, I\u2019d be more ready to accept a lion victory. However, I believe you could muzzle the tyrannosaurus and it would claim victory over 150-200 lions.", "filename": "1953A3DA-BECC-4C57-892D-0D75F946AB84", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 576, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671328393003879, "time": 1671328393, "md5": "DXyuXfs78Le3EVm5OtsGdA==", "fsize": 76919, "resto": 4379828}, {"no": 4383815, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:31:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4383552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4383552</a><br>You think the artist was bit by a tokay?
