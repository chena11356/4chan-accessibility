Dumber animals just do what&#039;s worked before and take a while to realize it&#039;s not working, so although it takes a lot of work to get it through their tiny brains they&#039;re less likely to fuck off mid performance and see if the audience will give them food.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0<wbr>z3-iZ_TY", "time": 1670541526, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375400, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)19:33:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4375347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375347</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cats are half as intelligent as a chihuahua</span><br>stopped reading", "time": 1670546027, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375401, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)19:38:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4375400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375400</a><br>as always, the catfag fears anything that may even interfere with his reddit mindset", "time": 1670546288, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375420, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:04:26", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1669853053954984", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1152, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670547866055720, "time": 1670547866, "md5": "r9fKif00BaZq88lYR1e4DA==", "fsize": 97438, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375425, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:12:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4375420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375420</a><br>Toxoverlords, my family line is loyal to you...", "filename": "i-kneel", "ext": ".gif", "w": 498, "h": 476, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 119, "tim": 1670548324838718, "time": 1670548324, "md5": "D5iBFlwn4zODLrUwiKJdTw==", "fsize": 1231127, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375428, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:13:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4375425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375425</a><br>remember, always keep the cat near food sources at all times!", "filename": "1669839811133748", "ext": ".webm", "w": 480, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670548430366654, "time": 1670548430, "md5": "YFzQ4YezK4lUoszCoNNJyw==", "fsize": 1061325, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375429, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:14:54", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "1669542446172062", "ext": ".webm", "w": 576, "h": 720, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670548494761264, "time": 1670548494, "md5": "QIG9wEi+C9g6T1uLyPhH5A==", "fsize": 1455172, "resto": 4375331}, {"no": 4375431, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)20:21:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4375401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375401</a><br><a href=\"#p4375347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4375347</a><br>Not a cat owner, just a nerd.

As the sound grew louder, Casper knew that it was a pack of coyotes, fierce and cunning predators that would stop at nothing to snatch a meal from the sheep.<br><br>Without hesitation, Casper charged towards the coyotes, barking and growling fiercely. The coyotes, startled by Casper&#039;s boldness, hesitated for a moment before launching their attack.<br><br>Casper fought bravely, his sharp teeth and powerful jaws tearing into the coyotes&#039; fur and flesh. The battle raged on, with the coyotes snarling and snapping at Casper, and Casper baring his teeth and lashing out with his paws.<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the last of the coyotes lay dying at Casper&#039;s feet. Casper had triumphed, and the sheep were safe.<br><br>Word of Casper&#039;s bravery and valor quickly spread throughout the land, and the sheepherders praised him as a hero. Casper was hailed as a champion, and his name became known throughout the kingdom as the greatest guardian of sheep that had ever lived.<br><br>Casper lived out the rest of his days in peace, watching over the flock and defending them from any threat that dared to cross his path. And though he was no longer a young dog, his spirit and courage never wavered, for he knew that he had been chosen to protect the sheep, and he would do so until his last breath.<br><br>Thus ends the epic tale of Casper the heroic dog, who single-handedly defeated eight coyotes to defend his beloved sheep flock.

I personally think it overuses the colonial organism trope and has way too little sealife that doesn&#039;t just fit within the human size range. However, many of the animals, like the sea wheel and the sponge that has a chain of drones wheeling through it, are legit fascinating and cool.

His urethra had become mostly occluded due to the cancer, the prognosis for tumor removal on a 16yo cat with underlying kidney disease was abysmal, and the cancer was at the point where at any point in time it could grow another mm, fully obstruct his urethra and cause a ruptured bladder.

The green line depicts daily growth rates as calculated by Grady et al. (1); the orange (active growth) and black (paused growth) segments represent a finer interpretation of the growth record. Gray and white bars represent alternating years. (C) Scaling effect on conversion from annual to daily growth is magnified at higher annual growth rates and when growth takes place over the course of a decreasingly small fraction of the year. Black circles indicate daily growth rate if growth were spread evenly over ~365 days; red circles indicate daily growth rate if growth were restricted to a ~6-month period. Brown and green curves apply to the sauropod Alamosaurus and the theropod Tyrannosaurus, respectively (6). (D) Body mass versus growth rate for vertebrates, modified from Grady et al. (1).

Moisture is the ultimate killer of bees. Where I live most bee keepers take their bees into the interior for the winter where it is much dryer, even though it\u2019s much colder in the interior because it\u2019s drier the bees are much better off. When the bees get wet they are unable to heat up. A wet cold is very very bad. The beekeepers that keep their bees here typically have a setup to reduce as much moisture as possible from entering the hive. They do things like reducing vegetation around the hives and having a pad that is rock or concrete or anything that doesn\u2019t hold as much moisture as grass or dirt, the best is a bee house. A little shelter that has a floor that is raised off the ground a good amount and a big roof, that way there is alway a large dry perimeter around the beehives and the bee boxes don\u2019t ever get wet. Even though the bee boxes are by design to keep moisture out the second layer of defence of a bee house ensures that minimum moisture gets in and is necessary in areas where there is lots of precipitation", "time": 1670869210, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378766, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just bee yourself", "time": 1670869317, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378767, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Did they get ahold of some fentanyl?", "time": 1670869319, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378768, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Very difficult but I would avoid syrups entirely and look into biodynamic beekeeping and use smaller cap sizes to limit the amount of mites in your hive.

They are, in fact, the most prey driven of any dog, possibly moreso than wolves.

What a cool site. Im 22 and i used to work at a local vet last year as a cashier. I mean i only got the job because my brother was an intern, nevertheless i cleaned and accommodate customers appropriately. It was my first job and i enjoyed it. The fun part is that we could smoke weed when anyone wasn&#039;t around and it felt really gratifying buying mid shelf weed with my own cash. Not only that i worked with my brother&#039;s classmates inside the clinic and their a little older and more mature.<br><br>Somewhere around the 4th month of working there i was exposed to the ugliness of that business. I became a pervert and started and we started staring at hot customers ass and stalking their social media sites. The head doctor was the biggest pervert. Whenever he or the assistant hand over the pets, they would shrug their elbows upon the breasts of hot owners. It would make their day as they have shitty wives. <br><br>After my brothers 13th month pay they left and i was the only gen z left there. The staff began to treat me differently, which is understandable. Didnt worked my way up there to begin with. So i manned up, cleaned the cages and washed the dishes did what they told despite the gaslighting im poor your rich routine. Overtime i pondered.. wtf am i doing with my life, i quit college to help my dad out with the bills for this? Fuck this 9-7pm job, fuck the weed im getting outta there. At my final months i could even sit at the receptionist, the groomer occupied it so i had to sit tat the operating table. One time the fucking groomer was so brazen he asked to take a hit at my thc vape, all the while sitting feet up at my desk. So i awoled one day after rigorously cleaning the place up being treated like a maid. Im going back to college again and enrolled to a Bs IT course. Ill make sure i wont end up like those assholes. Ill treasure my youth, go to gym and study hard for my future.

Fish will probably eat it, shrimp will probably eat it and it will deposit on plants so I assume only a small fraction will end up consumed by the filtering shrimp.

Snails will be Clithon retropictum (japanese neritina) it isn\u2019t the most beautiful neritina but it have a long lifespan, 1 snail of other types so they won\u2019t reproduce and avoid snails that can reproduce alone. I could simplify it with only Neritinas but I like having one ramshorn snail, one japanese trapdoor snail, and one Biwamelania as special characters you see now and then.<br><br>While not self sustainable the tank will have a kind of nutrient flow. Fish waste becomes nutrient for plants and algae, algae becomes nutrient for shrimp and snails (or filtering shrimp in case of green water), Neritina babies become food for filtering shrimp and fish (negligible I think) IF the loach doesn\u2019t eat the eggs anyway and finally fish eat some of the shrimp babies. Also filtering shrimp eats own babies. I guess shrimp eat fish eggs as well.
