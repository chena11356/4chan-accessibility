I tried contacting my local animal hospital and they told me it would cost me to bring someone out there since I moved it and nuts to that.

Our cats continued to be avid mousers long into their old age. Don&#039;t over feed your animals if you want them to keep their prey drive up. Did you know a lot of dogs are very happy to receive mice as treats and will go mousing if they can catch them? Some friends had a pet husky who had to be watched around their pet rats because she would gobble them up by the gulp.
