Brain\u2013body mass ratio of cats are a bit higher than dogs. This is not a good absolute measure of intelligence, specially in extreme sizes, but is a decent measure between related species .

Based on the gravel substrate, I&#039;d guess it&#039;s the Driftwood, especially if it only started more recently (as it rots). I&#039;d recommend throwing a handful of crushed coral into the filter, or a thin layer on top of the substrate, to help balance that out, if you care about the snails and the rainbowfish in particular. You really want to try to hit 7 or close to it with that stocking, since you have soft and hard water fish together. <br><br>As for the stock, a few questions/comments:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what type of rainbow? The two-toned are likely another type of rainbowfish as well. In general you should probably bulk up both or either group, for bravery, but all the other fish might be adequate dithers. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kuhlis to 6+, ideally 10+, for bravery reasons, but don&#039;t expect miracles regardless. Get black kuhlis for best odds.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tetras to 6+, ideally 12+. Congos are big boys and, being tetras, prone to being dicks, so you want them to have enough friends to both focus on conspecifics and to not bully one individual too much.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yoyo loaches should be 6+ due to having fairly complex social hierarchies (for fish), probably the reason they&#039;re interacting at all with other fish</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;danios are best in 8+, similar to tetras they can be a little aggressive without enough friends, but they&#039;re probably the lowest priority</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chain loaches being the dwarf ones? If so, definitely up to 6+ for same reason as yoyo loaches, they&#039;re small enough you should go to 12+ imo: they have some really cool mating rituals (and the classic loach dance) you&#039;ll only see when you have a good sized group.</span><br><br>Good luck! And note the above is just my opinion, it&#039;s your tank - but I&#039;d recommend future stocking target larger groups, as you really get healthier, more active fish in a group.

Especially if you throw dirt in the mix, the extra lighting will help you plants eat up the excess nutrients before the algea. Here is a video where they set up an already established tank with dirt, but I imagine you will have a rough time relocating your fish during the process. Not sure why your pH is dropping, what&#039;s the pH of your tap? I&#039;ve heard about people losing fish because their city decided the tap water needed to be changed. Also, what plants have you been trying? I know there&#039;s quite a few that are farmed and sold emmersed, so they start to melt when they go fully underwater. That&#039;s a relatively short period and then the plant starts growing as it would under water.

You can use super glue as well, but I think it grows out the best with fishing line.

I just mention it because I used cheap topsoil instead of a good potting mix and still got a good substrate. My second go around I&#039;ve been using pic related, which I would recommend. You really want to look at what&#039;s in the bag, because I know in America the same soil can be different in Texas vs Georgia. In the actual ingredients, you want something with NO perlite and that ideally less than 60% mulch and bark. The mulch and bark are really just filler and it helps to screen them out. The perlite offers nothing in the aquarium and will float, which blows too. Most dirt will probably drop your pH a little at first because it has peat moss, but that&#039;s really not an issue. Next you&#039;ll want something with a NPK of around (0.1-0.05-0.5), but that&#039;s not a hard rule necessarily, just a good guide to keep away from the soils with ULTRA COWSHIT FERT MAXXX fertilizers. The soil in pic rel had 0.3-0.1-0.1, but I knew I was going to use a large plant load and I mineralizes the dirt which washed it out and took out some nutrients. Below is a link(replace DOT with .) for how to mineralize your dirt.

I don&#039;t want to discourage or scare you, but I personally think dirt is more work if you do it right and there&#039;s some room for error. However, I&#039;ve always felt fortune favors the bold, so no risk then no reward. That being said, the work is all front loaded so once you do it, your set. The dirt will last easily 5-7 years as well, so you want need to replace anytime soon really. The video I posted earlier shows you how to dirt an already set up tank. You will need to drain the tank as low as you can. The you want to scoop the gravel to one side, or out into a bucket, put the dirt in and cap ot back with gravel.

I have no clue why. I treat them well, give them open space, and always maintain them properly according to protocol. You would think they would be happy, healthy, and full of energy right? WRONG!!! I go out this morning to check on them. Only to find maybe 4 or 5 bees flying out of the hive while there are at least 500 fucking dead bees on the floor surrounding the hive. The queen is still there, and she looks healthy, but her workers are all fucking dead. <br>So what the fuck? Why are my bees dying?

Moisture is the ultimate killer of bees. Where I live most bee keepers take their bees into the interior for the winter where it is much dryer, even though it\u2019s much colder in the interior because it\u2019s drier the bees are much better off. When the bees get wet they are unable to heat up. A wet cold is very very bad. The beekeepers that keep their bees here typically have a setup to reduce as much moisture as possible from entering the hive. They do things like reducing vegetation around the hives and having a pad that is rock or concrete or anything that doesn\u2019t hold as much moisture as grass or dirt, the best is a bee house. A little shelter that has a floor that is raised off the ground a good amount and a big roof, that way there is alway a large dry perimeter around the beehives and the bee boxes don\u2019t ever get wet. Even though the bee boxes are by design to keep moisture out the second layer of defence of a bee house ensures that minimum moisture gets in and is necessary in areas where there is lots of precipitation", "time": 1670869210, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378766, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just bee yourself", "time": 1670869317, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378767, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:21:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Did they get ahold of some fentanyl?", "time": 1670869319, "resto": 4378747}, {"no": 4378768, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)13:23:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4378747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4378747</a><br>Very difficult but I would avoid syrups entirely and look into biodynamic beekeeping and use smaller cap sizes to limit the amount of mites in your hive.

Reproductive suppression would be an issue, particularly for tree-nesting species, as hormonal suppression becomes difficult, but raw aggression by the gyne is oftentimes sufficient. Burrowing species would have it easier in this regard.<br>End result is nests hosting thousands of birds with maybe a dozen gynes living along the Amazons or in the African savannah, the workers always busy containing seeds, insects, and occasionally bullying big cats and vultures off large carcasses to make off with the meat. Any animal getting too close to the nest risks being divebombed by a few dozen birds with sharp beaks, unless it&#039;s one of the trapping species that just wait for herbivores to step into one of their tunnels and then pick meat off the trapped zebra&#039;s calves.", "time": 1665689444, "resto": 4321695}, {"no": 4326093, "now": "10/13/22(Thu)17:15:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4325986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4325986</a><br>I think I&#039;ve heard birds can&#039;t be eusocial because of their sex determination? but honestly they could just be making like gamergates and sterilizing workers directly", "time": 1665695715, "resto": 4321695}, {"no": 4326596, "now": "10/14/22(Fri)06:34:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4326093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4326093</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think I&#039;ve heard birds can&#039;t be eusocial because of their sex determination?</span><br>Haplodiploid sex determination as a necessity for eusociality is a terrible meme.

I personally think it overuses the colonial organism trope and has way too little sealife that doesn&#039;t just fit within the human size range. However, many of the animals, like the sea wheel and the sponge that has a chain of drones wheeling through it, are legit fascinating and cool.

The only thing I didn&#039;t like was that the biosphere was way too limited.

What a cool site. Im 22 and i used to work at a local vet last year as a cashier. I mean i only got the job because my brother was an intern, nevertheless i cleaned and accommodate customers appropriately. It was my first job and i enjoyed it. The fun part is that we could smoke weed when anyone wasn&#039;t around and it felt really gratifying buying mid shelf weed with my own cash. Not only that i worked with my brother&#039;s classmates inside the clinic and their a little older and more mature.<br><br>Somewhere around the 4th month of working there i was exposed to the ugliness of that business. I became a pervert and started and we started staring at hot customers ass and stalking their social media sites. The head doctor was the biggest pervert. Whenever he or the assistant hand over the pets, they would shrug their elbows upon the breasts of hot owners. It would make their day as they have shitty wives. <br><br>After my brothers 13th month pay they left and i was the only gen z left there. The staff began to treat me differently, which is understandable. Didnt worked my way up there to begin with. So i manned up, cleaned the cages and washed the dishes did what they told despite the gaslighting im poor your rich routine. Overtime i pondered.. wtf am i doing with my life, i quit college to help my dad out with the bills for this? Fuck this 9-7pm job, fuck the weed im getting outta there. At my final months i could even sit at the receptionist, the groomer occupied it so i had to sit tat the operating table. One time the fucking groomer was so brazen he asked to take a hit at my thc vape, all the while sitting feet up at my desk. So i awoled one day after rigorously cleaning the place up being treated like a maid. Im going back to college again and enrolled to a Bs IT course. Ill make sure i wont end up like those assholes.

Yes hormonal development is important, but their development is done after a few years, and most vets (who are a lot more aware of the risks and benefits of fixing) advise them to be fixed at less than a year old.<br><br>The hormone changes a female dog goes through is NOT the same hormone changes that let her develop healthy. After every heat cycle (twice a year) her body reacts as if it&#039;s pregnant. Her vulva swells during heat, she bleeds, she gets mood swings, they often get fidgety and aggressive, have less energy, need to pee more, and it&#039;s generally uncomfortable. After heat she&#039;ll have varying hormone changes for two months, which cause her even more discomfort. Estrogen and progesterone levels tank and soar, her uterus physically changes, all of which is not only annoying but it can be painful. After the two months of constantly feeling bad (the length of a normal dog pregnancy) her hormone levels will abruptly change to the &quot;normal&quot; levels as opposed to the gradual leveling she&#039;d experience if she were nursing pups. This whole thing is basically a &quot;crash and burn&quot; mega-PMS experience that you&#039;re forcing her through twice a year, every year, because you&#039;re worried about her going through surgery. This is actually one of the reasons why ethical dog breeding professionals will breed their dogs every year - it&#039;s easier on the female physically (if she is a good mother and pregnancy is not hard on her) to have a litter every cycle.<br><br>I&#039;m also not saying you&#039;re going to &quot;let your dog get raped&quot;, because who the hell would? They&#039;re called *unwanted* litters because they&#039;re accidental - a dog escapes the yard or house, slips their leash, you (or someone watching your dog for you) makes a mistake, etc. Don&#039;t you have your dog chipped or keep a collar on her that has your phone number on it?

I legitimately had never even heard that fixing your animal is discouraged and unpopular in Europe. I have been told by literally everyone that the only responsible thing to do with your pet (any pet, from a rabbit to a cat to a dog) was to have it fixed as soon as possible. I always delayed getting my pets fixed until they were well into adulthood, and was chastized by friends, family, and vets for this decision. I always felt that putting an animal through surgery so young, and before they were done developing, wasn&#039;t the best idea and that I could keep my animal safe for long enough to get it fixed later. I wonder why? This is most definitely a cultural thing and I&#039;m fascinated by how it happened. Though, European countries do predictably have higher rates of the aforementioned illnesses, and they have stray dogs just like the US does (there are ~200 million stray dogs in the world and half of them are in Europe).

A cat, for instance, 100% knows what it&#039;s doing when it scratches or bites. They can willingly vary how retracted their claws are. My family had a cat that would only lightly scratch children and the dog, and really slice up adults. He also nearly killed a strange cat. It would be absurd to say that these animals that show problem solving abilities and brief moments of self comprehension don&#039;t know that bites and scratches hurt.<br><br>But does a dog know that if it picks a human infant up by its &quot;scruff&quot;, or by its head as some dogs will do, that this will almost certainly kill it, and be interpreted by humans as the dog biting the baby to death? Does a cat know that the bacteria transmitted in its warning scratch is enough to potentially kill a small child? No, they do not, these are things you need extensive experience with or knowledge of anatomy and germ theory to comprehend. Humans have such things, so when humans allow animals near such young and fragile children and something goes wrong the majority of the blame falls on the human.<br><br>And surely, then, a chimp knows exactly what they are doing when they rip your arm off.

The thing about &quot;conditioning&quot; is that at a level higher than pavlovian (so all operant conditioning) it requires some degree of thought and can be actively resisted, interpreted differently by an individual, or simply learned from. In fact, being able to learn through operant conditioning is a sign of higher than reptillian intelligence, while being able to resist operant conditioning and enforce your own will on the handler in such a way it&#039;s clear you&#039;ve learned and understood, but have set your own terms for cooperating is a sign of higher intelligence still. <br><br>And applying the concept of an association to as of yet unexperienced things is a sign above even higher intelligence. So a human who first learns that crying gets them attention even if they aren&#039;t hurt can figure out that being angry when they aren&#039;t will get people to go away and that they can act hungry when they aren&#039;t to get food for later. A dog can, after learning that acting anxious gets humans to come check out what&#039;s going on, fake a nap to try and get humans to pass them over.

But then it also depends on how large the windows are and what type of glass they&#039;re made of, and the colour of your walls and even your furniture also plays a role, and so on.

Here we report the discovery of basalmost grasses from the late Early Cretaceous (Albian, 113-101 Ma) of China based on microfossils (silicified epidermal pieces and phytoliths) extracted from a special structure along the dentition of a basal hadrosauroid (duck-billed dinosaur). Thus, this discovery represents the earliest known grass fossils, and is congruent with previous estimations on grass origin and early evolution calibrated by oldest known fossil grasses, highlighting the role of fossils in molecular dating. This discovery also indicates deep-diverging grasses probably gained broad distribution across both Laurasian and Gondwanan continents during the Barremian (129-125 Ma).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://academic.oup.com/nsr/artic<wbr>le/5/5/721/4769666?login=false</span>", "time": 1671125544, "resto": 4375389}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 4377335, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)04:16:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": ".", "filename": "IMG_4031", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 828, "h": 838, "tn_w": 247, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1670750187898441, "time": 1670750187, "md5": "kDOqer+TWTJY6EZHM1Oraw==", "fsize": 303070, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "", "replies": 13, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 4377364, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:13:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "le toad face", "time": 1670753629, "resto": 4377335}, {"no": 4377504, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)11:02:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 530, "h": 440, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1670774560519535, "time": 1670774560, "md5": "lVWB6rpR1GjUG8KQMA9ISw==", "fsize": 65954, "resto": 4377335}, {"no": 4377521, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)11:37:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4377335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4377335</a><br>This image perfectly illustrates the near demigod status normies place on the scientific community.

As the sound grew louder, Casper knew that it was a pack of coyotes, fierce and cunning predators that would stop at nothing to snatch a meal from the sheep.<br><br>Without hesitation, Casper charged towards the coyotes, barking and growling fiercely. The coyotes, startled by Casper&#039;s boldness, hesitated for a moment before launching their attack.<br><br>Casper fought bravely, his sharp teeth and powerful jaws tearing into the coyotes&#039; fur and flesh. The battle raged on, with the coyotes snarling and snapping at Casper, and Casper baring his teeth and lashing out with his paws.<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the last of the coyotes lay dying at Casper&#039;s feet. Casper had triumphed, and the sheep were safe.<br><br>Word of Casper&#039;s bravery and valor quickly spread throughout the land, and the sheepherders praised him as a hero. Casper was hailed as a champion, and his name became known throughout the kingdom as the greatest guardian of sheep that had ever lived.<br><br>Casper lived out the rest of his days in peace, watching over the flock and defending them from any threat that dared to cross his path. And though he was no longer a young dog, his spirit and courage never wavered, for he knew that he had been chosen to protect the sheep, and he would do so until his last breath.<br><br>Thus ends the epic tale of Casper the heroic dog, who single-handedly defeated eight coyotes to defend his beloved sheep flock.
