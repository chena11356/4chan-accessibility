For the micro fish I want white/very pale ones. For the shrimp, the darker/chocolate one will do, maybe they will blend in easier with floor. The Betta would be the daimyo of the tank, the fish his samurai, the bottom feeders peasants. Thus why I was thinking Medakas.<br>So if he decides to purge everything, it still fits the theme.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can&#039;t afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...

There&#039;s a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn&#039;t want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother&#039;s anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn&#039;t helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet.

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items. This guy breeds most of the mentioned species in this post (esp the Knobby Newt) and will probably have them ready in 4 to 5 months (assuming you&#039;re in North America): https://www.tritonnewts.com/availab<wbr>ility", "filename": "IMG_0930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671474788638776, "time": 1671474788, "md5": "RrpZxv+XR/hruaVr7XoARA==", "fsize": 127714, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385111, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hawaii totally forbids importing foreign reptiles</span><br>Note also that there are no native reptiles in hawaii unless you count oceanic ones like sea turtles and sea snakes.", "time": 1671474806, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385131, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br>I thought Florida only banned a handful of them like Niles, which you&#039;d never really want to own anyway", "time": 1671476090, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385157, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385131</a><br>they&#039;re working on banning literally everything right now. not joking", "time": 1671478570, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW no 1500sqf basement to turn into an ultimate animal room like Canadians and east coast people</span><br>It&#039;s not fucking fair", "time": 1671478898, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385168, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:52:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385160</a><br>Yea I&#039;ve always been butt hurt that basements aren&#039;t a thing here.

Pitbulls are 6% of dogs. This is a significant figure. Only hounds and labs make up a greater proportion. You don&#039;t see a lot of tibetan mastiff attacks because they&#039;re rare. For reference, ALL sled dogs are the next most popular. These are down there in bite statistics with labs so you could say a lab is half as likely to kill you as a husky. But a pitbull is over 20 times more likely.<br><br><a href=\"#p4386489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386489</a><br>German shepherds are bred for guarding. Guard dogs attack people. It&#039;s what they&#039;re bred for. Any animal can attack if it is severely abused, but guard dogs are bred to attack just because they are distrustful, afraid, or feel they own a specific piece of dirt.<br><br>However they are not so bad, being maybe 3.5% of dogs (a little over half as common) but even if pitbulls only killed 10 or 15 a year, german shepherds can only manage to kill 2. German shepherd owners are also quite shit! If we took their shock and spike collars and started cracking down on dog beating and tethering dogs outside all day, and made sure all males not doing stud services were neutered, we could get that 2/year down to 1 or 0.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all caps rant</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the fact that you don&#039;t understand that you are proving our point: all dogs bred for violence are inherently bad</span><br>Serbia&#039;s average IQ of 89.6 is starting to show through here.", "filename": "PicsArt_07-08-11.14.38", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 650, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671609762371046, "time": 1671609762, "md5": "6zFEoOiXPdo+6fM3n30Y1g==", "fsize": 247987, "resto": 4382990}, {"no": 4386494, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:04:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4386493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386493</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.5%</span><br>Oh fug 2.1.", "time": 1671609842, "resto": 4382990}, {"no": 4386497, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4386489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386489</a><br>A dog bred for dog fighting is bred for violence.<br>A dog bred for guarding is bred for violence.<br>A dog bred for hunting is bred for violence.<br><br>How this violence is triggered, and by what, is where they differ. <br><br>A fighting dog&#039;s violence is triggered when excited, and triggered by challenges and belligerence or just stress, and often includes prey drive. They can make a half assed guard dog, and the presence of prey drive means you could theoretically produce an okay herding dog or hunting hound with a few dozen generations, but the fighting dog instincts might resurface and fuck some people up. Best not to try. People have tried, it didn&#039;t go anywhere, they switched to collies and hounds instead. Fighting dogs are known for being hard to call off, otherwise they would be prone to &quot;giving up&quot; and trying to save their own skin.<br><br>A guard dog&#039;s violence is triggered by insecurity. A wolf&#039;s instinct to protect what is its own is heightened and put on a hair trigger with the brakes nerfed. When something is getting to close to what the dog thinks belongs to it, including its owner, it attacks, and it takes training to be able to call them off.<br><br>A hunting dog&#039;s violence is highly refined and is meant to be only triggered by prey animals. These are extremely unlikely to hurt humans, and when they do, it&#039;s not always prey drive, but just generic dog shit, like an abusive owner turning them mean, or a neglectful owner giving a dog a chance to knock over a crib or try and pick up a human &quot;puppy&quot; (breaks the neck without exception). Starting shit with anything other than a small, edible animal is considered a cull-worthy fault. And by cull I mean a club to the head.

Surprise surprise that she didnt get them fixed or anything so now we have two 3 week year old incest born kittens. Last night me and my mother came to visit her. she lives with her son in an apartment complex that shes already struggling to pay rent for. (her \u201cfianc\u00e9 \u201c is dying of cancer rn or something). So right off the bat you can tell she is not financially capable of raising a cat, Nevermind two grown adults and two kittens. The mom is borderline skinny and very nervous, which makes me think that she is physical with her in particular. My sister has a stupid thing of picking favorites with animals. Besides all that, they all have fleas. ALL of them. Even the kittens, which brings me to this morning:<br><br>I found the kitten on the right dead. Last night the thing was so weak, barely got up like its sister and i didnt see it suck milk from its mom once. Chances are he was very sick. My sister requested i take it to the garbage immediately to make sure it doesnt \u201cstink the place up\u201d. Fucking piece of shit\u2026 after that i was inspecting the other kitten, its belly is literally filled with fleas. I cant imagine how much pain the poor thing is under, and i cant help but feel like these blood sucking fuckers killed the other.<br><br>My sister is a poor fag (as i said before) and is too retarded to take the poor thing to the vet. I cant take it unfortunately Because my cat hates other cats.

Even when it&#039;s all shed their pawpads are much hairier than dogs&#039; - fur actually grows out of the edges of the pawpads.

In 1931, people gifted Mohan to a maharajah in India, and in 1958, they bred him to one of his daughters and created the first litter of white tigers born in captivity. They transported one of those cubs, Mohini, to the U.S. and gave her to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo later bred her to one of her offspring, continuing the inbred line.</span><br>https://www.worldwildlife.org/stori<wbr>es/the-truth-about-white-tigers<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Captive tiger cubs, including white tiger cubs, generate a large amount of revenue for the facilities that own them, and that funding often does not reach the field conservation projects they say that they support. Small tiger cubs are relatively easy to care for, but the constant stream of new cubs needed by many facilities for photo ops or cub handling for paying customers creates a bigger problem when they reach adulthood. Adult tigers are expensive to care for and require larger and more secure enclosures. To reduce their numbers, some captive facilities kill their tigers once they reach adulthood and sell their parts to supply the illegal tiger trade, making a profit for a second time.</span><br><br>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02<wbr>-19/white-tigers-inbred-for-beauty-<wbr>and-tourism-dollars/7182594<br>More info,", "filename": "de0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 426, "h": 364, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671417809077550, "time": 1671417809, "md5": "abFuWRGN36w0v0XMdgobjA==", "fsize": 44418, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384615, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:51:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384280</a><br>NEVER!!!", "time": 1671421895, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384627, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384144</a><br>Holy based!", "time": 1671422484, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384704, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:59:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384142</a><br>Go to Egypt and hit the tourist markets.

Fast forward to today. We have been together for just over 12 years now. We noticed that he has been getting a little skinnier, and chalked it up to age. The other day, my boy collapsed a little, brought himself up on shaky legs and defecated at the same time, involuntarily without squatting position.<br><br>When I took him to the vet, we discovered he had a tumor on his spleen. The ultrasound, however, found no evidence of fluid and found no evidence of metastasis. My dog was otherwise given a grade of flying colors-- completely healthy at 12.5 years, except for having cancer. When I took him home, he has seemed to recover more slowly than ever from the light sedation used for the xray and ultrasound.<br><br>At this time we are electing for surgery. But since he already collapsed...I fear a bleeding hemangiosarcoma. The doctor said that absence of fluid on MRI might simply mean that the collapse/mini stroke/seizure was an effect of the blood pressure consequences of having the clementine-sized tumor.<br><br>If he had a hemangiosarcoma, that means if he survives the operation, he will be with us for 20 to 80 days. For a large part/all of his time left alive he will have a cone collar which he dislikes but is very comfortable with. If the tumor is not a hemangiosarcoma, he could potentially become an extremely old man and live 1-3 years. As it stands, for a 50 pound dog, he has reached his natural lifespan.<br><br>I feel like I might be making the wrong decision. I don&#039;t know. He even did &quot;marchy feet&quot; today when I came home from the store-- what we call &quot;tippy taps&quot;. He has wanted to eat, begs for treats voraciously, wants to go outside and walk, barks at cars outside.

At one time clocking in at eighty-five kilograms, or 187 pounds, when attempts to help him shed the weight began he was too big to even be exercised. Also cursed with blood-shot eyes that bulged out of his head due to high blood pressure and fatty tissue around his head, Samson\u2019s life seems to have been a complete struggle. An animal that we can\u2019t find any reliable updates on, we can\u2019t tell you that he is back up on his feet and doing well, unfortunately.

Said to have weighed almost twenty-one stone at one point, or 294 pounds, he was seven years old at that time. Losing a third of his size , nearly one-hundred pounds, by the time he turned eleven, he was still big enough that he was able to take part in the Pet Fit Club. When you are a dog that drops that many pounds from your frame and you still qualify for a program for obese animals it is abundantly clear that being called fat is an understatement. According to his companion, Leslie McCormack, at one time he would eat five tins of dog food a day, which can only be called insane but has since been able to slowly decrease that to a single tin.

A dog that was once 180 pounds of fat, fur and flesh, the fact that more than half of the body he once possessed has disappeared is something worth celebrating.

But then it also depends on how large the windows are and what type of glass they&#039;re made of, and the colour of your walls and even your furniture also plays a role, and so on.
