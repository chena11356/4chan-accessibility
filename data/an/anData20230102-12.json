There has NEVER been any evidence that all vertebrates have nostrils as far down and forward as will fit on the face. This is some shit one retard made up and now everyone follows.<br>- Put Theropod hands on backwards. ALL Archosaurs appear to have positioned their hands at roughly a 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 angle to forward. Crocodilians do this now and quadrupedal Dinosaur footprints also show this. This belief that &quot;Theropods couldn&#039;t pronate their hands&quot; comes from a basic misunderstanding about how the carpals are attached to the radius and ulna in Archosaurs. Carpenter WRONGLY just assumed the radius and ulna would lie in the same plane as the carpals and phalanges. A quick look at how Crocodilian hands are constructed shows this is wrong. They are twisted at an angle that puts the hands much more pronated in orientation than supinated.<br>- Cover everything in feathers. Everything.<br>- Always get the feet wrong. Every time.<br>- Make the dinosaur fat.<br>- Add all sorts of balloon shit and other nonsense. While theoretically possible, even among birds, the number of species that have this shit is the minority, and it&#039;s even less so for modern reptiles, so it&#039;s pretty unlikely for anything other than perhaps dewlaps to be present on dinosaurs - and even suspected dewlaps on Hadrosaurs have been proven to be a taphonimic misidentification (the &quot;cockscomb&quot; on Edmontosaurus regalis is likely also wrong for the same reason - skin just slipped off the corpse).<br>- Orient the neck incorrectly &quot;because the bones lie that way naturally&quot; despite basically no animal really doing this.

But if you raise these animals just for food, it&#039;s inherently wasteful, not only because of the extremely high cost of raising them relative to how little you get back, but because they have other functions in agriculture even without special breeding or training.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cascading effects of the value system and how it interfaces with the average humans behavior</span><br>Will people be more callous about killing your pets? will they even eat them and mock you for caring?

They need somewhere to perch with a reasonably big space that\u2019s free of wind/rain/sun. They also love yards of grass to peck, just make sure there\u2019s nothing sharp they could eat. <br>Chickens mostly eat grains, they are omnivores though and will eat anything even meat. However their digestion suffers if they eat non-dense food such as bread, which you can solve by soaking. Young chickens should have medicated food to build up their immunity. You should also mix calcium in their food such as broken eggshells, calcium is very important to their diets and they can become egg bound and die without it. If they start molting feathers you should feed a high protein diet such as cat food.<br>They need pavement or stones to grind their beaks and nails on, otherwise you\u2019ll have to clip them once in a while.<br>If you live in freezing climate you\u2019ll need to figure out water. <br>They also need a supply of grit, this is literally just smooth gravel.

There\u2019s also a small chance the hens you buy at the local tractor supply will have a rooster, since its difficult to tell at a young age. I really doubt these ordinances are ever enforced though.<br>Incubation is necessary if the chicks are separated from their mothers.

One day the sister managed to knead a hole in a window screen and jumped from the ledge to the tree to the ground and promptly ran into the street and was struck and killed... The brother cat just shut down when sister didn&#039;t come home. Spent the first night and next day yowling, the second half of day two and then all of night two searching, meowing everywhere inquisitively, then the third day trying to get outside despite never having been outside. By day 4 he was visibly weak because he hadn&#039;t been eating or drinking at all despite me trying to lead him to his food many times so he was laying around more than he was searching around. I took him to the emergency vet who said he was &quot;fine&quot; but showed signs of shutting down from his 4-day fast. Recommended me to try my best to feed and comfort him. Took him home and he just stayed where I placed him in his bed, would meow longingly when I would pet him. I took him from his bed and into mine where he would have more room and fed him with one of those cat treat lick things and gave water with a baster. He refused pretty much all of it but took a little from a couple licks but he kept his mouth closed for the water. Tried again in the morning but same thing. Throughout day 5 I tried many times to drip water carefully from the baster and entice him to drink but he would meow in his longing way and turn his head, with a lot of effort. It looked like it was hurting him. At the very very end, he did lick a few drops of water though. So sadly, I think he was gradually leaving his manic &quot;sister gone&quot; state and rediscovered some want to live, but it was too late. He did not survive the night despite my efforts. He basically just went to sleep and died at the end. I think it&#039;s good for them to have bonds because it greatly enriches the cat&#039;s lives but from my experience if they bond they can&#039;t live alone.", "time": 1672444966, "resto": 4394323}, {"no": 4395050, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:13:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are cats a bad pet for a first time pet owner?", "time": 1672445616, "resto": 4394323}, {"no": 4395081, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:36:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4395045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4395045</a><br>Damn, this is the sort of thing I&#039;m afraid of happening, I&#039;ll have to think on it a bit more seriously.

Always calm, very independent, relatively indifferent to affection. I later made the decision to adopt a pair of sisters, being informed by my previous experiences. I really do believe that cats and other animals can benefit from being around a same species friend and it shows in the cats I have now. Always together, always playing or watching the other play, sharing food, sharing windows, they deeply value affection, they desire closeness, that kind of thing. I know they&#039;re developing a terminal bond but I don&#039;t intend on them being separated or being in danger of being separated.

He\u2019s skinny, missing one eye, some of his teeth have fallen off, he has a bit of yellow mucus on his nose, he makes noise when he breathes and he seems to not be able to clean himself properly anymore. He keeps following me around, sitting in front of me and staring at me like on the pic. He\u2019s an outside cat so he doesn\u2019t need me to let him poop or something. When I give him food he eats a little then stops and continues staring at me or sometimes just ignores the food altogether. If i squat and get my hand close to him he smells it and starts rubbing his face against it. I scratch/pet him for a while but he keeps leaving for a second or two then coming back. How can I help him? Does he just want scratches? They have taken him to the vet and the vet said he can\u2019t help him.<br>A little context: he\u2019s not my cat but I\u2019ve been visiting his owners (part of my family) for as long as he\u2019s been here. He randomly came here when he was very young and he\u2019s been staying around the house eversince. He was very scared of humans at first but I was the first one to try to get close to him and he ended up being a very sweet cat. He\u2019s such a gentle soul that when the other cats were hunting he just laid there in the sun enjoying nature. So even though he\u2019s not my cat i was his first human friend and we\u2019ve been friends for almost 2 decades. Last year he stopped eating for a while. I came here and stayed with him \u201cforcing\u201d him to eat and handfeeding him until he got better. It was almost like he ate to make me happy. He would look at me everytime he took a bite.

It&#039;s not popular, and it&#039;s banned in the most populated prefectures, but it&#039;s totally above-board. There isn&#039;t a lot of good info in English. Some people say the dogs only fight until one yelps or gives up, which sounds more humane, but fight dogs are bred for &quot;gameness&quot; above anything else. Which is basically the temperament to never, ever give up even if half their face is hanging off and they&#039;re on the edge of death. I would be surprised if Japanese dogmen are any different from western ones. My guess is they breed game dogs too. I&#039;ve read a handful of first hand accounts that say Japanese dog fighting is just as bloody as you&#039;d expect.

I currently have a 3 or 4 gallon jar that was an experiment using old fish poopy substrate, It turned into a grey bacteria infested mess of an unfiltered jar. I have had shrimp in it for ~4 months now, did take a few losses but they&#039;re breeding in there now. I have multiple smaller, sub 1 gallon jars and vases with neocaridinas with no filter that they do fine in, they don&#039;t tend to breed in these setups because I don&#039;t really feed them in there to keep nitrogenous waste extremely low but I figure if they survive about a year or two it&#039;s fine since that&#039;s a typical lifespan for an individual shrimp. I have had neocaridina shrimp in everything from 64 degree sub-6 pH, low mineral water to low 80 degree water around 8pH and they have succeeded in breeding and establishing in all of it. <br><br>The main parameters you need to worry about are nitrites, ammonia and nitrates, nitrates should be below the 3 digit range, I notice much shorter lifespans on them in my tanks I keep &#039;dirtier&#039; to feed plants. Also if you have toxic metals in your water it can be bad, if those tanks were galvanized for example they would kill 100% of shrimp. But people also told me copper pipes were a problem and they haven&#039;t been, even filling with water that has been sitting in the pipes for awhile. <br><br>As for temp, they&#039;re good from just about freezing to the low 30s celcius They do best around room temperature. Warmer water will increase breeding but reduce lifespan and also tends to reduce the max size of your shrimp.

Danios and tetras are both relatively slim bodied schooling fish. They fill a similar niche aesthetically and will hang out in the same areas of the tank so the visual effect isn&#039;t as good as just having more of one fish of that type. <br>But ultimately that&#039;s a matter of opinion, as long as you&#039;re putting in groups of 6 or more for the most part anything goes (exception for some of the meaner tetras and barbs which should be in bigger groups, the bigger your group is the more aggression will be diffused). <br><br>Platys aren&#039;t schooling fish but they are very personable and have thicker bodies. Most livebearers in general are very outgoing and will come hang out and beg for food. They&#039;re a good contrast to schooling fish which are mostly kind of doing their own thing darting back and forth around the tank. If you want a fun and simple/beginner friendly tank you honestly can&#039;t go wrong with platys. The one thing is bettas/gouramis GENERALLY do not like livebearers, while they generally tolerate stuff like tetras, minnows or danios. Think it has to do with the shape and color.

Whether or not the term pit bull is used as an umbrella term, which is perfectly legitimate in American English, it changes nothing. BSL should and usually does target all breeds historically used for bull baiting, fighting, and guard dog duty. These breeds are effectively weapons, and were never intended to live anywhere with moderate population density. They were caged 80% of their lives because the men who bred these dogs originally understood their purpose. Only idiot pit mommies and Serbians are confused about this. Ironically, the retarded hicks who still fight dogs in the backwoods are more responsible and sane owners. <br><br>Pit bulls are discussed most frequently in America because our country has a history of dog fighting. Guard dogs are probably more dangerous, but there&#039;s not a million cane corsos with behavioral problems in American shelters, there&#039;s a million pit bulls.

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items. This guy breeds most of the mentioned species in this post (esp the Knobby Newt) and will probably have them ready in 4 to 5 months (assuming you&#039;re in North America): https://www.tritonnewts.com/availab<wbr>ility", "filename": "IMG_0930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671474788638776, "time": 1671474788, "md5": "RrpZxv+XR/hruaVr7XoARA==", "fsize": 127714, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385111, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hawaii totally forbids importing foreign reptiles</span><br>Note also that there are no native reptiles in hawaii unless you count oceanic ones like sea turtles and sea snakes.", "time": 1671474806, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385131, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br>I thought Florida only banned a handful of them like Niles, which you&#039;d never really want to own anyway", "time": 1671476090, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385157, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385131</a><br>they&#039;re working on banning literally everything right now. not joking", "time": 1671478570, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW no 1500sqf basement to turn into an ultimate animal room like Canadians and east coast people</span><br>It&#039;s not fucking fair", "time": 1671478898, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385168, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:52:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385160</a><br>Yea I&#039;ve always been butt hurt that basements aren&#039;t a thing here.

Until we have perfect genetic engineering and/or virtual reality brain uploading so you can escape your shitty life/body, euthanasia is our best option for the truly unfortunate.

I agree that euthanasia would make this problem more severe. But it&#039;s probably worth the risk. Our attitude is already changing on the mentally disabled.

The issue is that disabled people essentially disable the entire family if they aren&#039;t capable of independence.

I&#039;ve heard of trading one toy for another to get the dog used to giving up a toy, and then trading for treats or food and progressing to just taking the toy and giving it back.

I&#039;ve seen a lot of people decorate their enclosures but I&#039;m really cautious about what&#039;s safe and what isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t really like how the standard for this is just skulls or other cliche morbid shit. I saw this black replica of the Rosetta Stone for sale and I thought it could look great in there, then I thought I could have this kind of stone platform structure and have the enclosure look something like the final room of a dungeon, or a sacrificial cult chamber or something. I could build two little semicircular holes in the platform and keep the underneath hollow, with substrate sloping up to encourage it to burrow in. Plus I was gonna put spiderwood at the back reaching in to make it look like an ancient tree has burst through the brickwork. Pic related is a little design I mocked up, just to give you an idea of what I see.<br><br>Do you think this would be appropriate for a GBB?

Besides all that, they all have fleas. ALL of them. Even the kittens, which brings me to this morning:<br><br>I found the kitten on the right dead.

Fucking piece of shit\u2026 after that i was inspecting the other kitten, its belly is literally filled with fleas.
