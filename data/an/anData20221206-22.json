Casper was the guardian of a flock of sheep that roamed the rolling hills and green pastures of the countryside.<br><br>One day, as Casper was patrolling the perimeter of the sheep&#039;s grazing grounds, he heard a faint yipping in the distance. As the sound grew louder, Casper knew that it was a pack of coyotes, fierce and cunning predators that would stop at nothing to snatch a meal from the sheep.<br><br>Without hesitation, Casper charged towards the coyotes, barking and growling fiercely. The coyotes, startled by Casper&#039;s boldness, hesitated for a moment before launching their attack.<br><br>Casper fought bravely, his sharp teeth and powerful jaws tearing into the coyotes&#039; fur and flesh. The battle raged on, with the coyotes snarling and snapping at Casper, and Casper baring his teeth and lashing out with his paws.<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the last of the coyotes lay dying at Casper&#039;s feet. Casper had triumphed, and the sheep were safe.<br><br>Word of Casper&#039;s bravery and valor quickly spread throughout the land, and the sheepherders praised him as a hero. Casper was hailed as a champion, and his name became known throughout the kingdom as the greatest guardian of sheep that had ever lived.<br><br>Casper lived out the rest of his days in peace, watching over the flock and defending them from any threat that dared to cross his path. And though he was no longer a young dog, his spirit and courage never wavered, for he knew that he had been chosen to protect the sheep, and he would do so until his last breath.<br><br>Thus ends the epic tale of Casper the heroic dog, who single-handedly defeated eight coyotes to defend his beloved sheep flock. Though he may have been just a humble dog, he will forever be remembered as a true hero, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.", "time": 1670343583, "resto": 4373266}], "last_modified": 1670343583}, {"no": 4372295, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:13:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ya know, penguins would actually thrive in the northern hemisphere if we gave them a chance.<br><br>See<br>No predators, only humans now", "filename": "1611864507369", "ext": ".png", "w": 400, "h": 365, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 228, "tim": 1670242389554470, "time": 1670242389, "md5": "aOm0avj59vVPe9r08QMZXA==", "fsize": 109583, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ya-know-penguins-would-actually-thrive-in-the", "replies": 8, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 3, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 4372738, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)18:50:37", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "image", "ext": ".png", "w": 338, "h": 298, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 110, "tim": 1670284237515653, "time": 1670284237, "md5": "OvsmcciobgbjRp+L3c7Cxw==", "fsize": 172610, "resto": 4372295}, {"no": 4372852, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)21:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4372295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4372295</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No predators</span><br>This half ton of fuck-you says &quot;Hello!&quot;", "filename": "polar bear", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1670292387012827, "time": 1670292387, "md5": "c/gok6L+Q33IWET/MN2SYg==", "fsize": 1272770, "resto": 4372295}, {"no": 4373002, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)01:57:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s with the knockoff bobo, chud?", "filename": "bobo-standard-face", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 1244, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 107, "tim": 1670309872577222, "time": 1670309872, "md5": "3YGrr7IpqRls6c994JwHHg==", "fsize": 288275, "resto": 4372295}, {"no": 4373160, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)07:56:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4372852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4372852</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;barely even exists in the northen hemisphere</span><br>Like I said, you could pretty much have penguins everywhere from Africa, America to Greenland, Scandinavia, Iceland, so on and so forth.", "time": 1670331389, "resto": 4372295}, {"no": 4373283, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)11:05:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4372295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4372295</a><br>I&#039;d pay for the introduction of penguins in the arctic circle just to see what happens", "time": 1670342709, "resto": 4372295}], "last_modified": 1670342709}, {"no": 4369902, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)09:57:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "dogs dont smile you fucking retards<br>stop saying &quot;oh my le hecking doggo pupperino furbaby le smiled at me today!&quot;<br>its fucking retarded", "filename": "1654206498228", "ext": ".png", "w": 1228, "h": 2484, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669993079147305, "time": 1669993079, "md5": "fTcekAvuvo6Ek4jF/VvDjg==", "fsize": 455943, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dogs-dont-smile-you-fucking-retards", "replies": 18, "images": 5, "omitted_posts": 13, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 4370452, "now": "12/02/22(Fri)23:27:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4370424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4370424</a><br>Read it.
