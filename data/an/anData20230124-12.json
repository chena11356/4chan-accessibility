There isn&#039;t a fundamental biological rule that states that &#039;reptiles don&#039;t have fat&#039;, because, conversely, they do. They don&#039;t have the same level of extensive fat deposits that mammals have because A) modern reptiles are generally smaller so require less on demand energy and B) surviving reptile taxa are all ectotherms, meaning they can&#039;t survive on burning their own calories alone, they need to warm themselves with the sun. Most of their fat deposits are for reproductive purposes primarily. However, we now know it&#039;s unlikely that a purely ectothermic regulation method could&#039;ve supported the metabolic rates of most dinosaurs, which were generally larger than modern reptiles, more active, and grew a lot faster. They had four-chambered hearts (all modern reptiles except for crocodiles have 3 chambers, crocodiles require 4 chambers because they are aquatic and probably inherited it from archosaur ancestors), likely a sustained aerobic metabolism (indicated by chambered air sacs), and ecologies that do not reflect ectothermic lifestyles (the ratio of the total mass of predators to prey in dinosaur communities was much more like that of modern and recent warm-blooded communities than that of recent or fossil cold-blooded communities.) <br>They were either wholly warm-blooded endotherms like their modern bird descendants, or they had intermediate mesotherm metabolisms somewhere between full ectothermy or full endothermy, perhaps with different lineages covering different types of metabolism.", "filename": "mesotherms", "ext": ".png", "w": 1284, "h": 944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1674414734563651, "time": 1674414734, "md5": "b0+iUWOkYm1uHC9FX84VGQ==", "fsize": 365327, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416774, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><a href=\"#p4416761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416761</a><br><br>Whatever the combination, the evidence shows that many dinosaurs were homeotherms and could independently maintain body temperature and metabolism in a way that modern reptiles can&#039;t. Now, if they were indeed endotherms, then they might have a different relationship with their adipose deposits than modern reptiles do, ie they might require them to maintain a high metabolic rate.<br>You don&#039;t have to undo the entire Dinosaur Renaissance just because you hate modern paleoart. It&#039;s very much the case that there&#039;s a lot of retarded stuff out there but that doesn&#039;t bring us back to the conclusion that dinosaurs were just &#039;muh big lizards&#039;. They were a lineage of reptiles that developed a collection of traits that made them wholly different from other reptile groups, including modern taxa. That&#039;s why they were so SUCCESSFUL for 165 million years, because these adaptions allowed them to dominate Triassic ecosystems in a way that other archosaurs or lepidosaurs or just other diapsid reptiles weren&#039;t capable of doing. Which is why their only surviving descendants, birds, are so totally different from any other line of reptiles.<br>Just admit this modern paleoart rubs you up the wrong way because you think it looks retarded. There&#039;s no shame in that, I&#039;d agree with you on a lot of it. But that doesn&#039;t justify trying to ignore some of the very unique things we know about dinosaurs that means that modern reptiles are NOT a good analogue for reconstructions, in much the same way that modern birds or, even further afield, mammals are also not a good analogue. Dinosaurs, as a lineage, were entirely sui generis and their only surviving non-avian reptile relatives are highly specialised aquatic predators that are very different from what we know about dinosaurs. With regards to other modern reptile groups, like squamates and testudines, they aren&#039;t all that helpful in understanding dinosaurs because they differ in fundamental ways.", "filename": "_112434394_mediaitem112434313", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 976, "h": 549, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674414997420460, "time": 1674414997, "md5": "E3h304rClKTTYRgMyhV5ng==", "fsize": 174064, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416777, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:17:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chamelons are the only type of lizard</span>", "filename": "78656_1610462814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1847, "h": 1300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1674415060038119, "time": 1674415060, "md5": "SJyDErlYPZnriJsH4tj54Q==", "fsize": 1160801, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416780, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:18:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416777</a><br><a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><br>vs the skeleton", "filename": "120781153_2886762624757142_4164605624018825197_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1536, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674415122155261, "time": 1674415122, "md5": "2koPDLK0DhCChBFWRFfMdQ==", "fsize": 159155, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416786, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:22:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416611</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

I dokn&#039;t know if it&#039;s entirely a digitigrade feature, Canines have the most wonderful bounce to their walk whereas Cats (big and small) look like they&#039;re almost lugging their limbs as they go (reminiscent of Great Apes). I must&#039;ve done Inari knows how many hours worth of staring at Dogs walking ahead of me. Just observing that mesmerizing bounce. I dokn&#039;t need videos, I dokn&#039;t even need to close my eyes; at any given second I can just simply begin to imagine a Dog walking and it&#039;s so real I could reach in and pet hir. My favourite is when it&#039;s a large(r) Dog, like a GSD, Husky, Rottweiler, Dobie, Lab, Shibe...

Though sons always leave their parents, sometimes daughters won&#039;t mate and will continue to live near their parents, sometimes helping them raise their next litter.<br><br>Oh, and biologically-related foxes can be friendly and have dens next to each other, there&#039;s a cute photo series of two fox familes who live together here: here https://dakotareflections.com/dakot<wbr>a%20region/red%20fox.html", "filename": "16779387493_ae2626bd3b_5k", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5119, "h": 3517, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1674420385675286, "time": 1674420385, "md5": "3SO4+NmYehJgauASouMCcQ==", "fsize": 1936005, "resto": 4407117}, {"no": 4416904, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:11:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416832</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vulpes vulpes schrencki) that has retained their sox</span><br>That&#039;s a northern species that lives where there&#039;s significant snow in the winter.

There is no special mechanism, it is that simple. This is why god tells you very clearly which animals you may eat, and how you may eat them, and how you are to treat animals. There are no contradictions, nothing said by an apostle changes a prior passage. All covenants remain in effect. God did not say &quot;go forth and pick through the word for new meanings&quot; nor &quot;go forth and find an excuse&quot;. That is another form of heresy.

Later in the summer when those species withered, the field was overtaken by sweet clover and regular clover making the meadow quite dull. In 2022 the meadow was all daisies, sweet clover and clover.

And by popular I mean the only animals that most people will keep just for company, without being some weirdo outlier. Everything else was a tool or food, closer to a car or a fruit tree than a friend.

Yahweh is the amalgamation of two or more pagan deities (yahweh, who shares a name with the vedic word yahvah that was also used as an epithet for the vedic fire god - and el of the mountain). Judaism is the amalgamation of various local pagan faiths from the age that ultimately became monotheistic as the most powerful city in the region declared that their native god was supreme god and demoted the other gods to angels and demons to concentrate religious and therefore legal power. Later some cheesy fucks wrote the new testament based on a personality clt, the book of mormon of its day. Don&#039;t forget the gotchas:<br>&quot;People used to practice another religion, but now they don&#039;t because el is the only god now, so don&#039;t say we just changed our minds&quot;<br>&quot;The book is right, and it is so right that it predicts that people will say the book is wrong. If people deny the book then this is proof the book is right.&quot;<br>It has the veracity of joseph smith swearing the tablets were real, or mohammad swearing he must be divine because he beat some pagans in battle and had partially memorized the OT.<br><br>This really isn&#039;t the board to school you on how christianity emerged from canaanite paganism (which came form north india being glorified gypsies) with clear influences from the ancient vedic faith, or how the bible is essentially a corruption of the original monotheistic vedic faith that replaces the supreme divinity with the fire demon that is an aspect of him - yahvah/yahweh.

The monkeys will certainly type at random and even if they are just typing one character at a time instead of just hitting the keyboard with their hands they will never achieve more than a few words and even that is super unlikely.

Oftentimes the trap breaks the lower spine, not the neck and causes the little vermin a great deal of pain before it finally dies. It is absolutely necessary to kill them as soon as you can, and in my mind, if you must kill, do it quickly and cleanly as you can. If you can see one, there are probably several you don&#039;t see, so keep setting traps until it&#039;s been days since you got one. Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can. If you hesitate or show mercy, not only will they fuck your world, you will end up having to kill far far more of them in the future. I am listening to rat scratches in the ceiling right now. I didn&#039;t have the heart to kill a rat, and now I&#039;ve been killing scores of it&#039;s descendants every week for the past six months. The whole property is lousy with them.

At one end of each of the semicircular canals is a dilated sac called an osseous ampulla, which is more than twice the diameter of the canal. Each ampulla contains an ampullary crest, the crista ampullaris which consists of a thick gelatinous cap called a cupula and many hair cells. The superior and posterior semicircular canals are oriented vertically at right angles to each other. The lateral semicircular canal is about a 30-degree angle from the horizontal plane. The orientations of the canals cause a different canal to be stimulated by movement of the head in different planes, and more than one canal is stimulated at once if the movement is off those planes. The lateral canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down.[1] When the head changes position, the endolymph in the canals lags behind due to inertia and this acts on the cupula which bends the cilia of the hair cells. The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place. The ampullae open into the vestibule by five orifices, one of the apertures being common to two of the canals.<br><br>Among species of mammals, the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion. Specifically, species that are agile and have fast, jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously.[2]", "time": 1674005871, "resto": 4400632}, {"no": 4412424, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:33:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4412313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4412313</a><br>Oh, so it&#039;s a turbo encabulator.", "time": 1674012793, "resto": 4400632}, {"no": 4412429, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:35:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4412424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4412424</a><br>yes.<br><br>it&#039;s an organ so absurdly perfect for its purpose that it could never have evolved by chance.

I&#039;ve got a buddy with a 10 gallon full of dwarf sag and a big Amazon sword that runs amazingly. He&#039;s got it by a window to catch some sun, but also has a cheap LED. He does irregular water changes too, and not exactly big water changes either. It&#039;s stocked with some of his cull platys and a khuli, so he only runs a small sponge filter. Very simple but very low maintenance tank. I&#039;ve never seen algea in it or heard of many problems with it. He always talks about taking it down, but I convince him not too because he doesn&#039;t put any real time or effort to maintain it. Really about the balance of everything together that makes it so easy. Once you start getting high tech or premium stuff, you need to adjust to compensate for the extra &#039;quality&#039;. Like if you get a nicer light, it will be much brighter and probably cause more algea if your plants aren&#039;t bumping. You might even need to start fertilizers because your plants are eating all your nutrients and stalling or choking out slower plants. Adding ferts means you&#039;ll probably need better flow, so either a better filter or power head....you see how this can snowball from low tech ten gallon to a high tech 40 breeder pretty quick.

Personally I like sicce filters but they&#039;re kinda pricey, the air-powered moving bed filters are great, or depending on stock a sponge filter or similar small filter may be enough. If you&#039;re looking to add a good number of fish, get a small external canister instead of trying to do 2+ internal filters, it increases water volume and provides way more surface area for the money spent.
