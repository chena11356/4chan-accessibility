But doctors said no, that wasn\u2019t the cause.<br><br>Then Sam turned to his mother and told her he had eaten a slug, \u201cAnd I went, \u2018No, no one gets sick from that,\u2019 \u201d Katie Ballard said. CNN has also reached out to Ballard.<br><br>Soon, however, doctors told them otherwise. Sam had developed rat lungworm disease from the infected slug.<br><br>Soon after the diagnosis, Sam fell into a coma, where he remained for 420 days, Ballard said in the Australian news report. He woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week.<br><br>But the disease didn\u2019t affect his mental faculties, his family and friends said.<br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s in there, 100%,\u201d Galvin told \u201cThe Sunday Project.\u201d \u201cI apologized to Sam about everything that happened that night in the backyard. And he just started bawling his eyes out.
