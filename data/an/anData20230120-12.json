I must&#039;ve done Inari knows how many hours worth of staring at Dogs walking ahead of me. Just observing that mesmerizing bounce. I dokn&#039;t need videos, I dokn&#039;t even need to close my eyes; at any given second I can just simply begin to imagine a Dog walking and it&#039;s so real I could reach in and pet hir. My favourite is when it&#039;s a large(r) Dog, like a GSD, Husky, Rottweiler, Dobie, Lab, Shibe...

When you need that information to eat or not be eaten it benefits if you have eyes and a brain or ganglia nearby so you can react as quickly as possible (or a nose or ears or whatever you like). <br>Your brain uses a lot of tricks to edit out this lag to your conscious mind, touch your finger on one hand to the tip of your nose, and on the other hand touch the tip of your toe at the same time. <br>It FEELS like its all happening instantly despite the fact that there&#039;s about a fifth of a second difference in the time it takes both signals to reach your brain. <br>What happens is that your brain knows to account for this difference, and gives the signals the same timestamp despite them hitting at different times, and so it FEELS like it happened at the same time. One of the possible explanations of Deja Vous is that the filing clerk in your brain fucks up and gives something the wrong timestamp. You&#039;re just sitting there and thinking of a song, but some aspect of that moving out of iconic memory (super short term memory, a buffer or cache for your brain) into more permanent memory gets flagged as happening &quot;some time ago&quot; instead of &quot;right now&quot; and the best your brain can do to cope is go &quot;DUDE THIS HAPPENED BEFORE! HOW WEIRD&quot; because a big part of human perception is making sure no one ever looks behind the curtain and realizes how little we deal with reality and how much of our experience is an ad hoc subjective hallucination that probably resembles an objective reality.", "time": 1674170980, "resto": 4413357}, {"no": 4414457, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:40:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4413412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4413412</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bird catching spiders have good enough eyes to snatch a small bird out of the air</span><br>Every species of spider that can even remotely attempt to catch a bird has terrible eyesight", "time": 1674182429, "resto": 4413357}, {"no": 4414458, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:41:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4414290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4414290</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spiders don&#039;t have compound eyes</span><br>Nobody said that.

There are definitely many fungi which actively break down rocks for their essential minerals and metals though, lichen are very well known for this. They pump out potent organic acids and chelating agents to quickly weather pits and holes into solid stone. They are a major agent of what&#039;s called bio-weathering of exposed stone, probably most known for erasing the surface of tombstones. If you find lichen like Xanthoria growing on old stone and scrape a small portion away (not much since they take hundreds of years to grow), you&#039;ll see that there is actually a pit underneath where they&#039;ve degraded the material.<br><br>Another example of mineral degradation is seen very commonly in mycorrhizal fungi, those that associate in a symbiotic relationship with tree roots. To make this symbiosis mutually beneficial, there has to be a give and take between the two partners. Since fungi are capable of quickly degrading and cracking stone through a combo of hydraulic pressure and acids, they will actually tunnel straight into rocks to obtain phosphorous and essential metals, minerals bound into rocks to a point where trees and other organisms are totally incapable of sequestering them. We were finding small micro-tunnels in rocks all around the world before we finally made the connection that mycorrhizal fungi had been digging.<br>Nothing else in the food web is capable of releasing the phosphorous bound into these minerals, and often times whole forest ecosystems only exist because of the P freed up by mycorrhizal fungi, which goes to the trees, which then filters out into the rest of the web.

It produces a very vibrant cotton candy pink, but if the yarn is exposed to sunlight while damp from the dye, it will quickly turn a sort of cotton candy blue. Once dry the color is stable either way. Unfortunately there isn&#039;t a good paper out yet on what exactly is going on chemistry wise, but that&#039;s one thing I&#039;m interested in researching.

Technically, &quot;mating types&quot;. There are two major systems used in fungi which determine how this is organized. Many Ascomycetes (one of two major groups in kingdom fungi) have bipolar mating, where there are essentially two mating types, a roughly 50/50 ratio. This isn&#039;t determined by a whole chromosome as with humans, just a couple gene regions on one chromosome that has to do with pheromone production and detectors. These basically have two sexes. In contrast, the other major group that contains most of what we consider mushrooms, gills/stem/cap etc, are tetrapolar. They have two gene regions with two major alleles each. This means there are basically four sites available for variation. I&#039;ll try to simplify, but because some species have literally hundreds of alleles for these four sites, which means that you can quickly multiple to have 10&#039;s, even 100&#039;s of thousands of different mating types, or &quot;sexes&quot;. <br>The whole point of the tetrapolar mating system is to promote outbreeding and prevent inbreeding. In order for two unmated strains to be compatible, they have to have different allelles at both sites, which means that inbreeding compatibility is only about 25%, while outcrossing compatibility with a new parent is basically 100%, since nobody but siblings is likely to ever share one of these alleles.<br><br><a href=\"#p4407573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4407573</a><br>Yeah, I basically stick to Facebook.<br><br><a href=\"#p4407587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4407587</a><br>It is global.

Specifically, once I learned how easy it was to clone and start growing wild fungi to add to a culture bank, it got out of control.

At one end of each of the semicircular canals is a dilated sac called an osseous ampulla, which is more than twice the diameter of the canal. Each ampulla contains an ampullary crest, the crista ampullaris which consists of a thick gelatinous cap called a cupula and many hair cells. The superior and posterior semicircular canals are oriented vertically at right angles to each other. The lateral semicircular canal is about a 30-degree angle from the horizontal plane. The orientations of the canals cause a different canal to be stimulated by movement of the head in different planes, and more than one canal is stimulated at once if the movement is off those planes. The lateral canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down.[1] When the head changes position, the endolymph in the canals lags behind due to inertia and this acts on the cupula which bends the cilia of the hair cells. The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place. The ampullae open into the vestibule by five orifices, one of the apertures being common to two of the canals.<br><br>Among species of mammals, the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion. Specifically, species that are agile and have fast, jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously.[2]", "time": 1674005871, "resto": 4400632}, {"no": 4412424, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:33:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4412313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4412313</a><br>Oh, so it&#039;s a turbo encabulator.", "time": 1674012793, "resto": 4400632}, {"no": 4412429, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:35:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4412424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4412424</a><br>yes.<br><br>it&#039;s an organ so absurdly perfect for its purpose that it could never have evolved by chance.

Your dog will certainly get fat more easily and only think about food. He will be lazy, prone for diabetes and there is a chance his loss in testosterone may make him fearful and less balanced in character around other dogs/new situations. Unless you have a intact female dog in the same household there is literally no reason. And a daycare shure as shit is certainly not one eaither. Just because ever other owner in your area castrates or neuters does not make it right. Around my area (in Europe ) it is far more normal not to neuter and dogs are just fine. Learn to control your dog around other females (be strict about it) and ask if they are in heat when you meet other owners. Besides, if every female in your area is not intact (which seems to me the case) there is even less reason to neuter, cause who the fuck should he impregnate? <br><br>If you irreversibly mutilate your dog simply for the sake of putting him into a daycare you do not deserve to own a dog.

After the op they\u2019ll keep her in for a few hours to make sure she\u2019s okay, before calling you to collect. For my vets I usually drop them off at 9am and get the call to come pick them up around 4pm. Usually they can come home the same day, but if they\u2019ve pulled out their stitches they may stay in overnight so they can be restitched. If they pull out their stitches the second time, provided the wound is clean and dry you might as well take them home. It\u2019s a bit more work post-care, but as some rats tear their stitches due to distress being back home in a familiar environment can help calm them down.<br><br>When she comes home she may still be a little woozy from the anaesthetic, which can be upsetting if you\u2019re used to her being an active rat. This will wear off in a few hours and she\u2019ll be back to normal. In the meantime let her rest in a quiet environment (a snuggle pouch on your lap is great), and offer her a spoon of watered down baby food/yoghurt; she won\u2019t have eaten or drank in a while so it will help. Make sure it\u2019s nothing chewy or sticky as she\u2019ll lack coordination at first, you don\u2019t want her to choke.<br><br>She should spend the first night back home in a hospital cage (more on that later). Be prepared to stay up late. Some rats are as good as gold with their stitches, some are terrors that will be obsessed with pulling them out. You won\u2019t know what she\u2019s like until the painkillers from the op wear off that evening. If she starts worrying her wound (pulling and chewing, not just grooming) you\u2019ll have to keep interrupting her until she settles. Try distracting with food, play, and cuddles.

Sheep need more pasture/grassland than goats but on the other hand you can also sell the wool. My friend was a sheep farmer and only had to manage the herd maybe once or twice a week to herd them to new pastures, fix rockwalls/fences etc. He told me that the hardest part of the year was lambing season when the ewes give birth to lambs because you have to physically help them give birth and it&#039;s quite hard and disgusting work. Also shearing sheep is apparently necessary for their health and is quite difficult to DIY; most sheep farmers hire shearers to do it seasonally. If your herd becomes substantial you might also have to get a shepherding dog as a working animal to help you herd them; border collies are apparently the best for this. They instinctively know how to herd sheep but still need to be trained on where to herd them.

You&#039;ll need to maintain a decent balance between your population of rams and ewes for maximum fertility and you can start making money simply by selling surplus livestock and wool (has a very low wholesale price, however). Depends on where you live but if you genuinely start farming/herding you can probably apply for government agricultural subsidies and expand your land. If you have a lot of land I would start with a flock of sheep and after a couple years of selling wool, auctioning excess sheep, trade up to cattle which are much more valuable.

Reversal is still a reassignment no matter how pedantic you want to be. <br><br>The wiki tree still withholds Sha. sikannensis from the derived group including the confirmed edentulous form. If you want to claim that its second reassignment back to Guanlingsaurus is to a less derived form, then I guess you&#039;ll have to use Ji et al. 2013, which not only recovers sikanniensis as Shonisaurus (so, toothed), but also doesn&#039;t hold onto Guanlingsaurus and Shastasaurus as sister taxa, with Shasta being the more derived. Considering that edentulism isn&#039;t the ancestral form, and that there&#039;s zero evidence it was evolved and then secondarily lost somewhere between Guanling and Shoni, that leaves us with zero evidence that Shasta was edentulous.<br><br>Returning to Sander&#039;s paper, he all but outright says that Shastasaurus sikanniensis was probably toothed, and he still decided to keep it under Shasta instead of recovering it back to Shoni.

Say the 2 lineages you have identified share a dozen major character states not found in the proposed ancestors. This by itself essentially refutes your hypothesis by itself. But each of those character states consists of multiple individual evolutionary events. The fusion of 3 bones into 1 requires at least 2 intermediate events.

So we look at bird embryos and find that bird sternums are actually made from the 2 existing dinosaur sterna plus 5 new bones that aren&#039;t found in their ancestors. These 7 bones fuse into one to make the sternum, and it&#039;s the same 7 bones in each lineage of modern bird.
