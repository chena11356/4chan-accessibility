If I&#039;m not in the room with him he meows at the top of his lungs and wants to pull up the carpet. He also zero sense of boundaries, he plays way too rough after repeated &quot;gentle&quot; scoldings. At first I just completely ignored him and disengaged in play, but then he tried to make an ambitious jump on the back of my chair and we had to make an emergency vet visit (he was fine, just needed a shot for swelling)<br>After that, I tried hissing back at him to let him know he was being too rough, I figured since he didn&#039;t grow up with siblings he never learned boundaries and that&#039;s how they would do it.<br>After that didn&#039;t work I started being a little rougher, I would (gently) toss him away while trying to do a combination of the previous two, but that didn&#039;t work either.

All NGOs have already experienced corporate capture and are just parroting what corporations want and all state based agencies like DNR or F&amp;W work for lobbying groups like hunters and farmers.<br><br>None of these organizations gives two shits about the environment. NGOs do when small, but once they reach a certain size they start getting all HR-y. I don&#039;t know how they are now, but the International Rhino Foundation even proposed rhino farms for horn. This is a popular midwit take because it pleases lobbyists. The members OVERWHELMINGLY said FUCK no, because they know what was up. That&#039;s just one example. I don&#039;t even think there was malice behind that decision. But once you get to a certain size, fucking Wormtongues start infiltrating your group all over the place. Eventually, once you become large enough, you&#039;re basically just a mouthpiece for neoliberals and your policies start sounding amazingly like everyone else&#039;s in corporate burgerhell.<br><br>As for ecology - that mostly doesn&#039;t exist anymore. &quot;Ecologists&quot; even in name are extremely rare these days. And most of them are midwits weened on hunter lobbyist propaganda that don&#039;t know a fucking thing about how ecosystems actually work. This is a fight I&#039;ve been fighting for literally decades and it&#039;s never going to get better so long as america exists.<br><br>Global warming is another fake issue. Anyone who has even a passing interest in the environment is obsessed with 2 fucking degrees of warming Celsius. This is idiocy. Global warming literally isn&#039;t even in the top three threats to the planet.
