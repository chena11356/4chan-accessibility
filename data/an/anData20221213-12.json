The queen is still there, and she looks healthy, but her workers are all fucking dead. <br>So what the fuck? Why are my bees dying? The bee-keeper forums keep telling me that I\u2019m neglecting them, which I am not. This hive has been good from the start of the year when I started bee keeping.

What a cool site. Im 22 and i used to work at a local vet last year as a cashier. I mean i only got the job because my brother was an intern, nevertheless i cleaned and accommodate customers appropriately. It was my first job and i enjoyed it. The fun part is that we could smoke weed when anyone wasn&#039;t around and it felt really gratifying buying mid shelf weed with my own cash. Not only that i worked with my brother&#039;s classmates inside the clinic and their a little older and more mature.<br><br>Somewhere around the 4th month of working there i was exposed to the ugliness of that business. I became a pervert and started and we started staring at hot customers ass and stalking their social media sites. The head doctor was the biggest pervert. Whenever he or the assistant hand over the pets, they would shrug their elbows upon the breasts of hot owners. It would make their day as they have shitty wives. <br><br>After my brothers 13th month pay they left and i was the only gen z left there. The staff began to treat me differently, which is understandable. Didnt worked my way up there to begin with. So i manned up, cleaned the cages and washed the dishes did what they told despite the gaslighting im poor your rich routine. Overtime i pondered.. wtf am i doing with my life, i quit college to help my dad out with the bills for this? Fuck this 9-7pm job, fuck the weed im getting outta there. At my final months i could even sit at the receptionist, the groomer occupied it so i had to sit tat the operating table. One time the fucking groomer was so brazen he asked to take a hit at my thc vape, all the while sitting feet up at my desk. So i awoled one day after rigorously cleaning the place up being treated like a maid. Im going back to college again and enrolled to a Bs IT course. Ill make sure i wont end up like those assholes. Ill treasure my youth, go to gym and study hard for my future.

This helps them both conserve heat and walk on snow. Then come spring the fox sheds and the paw-bottom fur sheds too. There&#039;s vids of foxes chewing between their toes to help rip the fur out. Even when it&#039;s all shed their pawpads are much hairier than dogs&#039; - fur actually grows out of the edges of the pawpads. The fox in this photo has the least hairy pawpads I could find.<br><br>With fennecs, their pawpads are almost always completely covered in fur. This is for the opposite reason of red foxes: to protect their pawpads from the heat of the desert sand.<br><br>With gray foxes, these finally do have big black pawpad beans like dogs: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YzP11Mli<wbr>Y6s/W_m2i43RuqI/AAAAAAAABzk/t6iHzEJ<wbr>ryU03U_8_i40-9xj4QcvxaXLUACLcBGAs/s<wbr>0/foxNewcollarsm2018NPS.jpg", "filename": "EOKsQDAU0AAv18r", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 1365, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1670886609269887, "time": 1670886609, "md5": "KRsd1F/MWG8H8DOnaxDuKg==", "fsize": 814192, "resto": 4372887}], "last_modified": 1670886609}, {"no": 4337649, "now": "10/26/22(Wed)12:47:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is the crowned eagle, the most powerful eagle of Africa.<br>Say something nice about her.", "filename": "African crowned eagle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5632, "h": 4297, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 190, "tim": 1666802873082980, "time": 1666802873, "md5": "QQSM0UhqI8UH+rBcc1ibEw==", "fsize": 3700504, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-is-the-crowned-eagle-the-most-powerful-eagle", "replies": 145, "images": 112, "omitted_posts": 140, "omitted_images": 110, "last_replies": [{"no": 4377610, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)13:53:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4337649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4337649</a><br>If it attacked me I would grab onto it and try to snap its neck.

But doctors said no, that wasn\u2019t the cause.<br><br>Then Sam turned to his mother and told her he had eaten a slug, \u201cAnd I went, \u2018No, no one gets sick from that,\u2019 \u201d Katie Ballard said. CNN has also reached out to Ballard.<br><br>Soon, however, doctors told them otherwise. Sam had developed rat lungworm disease from the infected slug.<br><br>Soon after the diagnosis, Sam fell into a coma, where he remained for 420 days, Ballard said in the Australian news report. He woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week.<br><br>But the disease didn\u2019t affect his mental faculties, his family and friends said.<br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s in there, 100%,\u201d Galvin told \u201cThe Sunday Project.\u201d \u201cI apologized to Sam about everything that happened that night in the backyard.
