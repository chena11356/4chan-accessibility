We have two large dogs that usually find their way home eventually but one likes cactus and there&#039;s lots of wildlife and neighbors dogs so we spitballed a budget of $600 and picked up the raw materials for a dog run. It&#039;s a rectangle that&#039;s about an acre total and it&#039;s great for throwing the ball and burning energy off chasing birds (one of our dogs has a crow friend). I thought it was excessive but wouldn&#039;t want to go with less than what we did. I would not let my dogs go free if there&#039;s wildlife or any chance of criminals trespassing, too much liability, but I take them on walks outside the run when I can. This is all with two dogs with established history, so who knows maybe it would be easier with a puppy if you&#039;re going that route. With some snake avoidance training I&#039;d be more willing to let them out onto the land more I think, but I&#039;d still consider crime an issue.<br><br>I would recommend getting it socialized asap (try to avoid getting it too sick too early) and getting it in with a reputable trainer (not Petmart) as early as the trainer will take it. I did not rear either of my dogs myself but I know neither of them were properly socialized and they both get nervous around strangers the first few times. We used to take them to to &quot;doggy daycare&quot; for extra socialization and training once a week before covid shut that down but now we have family and friends over whenever we can to help. <br><br>We pay A LOT for our vet, the ones that are cheap have really let me down in the past and I have been really happy with every vet I ever paid enough to care about my pets health lol.

Although I guess you can make the exhibit look however you want and mix and match any animal and you won&#039;t have dumb shit like MOOSE DOEN&#039;T LIKE BUSH 5. At the same time, in ZT1 you can mix and match certain animals but it&#039;s tough to get the exhibit just right but it&#039;s that challenge I enjoy.<br>PLUS there&#039;s like 300 animals in the first one and like 40 animals in 2, so there&#039;s that.<br>But I WILL say this about ZT1, the dinosaurs have always been fucking glitched ever since it came out. If there is a tree in a mean dinosaur&#039;s exhibit like a t-rex, it will b-line right for that tree and immediately demolish it which turns into rubble which they don&#039;t like, so to circumvent this I&#039;ve always put the necessary amount of dinosaur trees in another section of the exhibit just there because the game needs you to have trees to keep the animal happy, but I block it off with fence like a separate adjacent exhibit, except for 1 tile which I then block off with water so they can&#039;t get to the trees.

They consist of 15 species of jay in two genera, Cyanolyca and Cyanocorax. Cyanolyca is more basal to all American jays (Cyanocoracinae), while Cyanocorax species are usually larger and derive from the same lineage as NA magpie-jays and the Mexican brown jay. Cyanocoracine jays are suited for wooded environments and carry the same jay synapomorphies, so when they expanded into Central America after the continents collided, they were the group of corvids that did best in the Amazon basin and other South American neotropical ecoregions. However, like was stated in this thread, South American bird fauna were very competitive, and when North American lineages other than corvids expanded south, it was caracaras that dominated the ground-walking opportunistic niches that corvids enjoyed in the Northern Hemisphere.", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-02-06 at 21.54.38", "ext": ".png", "w": 1672, "h": 1428, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1675720494689551, "time": 1675720494, "md5": "g/abB2/x1uRwovh3DMRKiw==", "fsize": 3642627, "resto": 4396491}, {"no": 4431465, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)17:08:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4430325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4430325</a><br>thats apparently named &quot;paraguay&quot;", "time": 1675807735, "resto": 4396491}, {"no": 4432421, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)17:47:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Penguin_range", "ext": ".png", "w": 1425, "h": 745, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1675896435346373, "time": 1675896435, "md5": "Bw4BbrCPV4wMPAX7Zpw5sA==", "fsize": 48720, "resto": 4396491}, {"no": 4432830, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)03:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4432421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4432421</a><br>penguins in that region of australia?", "time": 1675931460, "resto": 4396491}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 4428611, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)21:08:27", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/pom/", "com": "I&#039;m obsessed with pomeranians.

In my vision, I was on the veranda of a vast feeding platform, a Peron Makan of some fantastic proportion. <br>There seemed to emanate from it a light from within - this gleaming radiant jungle. I had known this place. I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return, a reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. Wandering about, I was happy that the forest had been immaculately maintained. There had been planted a number of additional trees, but in a way it blended so seamlessly with the original canopy, one would never detect any difference. Returning to the jungle&#039;s grand treescape, there came a knock from above. Budi was standing there. He was happy and care-free, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy. We embraced - a warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were in this moment one. My vision ended.

Obviously it&#039;s never going to be as cut and dry as that, but we can theorise that the gradual decline of the carcharodontosaurs and their disappearance from the fossil record by the Cenomanian (when they truly reached their greatest sizes with Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Carcharodontosaurus) could be connected to the shift in sauropod populations, and that shift also eventuated the success and diversity of abelisaurids and tyrannosaurids in the last 25 million years of the Cretaceous, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We can perhaps theorise some large scale biogeographical shift that meant that carcharodontosaurs, which were specialised to be giant apex predators hunting the juveniles of the huge titanosaurs (or potentially forming packs and hunting adults), could no longer cope. Usually this kind of specialisation is a double edged sword - you&#039;re king of the castle while things are stable, at the highest trophic level, but when there are ecological shifts, migrations or other environmental factors, your specialisation can be a handicap. The ancestral lineages of abelisaurs and tyrannosaurs were most likely generalists, and when the Mid Cretaceous transitioned to the Late Cretaceous, it seems that they were the ones to benefit.", "filename": "tumblr_inline_nsozcvJ4BL1rx4yme_1280", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 556, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1675713361134124, "time": 1675713361, "md5": "VKEKEgYKsrsNb68RoC9jvw==", "fsize": 604321, "resto": 4428422}, {"no": 4430433, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)14:57:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4430395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4430395</a><br><a href=\"#p4430432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4430432</a><br><br>Again, like you said, the Cenomanian seems to exhibit shifts in the fossil record when it comes to the dominance of different large theropod lineages. The spinosaurids also thin out of the fossil record at this time, and they were clearly very specialised compared to other tetanurans.<br>The megaraptorans are a bit of a wild card, if they were indeed allosauroids, then they could be an argument for smaller, lightweight carnosaurs with long grasping forelimbs surviving where massive carcharodontosaurs could not.<br>Maybe this biogeographical transition and faunal turnover, if it did happen, could be linked to the Bonarelli anoxia event, which was related to the development of large igneous provinces across the equator due to marine transgression and the continued break up of Gondwanaland. Sea levels rose, choking littoral and delta ecosystems which supported spinosaurids, but also potentially shrinking the floodplains that the giant titanosaurs would have relied upon as nesting grounds. The carbon cycle disturbance also interrupted the marine oxygen cycle, leading to 500,000 years of decline in marine biodiversity, as reflected in the fossil record with reductions in plankton and foraminifer biodiversity. The increase in average water depth would have seawater to become less eutrophic in shallow, epicontinental seas, and this brought about the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, just like you said. Then, over the following strata, mosasaurs grow to gigantic sizes and dominant the interior seaways of North America and Europe, and the epicontinental seas around Zealandia.

Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can.

I looked into this and apparently in breeding contracts this is actually called selling off a \u201cshow quality/potential\u201d puppy, and it would outline stipulations for things like showing her and breeding. The dog herself is an absolute angel, she\u2019s just the sweetest thing in the world.

I went to Maldives two years ago and swam with hundreds of clownfish: not a single anemone in sight. Clownfish in the wild can find shelter in a number of different things including rockwork and coral, this is perfectly natural. In tanks people have even gotten anemone to be hosted in fake anemone.<br>4) There are lots of different, far more effective, far less retarded, ways of encouraging hosting behavior. One surprisingly effective way is to tape a picture of clownfish being hosted by an anemone to the glass. Yes, they&#039;re smart enough to identify themselves and anemone in a picture, which makes you torturing them all the more insane. Two, you can use the tube method where you just get a big clear acrylic tube, put it over the anemone, and introduce (in your case re-introduce) the anemone to the tank in the tube. Finally, you could just wait.

The problem is, he has been there for almost two weeks now. I live in a small flat, and he keeps playing with my stuff, knocking objects while jumping around, and so on. Everytime I try to put him in his transport box to give him back to my mother, he goes in a frenzy, escape and hides for hours. I even set up a cage trap with his favourite food (similar to the ones meant to catch ferals), but he hasn&#039;t touched the food in 3 days, despite barely feeding him otherwise. It&#039;s like he understood it was a trap. Everytime my mother comes to pick him up, he hides and I swear it&#039;s impossible to find him.

Not only do they look like adorable little angels, they also have the personalities of ones as well. Chick-on-chick infanticide is relatively rare in this species, and on top of that the siblings are known to share their given meals with each other. All the more impressive taking into consideration that they live in an environment that is only slightly more forgiving than the polar ice caps, or planet Hoth. <br><br>The species are sexually dimorphic to better suit their familial roles.
