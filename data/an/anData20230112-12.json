If they die under you then their horse spirit follows you neighing directly into your ear.", "time": 1673342600, "resto": 4398608, "filedeleted": 1}, {"no": 4404702, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)08:41:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "you MUST be in snoofing range to be seen in 3D.", "filename": "1673351469401540", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 523, "h": 1115, "tn_w": 58, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673358109250187, "time": 1673358109, "md5": "TlC6F586+BsrTTqcoGq4Ow==", "fsize": 61845, "resto": 4398608}, {"no": 4404713, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)08:56:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4404702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4404702</a><br>hope you&#039;ve seen that horse vision video on youtube<br>https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=4_ij<wbr>itbhT7w", "filename": "vision du cheval", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673358963714054, "time": 1673358963, "md5": "esUJUuh10aD7KsAGwVYrsw==", "fsize": 89715, "resto": 4398608}, {"no": 4404718, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4404590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4404590</a><br>Who would I hire to remove a horse spirit haunting", "time": 1673359277, "resto": 4398608}, {"no": 4404726, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:07:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are Horses the white people of the animal world?", "time": 1673359643, "resto": 4398608}, {"no": 4404736, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:18:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4404726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4404726</a><br>elaborate on this statement", "time": 1673360305, "resto": 4398608}, {"no": 4404741, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)09:24:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4404726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4404726</a><br>Horses are north asians.

After the op they\u2019ll keep her in for a few hours to make sure she\u2019s okay, before calling you to collect. For my vets I usually drop them off at 9am and get the call to come pick them up around 4pm. Usually they can come home the same day, but if they\u2019ve pulled out their stitches they may stay in overnight so they can be restitched. If they pull out their stitches the second time, provided the wound is clean and dry you might as well take them home. It\u2019s a bit more work post-care, but as some rats tear their stitches due to distress being back home in a familiar environment can help calm them down.<br><br>When she comes home she may still be a little woozy from the anaesthetic, which can be upsetting if you\u2019re used to her being an active rat. This will wear off in a few hours and she\u2019ll be back to normal. In the meantime let her rest in a quiet environment (a snuggle pouch on your lap is great), and offer her a spoon of watered down baby food/yoghurt; she won\u2019t have eaten or drank in a while so it will help. Make sure it\u2019s nothing chewy or sticky as she\u2019ll lack coordination at first, you don\u2019t want her to choke.<br><br>She should spend the first night back home in a hospital cage (more on that later). Be prepared to stay up late. Some rats are as good as gold with their stitches, some are terrors that will be obsessed with pulling them out. You won\u2019t know what she\u2019s like until the painkillers from the op wear off that evening. If she starts worrying her wound (pulling and chewing, not just grooming) you\u2019ll have to keep interrupting her until she settles. Try distracting with food, play, and cuddles.

Replace whenever you see it soiled. Have two places she can sleep (I use a fabric cube and a hammock), as having a choice can reduce stress. Put food in a bowl to prevent loose pieces catching the wound. A hanging chew bar is a great distraction. A towel over the cage covering at least the sleeping area will help her feel more secure, and also keep the draught out (as she won\u2019t have her companion to snuggle up to to keep warm).<br><br>Put the cage somewhere where you can supervise her- I put it on a side table next to my chair.

Reversal is still a reassignment no matter how pedantic you want to be. <br><br>The wiki tree still withholds Sha. sikannensis from the derived group including the confirmed edentulous form. If you want to claim that its second reassignment back to Guanlingsaurus is to a less derived form, then I guess you&#039;ll have to use Ji et al. 2013, which not only recovers sikanniensis as Shonisaurus (so, toothed), but also doesn&#039;t hold onto Guanlingsaurus and Shastasaurus as sister taxa, with Shasta being the more derived. Considering that edentulism isn&#039;t the ancestral form, and that there&#039;s zero evidence it was evolved and then secondarily lost somewhere between Guanling and Shoni, that leaves us with zero evidence that Shasta was edentulous.<br><br>Returning to Sander&#039;s paper, he all but outright says that Shastasaurus sikanniensis was probably toothed, and he still decided to keep it under Shasta instead of recovering it back to Shoni.

There are definitely many fungi which actively break down rocks for their essential minerals and metals though, lichen are very well known for this. They pump out potent organic acids and chelating agents to quickly weather pits and holes into solid stone. They are a major agent of what&#039;s called bio-weathering of exposed stone, probably most known for erasing the surface of tombstones.

To make this symbiosis mutually beneficial, there has to be a give and take between the two partners. Since fungi are capable of quickly degrading and cracking stone through a combo of hydraulic pressure and acids, they will actually tunnel straight into rocks to obtain phosphorous and essential metals, minerals bound into rocks to a point where trees and other organisms are totally incapable of sequestering them. We were finding small micro-tunnels in rocks all around the world before we finally made the connection that mycorrhizal fungi had been digging.<br>Nothing else in the food web is capable of releasing the phosphorous bound into these minerals, and often times whole forest ecosystems only exist because of the P freed up by mycorrhizal fungi, which goes to the trees, which then filters out into the rest of the web.

There is a whole worldwide and growing group of Mushroom Dyer&#039;s. In most areas, they offer way more of a color range in pigments than plants do. In my eyes it is another way to take advantage of their biochemical potency, but natural dyer&#039;s more appreciate them for their beautiful shades. Here is some yarn I dyed with two of the mushrooms I mentioned, the green and yellow are Phaeolus schweinitzii (Dyer&#039;s Polypore), and the red is Lobster. <br><br>The Xanthoria lichen I mentioned is really interesting. The typical method involves &quot;fermenting&quot; (not an actual biological fermentation, the pH is too high), the lichen in ammonia for a few weeks to months, and then soaking your yarn/silk in the liquor. It produces a very vibrant cotton candy pink, but if the yarn is exposed to sunlight while damp from the dye, it will quickly turn a sort of cotton candy blue. Once dry the color is stable either way. Unfortunately there isn&#039;t a good paper out yet on what exactly is going on chemistry wise, but that&#039;s one thing I&#039;m interested in researching. At first I was convinced the shift to pink (parietin is yellow at neutral pH) was simply pH based, since many other anthraquinone pigments shift to reds or violets at a high pH, but so far the TLC (thin-layer-chromatography) I&#039;ve done has actually supported the formation of a new pigment. I suspect by incorporation of nitrogen from the ammonia, but I&#039;m not really sure yet.<br><br>I&#039;m going to be pissed if this image gets flipped too", "filename": "Yarn-Resized-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 582, "h": 449, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1673514878917528, "time": 1673514878, "md5": "kma2xswqU1wuWnW4dixFIg==", "fsize": 49489, "resto": 4404183}, {"no": 4406840, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:17:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4406834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4406834</a><br>Some more mushroom dyed yarn.

It&#039;s not popular, and it&#039;s banned in the most populated prefectures, but it&#039;s totally above-board. There isn&#039;t a lot of good info in English. Some people say the dogs only fight until one yelps or gives up, which sounds more humane, but fight dogs are bred for &quot;gameness&quot; above anything else. Which is basically the temperament to never, ever give up even if half their face is hanging off and they&#039;re on the edge of death. I would be surprised if Japanese dogmen are any different from western ones. My guess is they breed game dogs too.

They need somewhere to perch with a reasonably big space that\u2019s free of wind/rain/sun. They also love yards of grass to peck, just make sure there\u2019s nothing sharp they could eat. <br>Chickens mostly eat grains, they are omnivores though and will eat anything even meat. However their digestion suffers if they eat non-dense food such as bread, which you can solve by soaking. Young chickens should have medicated food to build up their immunity. You should also mix calcium in their food such as broken eggshells, calcium is very important to their diets and they can become egg bound and die without it. If they start molting feathers you should feed a high protein diet such as cat food.<br>They need pavement or stones to grind their beaks and nails on, otherwise you\u2019ll have to clip them once in a while.<br>If you live in freezing climate you\u2019ll need to figure out water. <br>They also need a supply of grit, this is literally just smooth gravel. They eat it to act as teeth in their stomach.<br>Roosters aren\u2019t always legal to own, but you can \u201cbabysit\u201d them to help breed a flock. There\u2019s also a small chance the hens you buy at the local tractor supply will have a rooster, since its difficult to tell at a young age. I really doubt these ordinances are ever enforced though.<br>Incubation is necessary if the chicks are separated from their mothers.

In reality carnivores are far more social and caring while herbivores tend towards being extremely selfish creatures that betray their own kin because they only live to fuck before dying. The only way an herbivore can rise above how thuggish and useless most of them all is by ascending beyond being prey, and even then they hit a hard stop because their diet is energy intensive to digest. They typically go extinct quickly after this, or become a carnivore/piscivore/insectivore. They&#039;re eating animals either way. Very few herbivores are currently at this stage. Most are retards like rabbits.<br><br>Carnivores also have a higher likelihood to develop ethical behavior. They start with a stronger motivation to be empathetic because they have to go out and get food, and the best way to do that is to be cooperative. Prey animals just graze. They do not need to help each other. Only frugivores differ here and they tend to start eating some meat eventually. They also have a motivation to care about suffering. In the primitive context, because suffering prey struggles and wastes energy/causes injury. Finding suffering naturally repulsive then becomes ethical killing, which becomes, many thousands of years later, cruelty-free vat meat or genetically engineered meat plants that can produce more nutrients with less resources than anything with pure plant kingdom DNA.<br><br>The very instincts that drive oversocialized westerners to go vegan are just standard facets of carnivore behavior that drive us to kill our prey efficiently and allow us to better predict their movements. You would not care about animals at all if you did not eat them. You would be as the bull, you would simply kill any animal that made you feel unsafe.<br><br>The end stage of veganism is eating a form of meat grown without a thinking, feeling central nervous system.

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items.

way to deal with them is to just get a decently sized glass or ceramic bowl similar to pic related and fill it with a bit of peanut oil, enough that the mice will get covered in it but not so much that they&#039;ll drown. Place it in the problem area with something next to it to act as a step so that the mice can jump up onto the rim of the bowl, and leave it overnight. The mice will smell the peanut oil and will jump into the bowl looking for food. Once they&#039;re in the oil pool they won&#039;t be able to jump back out and you can collect them and do whatever you want with them in the morning. It sounds dumb but this is far and away the most effective method I&#039;ve ever personally used to live-catch mice without hurting them. <br><br>You can fill a plastic tub with around an inch of of warm water mixed with a bit of mild dish soap and let them run around for a few minutes to get any oil off them and they&#039;ll be none the worse for wear. Just make sure they can run around with their heads above water so you don&#039;t accidentally drown them. <br><br>Once you&#039;ve caught them you can either release them, keep them, or euthanize them, but that&#039;s up to you. If you do want to keep or release them, check them for weird lumps, wounds, or sores. Lots of mice are carriers for some pretty horrendous parasites, and if you find any sick ones then you&#039;ll be doing them and the other mice a favor by putting them down. CO2 asphyxiation is the only American Veterinary Medical Association approved way to euthanize rodents and is probably the most humane.

Usually with bulk-based bargain deals where I can stash a good chunk of it in the freezer.

While the work there is 100% necessary, it reinforces the things I&#039;ve heard about pigs as livestock. That they seem to have extra awareness of their surroundings, they recognize when the necropsy techs come in and try to fight. I can visually see that they are fully mentally capable of learned helplessness, and I can no longer leave things up to my own personal ignorance. I see some of the animal techs going up to the cages and baby talking piglets and the mini-swine go to the edge of the cage like any dog would.

Say the 2 lineages you have identified share a dozen major character states not found in the proposed ancestors. This by itself essentially refutes your hypothesis by itself. But each of those character states consists of multiple individual evolutionary events. The fusion of 3 bones into 1 requires at least 2 intermediate events.

So we look at bird embryos and find that bird sternums are actually made from the 2 existing dinosaur sterna plus 5 new bones that aren&#039;t found in their ancestors. These 7 bones fuse into one to make the sternum, and it&#039;s the same 7 bones in each lineage of modern bird.

A few days ago, it came up to our back patio door and when I opened the door to pet it, it just waltzed right in. It was then that I noticed it appeared injured on its leg. This injury did not appear severe on that first night and didn&#039;t seem to be bleeding or anything (pic related, next pics will have updated wound). But today when we let him in it was bleeding. <br><br>It is a very, very loving cat and acts very unlike a stray. It is very affectionate and unafraid of human contact. But I find it hard to believe that if it was owned, its owner wouldn&#039;t have done anything about the wound. The problem is I don&#039;t have the funds to bring it to a vet, not to mention I still don&#039;t know if it is owned or not and thus don&#039;t want to get into problems with a potential owner.

Extreme high energy.<br><br>Now at first the older male just ignored him or put up with it, but after a couple weeks he started fighting back. I thought he was just putting him in his place, but it seems it keeps escalating. The little one chases him, bites him on the neck or face and grapples with him, the older one flips him over and bites him. The little one cries and runs away, but after a few seconds he turns around and takes another run at the bigger one. It always starts out as play, but as the bigger one has gotten fed up with it every time he deals with it a little more roughly. A couple hours ago the little one was screaming bloody murder, ears back, hissing and he ran away after the bigger one let him go, so I inspected him and his nose is bleeding a little bit.<br><br>I&#039;m getting the feeling this isn&#039;t going to resolve itself on it&#039;s own.
