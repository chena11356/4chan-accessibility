All the pics you see are the same 300 gallon rubbermaid stock tank wrapped with a wooden frame for aesthetics. I&#039;m using pool filter sand as substrate over the rocks now because the sand doesn&#039;t trap poop, is much easier for plants to root into, and allows me stock snails and freshwater clams. The circular shape also allows you to have a nice circular flow pattern of water where there isn&#039;t any dead spots for shit to collect in. Filtration wise all my water is going down a overflow so the surface is skimmed of dust and leaves. Upkeep routine is once a week I will open the filter and hose down these 12&quot;x12&quot; foam pads and every other week change 50% of the water. During warmer weather when plants grow I will actually have to water change less or else the plants stop growing completely and die off a little. Water changes are super easy since its outdoors and I can drain into my backyard and rapidly refill with the hose.

They are the most chill breed of dog on their earth. They sleep peacefully on the sofa while I work and look out the window. When you want to play, so do they. They walk when you want to walk. You feed them in the morning and let them do their thing. I do remember when they were puppies it was a hassle, but they also had each other to play with. They also kept each other company.<br>Now with this new puppy, my idea was to give my larger of the two schnauzers I have a new dog to play with (he&#039;s male) because his litter mate (female) is quite small and can&#039;t keep up with him when he plays she also likes to sleep twice as much as he does, I think she enjoying snuggling more than anything else in this world. Now I&#039;m about a week in and they &quot;get along&quot; but this puppy is bouncing off the walls. She barely knows how to walk on a leash despite walking her multiple times a day, showing her how the other dogs walk, etc, she needs constant attention or she screams, she also wants to bite literally everything, including me and the dogs. Now my dogs are patient and they put up with her constant biting for a little bit but even they have a limit. And then it turns into them chasing each other around the house and constant barking. So when she&#039;s bad, I put her in time out and she just screams and screams. I guess I forgot how much work it is to integrate a new puppy but I&#039;m a week in and I feel like tearing my hair out. I just want my dogs to be happy and chill with me while I work from home.

Like the other anon said weight is a huge factor since it has a exoskeleton. When I said it would be like a jumping spider that was just answering the hypotheticals and ignoring the actualities of it. If this actually existed it would be slow as fuck like a tortoise or coconut crab, but it can&#039;t exist. There&#039;s a reason why the largest exoskeletons exist underwater and not on land, the weight of this thing makes it impossible. Although pic related did exist you can see it&#039;s actual volume to surface area is drastically different to a spider, mainly it has a huge weight distribution. 8 exoskeleton spider legs are going to be under enormous strain to hold up a cow sized spider&#039;s body, even more so because spider legs are segmented and the weight doesn&#039;t actually go down on the legs, but is instead suspended. The amount of tension on the upper joints would rip itself up apart. <br><br>So if you did the math to scale up how strong and thick a cow sized exoskeleton would be, it would immediately be wrong because a cow sized exoskeleton couldn&#039;t be made up the same material as a actual spider.

Their whole respiratory system would have to be reworked to operate like a vertebrate, and the physics which let them crawl around upside down on 6/8 legs no longer works in the 1kg+ league. So basically, their whole body plan is retarded at such a scale. The extra limbs just becomes more weight to have to move around, and since it&#039;s hard to gallop on them all, they&#039;d be fairly speed limited.

It&#039;s the first week of October and I&#039;m here in the lower garden. If you look just over there you can see some leaf mold we&#039;re working on. All around the property you&#039;ll see these hoops with leaves piled up. We&#039;re making leaf-molllllld. It&#039;s great compost. You just let leaves decompose in place and in two years you have fantastic compost. Now if you want to speed that process up you can dump urine on it.

I felt fucking awful. <br>The second was when I&#039;d been fucked over by like 2 people on rent for the the Nth time and decided to kick them out and move. Moved in with a nice old hippy lady with empty nest syndrome that loved animals, so my cat wouldn&#039;t be a problem.

My cat didn&#039;t stray from the porch for months until making longer forays. Eventually he never came back. Didn&#039;t see him for weeks until I saw his stupid ass on the adjacent block during a run and he came bounding up and chirping at me and acting like he was lost but he knew what the hell he was up to, dumbass just didn&#039;t want to go home.<br><br>This lesbian couple were feeding him and letting him hang out on the porch. Turns out he had chased off most of the other local cats, and became Gigachad boss of the block. I brought him home and he stuck around for a few days, but he chose a new home in his own way I guess. They were chill about it, we made friends and I&#039;d bring cat food when coming to visit. Eventually moved out of there and I have basically no idea what he&#039;s doing. It&#039;s been about 5 years and we&#039;d had him for a long time, so if he hasn&#039;t died of old age by now he&#039;s probably still chilling. I mostly regret feeling like I didn&#039;t come visit him enough, but it makes me happy he got to experience so much late in life in a sleepy neighborhood, away from traffic, and choosing his own way.

In my vision, I was on the veranda of a vast feeding platform, a Peron Makan of some fantastic proportion. <br>There seemed to emanate from it a light from within - this gleaming radiant jungle. I had known this place. I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return, a reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. Wandering about, I was happy that the forest had been immaculately maintained. There had been planted a number of additional trees, but in a way it blended so seamlessly with the original canopy, one would never detect any difference. Returning to the jungle&#039;s grand treescape, there came a knock from above. Budi was standing there. He was happy and care-free, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy. We embraced - a warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were in this moment one. My vision ended.

While humans have only very limited biological reproductive specialisation (menopause), our behaviour is highly eusocial.<br>Laying down your life to the benefit of others in your community is a fundamentally eusocial behaviour. The poppy fields of flanders are only possible if your species, or society, values supporting the reproductive success of the collective over the reproductive success of the individual. Human willingness to go to war and die for the benefit of the collective is a fundamentally eusocial behaviour.<br>And the reason eusocial species are as successful as they are isn&#039;t simply their mode of reproduction. It&#039;s the behavioural changes this mode of reproduction enables. If these same behavioural changes are possible without changing the mode of reproduction, the impact on the ecosystem is still the same. <br>And that&#039;s before we get into humans not having a high degree of biologically sourced reproductive specialisation, but very much having a high degree of social reproductive specialisation. Wealth used to be an important determinant in whether a human could reproduce or not. A large percentage of humans still worked for their respective polities, but never got to breed, simply by way of social enforcement. Crucially, their work still benefitted the polity they lived in, which cannot be said for a jaguar that dies alone and without having fathered cubs. Individuals without reproductive success still added to the reproductive success of the collective.<br>THAT is the fundamentally difference between eusociality and not-eusociality.<br>And interestingly enough, there are species of wasps that function the same. Each worker CAN lay eggs from which new wasps would hatch, but social enforcement of dominance hierarchies means that only the queen (or sometimes several queens) actually does so.<br>Humans are on that level.

Cut your dick off, you&#039;ll love it!&quot; The ancients were obedient to the gods and they were rewarded as history shows. But at some point a cancer formed. Humans became too populous and death opened a niche for a metaparasite. Something that had never existed before. A hominid that parasitized other hominids. For centuries these monsters just wandered around in the desert or preyed on and off on structured human societies. Their first major victim was Egypt, but that was when they were first coming into being and the Egyptians effectively purged the creatures. Unfortunately, those little demons stole the worst ideas Egypt had to offer in the process (circumcision, monotheism, belief in superstition over actual metaphysics - stupid shit like &quot;the magic of names&quot; which made a bit more sense in actual Egyptian society). Their next major target destroyed the world: Rome. When jews infiltrated Rome, they were immediately seen as parasitic trouble-makers, but even early on there were traitors (mostly non-Romans like constantine) that gave them power. Then they encountered the germanic - easily the greatest ally the jew has ever encountered and they gained total control over the Earth out of this arrangement. And for 2,000 years the world has been plunged into darkness and evil. Mankind can hardly even grasp the difference between good and evil in any cultural context nowadays, though even NPCs understand what is good and what is not.

But NH3 can diffuse into plant cells and will easily find a free H+ to become NH4+ which will then be used.<br><br>A lot of plants actually use Ammonium much easier than Nitrate, the reason why the whole cycle works the way it does is because bacteria is even faster than plants at processing Ammonia/Ammonium (and Nitrite), thus the plants have no choice to use Nitrate as in a mature system that is all that&#039;s left. <br><br>However it is mostly correct that to totally offset fauna, it generally takes a shitload of plants if you&#039;re not using any sort of traditional aquarium filter.

They also are characteristically known for their social aspect of playing with each other for fun, wagging their tails, and their high range of vocalizations (barking, howling, whining, etc) which they use to communicate with each other.

Obviously it&#039;s never going to be as cut and dry as that, but we can theorise that the gradual decline of the carcharodontosaurs and their disappearance from the fossil record by the Cenomanian (when they truly reached their greatest sizes with Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Carcharodontosaurus) could be connected to the shift in sauropod populations, and that shift also eventuated the success and diversity of abelisaurids and tyrannosaurids in the last 25 million years of the Cretaceous, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We can perhaps theorise some large scale biogeographical shift that meant that carcharodontosaurs, which were specialised to be giant apex predators hunting the juveniles of the huge titanosaurs (or potentially forming packs and hunting adults), could no longer cope. Usually this kind of specialisation is a double edged sword - you&#039;re king of the castle while things are stable, at the highest trophic level, but when there are ecological shifts, migrations or other environmental factors, your specialisation can be a handicap.

Sea levels rose, choking littoral and delta ecosystems which supported spinosaurids, but also potentially shrinking the floodplains that the giant titanosaurs would have relied upon as nesting grounds. The carbon cycle disturbance also interrupted the marine oxygen cycle, leading to 500,000 years of decline in marine biodiversity, as reflected in the fossil record with reductions in plankton and foraminifer biodiversity. The increase in average water depth would have seawater to become less eutrophic in shallow, epicontinental seas, and this brought about the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, just like you said. Then, over the following strata, mosasaurs grow to gigantic sizes and dominant the interior seaways of North America and Europe, and the epicontinental seas around Zealandia.

You can stick a moose in the desert or snow or whatever and it&#039;ll be happy as long as it has a little bit of deciduous forest floor, which again I could see how some people might like that, but then it just turns into a boring sandbox and less of a real game like 1. Although I guess you can make the exhibit look however you want and mix and match any animal and you won&#039;t have dumb shit like MOOSE DOEN&#039;T LIKE BUSH 5. At the same time, in ZT1 you can mix and match certain animals but it&#039;s tough to get the exhibit just right but it&#039;s that challenge I enjoy.<br>PLUS there&#039;s like 300 animals in the first one and like 40 animals in 2, so there&#039;s that.<br>But I WILL say this about ZT1, the dinosaurs have always been fucking glitched ever since it came out. If there is a tree in a mean dinosaur&#039;s exhibit like a t-rex, it will b-line right for that tree and immediately demolish it which turns into rubble which they don&#039;t like, so to circumvent this I&#039;ve always put the necessary amount of dinosaur trees in another section of the exhibit just there because the game needs you to have trees to keep the animal happy, but I block it off with fence like a separate adjacent exhibit, except for 1 tile which I then block off with water so they can&#039;t get to the trees.

Still a good idea to have a few unassigned zoo keepers floating around wherever to drop into exhibits that need extra help like if the lion exhibit gets covered in crap.
