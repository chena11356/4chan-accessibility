Especially if you get a kitten. There&#039;s a chance if you get a cat he will be a house plant you need to feed, but theres a bigger chance the cat is a much larger part of your life then you think it would be. <br><br>I got my cat during covid when he was 3 months old, and I spent every second with him. We grew a huge bond because he was the only living thing I saw daily, but he imprinted on me to such a degree where he is extremely comfortable around people (when I go to the vet they can&#039;t believe how well behaved he is, he isn&#039;t scared at all to be picked up or examined) and is very social. But I know he&#039;s like this because I was in his life constantly. <br><br>Anyways, because of this, he needs love and affection, not just food. He wants to play, cuddle, be pet, etc. I talk to him and he talks back, and we spend time at my apartment together a lot. I care about his health and weight so I feed him wet food every 8 hours, so thats definitely a routine I have to follow for his sake. But when I get home he&#039;s happy, and I&#039;m happy to see him. I feel like the answer to your question is more how much you want your cat to be part of your life. Assuming you get a kitten (which you need to have a lot of time for at the beginning) every cat can become fun little kitties. Older cats usually are more set in their ways, but they have their routines and know what they want, so you dont have to constantly analyze and raise a kitten. I&#039;ll say this, watching him grow up was truly surreal. Seeing how small he was when I got him where he had to climb up his scratching post, to being taller than it. Him being able to make jumps he couldn&#039;t before, getting stronger while playing, there truly is nothing like it.

Apparently this can be anal glands or something, but vet yesterday said it should be his lower back and gave him a cortisone shot (didn&#039;t even look at his ass though). It didn&#039;t really do anything since he already slid on the floor again twice, but on another note his appetite seems to have been down since the weekend too. Given that cortisone supposedly boosts appetite, him still barely touching his food and not even whining for something to eat really worries me. We had a cat that started eating less and being less energetic only to die in her sleep not too long after. He&#039;s also being too low energy for his usual self.<br>Now, he also barely has any teeth left, and never had the healthiest mouth, so I&#039;m not sure if that might be related, though he&#039;s been on wet food ever since he got the last set of teeth taken out and that hasn&#039;t changed.

Now we have hundreds of sites cluttering the searches most with no concern over the quality, just trying to maximize revenue. My strategy is to check the sites and see how much bulshit they have on other topics, if they have lots of wrong information in general then you better not trust them at all. There are some sites that are very rigorous on the conditions and try to push that you must keep the fish in the exact supposed conditions of the habitat the fish lives in while others are way too lenient and gives you the bare minimal for the fish survive in the short/medium term. For example hillstream loaches are from rivers with a strong current and highly oxygenated water and try to replicate that environment for them is an admirable effort but I have seen many people relating being able to keep and breed them in tanks with no water current at all. If it were just one or two claiming that without providing much details or evidence I would suspect it is just another person spreading disinformation but since there are so many there should be a reason for that. Natural habitats are constantly changing and rivers go through cycles where the water volume, speed and parameters change. It would make sense that even if it stay in the same area all year long sometimes it would be in a strong current holding tightly on rocks to stay in place but other times with a lower water level and volume it could find itself in calmer pockets in the margin of the river so it makes sense that they could be more adaptable than some people give them credit. If they had to compete for resources with species optimized for calm waters they would be at disadvantage in those habitats but they usually don&#039;t need to compete in aquariums.", "filename": "River-branch-pond-fish-lake-water1.jpg-", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1018, "h": 689, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1675332608649122, "time": 1675332608, "md5": "JKiNaFzlSVf3ZSebz6sOIw==", "fsize": 65229, "resto": 4423259}, {"no": 4426262, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)06:23:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I want more plants...", "time": 1675337034, "resto": 4423259}, {"no": 4426265, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)06:25:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4426262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4426262</a><br>Fuck forgot the image", "filename": "IMG_8219", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1672, "h": 1254, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675337121076768, "time": 1675337121, "md5": "hDw3hgEoKYrX+Wdn4MSK5Q==", "fsize": 707858, "resto": 4423259}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 4419754, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)10:03:47", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/fox/ - Fox General", "com": "teef edition.<br>previous: <a href=\"/an/thread/4407117#p4407117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4407117</a>", "filename": "1610655907928", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 628, "h": 639, "tn_w": 245, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674659027701864, "time": 1674659027, "md5": "bKCaQQQT70PbCt81MDCfwg==", "fsize": 71602, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "fox-fox-general", "replies": 153, "images": 113, "unique_ips": 41}, {"no": 4419766, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)10:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Uhh...

They diverged too long ago for that. The most primitive plants, mosses and liverworts, don&#039;t have roots or flowers at all. They&#039;re basically a mass of photosynthesis capable cells that can regenerate from even a tiny cutting. <br><br>If you want to gain an appreciation for plants, I&#039;d look into their history foremost. They were the first living things to leave the oceans and conquer the land, in the process they literally terraformed the whole planet. Mosses covered the world, pumping the atmosphere full of oxygen. For fifty million years trees ruled the continents, there weren&#039;t even organisms capable of breaking down wood yet. Dead trees simply built up on the forest floor, their mighty corpses totally impervious to other life (this is the origin of coal btw). All complex life relies on plants binding the suns energy through photosynthesis. <br><br>Human culture itself only really came about once we settled down and started tending to plants. Surely this is also where some part of our fascination with them stems from. For ten thousand years, our lives and civilizations were (and continue to be) dependent on people living in sync with their crop plants. Deep knowledge of plants and their culture has been passed down for generations, one the most essential things for survival.

Cats are prey animals to any medium or larger canine, as well as prey animals to other felines. Everything eats cats - cheetahs, jaguars, servals, painted wolves, hyenas, lions, crocodiles, birds of prey, etc. It&#039;s why they&#039;re always skittish and try and remain undetected, not just when they hunt. This has nothing to do with pitbulls. The only way pitbulls are special here is they will continue killing a cat if it stands up for itself and fights back, when most dogs will fall for the bluff and give up.<br><br>Greyhounds are considered gentle natured, non-aggressive dogs ideal for families but are major cat killers. Even herding dogs will kill cats. A dog doesn&#039;t recognize the difference between a cat and a rabbit unless purposefully socialized to, and even then they will slip up and act out their instincts. Both are small, edible, and kick and claw when cornered.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I swear my dog is meant to be nice</span><br>If you would not raise a cat with a rat without expecting the cat to kill the rat you should not place cats with medium and larger dogs.

Not only do they look like adorable little angels, they also have the personalities of ones as well. Chick-on-chick infanticide is relatively rare in this species, and on top of that the siblings are known to share their given meals with each other. All the more impressive taking into consideration that they live in an environment that is only slightly more forgiving than the polar ice caps, or planet Hoth. <br><br>The species are sexually dimorphic to better suit their familial roles.

Oftentimes the trap breaks the lower spine, not the neck and causes the little vermin a great deal of pain before it finally dies. It is absolutely necessary to kill them as soon as you can, and in my mind, if you must kill, do it quickly and cleanly as you can. If you can see one, there are probably several you don&#039;t see, so keep setting traps until it&#039;s been days since you got one. Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can. If you hesitate or show mercy, not only will they fuck your world, you will end up having to kill far far more of them in the future. I am listening to rat scratches in the ceiling right now.

Throughout the nymph stages they aren&#039;t even that bad, they just need it hot and dry in a well-ventilated cage. Once they are subadult it gets more tricky because they need a lot higher humidity and the final molts are just generally risky and ultimately involve some luck to not go badly, which is why keeping a bunch of them helps so that a mismolt doesn&#039;t completely screw you over. When I kept them I self-built netcages with branches glued to the top for better gripping during molts, that worked quite well. Breeding just didn&#039;t work out for me because I ended up with only one male, who grew faster than the females and was already a geriatric by the time they became ready to mate and he couldn&#039;t connect despite his willingness to do so.<br><br>Other empusids like Blepharopsis mendica and Gongylus gongylodes are cool alternatives that are less expensive and demanding, but somewhat similar to them.", "filename": "IMG_1249", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1815, "h": 1361, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674918435197686, "time": 1674918435, "md5": "VfEzYHp/ThB09S66oX3qyA==", "fsize": 565058, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422502, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:09:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422419</a><br>no i made the thread!<br>my thread is for cute bugs only i am racist against the scary bugs!", "time": 1674925785, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422510, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)12:25:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422502</a>", "filename": "3d8ea12af24b19a6827f5497d6cc2ec54701a49dr1-1024-768v2_uhq", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674926722874865, "time": 1674926722, "md5": "I3XlwU7eowD7bIJxL3zFNA==", "fsize": 40559, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422747, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422445</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve seen Americans ask for like $40</span><br>Shit last time I saw them for sale they were $100 each, $40 is what I&#039;d expect for something like an orchid mantis but that would seem incredibly cheap for Idolomantis", "time": 1674952455, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422750, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)19:44:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422747</a><br>mantidkingdom.com sells them for $40, according to their store page they&#039;re gonna have hatches in the coming months.", "time": 1674953076, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422763, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:09:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422750</a><br>Interesting, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s where I&#039;d seen them for $100 a while back I guess they must have had more success breeding more of them since then", "time": 1674954560, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4422913, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)22:47:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I walked around my garden and picked up insects that have been infesting my plants recently<br>I flung them into some spider webs and I saw the spiders come out of their leaf and bite them<br>Feels good man, fucking bastards deserve it", "filename": "1661690336064", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 473, "h": 366, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1674964055647611, "time": 1674964055, "md5": "j0oj/4giKn62uzVeV0FeOA==", "fsize": 20861, "resto": 4413075}, {"no": 4424572, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)03:30:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4422913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4422913</a><br>I go one step further.
