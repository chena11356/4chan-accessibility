There are virtually no good reasons for doing it. No evidence suggests that neuting will solve any behavioral issues or health expectancy. Your dog will certainly get fat more easily and only think about food. He will be lazy, prone for diabetes and there is a chance his loss in testosterone may make him fearful and less balanced in character around other dogs/new situations. Unless you have a intact female dog in the same household there is literally no reason. And a daycare shure as shit is certainly not one eaither. Just because ever other owner in your area castrates or neuters does not make it right. Around my area (in Europe ) it is far more normal not to neuter and dogs are just fine. Learn to control your dog around other females (be strict about it) and ask if they are in heat when you meet other owners. Besides, if every female in your area is not intact (which seems to me the case) there is even less reason to neuter, cause who the fuck should he impregnate? <br><br>If you irreversibly mutilate your dog simply for the sake of putting him into a daycare you do not deserve to own a dog.

If you find lichen like Xanthoria growing on old stone and scrape a small portion away (not much since they take hundreds of years to grow), you&#039;ll see that there is actually a pit underneath where they&#039;ve degraded the material.<br><br>Another example of mineral degradation is seen very commonly in mycorrhizal fungi, those that associate in a symbiotic relationship with tree roots. To make this symbiosis mutually beneficial, there has to be a give and take between the two partners. Since fungi are capable of quickly degrading and cracking stone through a combo of hydraulic pressure and acids, they will actually tunnel straight into rocks to obtain phosphorous and essential metals, minerals bound into rocks to a point where trees and other organisms are totally incapable of sequestering them. We were finding small micro-tunnels in rocks all around the world before we finally made the connection that mycorrhizal fungi had been digging.<br>Nothing else in the food web is capable of releasing the phosphorous bound into these minerals, and often times whole forest ecosystems only exist because of the P freed up by mycorrhizal fungi, which goes to the trees, which then filters out into the rest of the web. Here is a good article on that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://blogs.scientificamerican.c<wbr>om/artful-amoeba/the-world-s-larges<wbr>t-mining-operation-is-run-by-fungi/<wbr></span>", "filename": "Fungi Tunnels", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 533, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673418263458345, "time": 1673418263, "md5": "cstL6mD4Ip0PPdffBt1+dA==", "fsize": 331956, "resto": 4404183}, {"no": 4405686, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)01:25:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4405504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4405504</a><br>I&#039;m actually not sure about good East Coast guides.

There is a whole worldwide and growing group of Mushroom Dyer&#039;s. In most areas, they offer way more of a color range in pigments than plants do. In my eyes it is another way to take advantage of their biochemical potency, but natural dyer&#039;s more appreciate them for their beautiful shades. Here is some yarn I dyed with two of the mushrooms I mentioned, the green and yellow are Phaeolus schweinitzii (Dyer&#039;s Polypore), and the red is Lobster. <br><br>The Xanthoria lichen I mentioned is really interesting. The typical method involves &quot;fermenting&quot; (not an actual biological fermentation, the pH is too high), the lichen in ammonia for a few weeks to months, and then soaking your yarn/silk in the liquor. It produces a very vibrant cotton candy pink, but if the yarn is exposed to sunlight while damp from the dye, it will quickly turn a sort of cotton candy blue. Once dry the color is stable either way. Unfortunately there isn&#039;t a good paper out yet on what exactly is going on chemistry wise, but that&#039;s one thing I&#039;m interested in researching. At first I was convinced the shift to pink (parietin is yellow at neutral pH) was simply pH based, since many other anthraquinone pigments shift to reds or violets at a high pH, but so far the TLC (thin-layer-chromatography) I&#039;ve done has actually supported the formation of a new pigment.

Technically, &quot;mating types&quot;. There are two major systems used in fungi which determine how this is organized. Many Ascomycetes (one of two major groups in kingdom fungi) have bipolar mating, where there are essentially two mating types, a roughly 50/50 ratio. This isn&#039;t determined by a whole chromosome as with humans, just a couple gene regions on one chromosome that has to do with pheromone production and detectors. These basically have two sexes. In contrast, the other major group that contains most of what we consider mushrooms, gills/stem/cap etc, are tetrapolar. They have two gene regions with two major alleles each. This means there are basically four sites available for variation. I&#039;ll try to simplify, but because some species have literally hundreds of alleles for these four sites, which means that you can quickly multiple to have 10&#039;s, even 100&#039;s of thousands of different mating types, or &quot;sexes&quot;. <br>The whole point of the tetrapolar mating system is to promote outbreeding and prevent inbreeding. In order for two unmated strains to be compatible, they have to have different allelles at both sites, which means that inbreeding compatibility is only about 25%, while outcrossing compatibility with a new parent is basically 100%, since nobody but siblings is likely to ever share one of these alleles.<br><br><a href=\"#p4407573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4407573</a><br>Yeah, I basically stick to Facebook.<br><br><a href=\"#p4407587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4407587</a><br>It is global.

Both are great ways to get started working with them as organisms, and open up other options for actual mycology further down the line.

I had always been pretty outdoorsy and science focused, and it started bugging me I didn&#039;t know much about them. After learning some basic ID and biology, I really got sucked in once I started getting involved in their cultivation. Specifically, once I learned how easy it was to clone and start growing wild fungi to add to a culture bank, it got out of control. It was sort of like Pokemon, where I would have to spend hours searching specific habitats to find rare or interesting species with cool properties, and then try my hand and cross my fingers at cloning, hoping I could &quot;capture&quot;. I got involved in a mycoremediation project at my college and it sort of spiraled from there. Local mycological society chapters, and the enormous worldwide community on Facebook, sucked me in to a point of no return. It is basically my life now, where I spend the two mushroom seasons in spring and summer traveling from event to event teaching classes and giving talks.

Some of the others produce mycotoxins.<br>The key thing with Stachybotrys is that it doesn&#039;t produce airborne spores effectively. For them to get airborne and pose a respiratory risk you need the area to dry out after being damp, and for it to be disturbed substantially. So during remediation and cleaning it poses the biggest risk. Stachybotrys chilling in your crawlspace without disturbance doesn&#039;t likely pose a big danger. Touching or handling it isn&#039;t a great idea.<br>However, basically all molds pose a serious allergen risk in general, where their presence can cause inflammatory reactions to those nearby. Aspergillus is especially bad about that, since it does produce airborne spores and can contaminate a household or indoor space.

Spring for Advantage Multi - it&#039;s a flea, tick, and heartworm preventative.<br><br>Ferrets can tolerate high heat and humidity for an hour or two, but their coats are thick and any prolonged period of exposure to high heat (85 F or higher) puts them at risk for heatstroke.<br><br> It&#039;s a good idea to have a cage to keep them in, even in a ferret-proof room or rooms. Ferret Nation and Critter Nation cages are expensive but very secure. This way, you can confine them for flea treatment (so they don&#039;t lick it off each other&#039;s fur while it&#039;s still damp) or put them up if you need to do something in their room and don&#039;t want them getting underfoot.<br><br>On that note until about age 6, they like to get underfoot while you&#039;re moving around near them, which is bad for their safety. Put them up if you have to do anything in their room that requires lots of walking around. If you&#039;re just moving a little bit, shuffle slowly around them, don&#039;t stomp, run or make big strides. You&#039;ll probably still catch them with your feet on occasion, but if you&#039;re shuffling along without lifting your feet, it shouldn&#039;t do more than mildly discomfort them. Still, be very careful. Getting stepped on is the leading cause of death for pet ferrets.<br><br>Ferrets can play-bite hard enough to be painful, but I&#039;ve never had one draw blood. They rarely bite unless they&#039;re playing with you, and again, they won&#039;t draw blood on a human. If they do bite unprovoked, they can be gently disciplined by grabbing the scruff of their neck and dragging them backwards for a foot or so, or by locking them in their cage briefly.

Jingly toys, shiny toys, tubes and tunnels, plastic balls, sandboxes to dig in. (No rubber or foam rubber, though. Intestinal blockage hazard.) They&#039;re curious, playful creatures, and this is a large part of their charm. Don&#039;t bother getting remote-controlled cat toys - unlike a cat, once a ferret grabs a toy, it&#039;ll probably carry it off and cache it somewhere.<br><br>You&#039;re the best ferret toy your ferrets have, though. Dangle a sock in front of them and watch them leap at it, or drag it around for them to pounce on. Use your hands to wrestle with them and rub their tummies. Hold them down and nuzzle them.

You can find translucent ferret tubes online that let you watch them scoot around, or you can get a dryer vent tube from the hardware store, which should be cheaper but opaque.<br><br>Bedding: Ferrets like hammocks, blankets, and clothing. Anything that they can bury themselves in and snooze. This includes your bed, but they&#039;ve got a nasty habit of burrowing under the mattress pad. (Pic related. If yours share a bedroom with you, look out for this type of lump before sitting/laying down.)<br><br>Be careful when getting bedding, though. Anything with foam rubber or soft plastic should be avoided.<br><br>Ferrets live 7-11 years, if you get them young and give them healthy food from the start. They can get human respiratory illnesses - flu, COVID, etc. Ferrets can be vaccinated for rabies and distemper. The distemper vaccine is a must-have because ferrets die from it very easily.<br><br>In short, they&#039;re good pets if you&#039;re willing to be neurotic about their safety.

I heard doing that has great results, because the animal sees the re-introduction as a completely new introduction to a toy.

The most promising such concerns the tail: the tail represents a unit that, unlike segments, CAN be duplicated. A stable mutation for a duplicated or bifurcated tail could serve as basis by which these tails take (especially in arboreal animals) on more grasping and other manipulative/tactile jobs (i.e. their use as a surface contacting and even load bearing organ is established). These duplicated prehensile tails could eventually wander more to the sides of the body plan, and optionally via chance come to resemble hands or feet.

In a next step, these outgrowths can be adapted for novel tasks vaguely related to manipulation or locomotion.

reassigned twice lol. Reversal is still a reassignment no matter how pedantic you want to be. <br><br>The wiki tree still withholds Sha. sikannensis from the derived group including the confirmed edentulous form. If you want to claim that its second reassignment back to Guanlingsaurus is to a less derived form, then I guess you&#039;ll have to use Ji et al. 2013, which not only recovers sikanniensis as Shonisaurus (so, toothed), but also doesn&#039;t hold onto Guanlingsaurus and Shastasaurus as sister taxa, with Shasta being the more derived. Considering that edentulism isn&#039;t the ancestral form, and that there&#039;s zero evidence it was evolved and then secondarily lost somewhere between Guanling and Shoni, that leaves us with zero evidence that Shasta was edentulous.<br><br>Returning to Sander&#039;s paper, he all but outright says that Shastasaurus sikanniensis was probably toothed, and he still decided to keep it under Shasta instead of recovering it back to Shoni.

weight to dive bomb upon the fish but get this: It uses it&#039;s sail to intentionally create drag to control it&#039;s momentum underwater and reduce oscillation for more precise and accurate snatching of fish. <br><br>This is one of the few hypothesis that actually explains what every part of Spinosaurus does without contradicting or just assuming something is for display.

Recent discovery of the high-spined tail of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that S. aegyptiacus was the first fully aquatic dinosaur. The \u2018aquatic hypothesis\u2019 posits that S. aegyptiacus was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and flesh models of S. aegyptiacus. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a posable flesh model. That model shows that on land S. aegyptiacus was bipedal and in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (&lt;1 m/s) too buoyant to dive.</span>", "time": 1673656132, "resto": 4408450}, {"no": 4408469, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:32:04", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Fjt36HKX0AEIqgS", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 4023, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673656324217931, "time": 1673656324, "md5": "EEzyUA41ISi7HKjcPKHfJg==", "fsize": 3363376, "resto": 4408450}, {"no": 4408470, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:33:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4408468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4408468</a><br>Yep.<br><br>you think the author&#039;s conclusions matter because you don&#039;t understand their math or the assumptions it&#039;s based on.<br><br>that&#039;s funny stuff.", "time": 1673656381, "resto": 4408450}, {"no": 4408472, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)19:35:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4408450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4408450</a><br>I think their sail was purely sexual.

Say the 2 lineages you have identified share a dozen major character states not found in the proposed ancestors. This by itself essentially refutes your hypothesis by itself. But each of those character states consists of multiple individual evolutionary events. The fusion of 3 bones into 1 requires at least 2 intermediate events.

So we look at bird embryos and find that bird sternums are actually made from the 2 existing dinosaur sterna plus 5 new bones that aren&#039;t found in their ancestors. These 7 bones fuse into one to make the sternum, and it&#039;s the same 7 bones in each lineage of modern bird.

The mother was dewormed at the 50th day of pregnancy and has all vaccines up to date.<br>I didn&#039;t really take a pregnant dog in but I was desperate enough to pretend to be less of a dumbass than one who ended up allowing his dog to get pregnant.<br>I was a bit worried because the mother was not lactating shortly after birthing the pups but by the next morning (the last birth was at 2 AM) things were &quot;fine&quot;. I&#039;ve been weighting them since that morning and so far all survivors have been gaining 12-15% more weight every morning, something that I hope is a good sign.<br><br>Sadly the first puppy was stillborn, after allowing the mother to lick it for a long time I tried to stimulate it with a slightly warm wet towel but to no avail. One of the pups had even lost weight by the second day I weighted them which was a red flag, another was the the mother had set her aside at the a shaded corner of the garden (summer shithole). I did my best to push her into suckling a teat the biggest puppy used many times but at most she seemed to reflexively just open her mouth to breathe instead of sucking like all her litter mates were doing fine. The mother still licked both her ends when I reintroduced her. I resorted to using a syringe with a special formula for newborns a vet gave me. She started growing colder so I kept her in a warm box and tried to keep her fed and gently massaged her like I was instructed to. She improved for the next 6 hours but after some short whining, she became unresponsive and I failed to resurrect her Thursday night. I feel like the death of this poor thing was on me, I should have probably noticed that she hadn&#039;t fed properly in the first night.<br>The one silver lining is that the mother seems a lot less stressed now.

Whether or not the term pit bull is used as an umbrella term, which is perfectly legitimate in American English, it changes nothing. BSL should and usually does target all breeds historically used for bull baiting, fighting, and guard dog duty. These breeds are effectively weapons, and were never intended to live anywhere with moderate population density. They were caged 80% of their lives because the men who bred these dogs originally understood their purpose. Only idiot pit mommies and Serbians are confused about this. Ironically, the retarded hicks who still fight dogs in the backwoods are more responsible and sane owners. <br><br>Pit bulls are discussed most frequently in America because our country has a history of dog fighting. Guard dogs are probably more dangerous, but there&#039;s not a million cane corsos with behavioral problems in American shelters, there&#039;s a million pit bulls.

Just wanted to clear up this misunderstanding between laboratory animals and general albino feeders, if people are interested in rescuing. Laboratory rats cost b/w $300-$2000 per rat. In labs they&#039;re housed in shoe box sized tanks with only the barred roof for ventilation. It&#039;s only cleaned once a week, but even with the immense ammonia buildup these rats never succumb to respiratory illness. Probably the only advantage of having biomedical research grade sprague dawleys.

After the op they\u2019ll keep her in for a few hours to make sure she\u2019s okay, before calling you to collect. For my vets I usually drop them off at 9am and get the call to come pick them up around 4pm. Usually they can come home the same day, but if they\u2019ve pulled out their stitches they may stay in overnight so they can be restitched. If they pull out their stitches the second time, provided the wound is clean and dry you might as well take them home. It\u2019s a bit more work post-care, but as some rats tear their stitches due to distress being back home in a familiar environment can help calm them down.<br><br>When she comes home she may still be a little woozy from the anaesthetic, which can be upsetting if you\u2019re used to her being an active rat. This will wear off in a few hours and she\u2019ll be back to normal. In the meantime let her rest in a quiet environment (a snuggle pouch on your lap is great), and offer her a spoon of watered down baby food/yoghurt; she won\u2019t have eaten or drank in a while so it will help. Make sure it\u2019s nothing chewy or sticky as she\u2019ll lack coordination at first, you don\u2019t want her to choke.<br><br>She should spend the first night back home in a hospital cage (more on that later). Be prepared to stay up late. Some rats are as good as gold with their stitches, some are terrors that will be obsessed with pulling them out. You won\u2019t know what she\u2019s like until the painkillers from the op wear off that evening. If she starts worrying her wound (pulling and chewing, not just grooming) you\u2019ll have to keep interrupting her until she settles. Try distracting with food, play, and cuddles.

Some people say the dogs only fight until one yelps or gives up, which sounds more humane, but fight dogs are bred for &quot;gameness&quot; above anything else. Which is basically the temperament to never, ever give up even if half their face is hanging off and they&#039;re on the edge of death. I would be surprised if Japanese dogmen are any different from western ones. My guess is they breed game dogs too. I&#039;ve read a handful of first hand accounts that say Japanese dog fighting is just as bloody as you&#039;d expect.

You said you want jungle val, which is typically grown in shallow waters. That means it will get alot of sunlight and alot of CO2. Not sure what your point about plants growing the swamps is because I never mentioned them?

To me it just sounds like you&#039;re stretching a little truth into a bigger misunderstanding. I beleive some plants grow like that or have that ability, but by and large the majority pull CO2 in with their leaves and nutrients through their roots. Seems like just because the exceptions exist in plants that adapted to survive in inclimate conditions, then you want to say it applies broadly to most freshwater plants, which is what I don&#039;t agree with. Roots just don&#039;t have the same efficiency as leaves, even if they can pull in CO2, this is just my experience, but of the aquatic plants I&#039;ve seen that photosynthesizing, they were pearling at the leaves, not shooting gas bubbles up from the substrate. This kind of goes back to choking out the dirt and more specifically the bacteria in the substrate that need some oxygen. I would think Val especially uses its leaves for CO2 uptake far more than it&#039;s roots. Everytime I grow jungle val, it doesn&#039;t take off until the first leaf hits the surface, then it blows up. Conversely, I&#039;ve killed batches of jungle val I constantly trimmed to be shorter than the surface, to keep from blocking light out. Not to mention when the leaves hit the surface, they get almost 2-3x as big, in order to be able to uptake more CO2. Pic related is my buddy&#039;s tank with some Val I gave him. Notice how thick the leaves are at the surface compared to the shoot coming out of the gravel. There&#039;s no dirt in this tank either, so not much carbin in the substrate relatively.<br><br>Your statement also of begs the questions why can&#039;t you grow val well as a floating plant, and why more carbon rich substrates aren&#039;t available, rather than gas diffusers that dissolve into the water, while there&#039;s plenty of nutrient rich substrates and additives?", "filename": "20220925_162819", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 2268, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673708116050337, "time": 1673708116, "md5": "JHH3HC6llrq/3wzP+0vdTw==", "fsize": 2756566, "resto": 4402761}, {"no": 4408993, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:03:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4408988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4408988</a><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC2707917/<br><br>Here&#039;s about the only study I could find on it.
