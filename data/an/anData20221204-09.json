The sheer level of fraud in the fossil trade in china combined with the desperate fumbling of baizuo faggots to defend it has made me re-evaluate a lot of things.

I&#039;m also taking a more skeptical look at traditionally accepted animals like Mamenchisaurus and the similar Omeisaurus, which have WAY too long of necks for how short their tails are.

Research into control theory. The solutions life ran into were rediscovered through human rigor to create ideal control systems which are used extensively in our technology. These systems run things like your circulation and breathing, your hormones which regulate growth across your whole body. They use both positive and negative feedback control, and you can&#039;t just take the negative away. It would be like making a bicycle which can only turn left. You might na\u00efvely think you could just make three lefts for a right and be fine otherwise, but you can&#039;t. The system becomes unstable and you&#039;ll be forced to stay in a hard left bank forever, reentering the zero point within it to retain control, and anything right of that point becomes the &quot;new right&quot;.<br><br>Taking away existing negative feedback creates a fundamentally less stable control system. You will be forced to keep steady positive feedback, and remove some of it to simulate negative feedback. Now you have a worse control system with limited resolution, and anything less than the new zero point of positive feedback just becomes negative feedback with extra steps. Congratulations. If you want a stupid example to better understand, consider the use of opiate drugs. Taking them habitually pushes the needle of positive feedback too far, and the result is a new centering where your natural steady state feels agonizing.<br><br>I am not dragging your ass through an entire college level control theory course to absolutely prove what I&#039;m saying is true when you won&#039;t even concede to some basic biological facts.

What is your opinion about people with rare mutations of the SCN9A gene who exhibit extremely high pain-tolerance? They apparently aren&#039;t the same ones as those patients with congenital analgesia who infamously die young. However, I&#039;ve had a hard time understanding what would distinguish the two. David Pearce alludes to the mutation as though it were a proof of concept for his &quot;gradients of bliss&quot; idea, and I&#039;ve read one interview with a patient that seems to support him:<br>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/<wbr>2020/01/13/a-world-without-pain<br>Importantly, she has kids, which goes a long way to undermine the idea that suffering is an evolutionary necessity. However she&#039;s not behaviorally anywhere close to a normal person, so it isn&#039;t really the case we&#039;re discussing. I&#039;d assume you&#039;re willing to agree that there&#039;s nothing that requires an intelligent organism to suffer in order for it to be successful, but rather, you&#039;d assert that our particular evolutionary history made indispensable use of suffering. Is that right?<br><br>In control system terms, I think the best way of understanding the specific idea that Pearce is getting at is a &quot;positive system&quot;:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posit<wbr>ive_systems<br>Differential rewards exist, but they can only lower you, not cause you to cross the zero point. You might counter by saying this would be experientially the same as suffering. But in my experience at least, I&#039;m familiar with instances of going from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;n-1&quot; without crossing zero, and I can even imagine all of my &quot;negative&quot; experiences working that way.

Bigger eyespots were probably favored, frightening predators away by masquerading as a larger animal instead of just hiding the head.<br>Once all of the caterpillars had frightening eyespots, natural selection favored the most frightening ones.

There are no levels in the traditional sense, as you instead use your cumulative exp to spec into different stats individually. Once a stat is maxed out you are given the option to evolve. Enemies evolve at the same pace as you, so make sure to have a balanced character. Each new creature you evolve into has unique moves in combat and over world hazard resistances. It is also possible to evolve into an evolutionary dead end. Doing this is one of the ways to get a bad ending, which there are many of. These endings are just meant to be jokes, and you are not penalized for getting them.
