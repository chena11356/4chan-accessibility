A temperate planet is MUCH worse for life than a tropical one. And get this: dinosaurs evolved VERY VERY slowly. They were amazing animals, but the largest land mammal that ever lived came into being when mammals were only dominant for ~35 million years. During the same amount of time after dinosaurs came into being, they were barely still differentiating into the most primitive versions of the groups they would later become known for. They also didn&#039;t diversify that much. Mammals have filled almost every niche on the planet. While Dinosaurs had competition with other reptiles that mammals don&#039;t, that&#039;s still not enough to explain their lack of diversity away.

Understory jungle plants can be placed further back, but not too far - for example, five metres away from a window is really stretching it if you want it to survive longterm. But then it also depends on how large the windows are and what type of glass they&#039;re made of, and the colour of your walls and even your furniture also plays a role, and so on. My advice will always be to give your plants as much light as you possibly can, and if after several weeks/months (during the growing season) you still notice them struggling with sunburn, and you&#039;re sure you didn&#039;t underwater them or let some pest wreak havoc, then you can take the struggling plants a bit further away from the window, but again, not too far.
