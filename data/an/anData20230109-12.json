It always starts out as play, but as the bigger one has gotten fed up with it every time he deals with it a little more roughly.

I got a little scared that maybe these weren&#039;t deer bones after all, so I looked at a PDF online of how to tell if they&#039;re deer or human bones, and I think I clearly found a humerus and it looks long and slender like a human&#039;s. Should I report this to the cops? Are these just deer bones and I&#039;m just scaring myself?

However their digestion suffers if they eat non-dense food such as bread, which you can solve by soaking. Young chickens should have medicated food to build up their immunity. You should also mix calcium in their food such as broken eggshells, calcium is very important to their diets and they can become egg bound and die without it.

Whether or not the term pit bull is used as an umbrella term, which is perfectly legitimate in American English, it changes nothing. BSL should and usually does target all breeds historically used for bull baiting, fighting, and guard dog duty. These breeds are effectively weapons, and were never intended to live anywhere with moderate population density. They were caged 80% of their lives because the men who bred these dogs originally understood their purpose. Only idiot pit mommies and Serbians are confused about this. Ironically, the retarded hicks who still fight dogs in the backwoods are more responsible and sane owners. <br><br>Pit bulls are discussed most frequently in America because our country has a history of dog fighting.

The breed was specifically created to be a personal protection dog due to the high crime rate in Brazil.

Place it in the problem area with something next to it to act as a step so that the mice can jump up onto the rim of the bowl, and leave it overnight. The mice will smell the peanut oil and will jump into the bowl looking for food. Once they&#039;re in the oil pool they won&#039;t be able to jump back out and you can collect them and do whatever you want with them in the morning. It sounds dumb but this is far and away the most effective method I&#039;ve ever personally used to live-catch mice without hurting them. <br><br>You can fill a plastic tub with around an inch of of warm water mixed with a bit of mild dish soap and let them run around for a few minutes to get any oil off them and they&#039;ll be none the worse for wear. Just make sure they can run around with their heads above water so you don&#039;t accidentally drown them. <br><br>Once you&#039;ve caught them you can either release them, keep them, or euthanize them, but that&#039;s up to you. If you do want to keep or release them, check them for weird lumps, wounds, or sores. Lots of mice are carriers for some pretty horrendous parasites, and if you find any sick ones then you&#039;ll be doing them and the other mice a favor by putting them down.

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items. This guy breeds most of the mentioned species in this post (esp the Knobby Newt) and will probably have them ready in 4 to 5 months (assuming you&#039;re in North America): https://www.tritonnewts.com/availab<wbr>ility", "filename": "IMG_0930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671474788638776, "time": 1671474788, "md5": "RrpZxv+XR/hruaVr7XoARA==", "fsize": 127714, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385111, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hawaii totally forbids importing foreign reptiles</span><br>Note also that there are no native reptiles in hawaii unless you count oceanic ones like sea turtles and sea snakes.", "time": 1671474806, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385131, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br>I thought Florida only banned a handful of them like Niles, which you&#039;d never really want to own anyway", "time": 1671476090, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385157, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385131</a><br>they&#039;re working on banning literally everything right now. not joking", "time": 1671478570, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW no 1500sqf basement to turn into an ultimate animal room like Canadians and east coast people</span><br>It&#039;s not fucking fair", "time": 1671478898, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385168, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:52:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385160</a><br>Yea I&#039;ve always been butt hurt that basements aren&#039;t a thing here.

It&#039;s not popular, and it&#039;s banned in the most populated prefectures, but it&#039;s totally above-board. There isn&#039;t a lot of good info in English. Some people say the dogs only fight until one yelps or gives up, which sounds more humane, but fight dogs are bred for &quot;gameness&quot; above anything else. Which is basically the temperament to never, ever give up even if half their face is hanging off and they&#039;re on the edge of death. I would be surprised if Japanese dogmen are any different from western ones. My guess is they breed game dogs too.

One day the sister managed to knead a hole in a window screen and jumped from the ledge to the tree to the ground and promptly ran into the street and was struck and killed... The brother cat just shut down when sister didn&#039;t come home. Spent the first night and next day yowling, the second half of day two and then all of night two searching, meowing everywhere inquisitively, then the third day trying to get outside despite never having been outside. By day 4 he was visibly weak because he hadn&#039;t been eating or drinking at all despite me trying to lead him to his food many times so he was laying around more than he was searching around. I took him to the emergency vet who said he was &quot;fine&quot; but showed signs of shutting down from his 4-day fast. Recommended me to try my best to feed and comfort him. Took him home and he just stayed where I placed him in his bed, would meow longingly when I would pet him. I took him from his bed and into mine where he would have more room and fed him with one of those cat treat lick things and gave water with a baster. He refused pretty much all of it but took a little from a couple licks but he kept his mouth closed for the water. Tried again in the morning but same thing. Throughout day 5 I tried many times to drip water carefully from the baster and entice him to drink but he would meow in his longing way and turn his head, with a lot of effort. It looked like it was hurting him. At the very very end, he did lick a few drops of water though. So sadly, I think he was gradually leaving his manic &quot;sister gone&quot; state and rediscovered some want to live, but it was too late. He did not survive the night despite my efforts. He basically just went to sleep and died at the end. I think it&#039;s good for them to have bonds because it greatly enriches the cat&#039;s lives but from my experience if they bond they can&#039;t live alone.", "time": 1672444966, "resto": 4394323}, {"no": 4395050, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:13:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Are cats a bad pet for a first time pet owner?", "time": 1672445616, "resto": 4394323}, {"no": 4395081, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:36:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4395045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4395045</a><br>Damn, this is the sort of thing I&#039;m afraid of happening, I&#039;ll have to think on it a bit more seriously.

Always calm, very independent, relatively indifferent to affection. I later made the decision to adopt a pair of sisters, being informed by my previous experiences. I really do believe that cats and other animals can benefit from being around a same species friend and it shows in the cats I have now. Always together, always playing or watching the other play, sharing food, sharing windows, they deeply value affection, they desire closeness, that kind of thing. I know they&#039;re developing a terminal bond but I don&#039;t intend on them being separated or being in danger of being separated.

He keeps following me around, sitting in front of me and staring at me like on the pic. He\u2019s an outside cat so he doesn\u2019t need me to let him poop or something.

How can I help him? Does he just want scratches?

He randomly came here when he was very young and he\u2019s been staying around the house eversince.

He\u2019s such a gentle soul that when the other cats were hunting he just laid there in the sun enjoying nature. So even though he\u2019s not my cat i was his first human friend and we\u2019ve been friends for almost 2 decades. Last year he stopped eating for a while. I came here and stayed with him \u201cforcing\u201d him to eat and handfeeding him until he got better. It was almost like he ate to make me happy. He would look at me everytime he took a bite.

He used to panic when he fell \u201ctrapped\u201d inside the house. The person who\u2019s part of my family doesn\u2019t care much and her husband, even though he is affectionate towards the cats, still sees them as working animals and doesn\u2019t want to spend money on them for anything other than food. He only took this cat to the vet because his eye was hanging out of the socket. The vet removed the eye and said he can\u2019t do anything about the other stuff. Even though i love this old little man i don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to put him down though. At least they spay/neuter them now.

Amanos are even easier than neos though they need saltwater to successfully reproduce. Caridina cantonensis aka bee shrimp have several color morphs and some are extremely inbred (in particular, crystal reds). In general they are less fecund which means their colonies end up being relatively more fragile. MOST bee shrimp morphs are not that much harder to keep than cherry shrimp provided you get the water parameters right. Aquasoils are sold as a canned solution to get the water right, and IMO they are worth it for bee shrimp. <br>A lot of the other exotic caridinas like cardinals both have small founding populations for the captive population and are generally from a very narrow range compared to both neocaridina and bee shrimp.<br><br>My experience is that as long as you have some calcium in the water or are getting calcium to them in supplemental food, neos do not care about pH. You may lose some in adjustment but I have kept and bred them in a sub 6pH tank. I have also kept them on a 50% crushed coral substrate.

It&#039;s hard to tell from the pic but there&#039;d actually very little room behind the wooden piece, only enough for one row of plants. My idea was to leave the one up front to flourish and propagate, then bring all the cuttings I take off it into the back. I also like having a single one in front because i like the look of the plant and want one up there as a sort of centerpiece. Also makes it look more natural to have it &quot;weave&quot; with the driftwood.<br><br>The intention grass on the right is obvious enough. I&#039;ll let it grow in amongst the rock formation.

Nowadays you have to:<br><br>- Put the nostrils on wrong and make them look as much like mammal nostrils as possible. There has NEVER been any evidence that all vertebrates have nostrils as far down and forward as will fit on the face. This is some shit one retard made up and now everyone follows.<br>- Put Theropod hands on backwards. ALL Archosaurs appear to have positioned their hands at roughly a 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 angle to forward. Crocodilians do this now and quadrupedal Dinosaur footprints also show this. This belief that &quot;Theropods couldn&#039;t pronate their hands&quot; comes from a basic misunderstanding about how the carpals are attached to the radius and ulna in Archosaurs. Carpenter WRONGLY just assumed the radius and ulna would lie in the same plane as the carpals and phalanges. A quick look at how Crocodilian hands are constructed shows this is wrong. They are twisted at an angle that puts the hands much more pronated in orientation than supinated.<br>- Cover everything in feathers. Everything.<br>- Always get the feet wrong. Every time.<br>- Make the dinosaur fat.<br>- Add all sorts of balloon shit and other nonsense. While theoretically possible, even among birds, the number of species that have this shit is the minority, and it&#039;s even less so for modern reptiles, so it&#039;s pretty unlikely for anything other than perhaps dewlaps to be present on dinosaurs - and even suspected dewlaps on Hadrosaurs have been proven to be a taphonimic misidentification (the &quot;cockscomb&quot; on Edmontosaurus regalis is likely also wrong for the same reason - skin just slipped off the corpse).<br>- Orient the neck incorrectly &quot;because the bones lie that way naturally&quot; despite basically no animal really doing this.

But featherfags use the term PB to add certainty to their arguments, despite their cladograms shapeshifting radically like transformers every few years. That&#039;s why PB is fucking nonsense. When you say you&#039;re using basic pattern recognition, you&#039;re using the OLD method of sorting these speices. The LINNAEAN method, by which you compare ALL available data and use your judgement to assess relatedness. Cladists don&#039;t DO this. They cherrypick a few traits like ankle shape and get real fucking autistic about it, while ignoring anything that defies the model. That&#039;s how you get things like Pterosaurs nesting INSIDE Dinosauria between literal early Dinosaurs and more &quot;accepted, normal&quot; Dinosaurs, despite them sharing very little in common anatomically with Dinosaurs. Pterosaurs have the wrong number of neck vertebrae, lack a mandibular fenestra (which featherfags have DESPERATELY tried to find over the years), lack a subnarial gap, etc. Don&#039;t pay attention to any of that. Their ankles are similar or something - but don&#039;t look any lower than the ankle! since no Pterosaur foot bears any resemblance to any Archosaur foot.

For 5 months I went once a week, and for 2 months I worked there about 6 days a week full time, then I quit. <br><br>tl;dr: not fun<br><br>Long version:<br>It was extremely stressfull because most the people who &#039;work&#039; there are just afwul retards. The owners are a gay couple, one of whom is the founder of the shelter. Although he didn&#039;t have a degree in anything to do with animals he puts all of his work and effort in to making the shelter as good as possible for the animals, teaching the public, etc. He&#039;s a very nice guy. His husband however, who works there full time as well, is just a lazy piece of shit. The volunteer responsible for the other volunteers was unironically a mentally ill old thing of which you couldn&#039;t tell wether it was a man or a woman, who couldn&#039;t do shit for the animals.<br><br>Most young animals who came in were cared very well for by the volunteers, and suddenly, during the weekends when we didn&#039;t come, they mysteriousely died. A fox, who recovered from getting hit in traffic and was actually good to be released died because they forgot to feed hem.

After the op they\u2019ll keep her in for a few hours to make sure she\u2019s okay, before calling you to collect. For my vets I usually drop them off at 9am and get the call to come pick them up around 4pm. Usually they can come home the same day, but if they\u2019ve pulled out their stitches they may stay in overnight so they can be restitched. If they pull out their stitches the second time, provided the wound is clean and dry you might as well take them home. It\u2019s a bit more work post-care, but as some rats tear their stitches due to distress being back home in a familiar environment can help calm them down.<br><br>When she comes home she may still be a little woozy from the anaesthetic, which can be upsetting if you\u2019re used to her being an active rat. This will wear off in a few hours and she\u2019ll be back to normal. In the meantime let her rest in a quiet environment (a snuggle pouch on your lap is great), and offer her a spoon of watered down baby food/yoghurt; she won\u2019t have eaten or drank in a while so it will help. Make sure it\u2019s nothing chewy or sticky as she\u2019ll lack coordination at first, you don\u2019t want her to choke.<br><br>She should spend the first night back home in a hospital cage (more on that later). Be prepared to stay up late. Some rats are as good as gold with their stitches, some are terrors that will be obsessed with pulling them out. You won\u2019t know what she\u2019s like until the painkillers from the op wear off that evening. If she starts worrying her wound (pulling and chewing, not just grooming) you\u2019ll have to keep interrupting her until she settles. Try distracting with food, play, and cuddles.

Replace whenever you see it soiled. Have two places she can sleep (I use a fabric cube and a hammock), as having a choice can reduce stress. Put food in a bowl to prevent loose pieces catching the wound. A hanging chew bar is a great distraction. A towel over the cage covering at least the sleeping area will help her feel more secure, and also keep the draught out (as she won\u2019t have her companion to snuggle up to to keep warm).<br><br>Put the cage somewhere where you can supervise her- I put it on a side table next to my chair.

In previous, earlier videos, there are young boys around him, that he calls the &quot;kids&quot;. Too bad, that in this current climate, when a man has young male &quot;kids&quot; around him, he falls under suspicion of being a pedohile. That is a shame. He does have young men now, not children, adult men, living with him. He sometimes calls them his sons, but he has not done that lately.

In my opinion, Jamil is a homosexual, a gay man. I believe, that he uses the female adult monkey sexually, that he is intimate with that monkey. If Monkey Shaki was examined by a valid, qualified, professional veterinarian, human sperm matching this man might, perhaps be found in her. IF, that is a big IF, that is the case, he has had the monkey for years and has been using her for a while. And if there was a DNA test, that human sperm, would most likely match this man. He sleeps with the monkey, he kisses her on the lips, he body hugs her, he allows the monkey to lick his body. Something is up.

These were both members of the mirorder Ferae which includes modern Carnivorans and pangolins, and had already evolved the shearing carnassial teeth seen in modern Carnivorans, which gave them dietary benefits over carnivorous ungulates, permitting as they did the more efficient consumption of meat. &#039;Creodont&#039; carnassials were, however, structurally different to modern Carnivoran ones and were probably evolved independently.

Their new carnassials were modified from the last upper premolar and the first lower molar, allowing the rearmost molar teeth to evolve adaptations for feeding on non-meat foods, while &#039;creodonts&#039; had no molars left for non-meat. The early Carnivorans exploited mesocarnivore and omnivore niches, which also meant their limbs adapted to a variety of different lifestyles, and their advanced digitigrade posture lent itself to greater manoeuvrability, meaning they could turn their wrists and forearms inward to trip, slash, or grab prey, while &#039;creodonts&#039;, even digitigrade Hyaenodonts, had limb structures that limited leg movement to a vertical plane, as in ungulates. &#039;Creodonts&#039; relied entirely on their jaws to catch prey, often having a larger and more robust head, and a smaller brain. As Earth transitioned from the Oligocene into the Miocene, the climate began slowly cooling towards the ice ages, increasing the presence of new grasslands and leading ungulates to proliferate in small, agile forms.

Even monogastric perissodactyls like horses evolved high speed and manoeuvrability in this new landscape. During the Middle Miocene, the Antarctic ice sheets began to grow, and shifting ocean currents caused global temperatures to drop. The world was turning towards the ice ages, and C3 grass easily spread in these now dry and cooler plains, and gracile ruminants went with them. Grass evolved to defend itself, filling their leaves and stems with phytoliths - minute bits of silica harvested from the soil that grind down mammalian teeth. In response, ungulates evolved tall-crowned hypsodont teeth that grew constantly and so could be constantly worn down, and the multi-stomach ruminant digestive system to squeeze out what small nutrients grass could provide, and break down troublesome cellulose. These new lineages of giraffes, horses, camels, deer and antelopes were unsuitable prey for Hyaenodonts, but the adaptability and agility of early Carnivorans, as well as their mesocarnivorous and opportunistic diets, led them to eclipse the &#039;creodonts&#039;.

In wheat, the seed of the grain is the part with more nutrients, the kernel is the part with more starch. Separating the germ/bran (seed and outer layer) from the endosperm (fruit) is part of the complex milling process, but it gives the white bread a longer shelf life because it doesn&#039;t contain the oils from the germ/bran that could potentially go rancid. Leave the kernel and seed together, you&#039;ve got brown bread. With barley, oats and rye, there is nutrients in the kernel as well. Rice is fruit, wholesale.<br><br>Grains are good for you but they are small and you must consume them in a great concentration to get the adequate nutrients on a regular basis.

This is because grass grains, while being the fruit of the grass as you said, are not evolved to be eaten by frugivorous animals and dispersed via endozoochery - ingestion and defecation. They are evolved to be dispersed via wind - anemochory. Therefore, they only contain the nutrients and carbohydrates intended for the seed itself once it has landed in a site suitable for germination. Fleshy fruit, on the other hand, while also being the ovaries of the plant, have evolved other, more attractive nutrients - complex carbohydrates, high-energy sugars like glucose and fructose, various minerals and vitamins. Fleshy fruits have evolved to be brightly coloured in order to advertise themselves to frugivores - just like flowers with insect or hummingbird pollinators. Grass fruit has done nothing of the sort, and grasses have actively evolved to resist grazers - phytoliths, and defensive trichomes. Grazing mammals have spent millions of years in an evolutionary arms race with grass - evolving endlessly growing teeth and complex multi-stomach digestive systems.

Once grazing mammals got the better of grass, they could travel everywhere.

The reason for this is partially that unlocking grasses&#039; potential made it a great foodstuff, but also because it is everywhere, can grow everywhere, and is incredibly hardy. You can only grow most fleshy fruit plants in specific conditions - wheat can be harvested from Scotland to Sudan.

One is the sporophyte, a multicellular diploid asexual phase with two sets of chromosomes. The other is the gametophyte, a multicellular haploid sexual phase with a single set of chromosomes, that functions more like sexual reproduction in animals (requires fertilisation to occur outside the organism). A mature sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis, a process which reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from two sets to one. The resulting haploid spores germinate and grow into multicellular haploid gametophytes. At maturity, a gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis, the normal process of cell division in eukaryotes, which maintains the original number of chromosomes. Two haploid gametes, originating from different organisms or from the same organism, undergo traditional sexual reproduction and fuse to produce a diploid zygote.

The entire gametophyte generation is contained within the sporophyte. Most angiosperms and gymnosperms follow this process. <br><br>However, flowering plants (including grass) have in addition a phenomenon called &#039;double fertilisation&#039;. Two sperm nuclei from a pollen grain (the microgametophyte), rather than a single sperm, enter the ovum of the female gametophyte, one fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte to form &#039;endosperm&#039;, which nourishes the developing embryo. This fertilised zygote then becomes the seed.

The giraffids that remained rainforest browsers in the Congo, like the okapis, did not have to evolve such traits.

For instance, red meat is rich in iron derived from haemoglobin, which is more easily absorbed than the non-haem form found in beans and leafy greens.

You really think a species that seemingly can only exist in a highly specialized environment and has a bad reproductive strategy should be protected for all eternity? Hundreds of thousands of those types of species blip in and out of existence every hundred years and we don&#039;t know about it. True, it gets less common the higher you go up the chain of complexity, for example, a new species of megafauna, I&#039;m not saying we should let pandas or elephants go extinct to the contrary I want them to thrive on all continents.<br>We spend a lot of money removing &quot;invasive&quot; species from &quot;pristine environments&quot; like Russian olive from Arizona. The hypocrisy is that at the same time we let foreign cattle and feral horses roam the same landscape. The most competitive species should be allowed to thrive and the less competitive species shouldn&#039;t be protected from outsiders. <br><br>I say we shouldn&#039;t be protecting our environment from so called invasive species but &quot;naturalizing&quot; as many species as are beneficial to humanity everywhere.

The problem of course is that the fossil animals we know are mere snapshots of what must have been. So it&#039;s very possible if not probable that there were small Deinonychus or larger Velociraptor species that we haven&#039;t found and never will, without saying the two genera were the same thing.
