My family has always owned dogs and I have always adored them. No matter what you might thing dogs are intelligent and can sense emotions of humans, if you have any hate towards the dog they will know and be wary of you. The best thing for a young puppy is a good Schedule of walking, eating, playing and sleeping. I have to say that this stage is by far the simplist to overcome. Once they get out of their puppyness they&#039;ll start being rebellious and question you. Dogs only follow a leader who thinks of everyone in their pack, not just themselves, but dogs are stupidly affectionate and will love people even if their abusive and neglectful.<br><br>My puppy had a problem with eating other dogs feces when it was small, it was because of a stomach bug as well as social anxiety. He would just panic a lot outside and try and eat anything he could. He&#039;s fine now its a phase that goes by very quickly usually. My best advice is to stop being so negative, you&#039;re lucky to have that dog in your life and the older they get the more you&#039;ll understand this. If you don&#039;t want to put work in to have a relationship with an animal who truly loves and trusts you then I don&#039;t care if your mom forced the puppy on you, its unfair for the puppy to have to experience a bad start to its life, just because it was given to someone who doesn&#039;t want to adapt and learn to take care of it. Have some backbone and tell your mum why you can&#039;t handle it, instead of whining and making yourself look like a lazy piece of shit who doesn&#039;t want to do anything.<br><br>I know why you like cats anon, its because most disgusting individuals who own them don&#039;t treat them as pets but rather an accessory which they don&#039;t actually care for. I could never just let my pet outside on their own because I was too lazy to exercise them myself and turn their destructive energy into productive interactive games.

Dogs and cats are so similar that a cat is essentially a small dumb dog and a small dumb dog is essentially a cat. Carnivora is carnivora. The ascended shrews, like all primates are ascended squirrels. If we had larger cats, like domesticated cheetahs, it would be hard for an impartial observer to see them as all that different from a slightly dumb dog that runs really fast. Both are domesticated, too dumb/weak to truly survive in the wild, and naturally enjoy human company. <br><br>It has everything to do with a culture that makes leaving the cats outside acceptable. In some countries, especially south american ones, dogs are treated like westerners treat cats. They are left outside to live on their own and choose their &quot;owner&quot; so everyone gets to larp as a beastmaster who naturally deserves the affections of wild vermin.<br><br>Is it better? Poetically, because you can write glowing paragraphs about freedom and self determination, but the harsh reality is the animals are largely anxious, fearful, stressed out, hungry, sick, and spreading parasites and various illnesses around like no tomorrow. And the animals lack your poetic appreciation for a life without limits. That is a uniquely human feeling that evolved to drive you to leave the nest, spread your genes, and blaze a trail for others to follow. To them they living a life with a lot of limits, actually. Their food runs away or is always spoiled and they are at constant risk of being attacked or killed by another animal, a human, or an automobile.", "time": 1669570352, "resto": 4359980}, {"no": 4365694, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4360124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4360124</a><br>Australia launched a campaign to kill millions of stray cats, what are you talking about?", "time": 1669571267, "resto": 4359980}, {"no": 4365698, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:52:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4365694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4365694</a><br>It&#039;s just the dog hate schizo.
