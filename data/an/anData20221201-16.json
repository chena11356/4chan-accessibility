The Devil has already tampered with the evolution of the surrounding planets, causing them to become lifeless.

There are no levels in the traditional sense, as you instead use your cumulative exp to spec into different stats individually. Once a stat is maxed out you are given the option to evolve. Enemies evolve at the same pace as you, so make sure to have a balanced character. Each new creature you evolve into has unique moves in combat and over world hazard resistances. It is also possible to evolve into an evolutionary dead end. Doing this is one of the ways to get a bad ending, which there are many of. These endings are just meant to be jokes, and you are not penalized for getting them. The manual even encourages you to find them all.<br><br>Overall I&#039;d say that it&#039;s a &quot;I watched a let&#039;s play&quot; out of 10. The game is a very grind heavy for little game play substance. The combat is even more primitive than the original Dragon Quest. Its a shame really, because the plot and level system is something else. If it looked fun I&#039;d be more eager to figure out how to emulate it, but as is the plot and themes are really what holds it up.
