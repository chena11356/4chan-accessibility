Bigger eyespots were probably favored, frightening predators away by masquerading as a larger animal instead of just hiding the head.<br>Once all of the caterpillars had frightening eyespots, natural selection favored the most frightening ones. Eyespots are combined with threat displays (many insects rear up), contrast coloration (many animals reveal a flash of color on the underbelly), and so on as the random mutations that make the caterpillar more frightening than his brothers are promoted.<br>But what about the fact that the caterpillar:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesnt even see and doesnt have a brain know it has to look like a snake?</span><br>It doesn&#039;t to know, and it never chose to look like a snake.
