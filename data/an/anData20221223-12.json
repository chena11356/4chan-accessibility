As far as shedding I&#039;ve seen ones that hardly shed at all, however my parents have had greyhounds and theirs always shed a lot considering how short their coat is, and the fur becomes airborne when you pet them, compared to my gsd who needs to be brushed at least weekly, but doesn&#039;t blow fur into the air just from being touched. Greyhounds coats don&#039;t usually smell bad unless they get wet, but because their stomach is so sensitive they get gas very easily which is horrendous. Greyhounds aren&#039;t the best with tricks or any of that and aren&#039;t easy to train, but they are so lazy and easy going that they are one of the few dogs just about anyone can handle even from a shelter, and are great with children and old people. <br><br>Can&#039;t really say much about whippets as I have never looked into them, I&#039;m not really into sight hounds, and my experience with my parents dogs has always been that they&#039;re boring.", "filename": "20221220_165939~2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3827, "h": 1813, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 59, "tim": 1671715228922750, "time": 1671715228, "md5": "MRTcQTeDQdZvpDCsf2hXVg==", "fsize": 916937, "resto": 4385180}, {"no": 4387529, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)08:25:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4387247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4387247</a><br>why, would you like to be fucked by one?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pointier dogs</span><br>forwardly grown chad dogs", "time": 1671715527, "resto": 4385180}, {"no": 4387532, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)08:26:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4387262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4387262</a><br>I can tell you are a white woman because you are an expert on dog&#039;s cocks and when they are big enough to penetrate your perfect pink pussy<br>dogs are slaying skinny basic white girl puss while even fat ugly chicks reject me as a truecel", "time": 1671715592, "resto": 4385180}, {"no": 4387568, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)09:03:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4387524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4387524</a><br>Is the racing circle a closed group?

They are notoriously picky eaters and always get sick (it&#039;s rumored soaking oak leaves help if you don&#039;t mind leeching tanins). I don&#039;t know how tropical you want to go, but eastern newts don&#039;t like going above 75 F. You certainly are not keeping discus fish with them. More over, a lot of newts instinctively distrust water with fish in them for fear of fish eating the eggs. Danube Cresteds and Spanish Ribbeds do a lot better with fish, are seemingly disease resistant, and handle warm water measurably better and both are very readily available. <br><br>If you are stuck on going tropical though, try Himalayan Knobby Newt (Tylototriton verrucosus) or Japanese Fire Bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The first species is easy to find but very expensive, the second species is affordable but rare due to difficulty in captive breeding. Both can handle warm water without a care with mild flow and a few fish but I would still caution on those last three items. This guy breeds most of the mentioned species in this post (esp the Knobby Newt) and will probably have them ready in 4 to 5 months (assuming you&#039;re in North America): https://www.tritonnewts.com/availab<wbr>ility", "filename": "IMG_0930", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671474788638776, "time": 1671474788, "md5": "RrpZxv+XR/hruaVr7XoARA==", "fsize": 127714, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385111, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hawaii totally forbids importing foreign reptiles</span><br>Note also that there are no native reptiles in hawaii unless you count oceanic ones like sea turtles and sea snakes.", "time": 1671474806, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385131, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:54:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385107</a><br>I thought Florida only banned a handful of them like Niles, which you&#039;d never really want to own anyway", "time": 1671476090, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385157, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385131</a><br>they&#039;re working on banning literally everything right now. not joking", "time": 1671478570, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385160, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:41:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW no 1500sqf basement to turn into an ultimate animal room like Canadians and east coast people</span><br>It&#039;s not fucking fair", "time": 1671478898, "resto": 4384859}, {"no": 4385168, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:52:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4385160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4385160</a><br>Yea I&#039;ve always been butt hurt that basements aren&#039;t a thing here.

When you are a dog that drops that many pounds from your frame and you still qualify for a program for obese animals it is abundantly clear that being called fat is an understatement. According to his companion, Leslie McCormack, at one time he would eat five tins of dog food a day, which can only be called insane but has since been able to slowly decrease that to a single tin.

A dog that was once 180 pounds of fat, fur and flesh, the fact that more than half of the body he once possessed has disappeared is something worth celebrating.

You know that phone in your pocket can be used to do voice calls? One of the biggest professional tips I can give all of you zoomers and maybe even fellow millennials is to pick up the damn phone. It doesn&#039;t matter even if you&#039;re working at one of the FAGMAN as software developer remotely. Guaranteed you will have a leg up on your peers if you just learned how to call people. Calling people will put them on the spot and force them to answer you immediately. It gives you immediate power over people. You could have had your question answered faster than the time it took you to sperg out and type that post. Double pro tip: in a job setting, after you&#039;ve called someone, follow up with an e-mail stating all the answers you got and CC others.

I strongly prefer undergravels in tanks below the 4 foot mark (ie, 55 or 60 gallon) and even in those larger tanks nothing stops you from running an undergravel or sponges as supplemental filtration except for the fact that sponges are ugly and undergravels require you to use gravel.<br><br>Flow is sort of important, the main thing is that it reaches all of your media, how fast it turns over is mostly irrelevant unless it&#039;s like glacially slow. Total media volume/surface area is the name of the game. For both sponges and undergravels you can choose air driven or power filtration, air driven is cheaper to run and creates less flow, power provides flow and also provides some extra heat. With a good lid and some powerheads you can skip a heater in some cases.

Since the water comes clean from the ground there aren\u2019t many phytoplankton for filter feeders to feed on so not much zooplankton and as consequence no fishes to eat those and so on. Whatever animals lives there must be eating the plants/algae or eating whoever is eating those. Look for bugs, snails and tiny shrimp/crab. If the water is acidic then it will be harder for snails. Try making a plastic bottle trap and setting it with different baits (cooked vegetables, raw fish, cat food, etc).

What a cool site. Im 22 and i used to work at a local vet last year as a cashier. I mean i only got the job because my brother was an intern, nevertheless i cleaned and accommodate customers appropriately. It was my first job and i enjoyed it. The fun part is that we could smoke weed when anyone wasn&#039;t around and it felt really gratifying buying mid shelf weed with my own cash. Not only that i worked with my brother&#039;s classmates inside the clinic and their a little older and more mature.<br><br>Somewhere around the 4th month of working there i was exposed to the ugliness of that business. I became a pervert and started and we started staring at hot customers ass and stalking their social media sites. The head doctor was the biggest pervert. Whenever he or the assistant hand over the pets, they would shrug their elbows upon the breasts of hot owners. It would make their day as they have shitty wives. <br><br>After my brothers 13th month pay they left and i was the only gen z left there. The staff began to treat me differently, which is understandable. Didnt worked my way up there to begin with. So i manned up, cleaned the cages and washed the dishes did what they told despite the gaslighting im poor your rich routine. Overtime i pondered.. wtf am i doing with my life, i quit college to help my dad out with the bills for this? Fuck this 9-7pm job, fuck the weed im getting outta there. At my final months i could even sit at the receptionist, the groomer occupied it so i had to sit tat the operating table. One time the fucking groomer was so brazen he asked to take a hit at my thc vape, all the while sitting feet up at my desk. So i awoled one day after rigorously cleaning the place up being treated like a maid. Im going back to college again and enrolled to a Bs IT course. Ill make sure i wont end up like those assholes. Ill treasure my youth, go to gym and study hard for my future.

In 1931, people gifted Mohan to a maharajah in India, and in 1958, they bred him to one of his daughters and created the first litter of white tigers born in captivity. They transported one of those cubs, Mohini, to the U.S. and gave her to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo later bred her to one of her offspring, continuing the inbred line.</span><br>https://www.worldwildlife.org/stori<wbr>es/the-truth-about-white-tigers<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Captive tiger cubs, including white tiger cubs, generate a large amount of revenue for the facilities that own them, and that funding often does not reach the field conservation projects they say that they support. Small tiger cubs are relatively easy to care for, but the constant stream of new cubs needed by many facilities for photo ops or cub handling for paying customers creates a bigger problem when they reach adulthood. Adult tigers are expensive to care for and require larger and more secure enclosures. To reduce their numbers, some captive facilities kill their tigers once they reach adulthood and sell their parts to supply the illegal tiger trade, making a profit for a second time.</span><br><br>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02<wbr>-19/white-tigers-inbred-for-beauty-<wbr>and-tourism-dollars/7182594<br>More info,", "filename": "de0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 426, "h": 364, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1671417809077550, "time": 1671417809, "md5": "abFuWRGN36w0v0XMdgobjA==", "fsize": 44418, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384615, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)22:51:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384280</a><br>NEVER!!!", "time": 1671421895, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384627, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)23:01:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384144</a><br>Holy based!", "time": 1671422484, "resto": 4384142}, {"no": 4384704, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)00:59:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4384142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4384142</a><br>Go to Egypt and hit the tourist markets.

Not only do they look like adorable little angels, they also have the personalities of ones as well. Chick-on-chick infanticide is relatively rare in this species, and on top of that the siblings are known to share their given meals with each other. All the more impressive taking into consideration that they live in an environment that is only slightly more forgiving than the polar ice caps, or planet Hoth. <br><br>The species are sexually dimorphic to better suit their familial roles.

(KY3) - Willard School District leaders say neighborhood dogs attacked students and teachers during recess on the school\u2019s playground.<br><br>The incident happened Tuesday around midday at Willard Intermediate South, located at 630 South Miller Avenue. School leaders say the dogs injured several students and teachers. Paramedics treated those injured.<br><br>District leaders say 21 people were injured during the dog attack, 18 of them students.

Pitbulls are 6% of dogs. This is a significant figure. Only hounds and labs make up a greater proportion. You don&#039;t see a lot of tibetan mastiff attacks because they&#039;re rare. For reference, ALL sled dogs are the next most popular. These are down there in bite statistics with labs so you could say a lab is half as likely to kill you as a husky. But a pitbull is over 20 times more likely.<br><br><a href=\"#p4386489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386489</a><br>German shepherds are bred for guarding. Guard dogs attack people. It&#039;s what they&#039;re bred for. Any animal can attack if it is severely abused, but guard dogs are bred to attack just because they are distrustful, afraid, or feel they own a specific piece of dirt.<br><br>However they are not so bad, being maybe 3.5% of dogs (a little over half as common) but even if pitbulls only killed 10 or 15 a year, german shepherds can only manage to kill 2. German shepherd owners are also quite shit! If we took their shock and spike collars and started cracking down on dog beating and tethering dogs outside all day, and made sure all males not doing stud services were neutered, we could get that 2/year down to 1 or 0.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all caps rant</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the fact that you don&#039;t understand that you are proving our point: all dogs bred for violence are inherently bad</span><br>Serbia&#039;s average IQ of 89.6 is starting to show through here.", "filename": "PicsArt_07-08-11.14.38", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 650, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671609762371046, "time": 1671609762, "md5": "6zFEoOiXPdo+6fM3n30Y1g==", "fsize": 247987, "resto": 4382990}, {"no": 4386494, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:04:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4386493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386493</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.5%</span><br>Oh fug 2.1.", "time": 1671609842, "resto": 4382990}, {"no": 4386497, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:14:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4386489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4386489</a><br>A dog bred for dog fighting is bred for violence.<br>A dog bred for guarding is bred for violence.<br>A dog bred for hunting is bred for violence.<br><br>How this violence is triggered, and by what, is where they differ. <br><br>A fighting dog&#039;s violence is triggered when excited, and triggered by challenges and belligerence or just stress, and often includes prey drive. They can make a half assed guard dog, and the presence of prey drive means you could theoretically produce an okay herding dog or hunting hound with a few dozen generations, but the fighting dog instincts might resurface and fuck some people up. Best not to try. People have tried, it didn&#039;t go anywhere, they switched to collies and hounds instead. Fighting dogs are known for being hard to call off, otherwise they would be prone to &quot;giving up&quot; and trying to save their own skin.<br><br>A guard dog&#039;s violence is triggered by insecurity. A wolf&#039;s instinct to protect what is its own is heightened and put on a hair trigger with the brakes nerfed. When something is getting to close to what the dog thinks belongs to it, including its owner, it attacks, and it takes training to be able to call them off.<br><br>A hunting dog&#039;s violence is highly refined and is meant to be only triggered by prey animals. These are extremely unlikely to hurt humans, and when they do, it&#039;s not always prey drive, but just generic dog shit, like an abusive owner turning them mean, or a neglectful owner giving a dog a chance to knock over a crib or try and pick up a human &quot;puppy&quot; (breaks the neck without exception). Starting shit with anything other than a small, edible animal is considered a cull-worthy fault. And by cull I mean a club to the head.

But then it also depends on how large the windows are and what type of glass they&#039;re made of, and the colour of your walls and even your furniture also plays a role, and so on. My advice will always be to give your plants as much light as you possibly can, and if after several weeks/months (during the growing season) you still notice them struggling with sunburn, and you&#039;re sure you didn&#039;t underwater them or let some pest wreak havoc, then you can take the struggling plants a bit further away from the window, but again, not too far.

While I agree Lions are truly incredible predators, Tyrannosaurus rex is the one predatory animal that will almost always win these kinds of fights. For one, archosaurian neuronal density far exceeds that of mammals (crows and crocodiles are smarter than their EQ, encephalization quotient, would traditionally suggest). The Tyrannosaur could kill lions by walking around the arena, and be able to disorient or outright cripple vast swathes of them with movements of the legs and tail. There are no easily accessible weak points for the lions to exploit, and even if they are all black maned high-T brother lions in perfect form and 100% cooperative, there is no strategy that would grant them the upper hand except Zerg rushing the dinosaur. Dinosaurian muscles are both lighter and stronger than something like a cat or an undulate. The Tyrannosaur could stomp and swing around, biting and throwing lions for as long as it wants. The elephant comparison is fair, but ultimately incomparable. T. rex is a biped that weighs as much as the quadrupedal African elephant- a carnivorous biped whose ancestors were mostly speedy, intelligent hunters that are great at administering a specified bite. If the dinosaur in question were a carcharodontosaurid, I\u2019d be more ready to accept a lion victory.

They like having their coat scratched, start with the head. Making sure we had eye contact, I scratch my cheek, then scratching theirs. Took a few tries, but after that they know what is meant by scratching, and they associate this with itch removal. Got a few occasions where they would walk up to me, present their head side on, and expecting some brushing. Actively moving along to make sure the itch was found. After a while, started to remove ticks and stuck plant matter in this way. The ears are super sensitive, and provide them with communication. Getting their ears cleaned, they really love the result. Not the cleaning though.<br>Got a young stallion bro who just races up to me when he sees me, just to get his chin brushed.<br><br>There are a few nasty sides to it too, sadly. For example there is a mare with a lot of visible tumors, and when they fight, they can get quite deep scarring, or trample foals. Had a good friendship with the leading stallion going, but he got kicked in the head during a fight, and his jaw got horribly infected. The last time I saw him, he had passed away, singled out from the herd. No hoofprints but his own, leading to his final destination, deep in the woods.

If they don&#039;t want a human inbetween their hierarchy, respect that.

Start over, by letting the situation settle for a few weeks. Don&#039;t buy your way into their hearts as well, a carrot is a nice treat, but wild horses have their food. Provide them food and they&#039;ll expect that. Don&#039;t have enough or feed the wrong horse? The rest gets angry. Don&#039;t have anything after that, and they&#039;ll ignore you. Just like genuine human friendships, equine hearts can&#039;t be bought.<br>Even with something like scratches, the haremleader gets them first. After that, the stallions and the more adventurous foals. The mares with foal want to inspect you before they let their foal near you, but once you passed that, you&#039;re in the herd. If you don&#039;t, respect them. They are protective, and if they don&#039;t trust you, they will let you know that.<br><br>About breaking trust, the horses I know will at first flee. Thats in their gentle nature, but there are other responses, your herd may differ greatly. Prezwalski may react very different from mustangs, or exmoor ponies for example.<br><br>Last but not least, if you go into the wild,take some survival kit with you. A flashlight, enough water and food, and a first aid kit. If you break a leg or something, make sure you can reach for help.

While gliding has evolved a decent amount of times, flying has only evolved 4 times in the entire history of Earth that we know of (Flying Fish are moving towards becoming the 5th). There shouldn&#039;t be all these fruit loop methods of achieving flight like it was the 1900s in aviation. The Pterosaurs didn&#039;t do this, the Bats didn&#039;t do this and for all we know the insects didn&#039;t do this. Even gliding is so uncommon that once a species really gets started down the path of achieving true flight, there is only ONE path. So you shouldn&#039;t be seeing shit like Yi qi. That doesn&#039;t fit the pattern. If that were the case, we&#039;d also have Pterosaurs that fused all their digits into one giant hand finger or used their thumbs instead of their pinkies or splayed out their hands like bats. Likewise we should see some mammals that tried to achieve flight but had Pterosaur hands or bird-like hands.

The fact that flight has only arisen a small handful of times (only 3 lineages of vertebrates for certain, I don&#039;t know enough about insect evolution to say otherwise) does cast some doubt on the idea of multiple branches of ONE lineage experimenting with flight. Unless there is something about theropods that made them somehow more likely to lean that way, but if such a thing existed or what that could be, I cannot say.<br>The best I can offer up for Yi qi is that if it IS real, maybe the arm spike and membrane evolved for something else entirely.

Some even believe that a handful to no dinosaurs had feathers, or that dinosaurs and birds aren&#039;t even related. It is all a part of the conspiracy, one in which the Chinese are in on, as some believe that Chinese paleontologists are doctoring fossils by giving them feathers.
