There isn&#039;t a fundamental biological rule that states that &#039;reptiles don&#039;t have fat&#039;, because, conversely, they do. They don&#039;t have the same level of extensive fat deposits that mammals have because A) modern reptiles are generally smaller so require less on demand energy and B) surviving reptile taxa are all ectotherms, meaning they can&#039;t survive on burning their own calories alone, they need to warm themselves with the sun. Most of their fat deposits are for reproductive purposes primarily. However, we now know it&#039;s unlikely that a purely ectothermic regulation method could&#039;ve supported the metabolic rates of most dinosaurs, which were generally larger than modern reptiles, more active, and grew a lot faster. They had four-chambered hearts (all modern reptiles except for crocodiles have 3 chambers, crocodiles require 4 chambers because they are aquatic and probably inherited it from archosaur ancestors), likely a sustained aerobic metabolism (indicated by chambered air sacs), and ecologies that do not reflect ectothermic lifestyles (the ratio of the total mass of predators to prey in dinosaur communities was much more like that of modern and recent warm-blooded communities than that of recent or fossil cold-blooded communities.) <br>They were either wholly warm-blooded endotherms like their modern bird descendants, or they had intermediate mesotherm metabolisms somewhere between full ectothermy or full endothermy, perhaps with different lineages covering different types of metabolism.", "filename": "mesotherms", "ext": ".png", "w": 1284, "h": 944, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 91, "tim": 1674414734563651, "time": 1674414734, "md5": "b0+iUWOkYm1uHC9FX84VGQ==", "fsize": 365327, "resto": 4416535}, {"no": 4416774, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)14:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416659</a><br><a href=\"#p4416761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416761</a><br><br>Whatever the combination, the evidence shows that many dinosaurs were homeotherms and could independently maintain body temperature and metabolism in a way that modern reptiles can&#039;t.

It&#039;s very much the case that there&#039;s a lot of retarded stuff out there but that doesn&#039;t bring us back to the conclusion that dinosaurs were just &#039;muh big lizards&#039;. They were a lineage of reptiles that developed a collection of traits that made them wholly different from other reptile groups, including modern taxa. That&#039;s why they were so SUCCESSFUL for 165 million years, because these adaptions allowed them to dominate Triassic ecosystems in a way that other archosaurs or lepidosaurs or just other diapsid reptiles weren&#039;t capable of doing. Which is why their only surviving descendants, birds, are so totally different from any other line of reptiles.<br>Just admit this modern paleoart rubs you up the wrong way because you think it looks retarded. There&#039;s no shame in that, I&#039;d agree with you on a lot of it. But that doesn&#039;t justify trying to ignore some of the very unique things we know about dinosaurs that means that modern reptiles are NOT a good analogue for reconstructions, in much the same way that modern birds or, even further afield, mammals are also not a good analogue. Dinosaurs, as a lineage, were entirely sui generis and their only surviving non-avian reptile relatives are highly specialised aquatic predators that are very different from what we know about dinosaurs.

A &quot;cold&quot; uterus, especially an old one, just (tries to) expel anything in there, but can&#039;t because the uterine lining hasn&#039;t been shed in a decade, and then closes up with a bacterial culture medium and inevitably, bacteria, all in a thickened organ that receives less attention from the immune system.

They don&#039;t shed the uterine otherwise. Cats have the same issue, but way worse because they are extremely prolific breeders (2-4 litters a year vs dogs 1 to 2). I believe breed differences come from some primitive and large breeds only having 1 litter a year so reproductive disorders are slower to come on.

Especially if you get a kitten. There&#039;s a chance if you get a cat he will be a house plant you need to feed, but theres a bigger chance the cat is a much larger part of your life then you think it would be. <br><br>I got my cat during covid when he was 3 months old, and I spent every second with him. We grew a huge bond because he was the only living thing I saw daily, but he imprinted on me to such a degree where he is extremely comfortable around people (when I go to the vet they can&#039;t believe how well behaved he is, he isn&#039;t scared at all to be picked up or examined) and is very social. But I know he&#039;s like this because I was in his life constantly. <br><br>Anyways, because of this, he needs love and affection, not just food. He wants to play, cuddle, be pet, etc. I talk to him and he talks back, and we spend time at my apartment together a lot. I care about his health and weight so I feed him wet food every 8 hours, so thats definitely a routine I have to follow for his sake. But when I get home he&#039;s happy, and I&#039;m happy to see him. I feel like the answer to your question is more how much you want your cat to be part of your life. Assuming you get a kitten (which you need to have a lot of time for at the beginning) every cat can become fun little kitties. Older cats usually are more set in their ways, but they have their routines and know what they want, so you dont have to constantly analyze and raise a kitten. I&#039;ll say this, watching him grow up was truly surreal. Seeing how small he was when I got him where he had to climb up his scratching post, to being taller than it. Him being able to make jumps he couldn&#039;t before, getting stronger while playing, there truly is nothing like it.

Yahweh is the amalgamation of two or more pagan deities (yahweh, who shares a name with the vedic word yahvah that was also used as an epithet for the vedic fire god - and el of the mountain). Judaism is the amalgamation of various local pagan faiths from the age that ultimately became monotheistic as the most powerful city in the region declared that their native god was supreme god and demoted the other gods to angels and demons to concentrate religious and therefore legal power. Later some cheesy fucks wrote the new testament based on a personality clt, the book of mormon of its day. Don&#039;t forget the gotchas:<br>&quot;People used to practice another religion, but now they don&#039;t because el is the only god now, so don&#039;t say we just changed our minds&quot;<br>&quot;The book is right, and it is so right that it predicts that people will say the book is wrong. If people deny the book then this is proof the book is right.&quot;<br>It has the veracity of joseph smith swearing the tablets were real, or mohammad swearing he must be divine because he beat some pagans in battle and had partially memorized the OT.<br><br>This really isn&#039;t the board to school you on how christianity emerged from canaanite paganism (which came form north india being glorified gypsies) with clear influences from the ancient vedic faith, or how the bible is essentially a corruption of the original monotheistic vedic faith that replaces the supreme divinity with the fire demon that is an aspect of him - yahvah/yahweh.

The monkeys will certainly type at random and even if they are just typing one character at a time instead of just hitting the keyboard with their hands they will never achieve more than a few words and even that is super unlikely.

Ever heard of them? That&#039;s where we came from. We simply migrated to other places and adapted. It was our brains that allowed us to migrate to and survive colder climates. We had already evolved to our current, relatively hairless, form well before then.<br><br>And finally, for other posters in this thread, religion (both modern and ancient) is entirely based around confirmation bias.

These drainage channels were destroyed after Saddam was toppled, and as of 2022 (OP pic), it looks like 50-60% has been restored (and growing). Shortly before invasion, it looks like maybe 5% remained in a more or less undestroyed state.", "filename": "2022", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1972, "h": 1300, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 164, "tim": 1674701880667263, "time": 1674701880, "md5": "Z1E+zi1KkNzgwKP1/AkVqw==", "fsize": 1214494, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "rewilding", "replies": 4, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 4420365, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)21:58:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The original state.", "filename": "1984", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1962, "h": 1247, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1674701917620986, "time": 1674701917, "md5": "yIPn3HDcKJaKdfSGyd9gxw==", "fsize": 1157018, "resto": 4420362}, {"no": 4420368, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:00:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And Saddam&#039;s attempt to desertify the region.", "filename": "2002", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1951, "h": 1296, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674702009805211, "time": 1674702009, "md5": "VR2EgcLoN05E1FFFLGH/lQ==", "fsize": 1368144, "resto": 4420362}, {"no": 4420409, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)23:04:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4420362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4420362</a><br>I worked on tall grass prairie reclamation.

Peritonitis too is quite dangerous, but it mostly becomes a severe threat after a couple days, when sepsis and other problems make it essentially a death sentence. Obviously every case is different, but generally speaking someone with a perforated colon and acute peritonitis has around a 70% chance of complete recovery if they go to a hospital immediately.

Half mast but the glans pointing back and down. <br>Often comes followed by some twitching and twisting of their shaft, 1, 2, 3 twists, then a few spurts, followed by slight retraction and erection followed by bellyslap. After flaring up, they lose interest in it, takes them up to an hour to start with sexual interest again, but expelling semen right after that is rare. But, if there is a teasing mare close by- they will react stronger, and that &quot;pause&quot; might not occur as much- if at all.<br><br>Speaking of expelling semen, why would a desert species like a zebra expel the most in volume? It seems counterentu\u00eftive to me to waste precious water in that way. Maybe to provide the mare with extra water to absorb?<br><br>Also, the amount of gel greatly varies by species of equine, and specific individual. Had a few stallions produce about 30 to 60ml of watery mess, but another specimen just keeps on producing thicker, more sticky gel. Up to the point of having it literally dragging back up semen from the collection vial just by the viscosity.<br><br>Once had to collect (not for AI) a &quot;deposit&quot; from grass, had to scoop it in a ziplock, but it was so sticky, it ended up folding in stringy globs around the bag, so in the end, after wiping with a few paper towels, a triple bagging was needed.

Oftentimes the trap breaks the lower spine, not the neck and causes the little vermin a great deal of pain before it finally dies. It is absolutely necessary to kill them as soon as you can, and in my mind, if you must kill, do it quickly and cleanly as you can. If you can see one, there are probably several you don&#039;t see, so keep setting traps until it&#039;s been days since you got one. Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can. If you hesitate or show mercy, not only will they fuck your world, you will end up having to kill far far more of them in the future. I am listening to rat scratches in the ceiling right now.

Not only do they look like adorable little angels, they also have the personalities of ones as well. Chick-on-chick infanticide is relatively rare in this species, and on top of that the siblings are known to share their given meals with each other. All the more impressive taking into consideration that they live in an environment that is only slightly more forgiving than the polar ice caps, or planet Hoth. <br><br>The species are sexually dimorphic to better suit their familial roles.

A family of foxes will stay loosely together until the next mating season starts to come near, at which time the parents will drive away their remainig kids so they can go establish their own territories. Though sons always leave their parents, sometimes daughters won&#039;t mate and will continue to live near their parents, sometimes helping them raise their next litter.<br><br>Oh, and biologically-related foxes can be friendly and have dens next to each other, there&#039;s a cute photo series of two fox familes who live together here: here https://dakotareflections.com/dakot<wbr>a%20region/red%20fox.html", "filename": "16779387493_ae2626bd3b_5k", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 5119, "h": 3517, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1674420385675286, "time": 1674420385, "md5": "3SO4+NmYehJgauASouMCcQ==", "fsize": 1936005, "resto": 4407117}, {"no": 4416904, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:11:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4416832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4416832</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vulpes vulpes schrencki) that has retained their sox</span><br>That&#039;s a northern species that lives where there&#039;s significant snow in the winter.

Bonus: deep-sea dwelling creatures often survive trips to the surface easily, so it would make them look even more blobbish but without any risks to their functionality. It would also give them precedence for wearable devices or containers for respiration or similar so you can move forward with your initial idea if you so choose.
