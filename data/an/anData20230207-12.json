On the off chance it&#039;s not:<br>1) Fish have long term memory. Most of us have fish that associate us with good things, primarily food. You&#039;re now training your fish to associate you with pain and stress, which will drastically decrease their overall lifespan and quality of life. Congrats.<br>2) Whatever forum you&#039;re going to is retarded and if this is not a troll post I question your intelligence for not immediately realizing this. Your clowns are definitely not the retarded ones in this scenario.<br>3) Clownfish do not NEED an anemone. I went to Maldives two years ago and swam with hundreds of clownfish: not a single anemone in sight. Clownfish in the wild can find shelter in a number of different things including rockwork and coral, this is perfectly natural. In tanks people have even gotten anemone to be hosted in fake anemone.<br>4) There are lots of different, far more effective, far less retarded, ways of encouraging hosting behavior. One surprisingly effective way is to tape a picture of clownfish being hosted by an anemone to the glass. Yes, they&#039;re smart enough to identify themselves and anemone in a picture, which makes you torturing them all the more insane.

I just didnt find the extra cost worth it. My little guy is great despite being northern. The breeder I got him from was real small time guy but they are certainly out there. <br><br>But also definitely make sure whatever you buy is captive bred, not captive born. Ask for pictures of the parents and whatever information you can get to try to verify they are actually captive bred. A lot of dealers will put &quot;CB&quot; so people think that means captive bred, when its actually captive born. These are just still wild ETBs that have had their eggs stolen and born in captivity.

Obviously it&#039;s never going to be as cut and dry as that, but we can theorise that the gradual decline of the carcharodontosaurs and their disappearance from the fossil record by the Cenomanian (when they truly reached their greatest sizes with Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Carcharodontosaurus) could be connected to the shift in sauropod populations, and that shift also eventuated the success and diversity of abelisaurids and tyrannosaurids in the last 25 million years of the Cretaceous, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We can perhaps theorise some large scale biogeographical shift that meant that carcharodontosaurs, which were specialised to be giant apex predators hunting the juveniles of the huge titanosaurs (or potentially forming packs and hunting adults), could no longer cope. Usually this kind of specialisation is a double edged sword - you&#039;re king of the castle while things are stable, at the highest trophic level, but when there are ecological shifts, migrations or other environmental factors, your specialisation can be a handicap.

Sea levels rose, choking littoral and delta ecosystems which supported spinosaurids, but also potentially shrinking the floodplains that the giant titanosaurs would have relied upon as nesting grounds. The carbon cycle disturbance also interrupted the marine oxygen cycle, leading to 500,000 years of decline in marine biodiversity, as reflected in the fossil record with reductions in plankton and foraminifer biodiversity. The increase in average water depth would have seawater to become less eutrophic in shallow, epicontinental seas, and this brought about the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, just like you said. Then, over the following strata, mosasaurs grow to gigantic sizes and dominant the interior seaways of North America and Europe, and the epicontinental seas around Zealandia. So there was definitely a faunal turnover in the ocean, which may have had analogues on land.

This was a vision, fresh and clear as a stream in Central Kalimantan- the mind revealing itself to itself. In my vision, I was on the veranda of a vast feeding platform, a Peron Makan of some fantastic proportion. <br>There seemed to emanate from it a light from within - this gleaming radiant jungle. I had known this place. I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return, a reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. Wandering about, I was happy that the forest had been immaculately maintained. There had been planted a number of additional trees, but in a way it blended so seamlessly with the original canopy, one would never detect any difference. Returning to the jungle&#039;s grand treescape, there came a knock from above. Budi was standing there. He was happy and care-free, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy. We embraced - a warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were in this moment one. My vision ended.

It&#039;s an absolute fucked industry. Salmon farming is the big one. The problem is literally every sea pen of salmon is infested with salmon lice that essentially eat the fish alive until it&#039;s body gives up. Because the salmon are so packed together it&#039;s like a breeding factory for lice which can then drift out of the pens and infect wild salmon.<br>Farmed salmon get treatment for the lice ( which is also fucked. Thermolicers are hot water treatments that essentially micro cook the salmon while alive to kill the lice), but wild salmon obvs get nothing and 1-2 lice will kill a juvenile salmon easy. Wild salmon populations are essentially non recoverable because salmon farming won&#039;t end bc it&#039;s too tasty. <br>Profits are plummeting for some companies rn because of literally microjellyfish floating in and killing half the stock, so salmon prices are probably gonna spike soon.<br>Also, wild fact.

Let me reiterate, it is absolutely imperative that you kill all of them as soon as you can. If you hesitate or show mercy, not only will they fuck your world, you will end up having to kill far far more of them in the future. I am listening to rat scratches in the ceiling right now.

Males are significantly larger, reaching up to 140 cm (4.5 ft) and developing large jowls. </span><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_t<wbr>egu<br>Yeah yeah,<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wikipedia</span><br>but I can&#039;t see any reason they&#039;d lie about it.", "time": 1675434196, "resto": 4425911}, {"no": 4427275, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)12:15:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4425911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4425911</a><br>That&#039;s a well marbled lizard.", "time": 1675444534, "resto": 4425911}, {"no": 4427404, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)15:20:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4425970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4425970</a><br>same as orang, it&#039;s a Chad thing", "time": 1675455615, "resto": 4425911}, {"no": 4427734, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:40:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4425911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4425911</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;call dad over</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;dad, look, they skinned this poor lizard&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;AHH FUCK WHY DID YOU SHOW ME THIS</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;exits NEETden</span><br>heh, nuthin personell", "time": 1675478415, "resto": 4425911}, {"no": 4427739, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:43:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p4426466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4426466</a><br><a href=\"#p4426283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;4426283</a><br>Why do iguanas always have patchy flaky bits of skin hanging off of them?

Especially if you get a kitten. There&#039;s a chance if you get a cat he will be a house plant you need to feed, but theres a bigger chance the cat is a much larger part of your life then you think it would be. <br><br>I got my cat during covid when he was 3 months old, and I spent every second with him. We grew a huge bond because he was the only living thing I saw daily, but he imprinted on me to such a degree where he is extremely comfortable around people (when I go to the vet they can&#039;t believe how well behaved he is, he isn&#039;t scared at all to be picked up or examined) and is very social. But I know he&#039;s like this because I was in his life constantly. <br><br>Anyways, because of this, he needs love and affection, not just food. He wants to play, cuddle, be pet, etc. I talk to him and he talks back, and we spend time at my apartment together a lot. I care about his health and weight so I feed him wet food every 8 hours, so thats definitely a routine I have to follow for his sake. But when I get home he&#039;s happy, and I&#039;m happy to see him. I feel like the answer to your question is more how much you want your cat to be part of your life. Assuming you get a kitten (which you need to have a lot of time for at the beginning) every cat can become fun little kitties. Older cats usually are more set in their ways, but they have their routines and know what they want, so you dont have to constantly analyze and raise a kitten. I&#039;ll say this, watching him grow up was truly surreal. Seeing how small he was when I got him where he had to climb up his scratching post, to being taller than it. Him being able to make jumps he couldn&#039;t before, getting stronger while playing, there truly is nothing like it.

Apparently this can be anal glands or something, but vet yesterday said it should be his lower back and gave him a cortisone shot (didn&#039;t even look at his ass though). It didn&#039;t really do anything since he already slid on the floor again twice, but on another note his appetite seems to have been down since the weekend too. Given that cortisone supposedly boosts appetite, him still barely touching his food and not even whining for something to eat really worries me. We had a cat that started eating less and being less energetic only to die in her sleep not too long after. He&#039;s also being too low energy for his usual self.<br>Now, he also barely has any teeth left, and never had the healthiest mouth, so I&#039;m not sure if that might be related, though he&#039;s been on wet food ever since he got the last set of teeth taken out and that hasn&#039;t changed.
