For most of those subjects, it was only until the 19th century or the early 20th century that they took a form familiar to contemporary eyes, with standardized notation, terminology, and analytic frameworks.<br>There is no end point to the sciences or to the history of philosophy, so every day, you get further away from finishing learning the sciences or reading the philosophical canon through the publication of a new paper and a few new books. <br><br>It might be good for a person to acknowledge that not everything they try to grab onto will be acquired properly the first time, but it&#039;s absurd to entertain the notion that the sciences must be learnt in chronological order using original texts, since most of those original texts are much harder to understand and more drawn out than a synthetic treatment of them in instructional material meant for non-specialists.", "time": 1676077059, "resto": 21641152}, {"no": 21642581, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)20:08:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642548</a><br>Euclid still holds up tbqh", "time": 1676077691, "resto": 21641152}, {"no": 21642786, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:08:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642548</a><br>bacteria were the true niggas all along... reductionist sisters why do we keep winning?", "time": 1676081307, "resto": 21641152}, {"no": 21642800, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:12:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "if schoppy were alive today he would probably be big into Neuroscience and how that effects us emotionally", "time": 1676081550, "resto": 21641152}, {"no": 21642867, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:41:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642548</a><br>Nice effort post anon, I&#039;m too drunk right now to read through it fully, but saving it to Google Keeps for later reading.", "time": 1676083302, "resto": 21641152}, {"no": 21642886, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:46:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641580</a><br>Quantum mechanics is physical chemistry you absolute moron<br>t.

Marx is truly a bourgeois thinker when he explains all of history by work, when he formulates man&#039;s whole relation to the world in terms of work, when he evaluates all thought in terms of its relation to work, and when he gives work as the creative source of value. Although he did not believe in values, he implies that work is a virtue when he condemns the classes that do not work. He was one of the most articulate interpreters of the bourgeois myth of work, and because he was a socialist and a defender of the working class, he was one of the most active agents in spreading the myth to this class. Besides, it was through work that this class would one day win power and freedom. For the post-Marxian working class, therefore, work meant both the explanation of its condition and the certainty of seeing it end. Once the motive of doctrine had been added to the motive of necessity, how could the workers fail to be imbued with this ideology? It was the bourgeois who invented the dogma of the eminent dignity of the worker, but it was Karl Marx who led the proletariat to this thenceforth ineradicable conviction. From then on, the myth of work became a myth of the left, and the bourgeois and the worker were united in the same commonplace: work is the be-all and end-all of life. The only difference is that for the bourgeois, work tends more and more to be the work of other people, while for the worker only he himself can bear the noble title of worker. Anyone who does not belong to the proletariat, being a nonworker, is a parasite.</span>", "filename": "59700", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 403, "h": 600, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675983305137530, "time": 1675983305, "md5": "sUuDfo2s7MR9wSMsM9FryA==", "fsize": 57827, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21637870, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21637279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637279</a><br>no, the implication is that a supposed hierarchy-less (classless) society would need constant correction to dissolve the naturally forming hierarchies, done by some agents with the power to implement those corrections and therefore forming the top of a hierarchy themselves.", "time": 1675984022, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21637878, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:09:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21637814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637814</a><br>Beyond fucking based Ellul as always.

Marx also said that the role of industrial capitalism was to cut costs of production so they could compete with industrial capitalists in other countries. You can do that if you lower wages (although that comes with downsides too). The U.S. later on during that century developed a system of higher wages which helped increase labor productivity, since it&#039;s good to have workers who are getting paid well and have enough to eat and are literate and so on.<br><br>A starving, uneducated workforce in a feudal society is not productive in comparison to that.<br><br>But then there&#039;s the problem of land and housing rent and private monopolies. So Marx saw (&quot;historically&quot;) &quot;progressive&quot; potential in industrial capitalism, but Marxism was also a critique of it, since you have financial monopolies which come into conflict with expanding productivity... like today. People read Marx and think he describes their world because they look around and everything seems to be getting shittier and poorer, but there&#039;s so much wealth that&#039;s just not being reinvested in actual production, because it&#039;s simply not profitable to do so. Marx meanwhile called for having the state to take over land and be the landlord instead of a hereditary landlord class. (Georgists favored a land tax.) Socialism would bring into public ownership (i.e. state ownership) the communications, transport, telephone services, education, healthcare and other basic needs instead of private monopolies, with these services provided freely (or basically subsidized). This sounds flatly totalitarian to people though. But China has done a lot of this and are indebted to his ideas and explicitly say they are.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It has since been thoroughly proven that collectivism cannot match the efficiency of the free market though</span><br>What makes Marxist socialism different from other socialisms is that it&#039;s supposed to be *superior* to capitalism (and not just &quot;better&quot; in a moral way like a Christian thing), and a lot of his writings were critiques of other socialists and anarchists and so on. That is, socialism is supposed to be more capable of &quot;scientifically&quot; and rationally allocating labor and resources, more efficient and more productive and so forth. You eliminate a lot of debt overhang and rents being charged by these private monopolists. <br><br>The 20th century communist countries like the USSR was not able to achieve that, though. It was very obvious by the 70s that they were falling behind. I think the Chinese drew the conclusion that it would be better to tolerate some sorta market economy (for now) in the absence of much greater &quot;productive forces&quot; necessary to allow a command economy to run efficiently.", "filename": "39580368904564", "ext": ".png", "w": 843, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1675988448229934, "time": 1675988448, "md5": "gRnbAUUOj5HSkjVPIL7UIA==", "fsize": 495701, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21638171, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21638076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638076</a><br>I understand the concept of surplus value, I&#039;m just not sure it makes sense and even if it does it seems to me like much less than is taken with taxes and currency dilution.

Barter economies naturally designate a commodity as money in order to facilitate trade. Not every thing can be easily traded for everything and as such people will tend to trade their goods for the more tradable goods, this creates a reciprocal effect where more people want the more tradable good which in turn increases its value which makes more people want it etc. and this is also how hyperinflation happens in the reverse, in fact hyperinflation can occur in the absence of inflation and inflation can go on without hyperinflation in theory. I think it was actually keynes who made the insightful remark that hyperinflation is the people revolting against the government, it wouldn&#039;t take much for it to get started either that is why they encourage people to save so much lately. As soon as people no longer save money, as soon as people prefer to stock up on goods rather than wait for their price to go up later the process is already in motion and prices will skyrocket and money loses its value.

The temptations to bribery and perjury and all other means of evasion beget a demoralization of opinion and they put a premium upon unscrupulousness and a tax upon conscience. And finally, just in proportion as the tax accomplishes its effect, there is a lessening in the incentive to accumulate wealth, which is one of the strong forces of industrial progress.

The problem is - the social and governmental structure of the Russian Empire was the largest obstacle for it&#039;s industrialization, as the existing Imperial government and aristocratic elites were tied to the extraction-based, low-tech economy, and straight up sabotaged industrialization and social adaptation necessary for it. The only movement towards the industrialization that happened was colonial development of the foreign industrial capital, which came together with severe economic and political dependency - which entirely succeeded in dragging Russia into a war that would be otherwise entirely pointless for both it&#039;s people and it&#039;s leadership.

Even though moral rules are said to come from God in Christianity, Western ethics and codes of law stem back to the traditions and prohibitions of ancient polytheistic cultures of Europe.

However, Buddhism greatly values conduct-based principles such as the 5 precepts and requires for rectitude in action and thoughts as part of the noble eightfold path.

Whereas many nobles in pre-modern Japan did undergo Confucian style education, it was not uncommon for nobles to become initiated as Buddhist monks or nuns later in life.<br>Confucianism is, strictly speaking, a system of ethics purely concerned with the proper observation of rites and upholding natural hierarchy and order. The reverence of the high by the low and ancestor worship rituals permeated Japanese culture early on, and in this, we can see that Japanese culture has had a noticeable Confucianist influence.<br>Chinese culture has many examples on its own of unambiguously right, noble characters as well as unambiguously evil characters both in its historical chronicles and in its romances, one of the most famous examples being the Romance of Three Kingdoms, with characters such as the much reviled Dong Zhuo.<br>I do not claim that moral ambiguity does not exist Japanese fiction works, just as I do not claim that moral absolutism does not exist in Western fiction works.

So much of this shit is based around basically worshiping women, just in an idealized, unrealistic form.<br><br>3. I sometimes feel a strong consciousness of death, and it makes frivolous activities like this feel wrong. This happened enough that it made it hard to enjoy things like this.<br><br>4. I got sick of having to get my entertainment from some other civilization, through a substantial linguistic and cultural barrier. I could eventually feel the cultural differences, things I just could not relate to at all, that were very alien to me. Also the more I learned about the real Japan the more I disliked it.<br><br>Some of that is kind of vague, but I haven&#039;t read a VN in years now.

It is of very variable quality - the professional facefarting pornography is all dreadfully low quality, but the amateur stuff is of very high quality. <br>The best in the game is Amirha, a woman with IBS and terrifyingly sharty farts - they are real and loud. She has a boyfriend who always plays the role of the bound, forced and unwilling receptacle of her feminine gasses. The very best part of her videos is towards the end, when she has farted quite abundantly, but is still pressing - the danger, the titillation arises, that her vigorous pressing might give birth to a more substantial gift than the rectal perfume she has so generously showered her man with. In those videos where it happen, where she does take a shit in her boyfriends mouth, I coom hard, very hard. <br>However, I recently stumbled over a compilation video that has cut and pasted together short clips of everytime it happens - this is a mistake and a misunderstanding. It is not the act itself that gives rise to the strongest of cooms, it is the danger of it happening, the uncertainty of what her pulsating asshole will produce, gas or mud - it is the indeterminacy that arouses the interest, as Kant rightly said of the artwork. <br>Creating a compilation of every time she shits in her boyfriends mouth is, in a manner of speaking, symptomatic of the problems of modernity - it is exactly such a thing that Adorno criticizes with his analysis of the Culture Industry, where art is rendered impotent by being subjected to means-end optimization. This is a profound tragedy, as art, and the aesthetic mode of thought it engenders, with it&#039;s indeterminacy - in Amirha&#039;s case, whether her sphincters contractions will produce a nugget or not - is the antidote to the means-end reasoning that has become all-pervasive in modernity.", "filename": "KingCSmile", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 414, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676055128806033, "time": 1676055128, "md5": "ZyDCd0OyJ0BPQKyPNiu1rQ==", "fsize": 98594, "resto": 21639393}, {"no": 21641227, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)13:57:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641207</a><br>You should expand this into a blog.

Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is &quot;wrong&quot;; they can&#039;t be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains \u2014 in the brains of even the stupidest person \u2014 is as &quot;correct&quot; as what&#039;s in my mind or Nietzsche&#039;s or Baudrillard&#039;s. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the &quot;truth&quot; that&#039;s hiding inside even the dumbest person&#039;s brains. For example, when a Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, he is not wrong. It&#039;s just that the concepts he designates with the words &quot;God&quot;, &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word &quot;God&quot;, going by the Christian&#039;s definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says &quot;God&quot;, he doesn&#039;t really mean an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being&quot; (since he&#039;s so dumb he can&#039;t even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means &quot;a very powerful being&quot;. Similarly, when he says &quot;universe&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;universe&quot; (i.e. &quot;everything&quot;), he simply means &quot;the earth&quot; \u2014 or at most, if he&#039;s had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps &quot;the solar system&quot;. And finally, when he says &quot;love&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;love&quot; (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. &quot;help me&quot; (= shape me).<br>So basically, when the Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, what he&#039;s really saying, translated in our language, is &quot;A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me&quot; \u2014 which could very well be true!<br>All of this stems from Nietzsche&#039;s positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener. Ultimately, each person gives his own meaning to every word, which is only natural since this meaning is to be found inside each person&#039;s brain, and all brains are different.<br>57.

There are three tiers of thinkers. On the third tier you have people like Jordan Peterson. These people fare well enough when confronted with trifling issues\u2014like whether a language should have ten personal pronouns or ten thousand, for example\u2014and for this they are lauded by the rabble as geniuses. But when it comes to the genuinely tough subjects\u2014the definition of truth say\u2014they can talk nonsense for 20 hours without getting anywhere\u2014and that&#039;s why their opinions on these subjects never survive the test of time: they are so confused and sprawling, while simultaneously worthless, that no one can bother memorizing them. If these people were a bit smarter they would not have opined on these subjects at all, but alas they&#039;re not, and thus the rest of us have to suffer their verbal diarrhea for a few years, until time wipes it all away.<br>Then we have the second tier, that comprises people like Aristotle, whose definition of truth, while next to useless, really, is at least concise enough to be memorable: &quot;To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true&quot;. This is merely common sense transcribed in a kind of formula that makes autistic people feel they&#039;ve understood something, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if Aristotle was on the spectrum somewhere. All &quot;analytic philosophers&quot; are in the same boat/spectrum, and all their writings are equally commonsensical and worthless. But if the universe functioned commonsensically, why would we need geniuses lol? So these people are superior to the base crowd-pleasers like Peterson because they at least make a concentrated attempt at grappling with the big issues, and the results are at least readable, if not exactly useful. Their main use, however, is to function as foils for the geniuses; to serve up the balls that the geniuses will hit out of the park, so to speak.<br>And finally, on the first tier, we have the bona fide geniuses. Consider Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;Truth is will to power&quot;. Doesn&#039;t it make Peterson&#039;s 20-hour verbal diarrhea on the subject seem ludicrous? Even more so considering the latter comes a whole friggin century after Nietzsche, and Peterson has read him? Not to mention the analytic autists, who still pathetically try to pretend that Nietzsche never existed.<br>And there you have the three tiers of thinkers.

People have a vast problem dealing with the notion of the inequality of men. But that the only reason for this problem is envy and resentment is shown by the fact that when it comes to other species, not only is there no problem, but inequality is taken as a given and the mere implication that, for example, a dog may be equal to a man is treated by everyone as proof of madness and cause for internment in mental institutions (and this is indeed how it will eventually be with whoever keeps insisting on the equality of humans and subhumans). And yet a simple substitution is all it takes to reveal the sheer absurdity of the business. Change &quot;men&quot; to &quot;lifeforms&quot; and the deeply reactive nature of the equality lie, the massive incapacity to unblinkingly acknowledge the simple fact that some men are superior, and even vastly superior, to others, stands revealed.

If you want to see what a subhuman really believes in, observe him at the moment of a medical emergency. Who is the first he thinks of, God or his doctor? Where does he first go, the church or the hospital? If he really does believe that his God is above the doctors, why does he unfailingly heed the doctors first in every case of need, and his God only much later, if at all? Therefore he believes first and above all in the descendants of Asclepius and Hippocrates. Why asking him is pointless, as regards the truth. What he believes and what he tells you he believes are two entirely different things.

Once you have understood that power is more important than happiness (which latter is merely a tool of the former, and not the other way around, as it appears from the inverted perspective of sick, declining lifeforms), the next thing you need to understand is that phrases such as &quot;to seek power&quot;, &quot;to want power&quot;, &quot;to take power&quot; and the like are merely subhuman misunderstandings of how power actually works.<br>If you seek power, it simply means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore will never get it either, because power is something you give, not take).<br>If you want power, this once more means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore once more will never get it, for the exact same reason I explained in the previous parenthesis).<br>If you take power, it simply means that someone is giving it to you, and is therefore the more powerful of the two, and will remain so for as long as you are drawing your power from him instead of bestowing it on him.<br>So how does power actually work? Take an extremely simple example from the physical sphere, where the mechanics are easier to understand. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, and try to figure out how he became so physically strong. The subhuman theory of power as something to be taken would suggest that Arnold took his power from somewhere, but from where exactly? From the barbells, perhaps? In this view, barbells would be magical instruments with the capacity for bestowing power on all those who... try to lift them, I guess. But if you or I tried to lift the kinds of barbells Arnold typically lifts, we&#039;d get literally crushed. Not only would we not &quot;gain&quot; any power: we&#039;d have to be hospitalized. We could of course start from smaller weights and work our way up, the same way Arnold did: but I have bad news for you here, sonny: we&#039;d probably fail at getting to his level, or even anywhere near it, no matter how hard we tried. Far more genetically gifted individuals than us in this sphere have already tried this, after all, and failed: that&#039;s why Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times while scores of his closest competitors didn&#039;t. This means that the subhuman theory of magical power-bestowing barbells is false: if the barbells do indeed play a role in the strengthening of an individual, then at the very least this individual must be of a specific type that is CAPABLE of benefiting from their effect: he has, in other words, to be WORTHY of them, which is merely another way of saying that he has to be ALREADY STRONG.<br>QED: Power is not something you can take but something that you must give, and the only reason subhumans are adamant that it is the other way around is because they are so inherently and irremediably weak, that they don&#039;t have the slightest conception of it. <br><br>460.

Though it could be argued that the Overman is the only one who is able to manifest what he wishes, because he is the only one who truly thinks himself capable and deserving of it. If the average person tried to manifest their dreams, they might fail because subconsciously they know they aren\u2019t worth it, and since they don\u2019t want to manifest that guilt along with their dreams, they can\u2019t manifest the dream at all. Also, the belief in causality and determinism can be another hindrance, which the Overman is not susceptible to. He doesn\u2019t need to know precisely HOW he gets what he wants, the universe bends its rules for him, because he creates the universe. So these things might explain why some people are able to manifest thousands or millions of dollars while others can only manifest a free coffee. But you could also argue that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d doesn\u2019t occur at all, but that the people who are confident and believe that they can manifest are the ones who are already powerful enough to attain their goals naturally, and so they attribute their success to manifestation when it was just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Again, the subhuman doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth anything, and believes in strict laws of causality and science etc. so if he fails at manifesting then he will just blame his lack of belief \u2014 a clever way of preventing blasphemers of manifestation.

In this case the question is whether our everyday intuitions about what is possible or impossible are sensible. For example, for thousands of years people were trying their hand at the geometric problem of &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, i.e., constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straight edge. Eventually, it was proven that this was mathematically impossible. Because it&#039;s impossible, it would be pretty stupid to keep trying to do it.<br><br>On the other hand, some things seem &quot;possible&quot; but don&#039;t happen. Sticking with the example of mathematical theorems, a person might try to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem, but fail. But it is nevertheless possible to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem--people do it all the time. So a person will necessarily fail to square the circle, but only contingently fail at proving Fubini&#039;s theorem.<br><br>For a long time there was skepticism about these concepts of &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;possibility&quot;, expressed especially by Quine. There were specific technical problems with trying to show how they could be incorporated into logic (in particular, modal logics were not &quot;extensional&quot;). On this basis people began to seriously doubt that there was anything meaningful about statements of possibility and impossibility, despite how intuitive they were.<br><br>Kripke revolutionized the field by introducing so called &quot;possible world semantics&quot; which overcame the technical problems identified by Quine and others. Now there was a way to make formal distinctions between impossibilities (like squaring the circle) and contingent falsehoods.<br><br>Maybe you think this is all too academic, and who cares whether some particular math problem is &quot;impossible&quot; or simply difficult.

In fact I would say having to rid oneself of resentment is just as bad as having it in the first place. The feelings which created such resentiment still exist, you have only adopted the values which you were critical of, i.e a hypocrite.<br><br>Now what is resentment? Often it is confused as simply rationalizing one&#039;s feelings of inferiority by condemning an external object for the subject&#039;s impotence. But one component is missing in this simple categorization of resentiment. That is &#039;envy&#039;. Why is envy essential for resentiment? It is because in order to feel quantitively inferior, one most also value the same measure of the external object which is being blamed for the inferiority. For example, the individual resentful of wealth values poverty over money, he still values money however he values the inverse of wealth &#039;poverty is good&#039; , &#039;wealth is bad.<br><br>Now you are saying that you have grown out of anti-Semitism by ridding yourself of resentiment. That is, not only have you never opposed Jewish values, but that you were envious of them and adopted them yourself! This only means that you were a Jew yourself, and your resentiment was simply self hatred at your ineptitude at being a Jew. <br><br>It is spiritual Jews like yourself, and that Jew Walter Kaufman who accused the NSDAP of resentiment towards both monopoly capitalism, and of course the Jewish race. That is, in your Jewishness you extoll money to be an objective value, and that one can be a master and value it, or a slave who resents it.<br><br>But this is of course far from the truth, now when I speak of the values of the NSDAP I speak of it not in individuals, not even in it&#039;s programs, but in it&#039;s form. I can best summarize it in this quote from Hitler:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]we do not say to the rich people &quot;Please, give something to the poor.&quot; Instead we say &quot;German people, help yourself!&quot; Everyone must help, whether you are rich or poor.

And now they&#039;re strangling us. Our own masculine brothers in the security forces will gun us down, if we try anything, because we have taught them to not think and simply take orders from the politicians. And now the politicians are fags and non-Whites. We have no one to blame but ourselves.<br><br>At the same time, we shouldn&#039;t blame ourselves\u2014or anyone else for that matter. We&#039;re in entirely new territory: no one has reached this level before. And like every higher level in a good game, it harbors new dangers, but also new opportunities. It&#039;s interesting and exciting as fuck! If something were to happen today, it would be biblical! Think for a moment what kind of war the Founding Fathers were fighting. The Brits were their brethren, and gentlemen to boot. War between such highly civilized people was more like a game, a chess match. But WE WILL BE FACING ARABS, MEXICANS, AFRICANS. If anything happened here, IT WOULD BE BRUTAL AS FUCK, LIKE FUCKING WARHAMMER. We&#039;re talking APOCALYPTIC VIOLENCE, drone-bombings, tactical nukes going off, mass torturings, mass graves. I can&#039;t wait! Some nights I dream about it! But I am not going to throw my life away by going out into the street and attacking the first fag or non-White I see. That&#039;s a fine gesture for what it is, I am not knocking the people who do that, it&#039;s understandable and to an extent necessary, and it&#039;s inspirational; but it&#039;s just prologue.<br><br>I want to play in the main event.<br><br>From http://orgyofthewill.net \u00a71364.

The ultimate orgy of the will in full so you don&#039;t think I&#039;m full of shit:<br>Why is the Big Bang an explosion and thus a destruction of everything including therefore whatever/whoever caused it? It can&#039;t be compulsion because the Big Bang is the greatest power in the universe, hence there&#039;s nothing to compel it, ergo it must be will, and precisely this is the ultimate orgy of the will. &quot;Every great thing is the cause of its own destruction, via an act of self-cancellation...&quot; The Big Bang is the very mechanism of the Eternal Recurrence, and note that Nietzsche wrote this HALF A CENTURY before Big Bang theory was conceived. He wasn&#039;t trying to EXPLAIN some astrophysical phenomenon with this theory\u2014since nothing at the time had been observed that was demanding such an explanation\u2014so he didn&#039;t TAKE this theory from anywhere, he simply CREATED it out of thin air (out of cultural observations that could have been interpreted in countless other ways than how he interpreted them), and lo and behold, the astrophysicists &quot;discovered&quot; it half a century later, entirely independently, since they hadn&#039;t read a word of Nietzsche... So what&#039;s going on here? Whose will precisely is the ultimate orgy of the will if not the will of those who dreamt and thus &quot;discovered&quot; it? You say, &quot;It is the will of future people with the technology to power it&quot;, but would those future people have created this technology without Nietzsche and the astrophysicists inventing the concepts of the Big Bang and the Eternal Recurrence for them? Would they have created this technology out of nothing?

She&#039;s the coming of spring and her return from the Underworld each year fills Demeter with so much joy that summer occurs.<br>Meanwhile Hades is the ruler of the underworld, the god of death. Cold and callous and without life or light, the etiological embodiment of winter in the greek mythos.<br>Though it&#039;s also fair to say that just as Hades is winter, so too is the absence of Persephone. They are connected, just as winter and spring are connected, and it is this connection that eventually leads to the idea that Persephone truly does fall in love with Hades despite being forced to stay in the underworld against her will.<br>Now some think this is an example of Stockholme syndrome, but that&#039;s a plebeian take. In reality, their love represents the acceptance of winter. The knowing that winter will always come, each year, and not only recognizing this fact but perhaps even embracing it. Winter, just like Hades, are not without their positives.<br>But we can go even deeper than this. It doesn&#039;t just tell us of the connection between winter and spring, but it tells us about the love between Hades and Persephone itself. They come to rely on each other so heavily that one cannot exist without the other, a co-dependence that alludes to the cycle of death and rebirth that comes from the very beginnings of human myth.<br>But it doesn&#039;t just explain why they love, it tells us how they love. In a sexual sense, the connection between winter and spring mirrors the physical connection of coitus between Hades and Persephone. And just as winter and spring are connected, so too does spring always follow winter.<br>And it&#039;s here that we discover the greatest secret about this myth.

It is a story about the end of the world in which the world ends.&quot; In other words, Clute&#039;s answer to my question is nothing, there&#039;s nothing at the end of the road. Such a statement &quot;in which the world ends&quot; strikes me as too categorical for The Road or for McCarthy&#039;s work as a whole, of which The Road, presaged over and again from The Orchard Keeper onward, is both a logical continuation and a kind of termination. I believe, with Edwin T. Arnold, that McCarthy&#039;s work is grounded in moral choice. Clute&#039;s statement &quot;you remove the Christ figure and you are left with virtually nothing&quot; leaves little room for choice, but I think the novel, in its own contradictory way, does. How then do we go about examining the relative evidence for and against God in The Road? We look directly at the text, at what McCarthy intentionally did or did not write. What and where is the textual evidence working against God, what and where is the evidence working for God? And how do they stack up? In the novel&#039;s second fragment we can begin to accumulate the evidence against God. There is a simple description of the setting as &quot;Barren, silent, godless&quot; (4). A few pages later a single snowflake sifts down: &quot;He caught it in his hand and watched it expire there like the last host of Christendom&quot; (16). It&#039;s the boy who catches the snowflake but the narrator&#039;s simile is hardly of the boy&#039;s imagining. Sometimes McCarthy reverses the religious reference for negative effect as in this un-writing of Genesis by the man: &quot;The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. [. . .] The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality&quot; (88-9).

Their conversation treats survival, death and God, but it raises more questions than it answers. Ely, whether it&#039;s real or some perverse nom de guerre, is the only person in the novel endowed with any sort of proper name. Why? What - beyond urging the critics to hustle - is the significance of the name? Some of the criticism takes Ely to allude to Elijah, a connection I fail to see except on the most superficial level - the wise old biblical prophet, other than caricature or intentional reversal, he is not; even less is he Melville&#039;s Elijah from Chapter 19 of Moby Dick - and I don&#039;t understand any link beyond some weird possible version of Elijah&#039;s sharing of the Passover meal, a flimsy tie, for what it&#039;s worth, seen also by Phillip A. Snyder (81) in the context of hospitality. <br><br>Why not Ely itself?

What if it&#039;s God-made or a catastrophic accident? McCarthy remarked somewhat facetiously in an interview in the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I don&#039;t have an opinion. At the Santa Fe Institute I&#039;m with scientists of all disciplines, and some of them in geology said it looked like a meteor to them,&quot; as if they were privy to information beyond his ken. &quot;But it could be anything - volcanic activity or it could be a nuclear war. It&#039;s not really important&quot; (Jurgensen). The only critic I have read so far who wants to keep the question open is Jay Ellis, who does not decide between &quot;nuclear winter, or the calamitous climate change sped up by a comet strike&quot; (28). The interview, even given McCarthy&#039;s well known propensity for hermetic or enigmatic pronouncements, only strengthens the possibility that the catastrophe was not necessarily man-made.<br><br>If we accept McCarthy&#039;s ingenuousness or ingeniousness, we also have to accept the somewhat outrageous notion that the only proper name in the novel (other than Rock City, of which Ely could be a reiteration, in which case Ely would be the rock of the un-church) coincides, at least in the popular mind, with a great physical disaster, which did to the dinosaurs what the current disaster in the novel is doing to man. And then we must ask if it&#039;s also coincidental that this character Ely, the only one with a name, is the one to tell us: &quot;There is no God,&quot; an utterly un-Elijah-like judgment that he promptly reiterates: &quot;There is no God and we are his prophets&quot; (170) - And why does he look like<br> &quot;a starved and threadbare buddha&quot; (168) and talk like the prophet Mohammed? That sort of multi-religious palimpsest is clearly contrived, but to what end? Is McCarthy deriding &quot;diversity&quot;? Are we meant to believe Ely? Maybe he&#039;s just crazy, or maybe he&#039;s right and crazy, or maybe he&#039;s trying to tell us in his own crazy Nietzschean way that God is so utterly removed from us as to be dead, an idea Jay Ellis flirts with when he writes of: &quot;[. . .] the larger philosophy we keep<br> determining in these novels - including McCarthy&#039;s sense of god as a kind of absent parent no longer able, or willing, to do anything&quot; (35), a sense that echoes tangentially Leo Daugherty&#039;s Gnostic reading of Blood Meridian. The disaster may not be caused by man, but the episode with Ely can only reinforce any case against any God other than a totally absent one, no matter how eccentric or contrived Ely himself may be.", "time": 1676109653, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643891, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643876</a><br>Another of those prose poems occurs in a kind of flashback or memory: &quot;Out on the roads the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond&quot; (181). The passage sounds like certain descriptions from Suttree and something like the first chapter of Ecclesiastes. The key word, for my purposes, is &quot;unremarked,&quot; which seems to indicate a nonexistent or uncaring God. The passage echoes one from early in the novel: &quot;The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air&quot; (11). These passages point convincingly to nothingness and doubtless are among the major reasons the novel has been labeled nihilistic or godless. There is also a brief fragment that would seem to deny any after life: &quot;Do you think your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledgerbook? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground&quot; (196). This denial seems to issue straight from the man as does a subsequent passage of the same type: &quot;I think maybe they are watching, he said. They are watching for a thing that even death cannot undo and if they do not see it they will turn away from us and they will not come back&quot; (210). Who are &quot;they,&quot; we are forced to ask, ghosts, angels, archons, aeons, gods? There is no answer and all that is clear is the quandary itself, yet the very nature of the question, at once rhetorical and pointed, seems to signal some Eliot-like turning, however bleakly. Is it some spark - &quot;the thing that even death cannot<br> undo&quot; - that they must see in order not to turn away? <br><br>The textual case for God, or more specifically a Christlike figure in<br> the boy, difficult to imagine without some a priori God, however aloof, comprises more evidence than the negative case, and more convincingly. We can understand much of the material by stringing it together, almost without explication, beginning with this passage, which is the first we hear of the boy: &quot;He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke&quot; (5). Shortly after they emerge from the mountains, the father, having left their camp, observes: &quot;When he rose and turned to go back the tarp was lit from within where the boy had wakened. Sited there in the darkness the frail blue shape of it looked like the pitch of some last venture at the edge of the world. Something all but unaccountable. And so it was&quot; (48). Except for being unaccountable, this phenomenon - whatever it describes - is wholly unremarked in the narrative or in the criticism, but it foreshadows much of what follows. That foreshadowing, while easily slipping by unnoticed here, cannot be anything other than explicit and intentional.", "time": 1676110251, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643898, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643891</a><br>Some twenty pages later, as the father washes the roadrat&#039;s gore from his son&#039;s hair, comes the first direct inkling of the boy&#039;s role: &quot;All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you&#039;ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them&quot; (74). Messiah, of course, means anointed one and while this passage does not proclaim a messiah, it does plant a seed of implication, especially when on the next page we read that the man &quot;sat beside him and stroked his pale and tangled hair. Golden chalice, good to house a god&quot; (75). Someone - the father, the narrator, the reader, the critic - is making suggestions we cannot simply ignore. Then the boy himself begins to make pronouncements. First he says that nothing bad will happen to them, &quot;Because we&#039;re carrying the<br> fire&quot; (83), when there is no fire and they&#039;re about to sleep in a car with only suit coats piled on for warmth. This figurative fire will become a central motif for the boy&#039;s sacred nature, which the man will continue to assert, as when he asks Ely: &quot;What if I said he&#039;s a god?&quot; (172), a role<br> the boy will eventually take for himself. When the boy answers the man, saying that he is the one &quot;who has to worry about everything,&quot; saying, &quot;Yes I am. . .I am the one&quot; (259), he is echoing Jesus in a number of instances - I am the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6); I am the door of the sheep (John 10:7); I am the light of the world (John 8:12); I am the alpha and the omega (Revelation 1:8), to mention a few of the most obvious. Suffice it to say the proclamation &quot;I am&quot; is among the strongest phrases in the Old and New Testaments, the latter inevitably an echo of God&#039;s pronouncement to Moses: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). Not only does the boy offer to take responsibility, he offers to do so in unmistakably religious language, with none of the equivocation or contradiction so evident in Ely&#039;s negative discourse. The boy, born after the disaster, has been raised, we must assume, without church or scripture, and his scriptural echoes must therefore issue forth from narrative design or divine inspiration. There cannot be - not in a Cormac McCarthy novel -inadvertent echoes or unintentional allusions.", "time": 1676110497, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643914, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>Later the boy asks: &quot;Is it real? The fire?&quot; and the man answers: &quot;It&#039;s inside you. It was always there. I can see it&quot; (278-9). Is that the figurative fire of civilization? I think it means - textually, in this novel - less something vaguely Promethean than the literal belief in or presence of God or at the very least some entrapped divine spark of the Gnostics. My reading stems not from any innate desire to interpret the text that way. Rather it seems the weightier of two intentionally conflicting possible readings or discourses, set out as though the narrator himself were engaged in some mono-dialogical debate meant to be attended and adjudged by the reader. Alongside the fire motif runs a light motif - when there is in this darkest of worlds no source of light - that only reinforces the sacred nature of the boy: &quot;There was light all about him&quot; and &quot;when he moved the light moved with him&quot; (277). The man is compelled to comment: &quot;There is no prophet in the earth&#039;s long chronicle who&#039;s not honored here today&quot; (277), an inference, by the father at least, that the boy incarnates some second coming. Finally, there are two poignant words that I believe strengthen the textual case for God. The first is salitter: word used rather exclusively by Jacob Boehme (or commentary on him, as by Hegel), the Lutheran mystic clearly familiar to McCarthy, to judge nowhere beyond the two citations, one used as epigraph and the other reversed as subtitle, for Blood Meridian. Salitter - there could be a dissertation on this usage eventually, as well as a study on the meaning of fire and light as God and Christ in Jacob Boehm and Cormac McCarthy - means divine essence, the stuff of God (not unlike the Tao or Brahman, or in quantum physics the matrix of Max Planck): &quot;He walked out into the road and stood. The silence. The salitter drying from the earth&quot; (261). John Clute properly underlines the vital importance of this sole word, acknowledging God&#039;s presence but believing that &quot;the Christ figure must somehow be seen - be felt - to transcend the drying of the divine out of the earth.&quot; I agree, at least to the point that Clute has put his finger in the wound. The central question would seem to be precisely that: Does the Christ-like figure of the boy transcend - or reverse or compensate for - such an absence or withdrawal? It is reasonable to argue, as Clute does, that the answer is no. But what are we to make of this passage, giving us the second poignant word, just before the father dies: . .he [the man] would raise his weeping eyes and see him [the boy] standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle&quot; (273)?", "time": 1676111035, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643920, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:25:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>I got 1 paragraph through this wall of complete shite and couldn&#039;t go on. <br>TLDR please and thx desu.", "time": 1676111150, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643928, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643914</a><br>Tabernacle: In general terms, a place of worship.

But regardless, why tabernacle, why the singularly most ecumenical term imaginable to express the essence of God? And what if the man is seeing into the future, or what if the boy does indeed glow? What if McCarthy is not making a reasonable or cogent argument?<br><br>The last thing the father says is: &quot;Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again&quot; (281). The father dies, the boy stays with him the emblematic three days and then as if on cue or as if preordained or as if popped from a machine, Parka-man &quot;hove into view&quot; (281). The critics who say that Parka-man is a deus ex machina are right, and that is precisely the point. His woman, who welcomes the boy, doesn&#039;t talk to him of civilization, she talks to him about God and tells him that &quot;the breath of God was his breath&quot; (286). If McCarthy didn&#039;t want us to read it the way I just have, why did he write it that way? Why say goodness will find the boy and have goodness find the boy? Why drag out a deliberate and undisguised deus ex machina - no one could seriously argue that McCarthy was unaware of the fact - if what you want to do is deny any sort of deus? And it&#039;s not just goodness that finds the boy but a new and this time caring mother, the mother that does not exist for that long list of road warriors we started with, the mother absent or defective in all those novels, every single one of them, including most especially this one, and not just goodness but warm caring affectionate understanding maternal goodness - quite the opposite of the mother who abandons the boy - the only such maternal goodness, all one short paragraph of it, in virtually all of McCarthy&#039;s work. If the message is meant to be nothing more than the withdrawal of whatever Gnostic substance there is out there, why have as the subject of the last paragraph of the plotted novel a mother who is not only all of the foregoing, but also a mother who understands how to explain the unexplainable without attempting to force any belief on the boy? What&#039;s at the end of The Road? What textually, with no need to adduce scientific opinion from the ironically named Santa Fe Institute? Stabat mater, not yet dolorosa. And that mother who is there, standing there, not yet grieving, means that the pistol-packing, fire-carrying boy, the light-bearing boy, the golden chalice and glowing tabernacle of an anointed boy who honors all the prophets and whom goodness has found is who and what we have.

It is distinct in tone and voice and time and perspective from the novel, raising more questions than answers, and serves as its undesignated epilogue.<br><br>Is the narrator addressing the reader directly when he says: &quot;Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand&quot;? Or is that second-person pronoun directed at the narrator himself, like a rhetorical question? Or is there an intentional conflation of narrator and reader and even ghosts? The man who remembered the trout in the early mountain section of the novel is dead. Yet you, the reader, cannot help associating the trout here with those remembered trout. They are as iconic as Hemingway&#039;s trout, or more so, both early in the novel and intensely so now in this echoing epilogic vision of them, shared in the foreground between the complicit narrator and the willing reader and in the background with Hemingway and the dead father.<br><br>Native brook trout (technically a char, salvelinus fontinalis) are as perfect a species as exists in nature, yet they are delicate and susceptible to the effects of any kind of pollution. McCarthy uses them to stand for all the particular natural miracles that have been destroyed by whatever cataclysm has occurred: &quot;Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.&quot; These miracle trout of becoming are at once real (the light wavy markings on the brook trout&#039;s dorsal area are called vermiculations) and intricately evolved, and they return us to once - what is now, from the current point of view of this narrator-after-the-fact, in illo tempore - to our as yet undestroyed world where the brookies still wimple and swim, while not releasing us from the recorded destruction in the novel: &quot;Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again.&quot; We are returned, briefly and ever so hypothetically, to the irreversibly fragile pristine mountain setting - a thing which could not be put back - of the sacred trout for the ultimate, possibly guilt-laden, possibly not, nostalgic and mystical pronouncement: &quot;In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery&quot; (286-87).", "time": 1676111991, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643952, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643946</a><br>In the deep mountain hollows and coves where the trout once lived, emblematic of the entire natural world, all of nature was older than man and all of it, everything, hummed with the essence of life.

However, based on his writing and philosophy, I believe he would approach the topic of AI with a mix of intellectual curiosity, skepticism, and concern. Wallace was known for his incisive and critical examination of the impact of technology on society, as well as his interest in exploring the nature of consciousness and human experience. In his writing, he often explored the ways in which technology and media can be both liberating and constraining, and he was deeply concerned with the effects of these forces on our relationships, our sense of self, and our sense of purpose. Given these concerns, it&#039;s likely that Wallace would approach AI with a critical eye, considering both its potential benefits and its potential drawbacks. He may have been intrigued by the idea of machines that can mimic human thought and decision-making, but also wary of the implications of this development for our understanding of consciousness and agency. Overall, I think Wallace would have approached the topic of AI with his characteristic blend of intelligence, humor, and compassion, engaging with the complex and often paradoxical nature of this rapidly-evolving field with the same kind of rigorous introspection that characterized his writing.</span>", "time": 1676095130, "resto": 21643417}, {"no": 21643506, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)01:23:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s too bad we&#039;ll never know.

These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but\u2014like the incorrect labels generated by the Xerox photocopier\u2014they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our own knowledge of the world.

If you\u2019re a writer, you will write a lot of unoriginal work before you write something original. And the time and effort expended on that unoriginal work isn\u2019t wasted; on the contrary, I would suggest that it is precisely what enables you to eventually create something original. The hours spent choosing the right word and rearranging sentences to better follow one another are what teach you how meaning is conveyed by prose. Having students write essays isn\u2019t merely a way to test their grasp of the material; it gives them experience in articulating their thoughts. If students never have to write essays that we have all read before, they will never gain the skills needed to write something that we have never read.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And it\u2019s not the case that, once you have ceased to be a student, you can safely use the template that a large language model provides. The struggle to express your thoughts doesn\u2019t disappear once you graduate\u2014it can take place every time you start drafting a new piece. Sometimes it\u2019s only in the process of writing that you discover your original ideas. Some might say that the output of large language models doesn\u2019t look all that different from a human writer\u2019s first draft, but, again, I think this is a superficial resemblance. Your first draft isn\u2019t an unoriginal idea expressed clearly; it\u2019s an original idea expressed poorly, and it is accompanied by your amorphous dissatisfaction, your awareness of the distance between what it says and what you want it to say. That\u2019s what directs you during rewriting, and that\u2019s one of the things lacking when you start with text generated by an A.I.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s nothing magical or mystical about writing, but it involves more than placing an existing document on an unreliable photocopier and pressing the Print button. It\u2019s possible that, in the future, we will build an A.I. that is capable of writing good prose based on nothing but its own experience of the world. The day we achieve that will be momentous indeed\u2014but that day lies far beyond our prediction horizon. In the meantime, it\u2019s reasonable to ask, What use is there in having something that rephrases the Web? If we were losing our access to the Internet forever and had to store a copy on a private server with limited space, a large language model like ChatGPT might be a good solution, assuming that it could be kept from fabricating. But we aren\u2019t losing our access to the Internet.

Example: contemplating natural beauty, and then thinking about what it implies (e.g., a providential and wise Creator).<br>Reasoning guided by imagination.

Christ however acts as a ladder which infuses the sensuous world through his life and his teaching with divine lights/sparks which can be used as the base of the contemplation, this is especially necessary since sense perceptions are bound by time and potentiality and thus are admixed with non being, therefore lacking perfection.

Am I stupid? What the fuck does that mean? I&#039;m high as fuck and this is bothering me, so please just bear with me: <br><br>There are two brothers, they are impoverished and living in a bronze age era land. One brother one day finds a meteorite which speaks to him and grants him magical powers, and he becomes a sorcerer. Then, he uses his powers to give a boon to his brother as well. His brother is then as mighty as a hundred men. The meteorite that spoke to the sorcerer when he was young is actually a demon, and he tricks the lover of the sorcerer into accepting his power too. The power he gives her is that she siphons the living energy of all things around her in a huge radius, except the sorcerer. Every night the people in this radius have nightmares that clearly label her as the cause. This makes everyone actively try to hunt her down and kill her wherever she goes, and this causes the sorcerer&#039;s life to become hell. Eventually they&#039;re cornered after running for so long. She knows that it&#039;s over and doesn&#039;t want to see her lover suffer with her as he deludes himself on ways to escape. So she runs away to the people who want to rip her apart in an attempt to end it all. The sorcerer is heart broken and kills her himself before she can make it to them in order to spare her the torture she&#039;d suffer. So, then he embraces her and all the life energy that she&#039;d siphoned from the world around her over that time is transferred into the sorcerer, who in his moment of grief uses it to destroy the land around him. He also blows up one of the moons, and it&#039;s super cool in my opinion. Anyway, he&#039;s totally evil now, and then he goes back to his homeland to find his brother. His brother is actually just a total jerk, and he used his power to become a warlord tyrant over his home nation. The sorcerer doesn&#039;t give a shit, because he&#039;s super evil now. He&#039;s actually a necromancer because of how corrupted the demon has made him through his grief. (The demon is actually trying to turn him into a huge battery so he can use him to spawn into the material realm and escape the planet before aliens show up to merk his ass.) Anyway, he tells his brother that he can see visions of the future, and that he sees that one day his brother&#039;s son will kill him. His brother doesn&#039;t actually find that too threatening, and he just says &quot;Whatever, I&#039;ll just slam every hatchling that comes out a male onto the rocks. No problem&quot; So, he goes ahead with that plan, and manages to live for a good long while thanks to the magical boon he got forever ago. So that prophecy spreads around his country. Eventually, one of his concubines gets pregnant, and her father says &quot;I actually DON&#039;T want my potential grandchild fucking squished, thanks&quot; So he runs away with his daughter into the wild lands, and surprise surprise the kid she pops out is a male.", "time": 1676101990, "resto": 21637452}, {"no": 21643673, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)02:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643670</a><br>Oh yeah, these are all sapient lizards by the way. <br><br>And this male is then raised by those who wish to see the asshole warlord brother&#039;s reign destroyed.

The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage.

He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual life, all that is foreign to that order.

There is no bigger sign of a midwit than sex positivity and unquestionally provoking and indulging your impulses. You&#039;ve never considered will. You&#039;ve never reflected on memory. Any sane person feels the inclination and competition for lustful feelings to detract from set goals and objectively fundamentally undermining one&#039;s very sense of agency which is already limited enough. All for what? It&#039;s ultimately a hedonic negative because following it sensitivity to other pleasures are decreased, precipitating a sense of anhedonia for hours to days, not to mention the tiredness it brings about. I encourage you to ejaculate several times in the span of a few hours and then try watching a movie or reading a book. It&#039;s going to be so underwhelming you might as well not even bother. What I don&#039;t understand is in this era, sex is everywhere. Porn is everywhere. Almost the only place you can get away from it is reading. And here you are, associating the one thing not fully infested with it, with the coom. Even physical intercourse is so ubiquitous and most have had it enough times yet go headlong investing countless hours, time and money to do it again. The only reason you are doing this is to detract from other failures of agency in life like needing to work. You work. Get home. Can&#039;t stand the thought of it or your life so you coom. The answer is you&#039;re coping and coping hard.", "time": 1675871260, "resto": 21628794}, {"no": 21631675, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21631657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21631657</a><br>basde", "time": 1675871492, "resto": 21628794}, {"no": 21631688, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)10:54:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21631657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21631657</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I encourage you to ejaculate several times in the span of a few hours and then try watching a movie or reading a book.

Rather than a store of facts and procedures, you can regard knowledge as a collection of models which explain some universe of observations (whether physical, as in the applied sciences, or abstract, as in mathematics). Then sudden shocks, in the form of observations which the models cannot reasonably explain or encompass, become the foundation for model evolution, making your knowledge stronger and more universal rather than merely obsolete.

Repetition is the simplest, most direct way to do this. Repetition alone is sufficient, but it&#039;s inefficient. Imagine the acquisition of any skill or body of knowledge as some fixed (unknown) number of repetitions, n. Every learning technique is just a way of decreasing n. The spacing effect decreases n via increased intervals of time between repetitions. Deliberate practice decreases n by making each individual repetition more effective (via immediate feedback and working at the threshold of ones abilities). Interleaving decreases n when you&#039;re trying to learn more than one thing at the same time. Mnemonics decrease n by creating a mapping that is more amenable to the brain&#039;s natural storage mechanisms (location, in particular). The asterisk method mentioned above decreases n by focusing on one&#039;s weaknesses (also one of the elements of deliberate practice). This explains why its better to pay more attention to when you study rather than how long. Studying for long periods at low energy will require many more repetitions than studying at high energy in short bursts. If you record n for some skill in the course of learning it you can use that information to predict how many repetitions you&#039;ll need to learn something new in the future. You can than use these metrics to measure momentum and identify places of expected plateau (repetitions increase but skill doesn&#039;t) so that you don&#039;t get discouraged when they inevitably happen, but can push through by persistence or experimentation. <br><br>There&#039;s a lot more, like how to set up each repetition properly, how to properly break down a skill so that it can be learned through repetition of its rudiments, how to motivate yourself to stick to the repetitions when they are difficult, etc.", "time": 1676082844, "resto": 21641187}, {"no": 21642873, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:43:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Antifragile</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blocks everyone on twitter</span><br><br>Many such cases!", "time": 1676083388, "resto": 21641187}, {"no": 21643142, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)23:08:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642850</a><br>That makes a lot of sense.

If it was just Pfizer or Moderna telling you the vaccines work, there&#039;d be no reason to trust it.

They&#039;re just organized in such a way that people can get what they need. Big Pharma is a for-profit industry. They observe market signals. Market signals tell you there&#039;s no profit to be made in preparing for catastrophe down the road. And then comes the neoliberal hammer: governments are not allowed to do anything other than repress people and beat them up.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible. And unlike anti-natalism, there are strong sociological and technical grounds to predict that the application of biotechnology will wipe out the substrates of suffering for good.</span>", "filename": "The Hedonistic Imperative - David Pearce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 279, "h": 445, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675759844213973, "time": 1675759844, "md5": "GU7wbhImRIt8qsWCkouz9g==", "fsize": 10616, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626937, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no meaningful arguments against antinatalism</span><br>If you accept utilitarianism.

One, that the Asymmetry argument for antinatalism fails. And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what about those who genuinely do regret having being born? One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller.

As a young professor, Nietzsche volunteered in the Franco-Prussian War and took part in the war as a medic. He fell ill fairly soon, however, and returned to Basel, but the impressions of the war marked a decisive period in his philosophical development, the first step in furthering Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy of will. His sister and biographer, Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche, describes his impressions of regiments going into battle, certainly based on verbal information from Nietzsche himself: \u201cAt that time he first felt deeply that the strongest and highest will to live was not in a miserable struggle for existence, but as a will to fight, as a will to power and superiority.\u201d<br><br>The enthusiasm of the young Nietzsche for the war of 1870-71 does not only determine the general metaphysical basis of his philosophy. His immediate impressions of the war, the hopes he pinned on Bismarck\u2019s founding of the Reich, also have a more general content, a concrete political and social line that is decisive for all of his later work. It is the struggle he waged throughout his life against the liberal and democratic ideology of his time. A foreword to his first work The Birth of Tragedy was published from the estate, which Nietzsche drafted in the war winter of 1870-71; there he clearly states why he is enthusiastic about the founding of the Reich: \u201cbecause in that power (the new German Reich. G.L.) something will perish that we hate as the real opponent of every deeper philosophy and art consideration, a state of illness from which the German character has been suffering primarily since the Great French Revolution ..., not to mention the great crowd, in which that suffering is called ... liberalism\u201d. The fact that Bismarck did not live up to Nietzsche\u2019s expectations in this respect, since he constantly made pacts with the national-liberal German bourgeoisie and did not break up the pseudo-democratic forms of the German Reich, is the reason for Nietzsche\u2019s later uninterrupted and increasingly violent polemics against the Bismarck regime.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Georg Lukacs.

It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production. In this connection, such things as cost accounting and profitableness, production costs, prices, etc., are of actual importance in our enterprises.

My ambition&#039;s not uncoloured by various sorts of shame and fear: previous extremely amateurish works of mine, the fact that I&#039;m not even twenty years old yet, my history of media consumption, not having read enough, not having written enough, standing generally on the fringes of literary circles (and not in a good way): I don&#039;t possess the sort of talent or intellect or linguistic nimbleness (linguistic dexterity, gracefulness, skilfulness) to write a truly great (or, let&#039;s tone that down: an even marginally good) novel. I don&#039;t even know if I spelt &quot;possess&quot; right. I constantly find myself referring to dictionaries, thesauruses, and grammar usage guides while reading and writing. Nevertheless for about a year I&#039;ve voyaged (even my use of the word &quot;voyaged&quot; here embarrasses me) on multiple attempts to write a novel, each of which have lead me into various branches of consciousness that terminate at nothing. It&#039;s like I&#039;m thrashing about in a pool of vaseline. I still have a sort of delusional optimism about these ambitions of mine. I think I&#039;ve got to.<br>But this delusional optimism&#039;s been shattered to bits, and I might have to lie down in bed for a while: I just read Barthelme&#039;s short story &quot;The Balloon,&quot; and I didn&#039;t understand it at all. I get that the story&#039;s about society&#039;s reaction to the balloon; society&#039;s positioning of itself in relation to the balloon as it takes over Manhattan, but I couldn&#039;t quite grasp what the balloon really was, even at the end, where the narrator explains to his lover [?] what the balloon was. I&#039;m missing the point so hard it&#039;s embarrassing. <br>I thought the prose was great and that there are some moments which were funny as heck, but I&#039;m ashamed of myself for not being able to grasp the deeper themes and yet even WANTING to be a writer, at my age, with my literary experience.

In general, leave &quot;Literature,&quot; the thing called &quot;Literature&quot; at present, to run through its rapid fermentations (how more and more rapid they are in these years!), and to fluff itself off into Nothing, in its own way, like a poor bottle of soda-water with the cork sprung; it won&#039;t be long. In our time it has become all the rage; highest noblemen and dignitaries courting a new still higher glory there; innumerable men, women and children rushing towards it, yearly ever more. It sat painfully in Grub Street, in hungry garrets, so long; some few heroic martyrs always serving in it, among such a miscellany of semi-fatuous worthless ditto, courting the bubble reputation in worse than the cannon&#039;s mouth; in general, a very flimsy, foolish set. But that little company of martyrs has at last lifted Literature furiously or foamingly high in the world. Goes like the Iceland geysers in our time, like uncorked soda-water; and will, as I said, soon have done. Only wait: in fifty years, I should guess, all really serious souls will have quitted that mad province, left it to the roaring populaces; and for any Noble-man or useful person it will be a credit rather to declare, &quot;I never tried Literature; believe me, I have not written anything;&quot; and we of &quot; Literature&quot; by trade, we shall sink again, I perceive, to the rank of street-fiddling; no higher rank, though with endless increase of sixpences flung into the hat.

And yet of Shakspeare too, it is not the Fiction that I admire, but the Fact; to say truth, what I most of all admire are the traces he shows of a talent that could have turned the History of England into a kind of Iliad, almost perhaps into a kind of Bible. Manifest traces that way; something of epic in the cycle of hasty Fragments he has yielded us (slaving for his bread in the Bankside Theatre); and what a work wouldn&#039;t that have been! Marlborough said, He knew no English History but what he had got from Shakspeare; and truly that is still essentially the serious and sad fact for most of us; Fact thrice and four times lamentable, though Marlborough meant it lightly. Innumerable grave Books there are; but for none of us any real History of England, intelligible, profitable, or even conceivable in almost any section of it!</span><br>\u2014Thomas Carlyle, Shooting Niagara, \u00a7 VI, \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136", "filename": "carlyle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1152, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1675891887194344, "time": 1675891887, "md5": "8vxZBoLg0WjBI2bT3oUV8Q==", "fsize": 124653, "resto": 21632708}, {"no": 21632882, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)16:32:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21632771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21632771</a><br>No. If its good book the story carries a truth within that you see playing out through the characters.

We who have been brought up in the English-speaking world have internalized the idea that law exists to do justice between individual parties, rather than to impose a uniform regime of commands. Other Western systems have also reinforced the attachment of citizens to the political order \u2013 notably Roman law and its many derivatives (the code napol\u00e9on among them). It was evident from the earliest days of Christianity that the New Testament was not an attempt to replace the law of the imperial power, but an attempt to make a space for spiritual growth within it. In his parables, Christ emphasized that the secular law is to be obeyed, and that our duty to God does not require us to defy or to replace it.

Such is the message of Sayyid Qutb\u2019s writings, and of Milestones (ma\u2018alim fi\u2019l tariq, 1964) in particular. In that book, Qutb denounces secular law, national identity and the attempt to establish a purely human political order without reference to the revealed will of God: all are blasphemous in Qutb\u2019s eyes.

The conversation then shifted to the physical features of white women, with some wishing they had hair like Latinas. The conversation then shifted to the size of penises, with some arguing that the average erect penis is 33% longer than the average vagina. The conversation then shifted to the beauty of Latinas, with some arguing that they are ugly and out of shape, while others argued that they are attractive.

He saw himself as superior, a brilliant mind unappreciated by a society that favored the flashy and the shallow.

He scoured the internet, reading forums filled with like-minded individuals who shared his frustrations and bitterness. He felt a sense of camaraderie with these anonymous strangers, bonding over their shared experiences of rejection and loneliness.<br><br>But as much as he wanted to connect with others, he found himself constantly pushing people away. He was consumed by his own self-pity and resentment, unable to form meaningful relationships with anyone. He was an incel, a term he embraced with a sense of pride, even as it pushed him further into the shadows of society.<br><br>One day, he snapped. He walked the streets, seething with anger, feeling a sense of powerlessness that he couldn&#039;t escape. He saw the couples walking hand-in-hand, the groups of friends laughing and chatting, and he felt a deep sense of jealousy and resentment. He was filled with a desire for revenge, a need to make those who had rejected him pay for their cruelty.<br><br>In a moment of rage, he acted out, lashing out at the world that had rejected him. The consequences of his actions were swift and severe, sending shockwaves through the community and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.<br><br>In the aftermath of his outburst, the man was left with nothing but the emptiness of his own loneliness.

Even Christ laying hands on the ill and disabled to heal them, suggests a belief in this type of force or energy, which the 20th-century Christian Science cult took as a core concept and ran with it. <br><br>The 20th-century psychologist Wilhelm Reich, who was simultaneously brilliant yet insane, tried to resurrect Mesmeric vitalism with his \u201corgone energy\u201d theory.<br><br>Fun fact: without even being known to have studied Hinduism or Tantra or ever claimed any inspiration from them, Wilhelm Reich\u2019s own eccentric, wayward, self-willed forays into psychology, psychiatry, and medicine, made him come up with a similar functional concept to the \u201ckundalini\u201d of Hindu mystics. Reich tied the orgone energy he saw as permeating and animating the entire universe and especially finely organized in living beings, to what he called \u201corgastic potency\u201d (or \u201corgasmic potency\u201d).", "filename": "7D93F204-0553-4FE6-BE94-1FD818DE3F31", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676050232296760, "time": 1676050232, "md5": "fXOC7acALBIKtg7+ICUI/Q==", "fsize": 140344, "resto": 21639951}, {"no": 21640867, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)12:35:26", "name": "Possible cult leader", "com": "<a href=\"#p21640847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21640847</a><br>This is the strength of the sexual force, or of the orgasm, of the living being. Yet, although this is one pole orgone energy worked through according to Reich, it also functioned for the general health, well-being, and psychological state of the human being. This is pretty close to esoteric Tantric teachings that the same energy animating and enlivening the human being, and which becomes the energy of \u201cenlightenment\u201d when raised to the head (Sahasrara Chakra at the crown of the skull), at the other pole is sex energy. And that the energy courses from roughly around the genital region and base of the spine, up the spine (central nervous system) and to the brain when kundalini is activated in a person.<br><br>If any of you have read or know or care about Gurdjieff, he also had some interesting thoughts on and relation to this theory. He devotes an entire chapter to Mesmer in his \u201cBeelzebub\u2019s Tales to His Grandson,\u201d saying he\u2019s one of the rare humans in modern history to pierce through to a deeper-than-usual insight about the nature of reality, and was of course systematically \u201chenpecked\u201d to symbolic death by the intelligentsia of the day and materialist reductionism of the West. <br><br>Several students, who don\u2019t seem to have any reason to be lying, and who worked with Gurdjieff at sometimes very different times and places, hence having no explicit tie with the other disciples and necessary knowledge of what they were saying or happened to them, give accounts of their experiences with Gurdjieff\u2019s \u201canimal magnetism\u201d or unusual parapsychological or energetic phenomena he could cause.<br><br>Fritz Peters claimed that after years away from Gurdjieff, in which he (Peters) was drafted to fight in WW2, and got PTSD (or then-called \u201cshell shock\u201d or \u201cbattle fatigue\u201d from the experiences) and became extraordinarily depressed, went to meet Gurdjieff in his apartment in France, whereupon Gurdjieff hugged him and called him \u201cmy son!\u201d. Then, over coffee in Gurdjieff\u2019s apartment, he suddenly transferred a \u201cviolet electric energy\u201d (in Peters\u2019s own mind\u2019s eye), instantaneously rejuvenating him massively and dispelling his depression. He says this event surreally caused Gurdjieff himself to grow noticeably wearier, paler, older, weaker, and frailer in just that brief notice, whereupon Gurdjieff left then came back later somehow himself also rejuvenated again.", "filename": "D70EEAEE-7593-4FFA-B120-09D71E9B416F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 443, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676050526435091, "time": 1676050526, "md5": "iODGEi2//+fp6iH9td4o7Q==", "fsize": 22894, "resto": 21639951}, {"no": 21640941, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)12:48:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21640867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21640867</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He stared at me again for a second, dropped his cane, and cried out in a loud voice, &quot;My son!&quot;. \u2026 I helped him retrieve his hat and cane, he put one arm around my shoulders and started to lead me up the stairs, saying: &quot;Don&#039;t talk, you are sick.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When we reached his apartment, he led me down a long hall to a dark bedroom, indicated the bed, told me to lie down, and said: &quot;This your room, for as long as you need it.&quot; I laid down on the bed and he left the room but did not close the door. I felt such enormous relief and such excitement at seeing him that I began to cry uncontrollably and then my head began to pound. I could not rest and got up and walked to the kitchen where I found him sitting at the table. He looked alarmed when he saw me, and asked me what was wrong.

After, perhaps, two weeks of this regime Bennett fell ill with dysentery and became progressively weaker.

Later that day a movements class, directed by Gurdjieff, was held out of doors in the heat of the early afternoon sun. The exercise being taught was unusually difficult and many, more experienced pupils were giving up. Of his own experience he writes:</span><br><br>I felt very ill and weak. A deadly lassitude took possession of me, so that every movement became a supreme effort of will...<br><br>...There was no past and future, only the present agony of making my body move.

I will quote two further passages that give a sense of the profundity of the experience. He writes:</span><br><br>The great trees, the grey rocks, the cloudless sky and the murmur of evening insects all blended with my inner life. There was no distinction of outside and inside: everything was where it was, and so was neither inside nor outside of anything else.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Further on, he says:</span><br><br>Love was everywhere and in everything. It was infinitely adaptable to every shade of need. After a time, it became too much for me, it seemed that if I plunged any more deeply into the mystery of love, I would cease to exist...<br><br>...I knew that the world I had entered is one where there is no loneliness, because all who enter into that Eternal Source meet there as brothers....I had...the...awareness that it would not in the least matter if my body were destroyed.<br>__<br>P.D.

An American woman, highly dismissive of Gurdjieff and his followers, nudged an acquaintance and gestured at Gurdjieff from across the room, gawkily and jeeringly telling her friend something like, \u201cThis man is something like an insane cult leader from the East, here with his \u2018students\u2019 of the organization he\u2019s formed.\u201d Gurdjieff then looked at her, she reports freezing up for a moment, and then \u2026 <s>having a legitimate orgasm right at that moment in the restaurant</s>.<br>__<br>In his own \u201cBeelzebub\u2019s Tales to His Grandson,\u201d he calls this energy hanbledzoin, ties it to Mesmer\u2019s theory of animal magnetism, and attributes it similar effects/abilities when consciously developed and mastery over its use attained \u2014 prowess in hypnotism (simply and directly through use \u201chanbledzoin\u201d, without an intermediary mean) and other similar types of parapsychological effects. <br><br>Some Central Asian Sufis preserve a similar idea under the name of \u201ckaif,\u201d a type of energy of blessing, which saints and developed Sufis have a greater quantity of, and which can hence reside in their presence, as well as their tombs, graves, grave-cloths places on their tombs to gather such \u201ckaif,\u201d artifacts handled by them, architecture (such as of the Mecca, most notably) etc., and hence be passed on to receptive disciples in that way.<br><br>The Scottish woman Morag Murray who married a Muslim Sufi man in the mid 20th-century, then delved heavily into the culture and religion thereafter, gives this account of it:<br><br>https://ikbalalishahfakir.blogspot.<wbr>com/2012/11/the-kaif-system-morag-m<wbr>urray-1968-note.html?m=1", "filename": "9062EF60-CC7D-4926-B2B2-19FDBB79DF6B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 637, "h": 1015, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676053261457548, "time": 1676053261, "md5": "phe4lmr2RtGrbkJfvmL9lg==", "fsize": 301496, "resto": 21639951}, {"no": 21641134, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)13:33:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641082</a><br>Now this is a surreal parallel: she claims Sufi thoughts on and usage of kaif, includes a practically identical use of what Wilhelm Reich called his \u201corgone energy accumulators\u201d!

Hinduism and Buddhism often enjoin celibacy, including even some Tantric sects \u2014 the Tantric ones with the esoteric explanation, preserving the sex energy allows the sexual energy to be redirected from the base of the spine and genital region up the spine/central nervous system to the brain, leading to enlightenment. Tantric sects enjoining celibacy exist just as the more exotic Tantric sects more well-known to the West, following the \u201cvamamarga,\u201d left-hand heterodox path, who allow and sometimes even enjoin sex (such as with use of Tantric consorts).<br><br>Mesmer himself did not explicitly tie this vital energy/life-force he called animal magnetism to sexual energy, but the later psychologist Wilhelm Reich tied this almost identical concept, which he named orgone energy, to the orgasm, or sexual energy, as already explained, thus believing sexual potency, vigor, vitality and health was linked to overall psychological and bodily health, youth, and vitality, so whatever increased the patient\u2019s \u201corgastic potency\u201d (which hence could also be taken as, whatever made the patient\u2019s sex life better) overall made them healthier and could cure both mental and physical illnesses. He also coined the phrase \u201cthe sexual revolution.\u201d Hence Reich was more on the vamamarga Tantric wavelength than that of traditions enjoining celibacy. However, he was also a little bit insane (to put it mildly), at least in his later life, which perhaps was tragically compounded by the violent opposition and U.S. government and F.D.A. persecution against him worsening his mental health.<br><br>Precedents to the German physician Franz Anton Mesmer\u2019s (1734 - 1815) animal magnetism theory can be found in the works of Paracelsus (c. 1493 - 1591), the Swiss physician, alchemist, lay theologian/mystic, and philosopher of the German Renaissance. Mesmer started in the West/at least officially first publicized the techniques and phenomena of hypnotism, then called \u201cMesmerism\u201d after him. He claimed to use it to affect both physical and psychological cures of distressed patients. He attributed the mechanism of hypnotism, to a vital energy or life force, \u201canimal magnetism\u201d, in patients, with the stronger and healthier animal magnetism of the doctor/agents having a rejuvenating and salutary effect on the weaker, unhealthier patient(s).", "filename": "350DB210-A065-4E86-9D53-A8FFE17C2DC9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1222, "h": 1447, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676071160188257, "time": 1676071160, "md5": "xcwIgGfRMnK1pJVyAG0p5A==", "fsize": 902764, "resto": 21639951}, {"no": 21642302, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)18:29:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642263</a><br><a href=\"#p21641381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641381</a><br>It was named thus because like \u201cmagnetism\u201d, it was a mysterious immaterial and invisible force/energy/substance which nevertheless had real-life and observable effects, and \u201canimal\u201d because he theorized it to animate living beings. He seems to have literally conceived of it as a (immaterial/energetic/invisible) \u201cfluid,\u201d similar to how scientists of the day thought the force of magnetism functioned as a sort of fluid (like a liquid or gas) and could be modeled as such, but this is based on a somewhat outdated model of magnetism.<br><br>Again, he believed those with greater animal magnetism functioned as the ideal and natural \u201cMesmerists\u201d and hence could effect cures of patients simply from their greater and healthier stock of \u201canimal magnetism\u201d which they contributed to the patient. He also came up independently with a model and some practices similar to Taoist medical Qigong practices (think acupuncture and the like, but not just that), conceiving health as the free flow of animal magnetism in the body, and ill-health being tied to blockages or obstruction of the animal magnetism at various parts of the body. Hence like such medical Taoist folk practices, aimed to find and break these \u201cblockages\u201d. Wilhelm Reich had a similar yet more modernized idea as \u201cbody psychotherapy\u201d, holding that areas of muscular tension in the bodies of neurotic patients could be conceived as psychosomatic \u201cbody armor,\u201d these muscle groups often being unnecessarily flexed and tenses, as a sort of subconscious psychic defense, from trauma, as a manifestation of fear/latent anxiety, etc. So he tied the breaking up of \u201cbody armor\u201d or unnecessary muscular tension in patients (such as through relaxation techniques he came up with), psychosomatically, to improved mental health, holding it could and should all be part of one same process or system \u2014 treating the bodily and mental/emotional parts of the human simultaneously.<br><br>Compare this to practices like hathayoga, the yoga of the body and physical postures or \u201casanas\u201d as they\u2019re called, held to put one\u2019s body in the ideal state for meditation and naturally relax the psyche.", "filename": "E9018E2C-B62A-4555-A3E8-889B5CC5DA08", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 480, "h": 960, "tn_w": 62, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676071766200919, "time": 1676071766, "md5": "ZuiyAYwl7HvZL/D3fwlJnw==", "fsize": 61083, "resto": 21639951}, {"no": 21643218, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)23:35:51", "name": "I V R I \u2022 N E M O", "com": "<a href=\"#p21639951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21639951</a><br><br><br>Electromagnetism is real, but &quot;animal magnetism&quot; is nothing but a euphemism for psychologistical suggestion.", "time": 1676090151, "resto": 21639951, "trip": "!!GgBWHLRiayD"}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21641961, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)16:44:57", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "rate my short story", "com": "Inside a crowded carriage sat a middle-age Englishman and beside him was his wife, who also happened to be middle-age and English.

This in fact is precisely the offenceb and fate of the small Jewish people which, wondrous to relate, was driven from its domicile almost two thousand years ago, still exists and wanders about homeless. Meanwhile, so many great and glorious peoples, in whose company such a ramshackle nation should not even be mentioned \u2013 the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Etruscans and so on \u2013 have gone to their eternal rest and have entirely disappeared. Thus even today this people without home,c this John Landless among the peoples can be found the whole world over, nowhere at home and nowhere a stranger, all the while affirming its nationality with unprecedented stubbornness. Indeed, harking back to Abraham who lived in Canaan as a stranger but eventually became lord of the whole land as God had promised him (Genesis 17:8), it would like to get a proper foothold somewhere and put down roots, in order to obtain a country again, without which of course a people is a ball in the air. Until such time it lives parasitically on the other peoples and their soil, but is nevertheless inspired by the most robust patriotism for its own nation, which it displays by firmly sticking together, so that all stand for one and one for all.</span>", "time": 1676049365, "resto": 21640751}, {"no": 21640804, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)12:17:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21640797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21640797</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus this patriotism without fatherland has a more inspiring effect than any other. The fatherland of the Jew is composed of the rest of the Jews; this is why he fights for them as for hearth and home and no community on earth sticks together as firmly as this one. From this is seen how absurd it is to attempt to accommodate them with a share of the government or administration of any state. Their religion, from the ground up merged with and one with their state, is by no means the main issue here, but on the contrary only the bond that holds them together, the rallying point and the banner by which they recognize one another. This is also revealed by the fact that even the baptized Jew by no means heaps the hatred and loathing of the others upon himself as apostates otherwise do, but instead as a rule does not cease to be their friend and companion, with the exception of a few Orthodox Jews, and regards them as his true countrymen. For the regular and solemn prayer of the Jews, for which ten must always be together, a baptized Jew is even allowed to substitute if one is missing, though no other Christian. The same holds true for all other religious acts. The matter would emerge with even greater clarity if Christianity were to decline entirely and cease, insofar as the Jews would not then cease to exist and stick together separately as Jews, for themselves.

The Metaphysics Of The Love Of The Sexes.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own.38 Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is. Therefore snub-nosed individuals have an inexpressible liking for hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it is the same with regard to all other parts. Men with excessively slim, long bodies and limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure stumpy and short. The considerations with regard to temperament act in an [pg 359] analogous manner. Each will prefer the temperament opposed to his own; yet only in proportion as his one is decided. Whoever is himself in some respect very perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others; because he himself insures the children against great imperfection of this part. For example, whoever is himself very white will not object to a yellow complexion; but whoever has the latter will find dazzling whiteness divinely beautiful. The rare case in which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs when, besides the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the opposite, and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then wont to reach a high degree.</span>", "filename": "schoppi_d8rw6__please_credit[palette.fm]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 476, "h": 525, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676058235154179, "time": 1676058235, "md5": "6nQhytnFxyERCCcuoUnLmg==", "fsize": 60258, "resto": 21640751}, {"no": 21641420, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:47:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21640751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21640751</a><br>For me it&#039;s still the ramblings about his noisy neighborhood", "time": 1676058452, "resto": 21640751}, {"no": 21641424, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:48:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641406</a><br>Women prefer men with dark hair<br>https://www.bustle.com/articles/103<wbr>217-women-dont-want-to-date-men-wit<wbr>h-blonde-hair-says-new-survey-but-h<wbr>eres-who-they<br>https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front<wbr>/london-s-women-prefer-dark-hair-63<wbr>28244.html", "time": 1676058483, "resto": 21640751}, {"no": 21641465, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)14:55:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641420</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kant has written a treatise on The Vital Powers; but I should like to write a dirge on them, since their lavish use in the form of knocking, hammering, and tumbling things about has made the whole of my life a daily torment. Certainly there are people, nay, very many, who will smile at this, because they are not sensitive to noise; it is precisely these people, however, who are not sensitive to argument, thought, poetry or art, in short, to any kind of intellectual impression: a fact to be assigned to the coarse quality and strong texture of their brain tissues. On the other hand, in the biographies or in other records of the personal utterances of almost all great writers, I find complaints of the pain that noise has occasioned to intellectual men. For example, in the case of Kant, Goethe, Lichtenberg, Jean Paul; and indeed when no mention is made of the matter it is merely because the context did not lead up to it. I should explain the subject we are treating in this way: If a big diamond is cut up into pieces, it immediately loses its value as a whole; or if an army is scattered or divided into small bodies, it loses all its power; and in the same way a great intellect has no more power than an ordinary one as soon as it is interrupted, disturbed, distracted, or diverted; for its superiority entails that it concentrates all its strength on one point and object, just as a concave mirror concentrates all the rays of light thrown upon it. Noisy interruption prevents this concentration. This is why the most eminent intellects have always been strongly averse to any kind of disturbance, interruption and distraction, and above everything to that violent interruption which is caused by noise; other people do not take any particular notice of this sort of thing.</span><br>It&#039;s almost adorably autistic", "time": 1676058919, "resto": 21640751}, {"no": 21641754, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)15:58:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21640922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21640922</a><br>Why be proud of something you didn&#039;t do?

There is no superior race. Augustine was probably black as his Berber mother was. Luther had constant contact with a Coptic priest from Ethiopia. The charismatic movement is rooted in African worship. Racism was created during the enlightenment and was a way for the elite to step on any culture they felt like. Racism as a worldview is only 300+- years old. Islam is older than racism lol. It is foolish. Rooted in erroneous dogma perpetuated by Darwin. It is in its most base form an excuse for man to reveal his sinfulness.

You don\u2019t see the same kind of praise in America for Samuel R Delaney and Hogg that you do in France for de Sade and 120 days of sodom, despite what I would consider to be comparable degeneracy, and while Delaney has shared some nonce views, there is no knowledge of him actually kidnapping and abusing children like de Sade did", "time": 1675950700, "resto": 21631699}, {"no": 21635780, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)08:56:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21635766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21635766</a><br>Because mentally ill Americans are pussies.

Instead they treat them as subjects to be studied through the format of the interview, if they actually said the things they add as voiceovers later, the interview would simply be over because these art people are too far up their own ass to entertain any thought outside their large intestines, so it&#039;s much more fruitful and entertaining to get them to talk and then analyse what they say later. I don&#039;t think they go at it as a way of seeking a real discussion, they just try to get people to reveal something to them that they can explore and analyse from their point of view.
