He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them. In like manner the God, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of daemons who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Cronos, as tradition paints it, and order both our homes and our States in obedience to the immortal element within us, giving to reason&#039;s ordering the name of \u201claw.\u201d But if an individual man or an oligarchy or a democracy, possessed of a soul which strives after pleasures and lusts and seeks to surfeit itself therewith, having no continence and being the victim of a plague that is endless and insatiate of evil,\u2014 if such an one shall rule over a State or an individual by trampling on the laws, then there is (as I said just now) no means of salvation.</span>", "filename": "UWHQDRHYVJCBTE5ZZQCWCPZ6UI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1632, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1673404138059078, "time": 1673404138, "md5": "Y4zW/6AovWRXBEd5WJ2KDA==", "fsize": 966047, "resto": 21507974}, {"no": 21508845, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508590</a><br>Some people are born to be whiny faggots who accomplish nothing (you and OP).

Such an \u201cinside out\u201d use presupposes the loss of the sense of the supernatural, and therefore a certain degeneration of the sacred forms where such an inversion first occurs; and, once actualized, such an inferior and rightly infernal possibility will obviously attempt to seize all religious forms, even in the full strength of their orthodoxy.

This chapter recounts how certain angels coveted the \u201cdaughters of men\u201d and united with them. Now there is, in fact, one text among others of the Hermetic tradition that relates this mysterious event to Set-Typhon. We hear Isis the prophetess reveal to her son Horus that \u201cas (he) was leaving to do battle against Typhon . . . one of the angels which reside in the first heaven, having seen her, wanted to have intercourse with her.\u201d Clearly this symbolically indicates a descent of energy from the spiritual to the psychic level, a fall from the heavenly into the earthly, a profanatory intermingling of the two. And, in the Bible, this event has a direct connection with the Flood which, according to Gu\u00e9non, corresponds to the disappearance of Atlantis.<br><br>https://discord.gg/rjbwFp3g", "filename": "Jean-BORELLA-4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1365, "h": 2047, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673667296565875, "time": 1673667296, "md5": "wMZaIDiEEiZ/sp61szCwcw==", "fsize": 3453109, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "jean-borella-on-the-counterinitiation", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 21523986, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)07:28:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673699335, "resto": 21522544}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21518025, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)21:08:14", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Books that genuinely changed your life and why", "com": "Tolstoy details his existential crisis and explores the main questions of life that most people are too scared to contemplate.

One-word translations are searched for in all your selected dictionaries. Then, the words you have looked up are added to your vocabulary that you can go back to and learn again (&quot;Vocabulary builder&quot; feature). Sentence translation uses internet, works great too, but I never use it.

How all you can do is bait a hook and wait for the idea fish to appear. That made me think about the book &quot;From Normal to Healthy&quot; by K\u00fchlewind. In the intro section he talks about how thought forms appear fully realized in your consciousness. And this all made me think about something I realized while journaling recently - I haven&#039;t been truly bored in years, decades, perhaps since I was a kid where I have distinct memories of those grueling moments of pure boredom. Sundays after church when my dad was cooking and the whole house was 80F+, I would sit in my room sweating, looking at the handful of books I had read multiple times each, flipping around the three stations on the TV. Maybe I&#039;d go in the back yard and lose hours climbing on the same tree or scratching at the ground with a stick or throwing pebbles at the fence. Riding my bike down, and pushing my bike back up, the same hill at the end of the street over and over again. These activities were all meaningless but they gave the appropriate space to imagine, to worry, to think. In an effort to fight the boredom, as I always dreamed of doing on those sweaty Sundays, I have created a life in which I can never be bored. And as such, I am no longer fishing. Any idea that could have formed flows right past me. I&#039;m not tuned in to hear it.<br><br>Today I did a bit of an experiment. My top priority was to drop whatever I was doing when I had a &quot;distracted&quot; thought in order to pursue it - something Lynch also mentioned in the clip I saw. I would catch the faintest idea and pursue it. Bloom it. At the very least, record it. I wrote pages in a legal pad until my hand hurt. And despite the scribbling and the interrupted reading and working sessions, I feel more centered than I have in some time. I feel less distracted because I gave myself some boring space to sit staring at the trees, and when I realized what the trees looked or smelled like, I wrote about it.", "time": 1673664331, "resto": 21519351}, {"no": 21522387, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:00:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldQ<wbr>rapQ4d0Y", "filename": "1614203842017", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 578, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1673665245687564, "time": 1673665245, "md5": "vk7AG6aDNbsDvhQVI30CSw==", "fsize": 49817, "resto": 21519351}, {"no": 21522414, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:08:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522349</a><br>You seem like you will be considered a wise man someday, anon.<br><br>I truly hope that you don&#039;t ever give up on yourself.

She&#039;s a bit of a slut, a drunk, cokehead but she inexplicably looks better than girls 10 years younger than her despite abusing her body.<br><br>We got to know each other, had sex a few times and she seemed very much into me until about a few weeks later when she very much wasn&#039;t. No explanation. Remember, I&#039;m on this website: I&#039;m one of life&#039;s failures, especially socially, so for any woman, let alone a real pretty one to throw herself at me like she did was unthinkable, even if she was an emotional trainwreck. She was the first and so far the only one. I was 27 on the night we met which was also the first time I had sex. In the end, she was very clear that she didn&#039;t want to see me anymore, neither as a serious relationship nor as a friend (the latter through actions rather than direct words).<br><br>After no contact for about 4 months, we ran into each other again last night, as I was with mutual friends who wanted to see her. She was very genial and we could speak comfortably, alcohol helping (she was blind drunk, me slightly less). I had been thinking of calling her since about early December. I thought there might be a chance to try again. Eventually I found out she was seeing someone. I couldn&#039;t help but mention that she had said before that she had too much going on for a relationship when we last spoke. She said it was true then but she was sorry and that I never did anything wrong, a thought which has tormented me since it ended. I didn&#039;t really have it in me to hide my disappointment, but I didn&#039;t push the issue any further. She no doubt noticed the change in demeanour and a few times during the night she seemed to try and make me feel better, despite being blind drunk. We chatted a little more as people started to head home from the bar around 2AM. She seemed to remember the things we used to talk about before we stopped talking; a work deadline I had, a job I had applied for and asked me how those things went. She kissed me on the cheek as she got a cab home.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m not sure what the point of this is. It&#039;s not particularly interesting or unique; I&#039;m not the first loser to get hurt by an unstable woman. I&#039;m just some guy. It probably wouldn&#039;t have worked with us in the long term (probably, not definitely). The obvious 4chan answer is that she&#039;s a crazy slut, who cares, move on. But I&#039;m also a real piece of shit so a trainwreck like her is probably on my level. At least I thought that might be the case. I dunno, I think I&#039;m kind of fucked in general. I got problems outside of her and I don&#039;t see things getting better soon. I don&#039;t really have much resilience left in me so I think I&#039;m approaching an inevitable conclusion soon enough. I know bad things happen to everyone but it&#039;s more the absence of anything good that gets me; many false dawns and glimpses of better things.

The way we met differed. I met her because she was trying to make money quickly for some urgent expenses, I just happened to find the ad because I had gradually been becoming sexually desperate to the point of looking around online, and naturally alongside that desperation, also wanting to meet someone who was reasonably intelligent, because as everyone probably knows if there is a big gap in wit it just results in feeling more alone, despite being in company (although ultimately, both situations can lead to increased suffering depending on the actual outcome). It&#039;s also the first time I&#039;d done anything like this, though, and quite impulsive on my part.<br><br>When I met her and went to the hotel (which was reasonably high class, no doubt, at least as far as I could tell), it was like a nonstop barrage of conversation about virtually anything. She had a personality that was not quite bubbly but at the same time highly open and dynamic, she could talk about virtually anything, a little bit airheaded, but more out of habit than actual stupidity. It was easy to tell she was quite intelligent despite the act, and she was also highly attractive and had a beautifully shaped face, especially her nose. She was complimenting me about everything (physical and otherwise, the former makes sense because I am actually quite tall and in reasonable shape) while at the same time asking questions to get to know more. I did the same to her, to the point where we ended up knowing more about each other than most people would know, I assume, even after going on a few normal dates.<br><br>The sex was also amazing. Despite it also being my first time, which means I genuinely cannot tell how well things went objectively or if there was deception involved on her part, it seemed like she enjoyed it more than I did, not just from what she said, but even (mainly) from her bodily reactions.<br><br>Last, I ended up overstaying and more or less staying the night despite the intention originally being about an hour. After I arrived back home, I was fine for a while, but the pangs of loss came into effect probably a day later. I messaged her after I left with the complimentary message saying how much I enjoyed our time together, but then later, as the pangs were felt, I likely overplayed my hand by becoming too personal and complimenting her too much on things that are well beyond merely sexual. I say &quot;likely&quot;, because despite this she was still messaging back and wanting to see me again, however she was not as open handed as me in giving out compliments. Maybe to stay professional or collected, I don&#039;t know. Either way I will probably see her again and follow the road whither it leads.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did yours wear a septum piercing?</span><br>Not at the time, but I didn&#039;t specifically look for a piercing mark to see if she simply wasn&#039;t wearing it.", "time": 1673672643, "resto": 21519351}, {"no": 21522901, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)00:04:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522878</a><br>I&#039;m not a &quot;shut in&quot;.

If you cannot mark the units with some regularity, you don&#039;t have verse.

He stopped posting because I humiliated him repeatedly during his Xenosystems days, simply by pulling at the seams of his idiotic thought process. As for Accelerationism, it is nonsense, because it is based on false premises:<br><br>1. That Capital and Intelligence (production) are somehow isomorphic. This is he kind of claim that&#039;s not right, but is not even wrong; no wonder then that Land makes appeals to gibberish production machines like Deleuze &amp; Guattari -- via &quot;deterritorialization&quot; -- to justify this inane equivalence. I will not belabor this point further.<br>2. That intelligence is some kind of attractor in, let&#039;s call it &quot;universal fitness space&quot; -- which is itself based on two sub-hypotheses:<br>2a. That intelligence is evolutionarily robust, as opposed to fragile i.e. it is a perennial winning strategy. This is an empirically disproven claim. The irony here is that one of Land&#039;s pet peeves during his Xenosystems &quot;era&quot; was dysgenics. The cognitive dissonance was too much I imagine, which is why I suspect he ended up &quot;devolving&quot; into a jelly-brained boomer in recent years.<br>2b.

This is, to say the least, highly speculative (granted, it is the least stupid of his assumptions).<br><br>Given these 2 assumptions, Land&#039;s point is then that Capital, once coming into being, can only continue existing and getting better and better at outcompeting any other thing, not limited to economic systems, but encompassing any system in the universe, including life itself.

That&#039;s not a bon mot. What with the insidious effects of the interweb and all, we&#039;re getting programmed for the 30-second (3-second) info-nugget, which makes it harder to understand / enjoy anything substantial. Reading the dictionary is only going to make that worse. You&#039;re exercising the muscle that&#039;s overdeveloped and ignoring the one that&#039;s atrophying.<br><br>\u2014 It doesn&#039;t show the words in action. Dr. Johnson did try to do this. He took the attitude that &quot;a word means what a good writer says it means&quot; and always looked for quotations from classic texts to demonstrate the meaning. But most modern dictionaries don&#039;t follow him. (The OED does, to an extent, but you aren&#039;t going to sit down and read the OED cover-to-cover unless you&#039;re Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Even if you are, you&#039;ll get through about one word an hour.)<br><br>\u2014 It doesn&#039;t have any sense of importance / frequency. It puts relatively common, useful words cheek-by-jowl with insane nonsense that Spenser used once and no-one has ever heard of since. You might consider something like &lt;pic attached&gt;. If you&#039;re at a certain middling level, it focuses on what you need; i.e. it misses out everything you already know, at one end, and everything you really don&#039;t need to know, at the other.<br><br><br>Reading a thesaurus is only good if you have a dictionary in the other hand, because a thesaurus doesn&#039;t tell you what the words mean. Sylvia Plath, apparently, wrote her poems with the thesaurus open on the table in front of her. But I imagine that a) she knew most of the words and was just using it to prompt her memory, and b) if she encountered an unfamiliar word she looked it up.

Normally they have to address it somehow because it&#039;s living in their head rent free. Sometimes there are literal slaves in the fantasy or allegories to slavery, but even in the absence of those it still tends to be a response to American racial slavery by its omission. Writers without that particularly American unease write both slavery and its absence differently, and are hard for Americans/anglophones to interpret because there isn&#039;t a presumption they&#039;re familiar with. Likewise, because Americans (and anglophones in general) have a kind of myth of the medieval ages, a lot of stuff in Anglo centric fantasy is just not going to be part of the presumptions of Europeans on medieval history. <br>If you want a really extreme example of this, a lot of Wicca comes from an English nudist civil servant&#039;s fantasy book on a supposed ancient English religion of magic. In any other situation the same people who practice that faith would see it as further cultural erasure of Celtic peoples and open cultural appropriation of their religion for personal profit, which English has a long and medieval history of doing. They can have debates about the cultural appropriation of voodoo, with no cognitive dissonance because it fits their presumption of a clean line of races by skin, but they start throwing out ideas like the Celts are not a race or the fantasy writer got their religion more right in the book than others, and there&#039;s nothing that is going to piss off the Celts than saying the English fantasy history is more accurate than their long recorded actual history and languages. Europe has at most two races in their minds, because there is the non slave race and the slave race in their minds, and Europe never had slavery in their basic presumptions about race because they assume it&#039;s homogeneously white (or at least not a slave race) with no internal divisions.

In a 1932 interview with Henry Nash Smith, for example, Faulkner claimed, in fact, that he had never read Ulysses, invoking instead a vague aural source for his knowledge of Joycean methods: \u201d \u2018 You know,\u2019 he smiled, \u2018sometimes I think there must be a sort of pollen of ideas floating in the air, which fertilizes similarly minds here and there which have not had direct contact. I had heard of Joyce, of course,\u2019 he went on. \u2018Some one told me about what he was doing, and it is possible that I was influenced by what I heard\u2019 \u201d (LIG 30). In a moment of irony that may not have been lost on the interviewer, Faulkner reached over to his table and handed Smith a 1924 edition of the book. . . By 1947, Faulkner hardly needed to be so coy, telling an English class at the University of Mississippi that Joyce was \u201cthe father of modern literature\u201d (1974 FAB 1230). By 1957, Faulkner\u2019s pronouncements on Joyce had become fully classical: \u201cJames Joyce was one of the great men of my time.

My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better.

A lot of the great history books either don&#039;t get reprinted or haven&#039;t been translated. Every book with the exception of Goldworthy&#039;s Caesar has major issues with one of the three things I brought up. Roberts&#039; Napoleon is an example of a dishonest biography. Roberts picks and chooses which antidotes of Napoleon he wants to include in order to fit his narrative. However, Roberts never acknowledges his cherry picking. The part discussing the Egyptian Campaign being the primary example. There are many different accounts describing Napoleon&#039;s conduct in Egypt, some favorable and others not. Roberts&#039; did not present both sides. Instead, he chose unfavorable depictions of Napoleon&#039;s behavior then presented that as fact. That is what I consider dishonest. Ron Chernow is is a historian that suffers from bias. Chernow is utterly convinced in presenting historical figures from his point of view. Now I can&#039;t be too hard on Chernow since 99.9% of historians let biases influence their work and unlike certain american historians like McCullough, Chernow isn&#039;t weighed down by narcissism and smugness. The key issue with Chernow is he almost always never lets the historical figures&#039; actions speak for themselves. Chernow always inserts himself into whatever action is taking place. He can&#039;t help himself from inserting his bias (which is mostly favorable). Robert S. Cato is the prime example of a petty historian. Cato&#039;s The Power Broker is an entire book spawned by Cato&#039;s hatred for Robert Moses. He does not even try to make a balanced view of his subject. It flat out is a study of a man who Cato despised. Of course, The Power Broker is an entertaining read but that doesn&#039;t distract from the fact he is completely absorbed by his pettiness.", "time": 1673691434, "resto": 21522181}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21519150, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)03:55:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "While walking around the bookstore I was struck by just how much shit has been published. <br><br>Why do these publishing houses keep publishing shit?

Her golden hair blew about his face, blinding him with its sheen; the feel of her slender body twisting in his mailed arms drove him to blinder madness. His strong fingers sank deep into her smooth flesh; and that flesh was cold as ice. It was as if he embraced not a woman of human flesh and blood, but a woman of flaming ice.

A fleeting instant, skies and snowy hills were bathed in crackling white flames, blue darts of icy light, and frozen crimson fires. Then Conan staggered and cried out. The girl was gone. The glowing snow lay empty and bare; high above his head the witch-lights flashed and played in a frosty sky gone mad, and among the distant blue mountains there sounded a rolling thunder as of a gigantic war-chariot rushing behind steeds whose frantic hoofs struck lightning from the snows and echoes from the skies.<br><br>Then suddenly the borealis, the snow-clad hills and the blazing heavens reeled drunkenly to Conan&#039;s sight; thousands of fire-balls burst with showers of sparks, and the sky itself became a titanic wheel which rained stars as it spun.

The &quot;problem&quot; with Ayn Rand&#039;s tough-minded writing is that it&#039;s too precise and too explicit; there&#039;s nothing that is up to interpretation. We see her politico-economic moral position with her every chapter (which a great number of people have qualms with).<br><br>3. Similarly, her philosophy is too simple, and I don&#039;t personally think that that&#039;s bad. But while it&#039;s also precise and rigorous, it chooses not to subscribe to the technical language of academics. Unlike the German and French who just love creating their own vocabulary or has an aphoretic style, she is too straightforward. Any person of significant fame and publicly declares her stances on all issues (an atheistic conservative at that) would be no less hated.<br><br>4. When morality is &quot;Black and White&quot; and Rand has an &quot;Me vs The World&quot; philosophy, it&#039;s easy to see why it&#039;s easy to hate her. Specially since she has a holistic approach to philosophy that a disagreement on one issue (e.g. she thinks a woman shouldn&#039;t be president), it&#039;s easy to snowball this disagreement into something else and, in her words, to &quot;package-deal&quot; hating her.<br><br><a href=\"#p21521296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21521296</a><br>One of my diasgreement with Rand is that in some cases there are points in civil society where responsibility takes precedence than rights, e.g. such as in the case of emergencies.

Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lu\u00b4thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u00b4miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\u2019s kin, in Lo\u00b4rien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father\u2019s house.

The vague thriller-plot investigation establishes just the right aura of existential culpability on this front. And the books\u2019 obsession with machinery and technology, explored in various ways, posits the human mind\u2019s urge to create such things as a fundamental drive. The same mental facility that leads men to build race cars (racing cars is another profession of Bobby\u2019s), and lay pipe on the ocean floor (a skill of the friend who is killed), leads them to build bombs and drop them on other people. The ultimate question is whether such evil comes from within us, or from an outside source, and how anyone is supposed to live in its shadow. McCarthy trafficks in religion. His characters don\u2019t believe, but they would like to. Their author takes God seriously enough to establish his absence.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cStella Maris,\u201d for example, is Latin for \u201cStar of the Sea,\u201d one of the titles of the Virgin Mary, but Alicia\u2019s behavior makes her an anti-Mary\u2014her scientific inquiry and her suicide are the opposite of Mary\u2019s submission to God\u2019s will. That this anti-Mary has a symbolic \u201cchild,\u201d and what he may be, offers many ticklish possibilities for contemplation. McCarthy\u2019s culminating metaphor for the presence of evil is also religious, and involves a \u201cJudas hole\u201d.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s a disappointment, but not a surprise, that critical reception for these books has so far been muted. A few perceptive souls have caught the extraordinary quality of the writing. But, as the Kid says in one scene \u201cCore questions can make you look stupid.\u201d (A few beats later, the Kid asks Alicia, \u201cWhere was I?\u201d She replies, \u201cLooking stupid.\u201d) Contemporary literature is by and large not concerned with God or metaphysics, and reviewers have neither the theology nor the history to engage with this work. And certainly no one has the math. One review characterized Hiroshima and Nagasaki as \u201can atrocity that might have stopped a bigger atrocity\u201d\u2014a grade-school version of events that is highly contested and that misses McCarthy\u2019s moral framework.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two novels also lack the discussion of personal identity and fulfillment that substitutes for philosophical inquiry and plot in our day and age. Alicia and Bobby, from this impoverished standpoint, are unrealistic. Few people want to recognize, as McCarthy does, that first things are realistic, including evil, including God. His suggestion that we bear responsibility for our violence and sins and bombs and wars is less popular still. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To misunderstand these books is to miss the bleakness and the haunting beauty of the \u201ceucharist\u201d (McCarthy\u2019s term) that Alicia offers with her lonely death, and to miss Bobby\u2019s gift as he departs singing on his bier, which is McCarthy\u2019s parting gift, as well. The old master is also singing. Let\u2019s listen to him.</span>", "time": 1673667689, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522581, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:44:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522111</a><br>Imagine getting filtered by a 4chan post", "time": 1673667857, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522589, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:45:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522581</a><br>It&#039;s a reasonable question.", "time": 1673667954, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522636, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522564</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a grade-school version of events that is highly contested</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; and reviewers have neither the theology nor the history to engage with this work. </span><br>https://www.wearethemighty.com/migh<wbr>ty-history/todays-medals-made-for-w<wbr>wii/<br><br>Lol.lmao.", "time": 1673668504, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522648, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:57:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522636</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jingoistic revisionism</span><br>Yeah not reading any of that bullshit, bud.", "time": 1673668664, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522697, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:07:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522397</a><br>And people say there&#039;s no humor in Cormac&#039;s books.", "time": 1673669233, "resto": 21522074}, {"no": 21522749, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)23:21:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522636</a><br>Holy shit!

Of course, American lit has been inspired by British lit, but a lot of it kinda feels like a rejection of that culture. So you have authors like Poe and Lovecraft that focus on the fantastical stuff, Emerson and Whitman that de-emphasize the importance of society to man, Hemingway that writes more symbolically about universals like a continental Euro, or the Southern Gothic writers that are very Anglo-inspired but still have a kind of tongue in cheek tone to them.<br><br>So I can&#039;t speak for everyone, but to me British literature&#039;s main problem seems to be its lack of expansive thought.

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. Lem liked to imagine Sisyphus happy. Sissyphus may be the name of a porn star Lem liked<br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle.

The Last Man thesis is a spot on description of the modern incel/chud. Afraid of becoming a sort of domesticated, bovine consumer, they lash out.<br><br>The Last Man craves safety, abhors struggle and risk, prioritizes equality above greatness, and is spiritually dead. Young men, confronted with becoming Last Men, flock to Gu\u00e9non and Evola, looking for spirituality (they have generally turned their back on religion, although you get Tradcath and Orthodox LARP too). Fearing their descent into Last Men, young men, mostly on the right, advocate for purposeless war and struggle for their own sake.<br><br>You can see this quite well on /pol/ and with the general phenomena of &quot;Boog&quot; enthusiasts. There is a lot of similarity between people wanting a war today, thinking it will be some sort of transformative, glorious thing, and all the people who yearned for war up until 1914. Memories of past conflicts have faded, and people end up with a delusional view on what war is actually like.<br><br>For example, I&#039;ve seen multiple threads on /pol/ asking: &quot;what will you do after the Civil War?&quot;<br><br>Most of the answers are: &quot;move to some small town, by a house with a decent amount of land, go to church and meet a girl. The great irony here, as someone who lives in a rural area, is that houses here are still very cheap. With the labor shortage here, anyone working full time with any financial discipline can get a house with a bunch of land. Churches are open every Sunday and always want new people, especially young ones. None of this is outside their means. But they don&#039;t go for it because it requires risk and hard work. <br><br>This then is the great irony of the Last Men. Fearing becoming Last Men, they become even more Last Men, destroying what their forefathers built out of petulance. <br><br>How does the Last Man respond to their sense of fading masculinity? Consumption. Hence tactical gear of all types, from tactical flashlights to coffee cups to tactical baby carriers. Men appropriately mock women for expensive handbags, but what is the truck for most men?

Our current society is predicated on the idea that there is no truth in life other than the 9-5 we wake up to in the morning. We are supposed to believe that the only words that matter are the orders of our bosses, that the knowledge we obtain from literature is less valuable than corporate etiquette handbooks, that hours spent contemplating profound artistic works are better spent scrolling through mindless social media videos, and that feelings of immense pain, beauty and euphoria which literature can inspire are just arbitrary chemical reactions rather than the cries of a primordial spirit. Most literature today is genre fiction garbage precisely for this reason. Like every other form of media now, it&#039;s simply a distraction.

Schmitt&#039;s rolling over in his grave. He identifies political theology with ideology. He misinterprets Schmitt&#039;s view on liberalism, which Schmitt could not mention without compulsively haranguing the reader about its tendency to depoliticize (and so not draw a distinction between friend and enemy). But then again of course he couldn&#039;t mention that, because then he couldn&#039;t write this gem:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From the realist perspective of Schmitt, there is no structural difference between the liberal state, the communist state, and the fascist state\u2014or indeed any other state. The only difference is the extent to which a regime may obscure the nature of its power or else genuinely buy into myths of neutrality. Viewed in this way, a state wedded to liberal democracy is as \u2018totalitarian\u2019 as any other since, by its very nature, it will be unable to tolerate any leaders who are not always already liberal democrats.</span><br><br>Check out pic related.

But it would be very much nearer to the truth. The last Stoics, like Marcus Aurelius, were exactly the people who did believe in the Inner Light. Their dignity, their weariness, their sad external care for others, their incurable internal care for themselves, were all due to the Inner Light, and existed only by that dismal illumination. Notice that Marcus Aurelius insists, as such introspective moralists always do, upon small things done or undone; it is because he has not hate or love enough to make a moral revolution. He gets up early in the morning, just as our own aristocrats living the Simple Life get up early in the morning; because such altruism is much easier than stopping the games of the amphitheatre or giving the English people back their land. Marcus Aurelius is the most intolerable of human types. He is an unselfish egoist. An unselfish egoist is a man who has pride without the excuse of passion. Of all conceivable forms of enlightenment the worst is what these people call the Inner Light. Of all horrible religions the most horrible is the worship of the god within. Any one who knows any body knows how it would work; any one who knows any one from the Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work. That Jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately to mean that Jones shall worship Jones. Let Jones worship the sun or moon, anything rather than the Inner Light; let Jones worship cats or crocodiles, if he can find any in his street, but not the god within. Christianity came into the world firstly in order to assert with violence that a man had not only to look inwards, but to look outwards, to behold with astonishment and enthusiasm a divine company and a divine captain.

Basically, books like OP aren&#039;t worth the effort it takes and books that would be worth putting the work into are also prohibitive given the amount of effort and likelihood of success; it would be easier/more profitable to create fake sports memorabilia (e.g. false signatures or even cards).", "time": 1673625206, "resto": 21499329}, {"no": 21520523, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)13:36:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21518585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21518585</a><br>underrated", "time": 1673635019, "resto": 21499329}, {"no": 21520574, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)13:53:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21520012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21520012</a><br>Its hard to make a passable fake of a rare volume.

Here&#039;s a quote by Schmitt in one of those Junger threads, from his Political Romanticism:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;To a great extent, all ecclesiastical and state institutions and forms, all legal concepts and arguments, everything that is official, and even democracy itself since the time it assumed a constitutional form are perceived as empty and deceptive disguises, as a veil, a fa\u00e7ade, a fake, or a decoration. The words, both refined and crude, in which this is encompassed are more numerous and forceful than most of the corresponding idioms of other times; for example, the references to &quot;simulacra&quot; that the political literature of the seventeenth century employs as its characteristic shibboleth. Today the &quot;backstage&quot; that conceals the real movement of reality is constructed everywhere. This betrays the insecurity of the time and its profound sense of being deceived. An era that produces no great form and no representation based on its own presuppositions must succumb to such states of mind and regard everything that is formal and official as a fraud. This is because no era lives without form, regardless of the extent to which it comports itself in an economic fashion. If it does not succeed in finding its own form, then it grasps for thousands of surrogates in the genuine forms of other times and other peoples, only to immediately repudiate the surrogate as a sham.&quot;</span><br><br>Is Junger&#039;s anarch only the result of this mindset? To go further, if we apprehend Schmitt&#039;s body of work as an attempt to elucidate a path by which we can find our own form, what does that mean for the anarch? He seems open to a legitimate and deserving authority (whatever that means), but Schmitt is quite explicit, i.e. in his work on Hobbes, about the necessity of the destruction of the distinction between public and private thought, or put properly, about that distinction being the root of the problem to begin with.", "filename": "schmitt", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1253, "h": 1548, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673560849706152, "time": 1673560849, "md5": "Z5vq5NGFUED0y9petpOTHQ==", "fsize": 905031, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21517541, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:02:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21516539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21516539</a><br>bump", "filename": "1280px-Henri_Matisse,_1902,_Notre-Dame,_une_fin_d&#039;apr\u00e8s-midi,_oil_on_paper_mounted_on_canvas,_72.4_x_54.6_cm,_Albright-Knox_Art_Gallery", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1752, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673568134658250, "time": 1673568134, "md5": "gukgXu09uX56PtGjgTSqWA==", "fsize": 474470, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21518283, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:25:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517067</a><br>SOMEONE ANSWER", "time": 1673580306, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21518684, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21516539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21516539</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you interpret Ernst Junger&#039;s Anarch?

OP if you really do have such knowledge of the history of philosophy, a guided list of great (or simply your favorite) lesser-known texts and thinkers would be more useful", "time": 1673655379, "resto": 21520176}, {"no": 21522018, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)20:04:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21521798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21521798</a><br>Good question. A few answers. One: For my own sake: It would force me to learn the philosophers I talk about very in-depth, and make connections between them, which due to polemical hostilities like you&#039;ve seen in this very thread, keep people from seeing important commonalities. I find that writing things down helps remember things, and systematically organizing and connecting ideas especially so. Second: By learning lesser-known insights as part of this sort of a project, it&#039;s possible to make new connections or new extensions that would keep philosophy progressing. So that&#039;s a value in itself. Third: I think some lesser-known ideas are perishing, not being paid attention to, when they don&#039;t deserve that lack of attention. So I feel a weird desire to bring them to light, because I don&#039;t think their dignity is any less owing to current lack of popularity. Fourth: It can be helpful for people who haven&#039;t studied these philosophers super in-depth to have access to secondary or tertiary literature. For one, it can give them a sort of outline of what basic things to expect when they then turn to reading the primary readings directly. But it should also encourage them (by getting them interested in those philosophers) to go and read those works themselves.<br><a href=\"#p21521777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21521777</a><br>Yes but that shortcoming is one we&#039;re trying to avoid. Why should Russell&#039;s failure entitle me to make the same mistake, even worse actually, judging from how polemical all of you have been in this thread? You guys are worse than Russell, so if you hate him hate yourselves next.<br><a href=\"#p21521802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21521802</a><br>I don&#039;t know why you&#039;re nitpicking a passing statement to then go on some tirade about something. You could just engage the thread in good faith, share philosophers that you would like paid more attention to, and leave it at that. You&#039;re shaking your fist at nothing actually worth your time. Best case scenario, you make a positive change in the course of future events, worst case scenario nothing happens, like you predict, and no book series comes out, or if one does it turns out bad and nobody reads it. That would hurt you in no way, barely affect anybody at all, while the best case scenario is a net positive. You&#039;re wasting time here creating enemies for no reason.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yet any idiot can publish anything on any topic they want</span><br>Yes, through vanity presses. I&#039;m not bothering with that. I would want any potential manuscript to be picked up by reputable academic presses. That would require a level of rigor and peer review from other scholars, and given the opportunity that&#039;s precisely what I would do. I would want to check with Hume experts on what I say about Hume, or Kant experts on what I say about Kant, and that&#039;s two examples of philosophers I actually know well. I would want to make use of living scholars&#039; criticism more in cases where I am less of an expert. Like I said I&#039;m a PhD student in philosophy, so I get to network about this sort of stuff down the line.", "time": 1673658290, "resto": 21520176}, {"no": 21522512, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:28:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522018</a><br>Godspeed, anon.

My biggest blindspot is medieval philosophy, but ideally I would want to discuss the Islamic, Jewish, and Catholic scholastic philosophers, plus stuff like Byzantine Orthodox philosophers (Gregory Palamas). I&#039;m aware that not a lot of attention is given to Mulla Sadra and post-Averroes Islamic philosophy, so I&#039;d want to have that included as well. Of Eastern philosophy, that&#039;s another major blindspot, but even if I stuck to Western, I would like to include the Kyoto School. One area that I think is a blindspot for most people, but I&#039;ve learned more about, is a bunch of 19th century philosophy that neither analytics nor continentals read much today. Along with the better known Fichte and Schelling, that includes other early post-Kantians like Maimon and Beck, and later ones like Herbart, Bolzano, Lotze, German positivists like Mach and Avenarius, the British Idealists, Royce, the Boston and California Personalists, Dilthey, neo-Kantians, etc. The next thing I really want to include is a very up-to-date and sufficiently in-depth history of analytic and continental philosophy that goes up to the 2020s. I have a lot of ideas about that stuff, and how to organize the thinkers and stuff like that. Copleston does the best job of anyone I know in really covering as much as he can but he doesn&#039;t extend past much past Wittgenstein and Sartre. There&#039;s been a lot of philosophy since that time. Anyway, obviously you&#039;d also get your classic well-known philosophers, but I would also like to bring attention to lesser known facts about them that I&#039;m familiar with, like Hobbes&#039; theory of mental space, or Hume&#039;s theories on geometry, the passions, propositions/logic, and how he was a proto-Kantian.", "time": 1673668452, "resto": 21520176}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21514227, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:27:10", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Is it going to be any good?", "filename": "D3375E50-6BB2-41DA-A944-1FE85B08096E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 342, "h": 500, "tn_w": 171, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673501230544832, "time": 1673501230, "md5": "3ZTbC3/imgMQ3of+BCBb7Q==", "fsize": 60279, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-it-going-to-be-any-good", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 41, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 34}, {"no": 21514232, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:28:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is it a sequel to American Psycho?", "time": 1673501339, "resto": 21514227}, {"no": 21514242, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:34:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514227</a><br>as relevant usb 1 in 2023", "time": 1673501664, "resto": 21514227}, {"no": 21514248, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:35:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514232</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBret Easton Ellis\u2019s masterful new novel is a story about the end of innocence, and the perilous passage from adolescence into adulthood, set in a vibrantly fictionalized Los Angeles in 1981 as a serial killer begins targeting teenagers throughout the city.\u201d</span><br>No, unless he\u2019s secretly the killer.

And all three haunt the work of T.S. Eliot, the greatest modernist writer in English, and the one who has inspired the thoughts contained in this book. To begin with Wagner is not to begin the story of modernism at the beginning. But it is to gain insight into the mission bequeathed by the Enlightenment to art. The operas of Wagner attempt to dignify the human being in something like the way that he might be dignified by an uncorrupted common culture. Acutely conscious of the death of God, Wagner proposed man as his own redeemer and art as the transfiguring rite of passage to a higher world. The suggestion was visionary, and its impact on modern culture so great that the shock waves are still overtaking us. Modern high culture is as much a set of footnotes to Wagner as Western philosophy is, in Whitehead\u2019s judgement, footnotes to Plato.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wagner was in conscious reaction against the sentimentality and lassitude of official art. Like Baudelaire (whose admiring letter to the composer after the Parisian performance of Tannhauser displays a self-conscious affinity) he saw that the ideal had fled from the world into the citadel of the imagination. Unlike Baudelaire, however, he believed that the ideal could be tempted back, so as to dwell among us (though at considerable public expense). He therefore tried to create a new musical public, one that would not merely see the point of the heroic ideal, but also adopt it.</span><br>t.
