The question posed by Marx is therefore completely different than that posed by classical or neoclassical economics; in principle, Adam Smith observes a single act of exchange and asks how the terms of exchange can be determined. Marx sees the individual exchange relation as part of a particular social totality\u2014a totality in which the reproduction of society is mediated by exchange\u2014and asks what this means for the labor expended by the whole society.

Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too, that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society\u2019s aggregate labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves. And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value of these products.

And the answer he comes up with, following a line of thought from Smith and Ricardo, is labour. Demand will fluctuate, and people will pay more for things at times of higher demand, but in the normal run of mass commodity production for profit, the scarcity of commodities* is determined by the amount of human labour required to produce them. If a machine is invented that allows you to make twice as many widgets in the same time, then assuming constant demand, the LTV says that prices will approximately halve.<br><br>Another useful thing about labour is that you can measure everything else by this yardstick. You can even measure the cost of reproducing labour in labour - i.e., you can work out that a worker who earns $X per week can command Y hours of the average wage at current labour productivity.

If in the assumed case the price were higher than the average market-value, the demand would be smaller. At a certain price, a commodity occupies just so much place on the market. This place remains the same in case of a price change only if the higher price is accompanied by a drop in the supply of the commodity, and a lower price by an increase of supply. And if the demand is so great that it does not contract when the price is regulated by the value of commodities produced under the least favourable conditions, then these determine the market-value. This is not possible unless demand is greater than usual, or if supply drops below the usual level. Finally, if the mass of the produced commodities exceeds the quantity disposed of at average market-values, the commodities produced under the most favourable conditions regulate the market-value. They may, for example, be sold exactly or approximately at their individual value, in which case the commodities produced under the least favourable conditions may not even realise their cost-price, while those produced under average conditions realise only a portion of the surplus-value contained in them. What has been said here of market-value applies to the price of production as soon as it takes the place of market-value. The price of production is regulated in each sphere, and likewise regulated by special circumstances. And this price of production is, in its turn, the centre around which the daily market-prices fluctuate and tend to equalise one another within definite periods. (See Ricardo on determining the price of production through those working under the least favourable conditions.)</span><br><br>Marx is absolutely 100% onboard with the existence of demand and its role in setting prices.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1675758875, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21626953, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:00:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>Old Yeller, Don Quixote and Lorca&#039;s collected poems", "time": 1675760409, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21626970, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>Jesus&#039; Son and The Largesse of the Sea Maiden,", "time": 1675760965, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627148, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:51:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Dido_and_Aeneas", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2396, "h": 1689, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1675767098979501, "time": 1675767098, "md5": "Mb7oM6NgMER2usPXIhAmSw==", "fsize": 1910905, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627182, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)06:07:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wept for days when the good guys lost to the Soviet Mongol hordes and the Amerifats", "filename": "55460C28-D524-4ACD-9521-D2891E7FD9A9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 296, "h": 500, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675768061225272, "time": 1675768061, "md5": "CKF9FXUB2ER7KrsdIhZhUg==", "fsize": 65662, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627338, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:13:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>i&#039;m aware this is normie tier but i fucking bawled throughout this book. japanese authors are chad enough to end their books on the most depressing tones without any of the soppy bittersweet endings western authors love to jerk off over", "filename": "nwmurakami", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 368, "h": 570, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772005133325, "time": 1675772005, "md5": "2AlbxlRJc9Bj6UpMtuG5sQ==", "fsize": 35754, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627345, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t usually cry outright but this one made my eyes a little teary", "filename": "lonesome dove", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 591, "h": 900, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772209225173, "time": 1675772209, "md5": "2ZQOS6ONBOLekjE+Ge1lGg==", "fsize": 136544, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627347, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:17:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21627338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21627338</a><br>Read Kokoro by Soseki.", "time": 1675772230, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627350, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Le_P\u00e8re_Goriot", "ext": ".png", "w": 330, "h": 545, "tn_w": 75, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772380930264, "time": 1675772380, "md5": "GbET7XGEn238jkVT+ntc0A==", "fsize": 188284, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627355, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626322</a><br>Yeah, I&#039;m not sure what qualifies as &quot;crying&quot; here.

The references and bibliography alone take up 144 pages. <br><br>Since I&#039;m just getting into philosophy and history, this book (alongside Mortimer J.

I feel so lucky to get to read about it. <br><br>My favorite part so far (I&#039;m just getting to the Scientific Revolution) has been about the revival of Stoicism in the early 17th century and how it countered the predominant view of Augustine&#039;s affirmations of Original Sin. I wonder if there is a parallel to the current rediscovery of Stoicism (i.e. Ryan Holliday) with the decline of organized religion. I get the sense that Stoicism, with its focus on practical self-control, is one of the more electrifying philosophies that appears when the theoretical, paralyzing philosophies become overwhelming or intolerable to people. The secular nihilism of today seems just as much a sedative as Original Sin; in both cases, it&#039;s like you&#039;re just waiting to die because either nothing you do in life matters, or because you&#039;re born so bad all you can do is spend your life repenting for a sliver of a chance to get into Heaven.<br><br>Anyway, it&#039;s a really good book so far and I would recommend to others (especially other Americans) who are interested in history. <br><br><a href=\"#p21619520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21619520</a><br>Nixon seems like one of the most secretly consequential presidents we&#039;ve had.

There is no indication from either the Hebrew scriptures or the New Testament that God&#039;s infinite nature entails that all offenses against him are also infinite. It generally seems to imply the opposite; for example, how exactly could Isaiah say that Israel had received &quot;double&quot; for all her sins when the debt incurred by any singular sin is infinite? If the proper response from God to any sin is to immediately inflict endless torture on the offender, why does Jesus tell us in the Gospels that the way to be like God is to forgive your enemies and be kind to the good and bad alike? If this theory of retribution were true, wouldn&#039;t he have said, &quot;And if a man slaps you on the cheek, immediately slap him back with the exact same amount of force?&quot;<br><br>Moreover, we must consider the concept of &quot;mens rea&quot;. Mens rea defines the level of intention, lucidity, and available knowledge that a person has, and which will influence the level of culpability that they are judged to have had in their offense. A sin of &quot;infinite malice&quot; must necessarily entail perfect knowledge of the offense and perfect knowledge of its infinite-ness. But of course, therein lies the rub: we are finite. And not only finite; we are created, contingent. A major point of St. Thomas&#039;s metaphysics, along with many other veritable theologians, is that God is ultimately unknowable in his very essence. &quot;We cannot know what God is,&quot; Aquinas famously states, &quot;only what he is not.&quot; This isn&#039;t limited to humans, either - even Lucifer does not actually know WHAT God is. This clearly implies that it is completely impossible for any created being to have the perfect knowledge necessary to be fully and infinitely culpable for an offense of this nature. The only being with full knowledge of God is God; but God, by his very nature, can&#039;t sin! Therefore on closer analysis it turns out to be metaphysically impossible to commit an infinite sin at all.<br><br>Another problem: God is not our peer in an ontological sense. When we judge human offenders, regardless of their status, we judge them as beings of the same finitude and existential type as us, as human beings. But God is transcendent. God is not one agent among many, who stands side by side with any of his own creations. He has ALL the power - impervious to harm or obstruction in any way by the creations whose existences are wholly dependent on him. There is nothing that any of us can do that would affect God in any way. A microbe can do more to us than we can do to God. If our sins have any effect, it must surely be on ourselves and not God.<br><br>I could keep going but unfortunately I&#039;m running out of characters.

You&#039;re right that the &quot;heresies&quot; were most likely the majority of early Christendom, but the big difference between them and the proto-orthodoxy (and why it&#039;s a false dichotomy) is that the &quot;heresies&quot; were internally diverse and not at all unified. When we compare one heresy to another, they could disagree about pretty much everything. This also applies to so-called &quot;Gnostic&quot; sects, a snapshot of their incompatibilities can be seen in the Nag Hammadi Library which offers no completely cohesive cosmology or other religious vision. <br>The proto-orthodox faction won because unlike the &quot;heretics,&quot; it was actually concerned with creating a unified Christianity, which involved shaving off a lot of the wilder interpretations which were active at the time. Proto-orthodox thinkers were concerned with determining an agreed-upon canon, ironing out the major theological differences, and in general bringing the churches into a state where they could cooperate and communicate clearly with each other.<br>As an example which also illustrates how the early heresies greatly influenced how the orthodoxy formed: Marcion of Sinope preached in Rome a gnostic claim that the Old Testament was the chronicle and work of an evil, spiteful creator deity, and as such should be thrown away entirely. The only scripture he valued was an edited version of the Gospel of Luke - many early Christians chose only one of the countless circulating gospels to treat as scripture. The church father Irenaeus likely encountered Marcion in Rome, which lead him to emphasize in his teachings that the Old and New Testaments were not only reconcilable, but part of the same continuing story, each equally important to the Christian message. He was also seemingly the first to assert the four currently-canonical Gospels as all equally canonical, again in opposition of Marcion&#039;s favouritism for Luke.<br><br><a href=\"#p21623145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21623145</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he does tend to repeat himself a lot in that context too</span><br>It&#039;s definitely his style, and I think it arises because his primary concern is to make his points clear to a general audience.

I can&#039;t write very well but this would&#039;ve been how I&#039;d have put it down for the first draft, though I&#039;d never have written it in first person. <br>As for your question, why is the protagonist saying that Steve isn&#039;t dead? <br>He should be pretending that he was killed by someone/something other than himself. Then, as he and Hanako travel around trying to survive, and the protagonist (not &quot;MC&quot;) has seemingly gotten what he wanted, Hanako can slowly come to realise that the protagonist has murdered Steve because<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;of the protagonist&#039;s guilt (if he&#039;s that way inclined)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the lengths the protagonist will go to get what he wants, now he&#039;s in charge of the group</span><br>Maybe Hanako notices the protagonist&#039;s inclination towards violence or that he can&#039;t deal with losing. I like the idea that after Steve&#039;s death they bond and travel around together for a while, but eventually meet and join up with another group. The protagonist is perhaps insecure around the young, athletic men in the new group who remind him of Steve, yet he has to reluctantly join them because his love for Hanako overpowers his selfish nature, whcih would be to keep her all to himself, even though it reduces their chances of survival. Then, when he feels the most threatened (he and Hanako have an arguement or something) he schemes once again to commit murder because he thinks *insert character* is going to steal her away from him. Hanako finds out and, realising his capacity for murder, puts it together, seeing that he&#039;s trying to kill to get her to himself, just like he did at the start.<br><br>And one thing I wanted to mention, &quot;Hanako&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot; aren&#039;t names which sound like they belong in the same setting.

Their effects may be similar in the sense that Buddhism effectively results in average Buddhists trying to avoid the mental suffering caused by living in the world with a psychic detachment, so that you aren&#039;t caught in a cycle of desiring escape or something. This is impossible, attachment causes suffering and desiring gives rise to attachment. For Buddhists, the desire to escape suffering can give rise to a lot of ignorant attempts to do so, because people mistake the concrete causes for suffering as their issue, whereas it is general psychic attachment to the world that perpetuates suffering. But stoicism actually just encourages you to shoulder the burden of suffering in order to fulfill your cosmic role in the world. I don&#039;t think Buddhism is necessarily concerned with your role in society etc., preoccupation with those things can create attachment.

My connections with friends and families were not at all satisfying and likely weren&#039;t dating all the way back to puberty. <br>The reason I was unhappy and unsuccessful is because I was always trying to cope with this state of deep unsatisfaction. You&#039;ll notice I say cope instead of change. I&#039;d liken it to a starving person constantly eating whatever horrific roadkill they might come across. You feel you need to do it, but it doesn&#039;t help, and it makes you sick, and then you do it again. It is both futile and compulsive. <br>Instead of squandering yourself this way a person who is alone should embrace that they are alone and firmly reject the constant yearning, conscious or otherwise, for other people. Only once you do this can you meaningfully change and improve yourself because you are now free of the ever distracting and futile sickness that has occupied you all this time.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible.

One, that the Asymmetry argument for antinatalism fails. And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what about those who genuinely do regret having being born? One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller. It is fortunately the case that we are not in a world where suffering is a metaphysical necessity.</span>", "filename": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Ric\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez de la Puente", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675760209237578, "time": 1675760209, "md5": "3B+bAGQUBJJDhjV+canOfQ==", "fsize": 25268, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626956, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:01:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br>Cognitive dissonance", "time": 1675760481, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626962, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626867</a><br>OMG SO TRUE DUDE LIFE IS SOOO SOOO HARD OMG SO SAD, ANYWAYS LETS GO BACK TO PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND FORGETTING ABOUT FUTURE GENERATIONS HAHA.

Thus to be sick unto death is to be unable to die, yet not as thought there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness is that even the last hope, death, is gone. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life. But when one learns to know the even more horrifying danger, one hopes for death.

Beneath the smooth, slick surface that is increasingly obviously a complete lie even to normal folks, there is something else that must be. It can only be evil and malicious, but what it is is the subject of so much debate and speculation. It&#039;s communists, marxists, liberals, jews, secret nazis, aliens, the NWO, the Illuminati, reptilians, capitalism, white privilege, the patriarchy, the cathedral. There&#039;s a legitimate percentage of literate people that believe the earth is flat. Nobody can really agree on what reality is anymore. The outer facade of American culture could be argued to be in many ways little more than a collection of snowballed psychological operations. Dick articulates for the reader the feeling of unease and anxiety that comes with living within such an artificial construction.

You see why the risk is minimized in the other method, the one starting from within, where the soul acts on itself with a \u201cgentle fire\u201d that accustoms it to detachment step-by-step, leading by degrees to the transformation from A (individuated state) to Z (non-individuated state), whereas in the other case decision and realization are instantaneous. We can also seek to actualize this gradual process, with \u201cdosings\u201d of the force, with a method that starts from the body, using different substances or using the same ones in a different way or a different quantity.

By keeping oneself there, intoxication is transformed into illumination, falling into rising, fire into light. If one does not succeed, consciousness quickly darkens, and a sort of dull syncope occurs which often has pathological repercussions on the organic functions; at any rate, a dismantling of what may be the person\u2019s internal unity and energy.

Bin Kabina was protesting passionately. I could see him gesticulating against the sky. I listened and, as I had expected, they were talking about money, the rights and wrongs of some ancient dispute about a few shillings which concerned none of them. I wondered if any other race was as avaricious as the Arabs, with such an intense love of money, and then I thought of bin Kabina giving away his only loin-cloth in Ramlat al Ghafa and wondered who, other than a Bedu, would have done that. It is characteristic of Bedu to do things by extremes, to be either wildly generous or unbelievably mean, very patient or almost hysterically excitable, to be incredibly brave or to panic for no apparent reason. Ascetic by nature, they derive satisfaction from the bare simplicity of their lives and scorn the amenities which others would judge essential. Although, on the rare occasions that offer, they eat enormously, I have never met a Bedu who was greedy. Continent for months on end, not one of them, even the most austere, would regard celibacy as a virtue. They want sons, and consider that women are provided by God for the satisfaction of men. Deliberately to refrain from using them would be not only unnatural but also ridiculous, and Bedu are very susceptible to ridicule. Yet an Arab will use his sister\u2019s name as his battle-cry, and Glubb has suggested that the medieval conception of chivalry came to </span><br>Europe from the Arabs at the time of the Crusades. Bedu set great score by human dignity, and most of them would prefer to watch a man die rather than see him humiliated. Always reserved in front of strangers and accustomed on formal occasions to sit for hours motionless and in silence, they are a garrulous, lighthearted race. But, at the instigation of religious zealots, they can become uncompromisingly puritanical, quick to frown on all amusement, regarding song and music as a sin and laughter as unseemly.

Moderation is key. Maybe platonism looks ascetic from the point of view of an epicurean society but it&#039;s not, it&#039;s a moderate view. The real ascetic position is cynicism. I&#039;ve read that Plato said Diogenes was Socrates gone mad and I think that&#039;s the way he would have look at anyone who overemphasised that misreading of Platonism. It&#039;s not that we need to mortify our bodies so the soul can go free, it&#039;s that we need to free it from false opinions that keep it oriented downwards looking at the shadows. The body is not what leaves the cave, it is the soul and what binds it is false opinions like &#039;pleasure is the only good&#039; that need to be broken through mental/spiritual inquiry/dialectic and purification. If you&#039;re mortifying the flesh but internally moaning to yourself about what a horrible thing it is to be alive and how you can&#039;t wait for death, that&#039;s a big error imo, possibly worse than the moderate hedonist who is at least tries to be virtuous, do good for others and try&#039;s to keep in mind the Good.", "filename": "Barry-Lyndon-3-1600x900-c-default", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675593907281642, "time": 1675593907, "md5": "4Pg5qTJQIOJ2CR/QRkEbfQ==", "fsize": 160545, "resto": 21614908}, {"no": 21617497, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:04:32", "name": "Strange Love", "com": "<a href=\"#p21616738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21616738</a><br><br>What is the basic principle of &quot;life&quot; I ask here.

To me her lyric poetry is the greatest of all. As for all kinds of poetry, the language of Shakespeare\u2019s plays is, to my mind, the greatest poetic language of all, and that makes Shakespeare the greatest poet. But Dickinson, even if some critics want to make us think she was greatly accomplished as a technical poet, is mostly at home with a single type of stanza and metrical pattern, and she doesn\u2019t care very much to break rules if the imagery and meaning of the poem would get diminished by following the constraints of the form. As for Shakespeare, he mostly used the sonnet and some fixed stanza forms for his longer poems (Venus and Adonis and Lucrece), and here and there used some different stanzas in the songs of the plays. But even Shakespeare seemed to be more interested in the sense and imagery than in experimentation with rhythms and more varied stanza forms. For him quatrains and variations of quatrains were good enough. His blank verse gradually became more relaxed and natural with time, and that means that it was starting to sound more and more like conversation and even prose, although his magnificent imagery never left him, and so he could write even plain prose and one would still feel he was presenting some of the greatest poetry of all time.<br><br>Now, when it comes down to technical skill and a constant willingness to challenge oneself and try to master several different forms of lyric poetry, I think Yeats it\u2019s the greatest of all poets in English. He\u2019s the poet whose work makes me think on things like The Art of Fugue. He uses all sorts of stanza forms and work hard to master all of them. His great poems are impeccable as verbal objects. I don\u2019t think he is a greater poet than Dickinson and Shakespeare, because poetry is more than form, but I think is just to call him the great master of fixed-form poetry in English, and even more so because he lived in an age where free-verse was becoming the dominant ruler of poetry writing.<br><br>1/2", "filename": "A292E4A7-3697-4917-9CB8-693DB6EABAC1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 739, "h": 415, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675685926684938, "time": 1675685926, "md5": "BjgoqaT7KdHAS96HE1Gg2w==", "fsize": 32890, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "who-do-you-consider-to-be-the-most-technically", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 54, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 29}, {"no": 21622650, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)07:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In the Portuguese tradition the greatest poet I know when it comes down to technical skill is Fernando Pessoa, because he had a great mastery of rhythm, was at home with free verse, metrical verse, with rhyme and blank verse, with poems ion English and in Portuguese, and also tried a variety of different stanzas and fixed forms, even managing to write sonnets with strict rhyme and metrical structure that sounded as if they were free-verse (and he did it because the fictional poet in whose name the sonnet was written, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, was mostly a free-verse-writinf poet).

I find her poetic subjects fascinating, but her form really gets in the way of my enjoyment. I intensely dislike ABCB rhyme schemes, which is her dominant scheme. <br>However, I agree mostly with your statements on Yeats. He is the true master of poetic forms, and that feat is compounded by his times, though I do where he falls short is his attempts at blank verse. Of course there is The Second Coming, but even this I don&#039;t find to be nearly as formally impressive as the greats of blank verse. However, in the Second Coming&#039;s defense, I believe it is the only of Yeats&#039;s published poems which was in blank verse, and what&#039;s interesting is that the first quatrain appears to have an attempt at rhyme: <br><br>Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br><br>But after this Yeats completely abandons rhyme for the rest of the poem. I think this is important to understand how this poem fits in with his poetics because Yeats is firmly the poet who rhymes when no one else will. Yet his decision not to use rhyme here appears to me almost like giving up in the face of some sublime, unapproachable subject. Surely some revelation is at hand; surely the Second Coming is at hand. <br><a href=\"#p21622703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21622703</a><br>You&#039;re not incorrect, but Yeats is a notable exception.

Swinburne even parodied his style in his later years (although I cannot find the exact quote I&#039;m thinking of). Anyway I would say Shakespare has the most impressive mastery of drama mixed with sound in english. Even beyond that his sonnets are sublime and use some extremely creative techniques to divulge as much information as possible in only 14 lines. Milton comes to mind as having extremely good sound and rhythm in his verse--especially the first two books of Paradise Lost--but fails in so many other regards it&#039;s hard to judge his poetry on that aspect alone.

This way, we can make a clear split into the supersensible substrate, that which produces the dialectic in the first place, and the unknown thing-in-itself. If we didn&#039;t posit the thing-in-itself, we would have to admit for perception the exact same logical structure as that of the antinomies, simultaneously.

It has long winded passages just describing nice countryside, but it still has the dragons and the goblins and wizards and battles and all of that shit. Just a great book. I loved LotR too, but in retrospect it just feels like Tolkiens dive into the mythos almost killed the fantasy genre. Everyone had to one up Tolkien and make an even more autistically realized fantasy world, but the cost of that is sucking out the whimsical bullshit that makes The Hobbit feel like a real adventure in mysterious, made up lands.

I find that The Lost Boy introduces the reader to the form and content of modernism. Like Faulkner&#039;s The Sound and the Fury, Wolfe&#039;s four-part novella embraces modernism&#039;s unease with omniscience and explores how any truth is composed of fragmentary and often competing points of view. Shifting away from The Lost Boy, in his book, In Of Time and the River, Wolfe wrote memorably about life in the mountains that perfectly captures his standing--recognized by Faulkner--as one of America&#039;s greatest writers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;... the immortal visage of the earth itself with the soaring and limitless undulations of its blue ranges, the great bulk of the autumn hills, immense and near ... the strange spirit of time and solitude that ... Eugene had felt and known in his childhood ... he had himself become its tongue and utterance ... he now saw it again as it must have seemed to the first men who ever saw it, with the eyes of discovery, love, and recognition. </span><br>Wolfe&#039;s historical and prophetic vision is of America, not of the South like Faulkner&#039;s, nor even of the mountains like James Fenimore Cooper&#039;s in which the Daniel Boone figure, Natty Bumppo, is the mountain character best known throughout the world. If one must, even so, call Wolfe a southern writer or include him among southern writers, then Wolfe is the only southern writer who forged a coherent vision of America, along with Whitman, not necessarily Dos Passos, but certainly Hart Crane, there in Brooklyn Heights, both blessed with the same windowview of iconic Brooklyn Bridge: &quot;the bridge that was a span, a cry, an ecstasy--that was America&quot; (Of Time 536).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, then, to every man his chance--to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity-to every man the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him--this, seeker, is the promise of America. ...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe we shall be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the catharsis of knowledge and conviction, is for me--and I think for all of us--not only our own hope, but America&#039;s everlasting, living dream.</span>", "time": 1675699590, "resto": 21623214}, {"no": 21623328, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)11:09:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21623300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21623300</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bonfire is a morally simplistic embarassment and a reminder why nobody tries to write like that anymore</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. butthurt retard whose existence Wolfe satirized in Bonfire </span><br>Sad.", "time": 1675699770, "resto": 21623214}, {"no": 21623329, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)11:09:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21623316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21623316</a><br>Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste.

He has helped me understand (I think) some things about Chinese politics but on a very general and surface level. One feature of Confucianism is an extreme level of seriousness in politics where you will &quot;lose&quot; face if you show excessive emotions, which is just not like American politics, and there&#039;s also the emphasis on a centralized (and, in theory, meritocratic) bureaucracy running the government, which makes a big deal out of infrastructure projects and social order. <br><br>The Party is kinda selective about it though, they apparently prefer the classic Confucianism (pre-Eastern Han age) rather than Neo-Confucianism. Confucianism is apparently against elitism and distrustful of the merchant class and exercises that opposition through an army of test-taking civil servants (today these are the CPC cadres who take a national civil servant exam) who are empowered to boss around the rich elites, but it&#039;s also against public or the politics of the &quot;mob,&quot; which makes it fairly autocratic by Western standards. The emperor today is the Party (or Xi but he&#039;s produced by the Party). Here are some civil servants:<br><br>https://youtu.be/hkvilRPqX9A<br><br>There&#039;s a focus on &quot;harmony,&quot; so you don&#039;t produce extreme far-right nor extreme far-left such that the central-left and central-right as the majority in the country will just constructively agree or disagree on most of the issues, at least in theory, or without forming into tribal camps. This is why trying to project Western far-left/far-right politics onto China doesn&#039;t work I think... like it is a fairly autocratic state by our standards but it&#039;s paradoxically a rather &quot;moderate&quot; one.

While the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is not an enemy, it has developed into a powerful competitor worthy of closer examination. If we (the US) are to follow the advice of PLA analysts, and do what they are doing, then we should be using peacetime to contemplate how their strategic thought is developed and implemented. Keeping a finger on the pulse of the PLA\u2019s thought process as it proceeds with confidence (and some degree of arrogance) into the second decade of the 21st century will allow the US to assess the probable direction (or uncover purposeful misdirection) inherent in PLA strategy. Accordingly, any required adjustments to US military strategy can be formulated. The analysis merely suggests a way of considering or thinking about PLA strategy and not necessarily the way.

China is basically a living fossil, a civilization from antiquity, but it is not safely locked in a museum. I have met Chinese people who think of themselves and their families as hundreds of years old, who know and care enough about what jobs their ancestors had in the middle ages to tell you about them. Every Chinese person to be sure, is not like this, but how many Westerners conceive of themselves, their families, or their countries as some sort of eternity? The dominant Western country, the United States, is almost entirely descended from people who elected to divorce from their homelands, cultures, communities, and so forth. An American and a Chinese person might as well not even be considered nationalities. An American is stateless (even the name of his country is plural) and a Chinese is the state. In other words, China has been breeding its people for thousands of years, while the average Western government emerges from some catastrophism or other of the last few hundred years. That is not to say China is without catastrophic traumas, but the result of these is always to reinforce China as an idea.

The man that you buy yams from isn&#039;t your brother, why shouldn&#039;t they be treated differently? This is called &quot;role ethics&quot;. A man&#039;s virtue is how well he can perform his roles (via study and practice), but his &quot;size&quot; is how well he can see down the network. A small man sees only those nodes that touch him, but a big man sees the nodes that touch the nodes that touch the nodes and so on. The Sage knows how to perform every role, and knows how even a slight plucking of the network will affect it.<br><br><a href=\"#p21621762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621762</a><br>China has a lot of schools of thought.

To put it simply, the ABSOLUTE left is that of absolute nihilism, subjectivity, egoism, and hedonism, and the ABSOLUTE right is that of a supernatural yet objective reality grounded by a higher principle, metaphysical truth, or higher power(s). An even more simple definition is simply this: Truth and relativity.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hierarchy.</span><br>One distinguishing feature of The Right is belief in an absolute power; power that does not radiate \u2018from below,\u2019 but which originates from above. This inevitably manifests itself as support for an absolute monarch (not beholden to the people), an objective hierarch that serves his own interests or that of the State (as a power greater than the simple desires of the people), or a form of theocracy (power from a god, God, or metaphysical Truth).<br>An argument against this might be that leftists have supported autocratic leaders in the past and continue, in some fashion or other, to support them. For example, Stalin was an indisputable leader of &quot;leftism&quot; yet an autocrat nonetheless. This discrepancy is fairly easy to explain; his power was justified not by a higher power (or by himself alone), but by his being a figurehead of the will of the proletariat. This is an emanation of power \u2018from below.&#039; His power was simply a representation of the base desires of the people, NOT that of a principle or of someone or something that is an OBJECTIVE HIERARCH.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truth</span><br>Another distinguishing feature of The Right is objectivity. The idea of reality, Truth, and Telos being OBJECTIVE in nature and not in any way relative to human beings. Leftism is diametrically opposed; there is not &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;reality&quot;, there is no &quot;fundamental purpose.&quot; A leftist MAY believe that there is an &quot;objective reality,&quot; but that this reality is ultimately indeterminable, unknown, uncertain, or even unimportant. In this regard, Protagoras sums up leftism: &quot;Man is the measure of all things.&quot;<br><br>Now for schizo-time: History is the proverbial Fall from the Garden of Eden. On the Right, Man governed by the most absolute of hierarchy, life at one with natural principles and truth and without &quot;philosophical mist&quot; over his eyes; everything is as it appears, and he lives out his telos with exactitude. On the Left, Man is purposeless, reality is in flux or unreal, truth is subjective, he cannot trust his own eyes. While it is unlikely for any specific movement to be &quot;purely&quot; right- or left-leaning, every political movement throughout history has had more or less of these qualities. The general trend is that of sprint towards the left, with minor &quot;re-adjustments&quot; back towards the Right.

Much like Communism. It eventually got so big that it overwhelmed society, because decent people had not paid enough attention to this cancer that was festering in the sewers of the Roman cities, and cynical power-hungry elites like Constantine even promoted it because it could be used to make the population easier to control.<br><br>Best place to read the Bible is sefaria.org because it makes it easy to access Jewish commentary on practically every verse.

But I was still viewing thing through a secular lens. I then encountered significant personal difficulties that made my call out to God for the first time since my childhood. I was faced with a situation where I could fall into the perils of secularism that I had already identified or cling onto God, the only Person who could deliver from what I was going through. Through His grace I was delivered and have been religious ever since. <br><br>In retrospect, God was sowing the seeds of my conversion to Him through my reading and the personal events were the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back. There has to be a movement of both the intellect and the heart to find God. Also, since then, God has helped me in ways that I couldn&#039;t even imagine.
