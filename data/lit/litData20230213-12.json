Now idividuality is not the highest good or priority in religion, that much is definetly true, but the divine is not an external concept to be submitted to, it&#039;s in aspects contained in humanity and therefore the self, and to cultivate that aspect is by the christian understanding the most virtuous thing to do, so it wouldn&#039;t be sumbission or destruction of the individual it would a refinment of the self.

I&#039;m not saying that this is the only right understanding of the matter, I&#039;m merely putting up a value judgement in opposition to your value judgement.

You impose the moral judgement of these actions through your framework, which is a perfectly fine thing to do, but it remains limited to the framework.

You possess an elevated state of consciousness that gives you the compacity for moral virtue, you don&#039;t have to live by them and most people fundamentally don&#039;t, or rarely they manifest these states. That is all. You&#039;re permitted to conduct yourself anyway you see fit in life but all actions equate to causality. From the food you eat, the way you act, the thoughts you think. The moral virtues you describe as sheep morality are the byproduct of your state of consciousness, and things like compassion, courage, humility manifest internally and aren&#039;t acted on. Trying to be compassionate isn&#039;t compassion, compassion happens effortlessly within you when again you exist in higher states of consciousness free from fear, anger, etc. Most people live in a perpetual state of lower consciousness which is a byproduct of many factors but ultimately leads to a less than optimal experience of life. It&#039;s fairly evident that the path of least resitance in life is these states; Anger, despair, fear, sadness, because most people perpetually live in them.(it&#039;s easier to be angry and afraid then it is to be free, this is the real slavery) These inturn bring rise to selfishness and internal states of chaos.

Virtuous states only manifest in you when you climb the ladder of consciousness and free yourself from yourself. If you have to denounce morals or god that&#039;s fine because by perceiving them through material lenses of abstraction thats exactly what they are. It&#039;s only when you perceive them purely that they exist purely. These philosophical roadblocks are the normal neurotic progression of your soul. You let go of god, you find God, you let go again, you find again. With a deeper insight, deeper appreciation, expanded awareness of what you thought was wrong now as right.

There is never any engagement between two holistic ideas with Nietzsche, he takes his thought as self-evident. Which consequently makes all further debates pointless. In a meta sense, even any objection to this is always already a proof of his being right. Any objection or reference to rationality or reason is always already pre-determined to be contaminated by will to power, ressentiment, slave morality and so forth. Of course his vulgar perspectivism is self-refuting but to point this out, to even think in this way, to think by a &quot;standard of truth&quot;, already proves will to power correct again you see, since what is truth but a disguise for will to power? *Whose* truth? This is why any argument with Nietzscheans always turns into cacaphony. Nietzsche unpacked is od course a sophmoric.l thinker as a whole but with a few interesting ideas.

I became more aware of what friends are supposed to be and why all of the friendships I&#039;ve ever had fell apart, despite me wanting my relationships with them to last forever and to love them without the thought of betrayal ever occuring to my mind. People are friends with you based on certain conditions. They become friends just like modern dating, systematically, by asking you the same questions NPCs do about yourself or they try to find something in common. Sure, that&#039;s not always the case and you can still find a certain level of deepness that you can share between yourselves. Even though you may have been together for a very long time, things always change and as such, conditions in your friendship change. The guy you&#039;ve been friends with for a long time changes so much that you start to not recognize him bit by bit and he starts alienating you, ignoring you and forget about you completely. What the fuck is the point of having friends when every single person on the planet is like this? No one actually cares for who you really are and what you think. Even when they care about who you are, it&#039;s either because they&#039;re a fan of you or they seek to gain something from you. They only think of you as a tool that can give them something of use. The only other name I could call a friendship would be a &#039;business relationship&#039; because that&#039;s what it is in the end. Only conditional. Loyalty is bullshit, the psychological support they give you is only in pretend or they don&#039;t want to, can&#039;t or don&#039;t know how to help you. I never wanted anything from my friends but just to feel loved forever. But everyone in this world is a douchebag who only loves what you offer, not who you are. I don&#039;t want to continue living on this planet if friendship between people is conditional. A slave is more loyal than a friend. I honestly am considering killing myself very soon.

Homosexuality is the desperate urge for the criminal to have his day in court, everything failing in him externalized into the expectation of an audience, perceived pity from the judge, or awe from the juror. For everyone in the court to see the lapsing in the criminal and find it\u2019s justification in the force of his \u2018argument\u2019. Heterosexuality is the criminal urge to defile one victim with no witnesses, to feel complete ownership over a victim that you have made your \u2018hidden own\u2019. Animals are all criminals, their initial kernel of worth allows them to externalize their lapsing onto their unworthy surroundings, and believe in the imposition foolhardily. I\u2019m more plant, sick person, the rigid and perpetually rooted oak, that greatly hangs about and let\u2019s the wind gently over hang his branches, creaking over the animals heads cryptically, letting the wind do his work. Plant life is more erotic. They effortlessly (gradual, slow) cast themselves out in front of the sun, ever reaching higher. <br>The most noble animal is the boar and listen to its internal grinding sounds https://youtu.be/c9pmqhK84BI<br>The sinking in, the whirling gurgling of the drain, like how the animals steals all that it possesses. It\u2019s correlate is the whirl pool, the visual metaphor of the sexual hormones. The sexual hormones literally carry the function of the whirl pool, the sinking in out of desperation to force action. Sinking in because it fully abandons respect of any creatures boundaries. Guttural sound of the drain, toilet flushing, the last sound before the pot breaks. The pot maker then re-moulds the liquefied clay into something new. Without Venus, the earth would cease to have its use. I\u2019m more plant, sick, internalizing, right now I\u2019m only typing this to distract myself from the sensation that my stomach has become a deflated bag due to erosion from the pressures of opioid constipation from abuse. When I breathe out my stomach feels like it\u2019s lost it\u2019s elasticity and doesn\u2019t return to its position. When I eat, the food goes no where, even after a big meal I don\u2019t feel warm and jolly, just the sensation of that bag floating. The connection between my head and my stomach has been severed. I don\u2019t feel the warm grounding pressure in the back of my head from correct breathing, only a strange sort of weightlessness, very unpleasant. This is awful and you could never handle this. You would break and strike your mother, snap at your sister who became your care giver on your sick bed. You would make an audible cry to all life around you, demanding for them to actualize yourself. Me? I can take it.

Saying what it&#039;s about would be a spoiler, or at least the narrative seems set up that way, which I find to be a risky idea, as it may require a lot of trust from the reader that the story is eventually going to go somewhere. There&#039;s a central idea that&#039;s explored, <s> the fermi paradox </s> but it&#039;s not evident that that&#039;s the idea until late in the book, so it may be inaccurate to say that&#039;s what the book is about. There&#039;s also a persistent aquatic motif which doesn&#039;t seem to tie into anything else in the book. It&#039;s something Reynolds seems to have done for aesthetic effect as far as I could tell.<br><br>The relationships among the crew of initially almost 150 on the space mining vessel is mostly what&#039;s focused on. Unfortunately, I have several complaints about Reynold&#039;s characters and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s one of his strengths. I didn&#039;t like any of them and the relationship that has the most time devoted to it is petty, overwrought, and unpleasant. There are quite a few named characters, though none of them really matter. I felt like the narrative was rather detached from the characters even though they were the focus, which was an odd feeling and may have just been me. Surprisingly for a Reynolds novel, identity issues were not a major part of the plot, though they&#039;re still present in other ways.<br><br>The story is divided three parts. I didn&#039;t like the first, the second was ok, and third was almost enjoyable, but not quite. I wouldn&#039;t have read through the first part if this wasn&#039;t something I read and discussed together. Those who don&#039;t like the first part, which is mostly arguing about whether they ought to be chasing a moon, may like the the second and third parts more, as they are about <s> trying to establish a sustainable society on a moon and then contact with alien species. </s> These are ideas that with other authors I have liked more, though there&#039;s often dissonance between what I think I&#039;d like and reading it in practice.<br><br>Overall, it&#039;s fine, even though this early standalone Reynolds features most of the problems I tend to have with him. The pacing is sluggish as it takes far too long before its premise is realized. I would&#039;ve preferred it be a few hundred pages shorter and there are various subplots that could&#039;ve been omitted. It does however provide for thoughtful consideration, fun speculation, and has generally interesting ideas, even though most of them are mostly in the background. This is the 10th book by Reynolds that I&#039;ve read, almost all of which I&#039;ve either read and discussed with others, or at least read at their behest. He&#039;s not an author that I would seek out. If I&#039;m asked to read more of him though, I will, because they are sufficiently worthwhile to read and discuss together.<br><br>Rating: 3/5", "filename": "pushing-ice", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1858, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676258987185557, "time": 1676258987, "md5": "OoDDEMetETFtc75VYFx+sw==", "fsize": 218058, "resto": 21647897, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21651697, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)22:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651671</a><br>Was it Zahn who wrote about the fucking space whale monks that can teleport?", "time": 1676259274, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651727, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)22:42:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish I could just press a button that would just instantly gas every Star Wars and Star Trek fan or creator in existence.", "time": 1676259749, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651833, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:10:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651727</a><br>I appreciate Trekkies paying the first mover cost for every other fandom in a lot of ways, even though the property itself is awful and kiked to the moon.<br><br>The only good thing to come out of Star Wars was Lucas Arts PC games.", "time": 1676261437, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651887, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:28:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wonderful.

While it is an issue, any amount of scripting won&#039;t cover the issues with your delivery. You waffle about without cutting your flubbed lines and your microphone quality is still not where it needs to be. Your mic is picking up an absurd amount of reverberation from your voice. This means that you are speaking too loudly in an untreated room with a microphone that does not handle background noise rejection. If you can&#039;t afford to throw $125 at acoustic foam then your next best option is to turn the gain down and move the microphone closer to your mouth. 6 inches away with the capsule and 15 degrees away from the front of your mouth to stop direct plosives.<br>As for your Vtuber avatar, upgrade or ditch it.

Deleuze quotes Henry Miller: &#039;To succeed in getting drunk, but on pure water&#039;. The most intense things are the subtlest, and to achieve them you need to be careful and alert. Every time I&#039;ve got better at writing, and felt like I was developing my aesthetic sense, it&#039;s been because I&#039;ve become better at discriminating and selecting, at figuring out which things &#039;work&#039; and which things are fluff or cliche or energy-dissipating.<br><br>Negativity is one of your most powerful aesthetic tools, because it&#039;s the instinct that pushes you to go beyond the mediocre cultural baggage that doesn&#039;t actually give you the ineffable &#039;thing&#039; you&#039;re looking for. Because that &#039;thing&#039; is ineffable, it&#039;s easier to say what it&#039;s not than to give a positive definition of what it is. Being negative and critical and discerning therefore helps you avoid those traps and dead-ends that take you further away from the &#039;thing&#039;.<br><br>Making unexpected connections is good, but you have to learn to sense which connections are the most intense and meaningful. You can&#039;t just blend everything together into a big abstract soup. If you mix together every colour of paint, you end up with grey.

This is something that happens directly to those who accept the truth. As Christ said, &quot;Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.&quot; (Luke 8:18)<br><br>In other words, someone who rejects the Gospel will be locked out of understanding the rest or recognizing God&#039;s word from falsehood. Meanwhile, someone who gladly receives the word of God will be given more, as it is God who gives us understanding in the first place. It also says that the sheep of the Shepherd know His voice, and will not follow the voice of a stranger (see John 10).

If there is disagreement in the world about what God&#039;s word is, it has to do with not everyone receiving this guidance. The only way to know for yourself is to be given this knowledge directly by God, as we can&#039;t rely on eachother.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How well it agrees with other accepted material?</span><br>This is also true, as anything short of infallibility wouldn&#039;t be absolute truth and thus not God&#039;s word.

Whether something is considered to be within canon or not, this doesn&#039;t matter if you don&#039;t actually believe it in the first place. Answering the first question without really believing, is more or less meaningless. If you do believe, then you will arrive to the same singular truth as other believers, since the Lord really is helping people to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br><br><a href=\"#p21651752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651752</a><br>2 Peter is written by Peter the apostle, That&#039;s what it says in the very first verse.", "time": 1676269869, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652178, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:36:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651741</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would think that the reference to it in the bible would be the predecessor claim of authenticity to any official claiming that it isn&#039;t authentic right?</span><br>Not really. Imagine that some historical event really happened, like Enoch preaching, and later it was written down in the Bible. There is sometimes a time lag between the event happening and it being recorded. Now imagine some third party source might also write some of these things down elsewhere. That doesn&#039;t mean the Bible is copied from it, it just means a non-inspired source also recorded some things that happened. And there are other instances of this where we learn about what someone preached that is written in a later book of the Bible. For instance, Matthew 27:9 tells us that Jeremiah once spoke the same prophecy that is found written in Zechariah 11:12-13. That is new information in the New Testament, as the Old Testament only has it written in Zechariah. Another good example of this just from the Old Testament is where Isaiah is inspired to write about events regarding the rebellion of Lucifer, in Isaiah chapter 14. And where Ezekiel does the same in Ezekiel 28. Obviously, this is God revealing new information via the prophets about events that happened long before them, which, if we are the believe the Bible, is true.<br><br>It&#039;s possible that people before these prophets had some awareness of these things in some cases - such as that of Jeremiah. Although they ultimately were recorded in the Bible where we find them today. So this would explain the fact Enoch&#039;s prophecy is found in Jude. The most straightforward explanation is that it really happened, and with that it wouldn&#039;t be a contradiction if any number of people recorded it or mentioned it in non-biblical accounts. There are also non-biblical accounts of Jesus&#039; life, although sometimes they contradict the New Testament, especially when it comes to things like the Gnostic writings which had their own agenda behind them.", "time": 1676270175, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652208, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:51:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651075</a><br>awo[eigo[iwjehjoi[weeiowqevrnoewrv[<wbr>oirvnoivnoiHJOIAWEFIFEWHOIEWFHJOIEW<wbr>FHIO I KILLED HIM.", "time": 1676271070, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652214, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There&#039;s a lot of good reasons Enoch 2-4 is not canon.

I&#039;m just insecure. <br>The earliest piece I remember writing was in kindergarten or first grade. I was 4 or 5. It was in response to a prompt that I don&#039;t remember. I think I described a white rabbit in blue clothing on skis in the snow. And I ended it with something along the lines of &quot;Just imagine! Wouldn&#039;t that be cute?&quot; I&#039;ve maintained some sort of a journal ever since I was seven. In the fourth grade I took to writing fiction about myself and my cousins and my elder sister going on adventures, saving friends from vegan giants (the only danger they posed was that they&#039;d keep you captive as &quot;pets&quot;), defeating Greek Gods, escaping boarding schools on blimps, etc.<br>I&#039;ve thrown most of those works out. Out of embarrassment. They were written as screenplays, not in prose, and the dialogue was incredibly children&#039;s film-ish. <br>I also wrote stories where most of the protagonists were self-inserts who served as insignificant observers (rarely movers) to the narrative. <br>A lot of these stories were illustrated, I remember. I&#039;d draw and write as I went, rarely going back to edit the plot. It was thrilling. I never showed anybody, not even the friends that I wrote about. I suppose my parents saw this stuff. Embarrassing.<br>Between the ages of 11 and 17 I also wrote and illustrated comics. I trashed most of the later work. <br>Between 14 and 18 I wrote a lot of poetry; from ugly adolescent whining in ninth grade to stupid, fun, sometimes vulgar little quatrains while in 12th grade. I have most of the quatrains saved to my phone. They&#039;d come to me in bursts of inspiration and I&#039;d write them in about less than a minute. Usually in iambic tetrameter. AABA-type stuff, but not always. I began and left incomplete two &quot;ballads,&quot; one meant to be a surreal narrative that was meant for children wanting to expand their vocabulary. I remember submitting two poems just for the hell of it to Poetry when I was in high school. One of these I think is still one of my favourite works. It was written after my grandfather died in 2021. I was rejected 8 months later, of course. <br>After my grandfather&#039;s death in the January of 2021 and I continued writing nonsensical poetry. The last two poems I wrote were written in December 2021 and September 2022 respectively. <br>In May 2021 I began keeping a private online notebook where I kept my entries short. I think this notebook&#039;s been my life for the past two years. In October 2021 I began growing restless. I wanted to write a screenplay of some sort. A long narrative. In December 2021 I finally decided that I wanted to write a novel. Playing with language appealed to me so much more. To me, art&#039;s always been a struggle against the flatness of the page. I began writing multiple short stories and &quot;humorous essays&quot; that really weren&#039;t very humorous, and regrettably deleted most of them.

There&#039;s three parts to making art. For everyone who wants to make art in whatever form it may be, listen carefully.<br><br>The first part is having an idea, a thought, an &#039;experience&#039;. If I asked you to describe what the color red looks like, how would you do it? You can&#039;t refer to other things like &quot;The color of a strawberry&quot; or &quot;A certain wavelength or light&quot;, I want you to describe the pure *experience* of the color red. If you had to explain it to a blind man and all. That first part is basically the intangible &#039;concept&#039; that our brain understands and generates. <br><br>The second part is the rules of the specific art you&#039;re trying to create. For novels and literature, it&#039;s all the relevant rules of grammar and all the other things that dictate what &#039;good language&#039; is. <br><br>The last part is actually *making* the art itself. You have to have that experience in your head, that no one is able to experience but you and that we have conceptualized into words, and use all of the rules to shape that intangible experience into something real that other people can use to get as close to experiencing your own experience as they can through your application of the rules of your chosen art.<br><br>Now you know all of this, I can actually make my point. In order for someone to actually make art, they need to master all three of those elements. When they do and by virtue of completing the third element, they&#039;ll have produced a piece of art. Now given how good you are at the individual elements, the piece of art will be better or worse. Here&#039;s the deal. Many people want to make a good piece of art, be it a painting or a novel, but they lack one of the parts. Many people hold the belief that if they can master and memorize the rules and simply applying the rules, that somehow a masterful work of art will come out of it. That&#039;s false. People go to college, read, analyze and do all sorts of things to master the rules, but don&#039;t actually either apply or have an idea they want to express. Because that&#039;s what art is. Like I have explained, art is the overarching term for having that intangible experience in your head to all the way of having someone else experience that same thing you had in your head.<br><br>Now, I quoted you at the beginning of this post. That&#039;s because you&#039;re one of those people who think that just knowing the rules will make you write a good piece of art. It won&#039;t. You can delve into books and think and analyze all you want, but if there&#039;s not an experience or thing you want to express, you&#039;ll never produce a good piece of art.<br><br>TL;DR: You don&#039;t want to write a good piece of art, you want to understand things. Don&#039;t write novels.

Meaning, you can internally assert what you want (which explains the &quot;I&#039;m bursting at the seams with stuff I want to say&quot;) and don&#039;t need something else to tell you what to feel. The problem is your extraversion. An INFP has introverted feeling and extraverted intuiting as their respective main and auxiliary function. Meaning, you&#039;re an introvert who knows what he wants, but your extraverted intuiting is making you &#039;insecure&#039;. You can see all the options of what people might feel and think and respond to what you might write down. that&#039;s why you&#039;re trying to make sure what you want to say (your Fi) will be received well (seeing that people might not receive it as you intend: Ne).<br><br>I haven&#039;t eaten for a while, so I don&#039;t have as much energy right now to give you an assertive answer, but I thought to give *any* answer to what you wrote me.

It\u2019s a highly decadent, secular, and particular (and not to mention utterly exhausted) view of art; one where the artist is reduced from the shaman that he is to a much narrower and yet now narcissistic archetypal role. The truth is there\u2019s nothing \u201cspecial\u201d about art, at least not in the individual sense that you expound. Art can be characterised simply as human creation, or rather participation, in beauty; and beauty is that which is conducive to aesthetic emotion, that emotion, as Joyce says, where the mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing; in this sublime moment we infinitesimally step out of the world of becoming.

Which means, states are no longer important in the incentive of tech, it&#039;s all done by capital and competition.<br>Society is fragmented, social groupss are quarelling over identity politics and other petty issues as Fukuyama&#039;s predictions of a world united under the banner of neoliberalism is collapsing, nations are disputing their local hegemonies again and the world is beginning to separate as it was during the cold war era.<br>So, we have an economic problem (the issues of resource management), a geopolitical problem (nations not willingly to collab towards a common global goal) and finally a cultural problem (all the division and social angst that modernity is accelerating)<br>It&#039;s all about a bunch of corporations struggling to see who will have more power over the human spirit, and the regular plebeians such as me and you are just assets for this struggle.<br><br>With this said, I just conclude saying that we do not belong to the stars. We belong here. I remember when William Shatner got a lift to the stars with Bezos and he, who played the most famous star-explorer of TV fiction said he went desperate as he looked at the emptiness of space, not even stars were seen through the hatch window, just the infinite blackness. He said that he only felt comfort when he looked back on Earth, and saw the comfort of our planet, that seemed so lonely and so majestic.

What he means by \u201cEros\u201d is never clear to begin with: sexual activity (in the Freudian genital sense), or an aesthetic-sexual mixture of art, sex play, and creative effort, or the whole domain of instinct (which returns us to the age-old problem of reason versus instinct), or else \u201ceverything oppressed by civilization.\u201d How does one conclude that revolution will occur through Eros and also will liberate it? Of course, the vibrant call for sexual liberty and uninhibited emotions would appeal to young people. But is it not plain that this licensed pan-sexuality, made out to be the highway to revolution, is among the most effective propaganda weapons (the kind that hits below the belt, as Hitler himself put it) and also the most demagogic form of deceit? To redeem spontaneity by that means is senseless regression in terms of revolution\u2014\u201cPost coitum animal triste\u201d: that is all we can expect of it, unless an iron fist clamps down on the rampant irrationality, the results of which we have already seen. We ought not to forget the vast irrational movement of our time which produced public festivals and mindless emotionalism on an incredible scale: National Socialism. The practice of \u201cclassifying,\u201d and thus dismissing, Nazism should stop, for it represents a real Freudian repression on the part of intellectuals who refuse to recognize what it was. Others lump together Nazism, dictatorship, massacres, concentration camps, racism, and Hitler\u2019s folly. That about covers the subject. Nazism was a great revolution: against the bureaucracy, against senility, in behalf of youth; against the entrenched hierarchies, against capitalism, against the petit-bourgeois mentality, against comfort and security, against the consumer society, against traditional morality; for the liberation of instinct, desire, passions, hatred of cops (yes, indeed!), the will to power, and the creation of a higher order of freedom. When I read the following: \u201cThe mob disclaims all responsibility, either for those who join it, or for what will happen tomorrow. Their actions and words are free of traditional restraints. They believe what they are doing and saying is simply the truth at the moment. ... I do not represent anyone; I think what I say voices the feelings of the students as a whole. ...

Any orientation of that nature will have the same results. That is why current invocations to irrationalism and to the mystique of revolution fill me with dread.

Also, not everything big tech is pushing is going to land because it will be expensive and not pleasant for the public (see the example of Google Glass, or how the Metaverse is not being a big deal outside techie circles and the predictable failure of Neuralink, actually everything Elon do is a scam). Economies that were promising are decelerating fast due a number of reasons (China is having minor growth, India is not a superpower as some predicted, Russia is thrown into a war, Brazil is almost in a civil war and Saudi Arabia reached peak production of oil and its promises of a &quot;Jeddah world trade center&quot; are halted for almost five years), economies that are well stablished are actually decreasing.<br>So, it&#039;s a great time to do some mischief to make the system bleed.

As far as I am aware, this very interesting book has only been translated into French and Italian. Several people very interested in J\u00fcnger&#039;s writing have consistently told me that this book offers great insight into his thinking, and since J\u00fcnger himself remains very popular here, I would like to make my translation available to read rather than simply handing it in to my tutor as part of my dissertation. <br><br>I&#039;ve noticed that J\u00fcnger and many other conservative revolutionaries have become more and more prominent in discussions here, and its been really impressive to see his works being republished by independent publishers long after they&#039;ve gone out of print. For any SpenglerBros reading, J\u00fcnger deals with Spengler&#039;s cyclical vision of history throughout the book. I&#039;m currently trundling on through the book at a decent pace, and using the German original text as my base whilst also consulting the other translations. It is quite a time consuming task, and hardly the most important thing I need to be getting on with, so finishing will take time!

To that end the thing must be made unconscious: that is the aim of every holy lie.\u2014The order of castes, the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an order of nature, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary fiat, no &quot;modern idea,&quot; can exert any influence. In every healthy society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and feeling of perfection. It is not Manu but nature that sets off in one class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only mediocrity\u2014the last-named represents the great majority, and the first two the select. The superior caste\u2014I call it the fewest\u2014has, as the most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can goodness escape being weakness. Pulchrum est paucorum hominum: goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees ugliness\u2014or indignation against the general aspect of things. Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. &quot;The world is perfect&quot;\u2014so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the instinct of the man who says yes to life. &quot;Imperfection, whatever is inferior to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala themselves are parts of this perfection.&quot; The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others.... cont.</span>", "time": 1676121077, "resto": 21643328}, {"no": 21644288, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21644285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644285</a><br><a href=\"#p21644255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644255</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Knowledge\u2014a form of asceticism.\u2014They are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them being the most cheerful and most amiable.

The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals, the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is rough in the business of ruling\u2014their followers, their right hand, their most apt disciples.\u2014In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing &quot;made up&quot;; whatever is to the contrary is made up\u2014by it nature is brought to shame.... The order of castes, the order of rank, simply formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution of higher types, and the highest types\u2014the inequality of rights is essential to the existence of any rights at all.\u2014A right is a privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre. Life is always harder as one mounts the heights\u2014the cold increases, responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture, science, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of occupational activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not society, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

The Prussian state for Spengler is his wishful thinking &#039;the state will allocate wages according to the given economic situation at the time&#039;. He blames Marx for strikes, and on worker demands for higher wages &#039;Marx wished to deprive capital of the right to private profit, but the only thing he could think of as a substitute was the worker\u2019s right to private profit&#039; but the question of wages, Marx does not care for higher wages for workers, because just as Spengler said, it would deprive capital of the right to private profit which would lead to the destruction of the employer.

I picked up programming in a few months, enough to do some fun stuff with it (tough I&#039;m still a beginner), but a true poet like Yeats took me ten years to absorb, and to this day there is much in him which I don&#039;t understand. This is because poetry is open to many interpretations and involves just too many things for there to be any clear route towards learning it, which is why Literature courses are a scam. There is no TAOCP for poetry, the best you&#039;ll get are rough guides by individual poets, like Horace&#039;s Ars Poetica or Pound&#039;s ABC of Reading, and the rest is left to your own individuality, or personality, assuming you have any and most people don&#039;t. You can do everything Pound recommends and you&#039;ll end up a Pound imitator, nothing else. Sooner or later you&#039;ll be entirely on your own, both as a reader and as an author, and then there is no clear learning route, only personaltiy, instinct and the help of accumulated knowledge. <br><br>Mathematics is just one specific type of thinking, based on logic. Once you now how to do it, it&#039;s just a matter of learning concepts and not skipping over prerequisites. <br>Theorem proving is harder, not because it&#039;s really hard, but because it demands too much time and concentration and exploration of possible solutions, including possible connections with other areas of math. Where it gets really hard is in higher, creative maths, which should be reserved to those who wish to be professional mathematicians, the Perelmans and Scholzes of the world. If you&#039;re not one of them, there&#039;s little point in it, because mediocrity has no point other than suicide.<br><br>Poetry demands *all* kinds of thinking, it can have rigorous logical reasoning and abstract structure, visual richness, emotional content, humor, and philosophy all at once. Think of Dante&#039;s sestinas or any passage from the Commedia.<br>Pure mathematics is beautiful in itself too, but its beauty is syntactical. Numbers don&#039;t mean anything, there&#039;s no real semantics, with few exceptions, such as when dealing with problems which inevitably lend themselves to practical applications and possible consequences for physics - yet even then the semantics is in our mind, the numbers are just its syntax. I think Mathematics is one of the great arts, but below poetry, music, painting, and others, because it doesn&#039;t excite the whole brain and body, only a part of it, even if it&#039;s one of the most noble parts - that of rigorous, clear thought.<br><br>Learning mathematics is like learning how to pilot a ship through the Atlantic: a precise procedure with a precise goal. Learning poetry is like learning how to love a woman: highly imprecise, improvisational, and you&#039;re never quite sure if you&#039;re doing it right or even if you ought to be doing it, but you&#039;ll know it when you get there.", "time": 1676251555, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651207, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651198</a><br>Hegel is literally one of the most influential philosophers of all time retard, he has changed the world in more ways than electrodynamics has.", "time": 1676251576, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651218, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:27:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;born 1770</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most influential</span><br>I think not.", "time": 1676251665, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651219, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:27:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651137</a><br>Electrodynamics is one of the most esthetic theories ever devised. <br><br><a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he has changed the world in more ways than electrodynamics has.</span><br>The bait was alright up to that point.", "time": 1676251670, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651221, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:28:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651206</a><br>imagine writing up this whole cope", "time": 1676251682, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651234, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:30:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br>hegel was only influential because he was a propagandist for prussia and his descendant marx became the basis of a state religion in a relatively short lived 20th century empire. they both are just ideologies pushed by now defunct states. waste of time.", "time": 1676251825, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651236, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:31:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651219</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The bait was alright up to that point.</span><br><br>It&#039;s not bait.

Every poet forms his own aesthetic judgement and judges his own poems accordingly. Good poets will have very strict judgements, so much so that a poet like Yeats was unable to write more than six lines of poetry a day - even though he was a very intensive worker and his prose amounts to thousands of pages.

For modern and contemporary poets, there is no uncontestable heavenly muse and no \u201ctribe\u201d that can be taken for granted like the bygone Epics. In The Tale of the Tribe: Ezra Pound and the Modern Verse Epic, Michael Andr\u00e9 Bernstein articulated this problem in his study of Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson: \u201cthe essential paradox of a modern verse epic,\u201d he says, is that \u201ca text that can be only the response of a particular individual writing from his own, partial and limited perspective [\u2026] must nonetheless give voice to historical forces transcending any single consciousness or moment\u201d (Bernstein 272). In Bending the Bow (where most of the Passages are contained), Robert Duncan writes<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the soul is the life-shape of the body, great stars, that are born and have their histories we read in the skies and will die, are souls. And this poetry, the ever forming of bodies in language in which breath moves, is a field of ensouling. Each line, intensely, a soul thing, a contribution; a locality of the living.</span><br>The passage illustrates Duncan&#039;s views on poetry and ethics. Duncan saw poetry and the body as interconnected, with the poem and the body both being sites of ethical responsibility during times of war. This responsibility goes beyond simple condemnation and instead involves a connection with the entire universe, which would bring all people together regardless of their political beliefs. This idea of interconnectedness is similar to the views of other poets, such as Charles Olson&#039;s proprioception and Louis Zukofsky&#039;s desire for totality. <br>Duncan disagrees with the idea that the universe is limited and fixed. Instead, he says in \u201cThe Multiversity, Passages 21,\u201d that it&#039;s made up of different parts that fit together but don&#039;t lock, meaning that what was previously closed can now be opened: \u201cThe part in its fitting does not lock but unlocks; what was closed is opened\u201d (iv). He believes that by going beyond what&#039;s expected, poetry can help heal people and bring love to those who are hurt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I have only the language of our commonness, alive with them as well as me, the speech of the audience in its refusal in which I would come into that confidence. The poem in which my heart beats speaks like to unlike, kind to unkind. The line of the poem itself confronts me where I must volunteer my love, and I saw, long before this war, wrath move in the music that troubles me. (iii) </span><br>In Duncan&#039;s poetry, the heart isn&#039;t just a figure of speech. He believes that by breaking out of the boundaries of the body through poetry, we can form a loving connection with all of humanity.

Euripides\u2019 Bacchae 457 has Pentheus describe Dionysus as \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, and also \u03bf\u03c5\u03ba \u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 [\u2026] \u2018\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (not ill-formed [\u2026] as unto women, 453-4).

Where other books that deal with socio-political issues have their character enact and realise the philosophy gradually throughout the course of the written work, Heinlein sees fit to introduce huge tracts of single character monologue instead. It is all objectively bad writing, even in Stranger where he has a blank canvas in the case of Michael he still has other characters, always his own self-insert,explain the philosophy in excrutating detail. If Heinlein had any skill in his craft, the reader would be gradually and subtly introduced to the theme via action and counter-action. <br><br>The Elric Saga, by Moorplots, is a better example of this.

Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or in utility of his own inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners\u2019 souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.

This also happened with several key Taoist texts, so some of the &quot;common&quot; translations are really fucking bad. The second is that these texts were only first translated into various vernacular languages during a period of Christian moral panic, so you end up with some translations intentionally censoring the texts to avoid topics that are found to be unbecoming (such as making Loki tie the goat&#039;s beard to his pants instead of his balls, or ignoring Freyja farting with shock). <br><br>But yes, you are right, it&#039;s not that big of a deal as long as you get a translation that doesn&#039;t censor and is made by an expert.

Other smaller sagas or works may reference this or that, but there&#039;s not much of &quot;Norse Mythology&quot; that you&#039;ll miss if you only read those two. Having said that, the entire body of Germanic literature is obviously involved if you&#039;re interested in the Germanic end of Indo-Europeanism, but if you&#039;re into that I&#039;d recommend skipping the Eddas and just going right to stuff like How to Kill a Dragon, because Indo-Europeanism is dominated by high-IQ genius polyglots who have read and synthesized everything already (Georges Dumezil read every single thing in Latin and Greek on Roman religion in order to write Archaic Roman Religion, for example).", "time": 1676125694, "resto": 21642664}, {"no": 21644637, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)09:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643968</a><br>Also, some translators abridge.

It is a story about the end of the world in which the world ends.&quot; In other words, Clute&#039;s answer to my question is nothing, there&#039;s nothing at the end of the road. Such a statement &quot;in which the world ends&quot; strikes me as too categorical for The Road or for McCarthy&#039;s work as a whole, of which The Road, presaged over and again from The Orchard Keeper onward, is both a logical continuation and a kind of termination. I believe, with Edwin T. Arnold, that McCarthy&#039;s work is grounded in moral choice. Clute&#039;s statement &quot;you remove the Christ figure and you are left with virtually nothing&quot; leaves little room for choice, but I think the novel, in its own contradictory way, does. How then do we go about examining the relative evidence for and against God in The Road? We look directly at the text, at what McCarthy intentionally did or did not write. What and where is the textual evidence working against God, what and where is the evidence working for God? And how do they stack up? In the novel&#039;s second fragment we can begin to accumulate the evidence against God. There is a simple description of the setting as &quot;Barren, silent, godless&quot; (4). A few pages later a single snowflake sifts down: &quot;He caught it in his hand and watched it expire there like the last host of Christendom&quot; (16). It&#039;s the boy who catches the snowflake but the narrator&#039;s simile is hardly of the boy&#039;s imagining. Sometimes McCarthy reverses the religious reference for negative effect as in this un-writing of Genesis by the man: &quot;The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. [. . .] The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality&quot; (88-9). Subtract the idiom and you subtract the referent - the un-reification of God.", "time": 1676108966, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643859, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)04:49:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643832</a><br>that&#039;s good too. hadn&#039;t thought of that", "time": 1676108967, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643868, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)04:55:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643858</a><br>Beyond the pervasive horror and starkness and gloom that never cease, probably the most unimpeachable godlessness comes in this descriptive prose poem: &quot;He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world.

And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover.&quot; If there&#039;s a god out there somewhere, he&#039;s not very evident. The narrator or the man - it&#039;s often hard to distinguish between them - laments this state of affairs as irremediable: &quot;Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it&quot; (130). Relendess, intestate, implacable, blind, crushing, hunted, trembling - is there a more ferocious description anywhere of our borrowed world?<br><br>If that hyper-McCarthy prose poem is the most negative ponderation on God, the most intriguing is surely the father and son&#039;s encounter with the old man who calls himself Ely. Their conversation treats survival, death and God, but it raises more questions than it answers. Ely, whether it&#039;s real or some perverse nom de guerre, is the only person in the novel endowed with any sort of proper name. Why? What - beyond urging the critics to hustle - is the significance of the name? Some of the criticism takes Ely to allude to Elijah, a connection I fail to see except on the most superficial level - the wise old biblical prophet, other than caricature or intentional reversal, he is not; even less is he Melville&#039;s Elijah from Chapter 19 of Moby Dick - and I don&#039;t understand any link beyond some weird possible version of Elijah&#039;s sharing of the Passover meal, a flimsy tie, for what it&#039;s worth, seen also by Phillip A. Snyder (81) in the context of hospitality. <br><br>Why not Ely itself? I mean E-L-Y, but pronounced Eel-ee (possibly derived from eels), the city on the River Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire, the cathedral of which is called the Ship of Fens, popularly believed to be built on Cromwell&#039;s Rock, on a meteorite that may have helped put the dinosaurs out of business (Ely Ghosts).", "time": 1676109337, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643876, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:00:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643868</a><br>Most readers tend to think that the unspecified catastrophe in the novel is man-made, but if so, why does McCarthy deliberately fail to say so, either in the novel or in subsequent interviews? What if it&#039;s God-made or a catastrophic accident? McCarthy remarked somewhat facetiously in an interview in the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I don&#039;t have an opinion. At the Santa Fe Institute I&#039;m with scientists of all disciplines, and some of them in geology said it looked like a meteor to them,&quot; as if they were privy to information beyond his ken. &quot;But it could be anything - volcanic activity or it could be a nuclear war. It&#039;s not really important&quot; (Jurgensen). The only critic I have read so far who wants to keep the question open is Jay Ellis, who does not decide between &quot;nuclear winter, or the calamitous climate change sped up by a comet strike&quot; (28). The interview, even given McCarthy&#039;s well known propensity for hermetic or enigmatic pronouncements, only strengthens the possibility that the catastrophe was not necessarily man-made.<br><br>If we accept McCarthy&#039;s ingenuousness or ingeniousness, we also have to accept the somewhat outrageous notion that the only proper name in the novel (other than Rock City, of which Ely could be a reiteration, in which case Ely would be the rock of the un-church) coincides, at least in the popular mind, with a great physical disaster, which did to the dinosaurs what the current disaster in the novel is doing to man. And then we must ask if it&#039;s also coincidental that this character Ely, the only one with a name, is the one to tell us: &quot;There is no God,&quot; an utterly un-Elijah-like judgment that he promptly reiterates: &quot;There is no God and we are his prophets&quot; (170) - And why does he look like<br> &quot;a starved and threadbare buddha&quot; (168) and talk like the prophet Mohammed? That sort of multi-religious palimpsest is clearly contrived, but to what end? Is McCarthy deriding &quot;diversity&quot;? Are we meant to believe Ely? Maybe he&#039;s just crazy, or maybe he&#039;s right and crazy, or maybe he&#039;s trying to tell us in his own crazy Nietzschean way that God is so utterly removed from us as to be dead, an idea Jay Ellis flirts with when he writes of: &quot;[. . .] the larger philosophy we keep<br> determining in these novels - including McCarthy&#039;s sense of god as a kind of absent parent no longer able, or willing, to do anything&quot; (35), a sense that echoes tangentially Leo Daugherty&#039;s Gnostic reading of Blood Meridian. The disaster may not be caused by man, but the episode with Ely can only reinforce any case against any God other than a totally absent one, no matter how eccentric or contrived Ely himself may be.", "time": 1676109653, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643891, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643876</a><br>Another of those prose poems occurs in a kind of flashback or memory: &quot;Out on the roads the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond&quot; (181). The passage sounds like certain descriptions from Suttree and something like the first chapter of Ecclesiastes. The key word, for my purposes, is &quot;unremarked,&quot; which seems to indicate a nonexistent or uncaring God. The passage echoes one from early in the novel: &quot;The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air&quot; (11). These passages point convincingly to nothingness and doubtless are among the major reasons the novel has been labeled nihilistic or godless. There is also a brief fragment that would seem to deny any after life: &quot;Do you think your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledgerbook? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground&quot; (196). This denial seems to issue straight from the man as does a subsequent passage of the same type: &quot;I think maybe they are watching, he said. They are watching for a thing that even death cannot undo and if they do not see it they will turn away from us and they will not come back&quot; (210). Who are &quot;they,&quot; we are forced to ask, ghosts, angels, archons, aeons, gods? There is no answer and all that is clear is the quandary itself, yet the very nature of the question, at once rhetorical and pointed, seems to signal some Eliot-like turning, however bleakly. Is it some spark - &quot;the thing that even death cannot<br> undo&quot; - that they must see in order not to turn away? <br><br>The textual case for God, or more specifically a Christlike figure in<br> the boy, difficult to imagine without some a priori God, however aloof, comprises more evidence than the negative case, and more convincingly. We can understand much of the material by stringing it together, almost without explication, beginning with this passage, which is the first we hear of the boy: &quot;He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke&quot; (5). Shortly after they emerge from the mountains, the father, having left their camp, observes: &quot;When he rose and turned to go back the tarp was lit from within where the boy had wakened. Sited there in the darkness the frail blue shape of it looked like the pitch of some last venture at the edge of the world. Something all but unaccountable. And so it was&quot; (48). Except for being unaccountable, this phenomenon - whatever it describes - is wholly unremarked in the narrative or in the criticism, but it foreshadows much of what follows. That foreshadowing, while easily slipping by unnoticed here, cannot be anything other than explicit and intentional.", "time": 1676110251, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643898, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643891</a><br>Some twenty pages later, as the father washes the roadrat&#039;s gore from his son&#039;s hair, comes the first direct inkling of the boy&#039;s role: &quot;All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you&#039;ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them&quot; (74). Messiah, of course, means anointed one and while this passage does not proclaim a messiah, it does plant a seed of implication, especially when on the next page we read that the man &quot;sat beside him and stroked his pale and tangled hair. Golden chalice, good to house a god&quot; (75). Someone - the father, the narrator, the reader, the critic - is making suggestions we cannot simply ignore. Then the boy himself begins to make pronouncements. First he says that nothing bad will happen to them, &quot;Because we&#039;re carrying the<br> fire&quot; (83), when there is no fire and they&#039;re about to sleep in a car with only suit coats piled on for warmth. This figurative fire will become a central motif for the boy&#039;s sacred nature, which the man will continue to assert, as when he asks Ely: &quot;What if I said he&#039;s a god?&quot; (172), a role<br> the boy will eventually take for himself. When the boy answers the man, saying that he is the one &quot;who has to worry about everything,&quot; saying, &quot;Yes I am. . .I am the one&quot; (259), he is echoing Jesus in a number of instances - I am the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6); I am the door of the sheep (John 10:7); I am the light of the world (John 8:12); I am the alpha and the omega (Revelation 1:8), to mention a few of the most obvious. Suffice it to say the proclamation &quot;I am&quot; is among the strongest phrases in the Old and New Testaments, the latter inevitably an echo of God&#039;s pronouncement to Moses: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). Not only does the boy offer to take responsibility, he offers to do so in unmistakably religious language, with none of the equivocation or contradiction so evident in Ely&#039;s negative discourse. The boy, born after the disaster, has been raised, we must assume, without church or scripture, and his scriptural echoes must therefore issue forth from narrative design or divine inspiration. There cannot be - not in a Cormac McCarthy novel -inadvertent echoes or unintentional allusions.", "time": 1676110497, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643914, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>Later the boy asks: &quot;Is it real? The fire?&quot; and the man answers: &quot;It&#039;s inside you. It was always there. I can see it&quot; (278-9). Is that the figurative fire of civilization? I think it means - textually, in this novel - less something vaguely Promethean than the literal belief in or presence of God or at the very least some entrapped divine spark of the Gnostics. My reading stems not from any innate desire to interpret the text that way. Rather it seems the weightier of two intentionally conflicting possible readings or discourses, set out as though the narrator himself were engaged in some mono-dialogical debate meant to be attended and adjudged by the reader. Alongside the fire motif runs a light motif - when there is in this darkest of worlds no source of light - that only reinforces the sacred nature of the boy: &quot;There was light all about him&quot; and &quot;when he moved the light moved with him&quot; (277). The man is compelled to comment: &quot;There is no prophet in the earth&#039;s long chronicle who&#039;s not honored here today&quot; (277), an inference, by the father at least, that the boy incarnates some second coming. Finally, there are two poignant words that I believe strengthen the textual case for God. The first is salitter: word used rather exclusively by Jacob Boehme (or commentary on him, as by Hegel), the Lutheran mystic clearly familiar to McCarthy, to judge nowhere beyond the two citations, one used as epigraph and the other reversed as subtitle, for Blood Meridian. Salitter - there could be a dissertation on this usage eventually, as well as a study on the meaning of fire and light as God and Christ in Jacob Boehm and Cormac McCarthy - means divine essence, the stuff of God (not unlike the Tao or Brahman, or in quantum physics the matrix of Max Planck): &quot;He walked out into the road and stood. The silence. The salitter drying from the earth&quot; (261). John Clute properly underlines the vital importance of this sole word, acknowledging God&#039;s presence but believing that &quot;the Christ figure must somehow be seen - be felt - to transcend the drying of the divine out of the earth.&quot; I agree, at least to the point that Clute has put his finger in the wound. The central question would seem to be precisely that: Does the Christ-like figure of the boy transcend - or reverse or compensate for - such an absence or withdrawal? It is reasonable to argue, as Clute does, that the answer is no. But what are we to make of this passage, giving us the second poignant word, just before the father dies: . .he [the man] would raise his weeping eyes and see him [the boy] standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle&quot; (273)?", "time": 1676111035, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643920, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:25:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>I got 1 paragraph through this wall of complete shite and couldn&#039;t go on. <br>TLDR please and thx desu.", "time": 1676111150, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643928, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643914</a><br>Tabernacle: In general terms, a place of worship.

Is the father delirious or divinatory: &quot;from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacled If the father is in some mortal delirium - there is nothing in the text to so indicate - then Clute is still in cogent territory. But regardless, why tabernacle, why the singularly most ecumenical term imaginable to express the essence of God? And what if the man is seeing into the future, or what if the boy does indeed glow? What if McCarthy is not making a reasonable or cogent argument?<br><br>The last thing the father says is: &quot;Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again&quot; (281). The father dies, the boy stays with him the emblematic three days and then as if on cue or as if preordained or as if popped from a machine, Parka-man &quot;hove into view&quot; (281). The critics who say that Parka-man is a deus ex machina are right, and that is precisely the point. His woman, who welcomes the boy, doesn&#039;t talk to him of civilization, she talks to him about God and tells him that &quot;the breath of God was his breath&quot; (286). If McCarthy didn&#039;t want us to read it the way I just have, why did he write it that way? Why say goodness will find the boy and have goodness find the boy? Why drag out a deliberate and undisguised deus ex machina - no one could seriously argue that McCarthy was unaware of the fact - if what you want to do is deny any sort of deus? And it&#039;s not just goodness that finds the boy but a new and this time caring mother, the mother that does not exist for that long list of road warriors we started with, the mother absent or defective in all those novels, every single one of them, including most especially this one, and not just goodness but warm caring affectionate understanding maternal goodness - quite the opposite of the mother who abandons the boy - the only such maternal goodness, all one short paragraph of it, in virtually all of McCarthy&#039;s work. If the message is meant to be nothing more than the withdrawal of whatever Gnostic substance there is out there, why have as the subject of the last paragraph of the plotted novel a mother who is not only all of the foregoing, but also a mother who understands how to explain the unexplainable without attempting to force any belief on the boy? What&#039;s at the end of The Road? What textually, with no need to adduce scientific opinion from the ironically named Santa Fe Institute? Stabat mater, not yet dolorosa. And that mother who is there, standing there, not yet grieving, means that the pistol-packing, fire-carrying boy, the light-bearing boy, the golden chalice and glowing tabernacle of an anointed boy who honors all the prophets and whom goodness has found is who and what we have. He and she - mother and child reunion - are the final image of the plotted novel.", "time": 1676111393, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643935, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643928</a><br>It&#039;s not just that the novel&#039;s &quot;literary passion defies the very emptiness that it proclaims,&quot; as John Cant has written (197).

The man who remembered the trout in the early mountain section of the novel is dead. Yet you, the reader, cannot help associating the trout here with those remembered trout. They are as iconic as Hemingway&#039;s trout, or more so, both early in the novel and intensely so now in this echoing epilogic vision of them, shared in the foreground between the complicit narrator and the willing reader and in the background with Hemingway and the dead father.<br><br>Native brook trout (technically a char, salvelinus fontinalis) are as perfect a species as exists in nature, yet they are delicate and susceptible to the effects of any kind of pollution.

On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.&quot; These miracle trout of becoming are at once real (the light wavy markings on the brook trout&#039;s dorsal area are called vermiculations) and intricately evolved, and they return us to once - what is now, from the current point of view of this narrator-after-the-fact, in illo tempore - to our as yet undestroyed world where the brookies still wimple and swim, while not releasing us from the recorded destruction in the novel: &quot;Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again.&quot; We are returned, briefly and ever so hypothetically, to the irreversibly fragile pristine mountain setting - a thing which could not be put back - of the sacred trout for the ultimate, possibly guilt-laden, possibly not, nostalgic and mystical pronouncement: &quot;In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery&quot; (286-87).", "time": 1676111991, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643952, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643946</a><br>In the deep mountain hollows and coves where the trout once lived, emblematic of the entire natural world, all of nature was older than man and all of it, everything, hummed with the essence of life.

A table is not a table because it has one flat plane and 3-4 legs as support, but it&#039;s daily day to day interaction with Dasein gives it its being. This knowledge is integrated automatically as background information and is not a conscious process. This is how objects take their being. Now, Heidegger also believed that poetic language can reveal aspects of Dasein that are usually hidden because it renders beings/objects in a different light for Dasein (I am using it as a noun but it isn&#039;t). Language is intrinsically tied with Dasein. Naming is the second step for Dasein to cognize objects as individual beings.<br><br>It is in the 2nd one that I see resemblance to Blood Meridian. The middle of the novel (nearly 200 pages) are almost exclusively landscape descriptions and natural imagery. But McCarthy&#039;s use of Similes and figurative language constantly casts &#039;known&#039; objects (usually features of geology with specific names) in almost alien, sometimes transcendent light. They become highly suggestive. This is possibly how language imbues symbols onto objects and is the basis of symbolism. But symbols in Blood meridian are unresolved. Images can imply any interpretation from any school of thought, even contradictory ones to the meaning of these scenes. This is what makes the task of interpreting the novel definitively, impossible. McCarthy&#039;s imagery is very vivid but also very associative and it seems to not observe a singular narrative line along which he might have wished to string his descriptions.<br>I would say that this may have been a function of poetic language than anything deliberate on McCarthy&#039;s part but for this one excerpt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their figures now quick with clarity and now fugitive in the strangeness of that same light. Like things whose very portent renders them ambiguous. Like things so charged with meaning that their forms are dimmed.</span><br>McCarthy clearly knows what his use of language is doing to the world/story he is describing. It is even acknowledged within the book by the narrator. The image of Judge and the fool travelling through the desert becomes suggestive, metaphorical such that readers will pay greater attention to the suggested symbols (King lear and his fool for one) than the literal objects themselves (the 7 foot albino judge and the shit-eating drooling fool). And in typical McCarthy fashion the suggested metaphor doesn&#039;t slot into any of the many interpretations of the novel.", "time": 1676224548, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21649589, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:58:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21649583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21649583</a><br>McCarthy&#039;s purpose here seems to show how language functions on the most fundamental level because finally all words are &quot;metaphors&quot; for their referrents.

But it is oblique, or should I say so obvious that most people never get it.<br><br>Additionally, I think Holden may also be a cheeky homage to Heidegger. He is also a master of language, a philosopher and speaks in the same convoluted but self aware way that Heidegger does in Being and Time. Both seem to be aware that some people will just label them sophists for the use of their kind of language. But what they are saying cannot be expressed in anyway else.

It is an exceptionally rich work. All his work is very rich and rigorous. McCarthy, like Melville, down the line might end up being seen as a philosopher or a visionary. But McCarthy might hold up better to rational/logic analysis because he seems to acknowledge the unreality of transcendence. <br><br>One thing I wished to add was that this figurative language, the suggestion in it, the suspense as you call it, might be McCarthy&#039;s way of implying presence of gnosis. The language constantly flirts with some revelation hidden in the reality of the world as it vividly describes the world. That it never comes might be seen as McCarthy&#039;s comment, but what to make of the epilogue then?<br><br>Buddha spent years meditating to achieve enlightenment, but what was the medium of such enlightenment? Language. All the great philosophers with great insights into the nature of being/world came to their final understanding when they finally had the words to express those insights. The permutation of words can deliver &quot;gnosis&quot;, if there is one to deliver. That&#039;s what Blood meridian seems to be trying, but mediated through the desert and the glanton gang and the Judge. It sounds ridiculous but the title is an homage to Jacob Boehme, who also has one epigraph at the beginning of the book, and Boehme started writing visionary books about art, creativity, philosophy etc. after witnessing the sun reflected off a pewter dish. The absurdity of the book&#039;s meditation is also an homage to the absurdity of Boehme&#039;s artistic inspiration. I wonder if the desert did the same to McCarthy as the sun did to Boehme.<br><br>It is an analytical book as much as it is an aesthetic novel.

I have read a few philosophers\u2019 works since then. I have engaged in a few discussions and debates about those works. Obviously my grasp of logic and language has improved. However, beyond a certain point I didn\u2019t find any special insight in philosophy. It seems to be a sophisticated hobby. I would rather have a conversation with people about the same philosophical ideas than endlessly read one philosophical work after another if my goal is to engage in sharp back-and-forth arguments. I would rather sing a song or listen to a song if stress relief is my goal. I would rather play ball with my friends or go to the gym for stress relief as well. I would rather read historical documents, biographies, legal documents and the like if my goal is to gather specific information. I can say the same about major works of literature like TBK, Anna Karenina, etc.<br>What I have understood is that I\u2019m not a reader. I will be giving away 33 books that I purchased the last few years to a local bookstore. I\u2019ve read about 60% of them and I know I don\u2019t have the patience to read the rest.

This is not to say you should never read obviously. Neither is this to say that reading is for nerds and morons who don\u2019t live a life blah blah blah.
