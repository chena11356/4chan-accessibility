Bureaucracy, ideology, and leaders are constantly in a flux to gain and maintain power. But messiahs and idols are the most productive and dangerous force capable of wielding power.<br><br>Bureaucracies are slow and inefficient, but methodical and capable of escaping accountability. They are constantly competing with other organizations. Vying for resources and influence. Despite their shortcomings, they are sturdy and very hard to kill. JFK threatened to destroy the CIA, and look where that got him. Their ability to escape accountability is what makes them so formidable. They are institutions that never sleep and every person and part within it&#039;s structure is replaceable. (In the first book of Dune this is exemplified in The Emperor being able to destroy a leading Landsraad house. Liet-Kynes (Herbert&#039;s self insert character), the Judge of the Change knows that resisting the coverup is futile). <br><br>Ideologies with the greatest effect are the ones that appeal to the sensibilities of dreamers, realists, intellectuals, and sheeple. They are not like a bureaucracy or leader. Bureaucracies have quarterly reports, budget restraints, minions to pay. Leaders expire/retire/sellout. However, ideologies are in a sense eternal. They are merely ideas. They promise an ideal of the future. Trying to appeal to so many people makes it hard to accurately map to reality. They can be preserved in a book, innovated on, and spread across populations through word of mouth. But without a thought leader, can become ensconced in dogma and preyed upon by opportunists. (Superstition and Dogma are the Bene Gesserit bread and butter for leveraging power amongst the unassuming masses. All one needs to do is appeal to their expectations to leverage power).

Their influence drives people to action more than any other factor. They are the focal point of written history. Whether it be through fear, money, influence, vision, innovation ect. The leader that can make and use these tools faster and more efficiently than his opponents will win. (Baron Vladimir Harkonen was the king of power manipulation as a leader. Able to leverage fear, money and violence to reach his goals. Innovating the use of artillery to nullify Atreides shields. Exploiting human weaknesses like Dr. Yueh. ect.)<br><br>And finally, you have the Messiahs. The idols. God King Emperors. The Caesar Augustus and Jesus Christ types. The one&#039;s who fundamentally change the world and humanity for thousands of years. The promise of one of these types emerging is profound and intoxicating. If one could synthesize what makes them so successful beyond simple observations of charisma, then they wouldn&#039;t be so special. The 1940s was one of those times where the world stood on the precipice of having one of these figures. Frank Herbert even likens Paul to mustache man. The point is that 200 years under the despotism of a bureaucrat, ideological zealot or robber baron is inconsequential to the suffering a Genghis Khan can inflict.", "time": 1673916881, "resto": 21535678}, {"no": 21535702, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)20:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What the fuck is this juvenile pseudy word salad trash you&#039;ve sharted out?<br><br>Scifi faggots are so annoying", "time": 1673917323, "resto": 21535678}, {"no": 21535718, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)20:08:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21535702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21535702</a><br>Don\u2019t listen to this guy, OP.

Honestly, I would venture to say &quot;No&quot;, insofar as we are concerned with the same type of love that men experience. It doesn&#039;t help that the constant blackpilling against women is extremely convincing and built on reasonable and rational, as well as historical grounds. When we look at the views of women from history, we can&#039;t help but see the same complaints about women then as we raise now. Women seem to be extremely superficial to a degree that is almost comical, yet we cannot ignore the simultaneous evidence that it is possible for women to experience &quot;idealistic&quot; love. Unless the men of antiquity were deluding themselves with massive copes, we can look to accounts of love such as that of Odysseus and Penelope, a woman that waited two decades for her husband faithfully, Romeo and Juliet, Aeneas and Dido, and so on. Even the Bible raises the possibility that virtuous women really do exist and really are capable of both enlightenment and love.<br>I would have to say that the reason for women&#039;s depravity today is a result of the depravity of the times. Feminists complain that women are being oppressed, and while they may be entirely wrong about the reasons, women indeed are being greatly oppressed by society. There has never been a point in history more tragically abusive towards women; and all of the areas in which a woman is led to believe she may alleviate these abuses are carefully constructed only to further that same abuse.<br>I believe women are cynical, jaded, and misled by society into living hedonistic and unfulfilling lives. They mistrust men, and indeed, abortion, birth control, fornication, and divorce increase the capabilities of men to serially exploit women. Women are, just as men, in a position where the only winning move is not to play. Their horrible decision making, shallow and dangerous short-term relationships, and other superficial behaviors may just be the optimal strategy for attaining some semblance of intimacy in a society that is designed from the ground up to put the malicious and evil at an advantage.<br><br>Or women could be shallow and entirely incapable of love.

I am still an incel sympathizer. <br><br>Let me tell you why. <br><br>It\u2019s because EVEN SHE CARED ABOUT APPEARANCE, ultimately, even though we initially bonded over having very similar personalities and intellects. <br><br>We spent around 15 hours together so far, visiting art galleries and museums, the cinema, the opera, cafes, or just straying around the city. We complimented each other often. But I never complimented her appearance. Never. She is hot. I know she knows she is hot. I know she knows I know she is hot. <br><br>I purposefully never mentioned the obvious fact I and most other men want to pump her full of semen, I skipped this self-explanatory banality. I focused my attention and compliments on her personality, thoughts and dreams completely.<br><br>She did not. She constantly complimented my appearance in ways both subtle and admiring. Try to guess how often she complimented my height (I am around 6\u20192\u2019\u2019, which is considered ideal female preference by most lookism / blackpill content)? Once? Twice? <br><br>Yeah. Five times. Five separate times, she repeated it like some sort of mantra: \u201canon, did I tell you you are tall yet\u201d? Another time, she mentioned my thick hair in a positive fashion. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want YOU to care. I don\u2019t want it to matter. <br><br>So even this genuinely very smart (her IQ was professionally tested and is above 120), very educated, very classy, very nuanced woman, the least superficial I have ever met, STILL cared a great lot about how long my fucking leg bones were and whether I was prematurely balding. And if I did, there\u2019s a chance we never would have bonded, even though we are soulmates. <br><br>If anything, this experience blackpilled me even more. Even the smartest young woman still is prey to her biological instincts. <br><br>Pic related is still me. <br>Even though a genuinely wonderful woman took enormous interest in me, I am still a Chud (no, not the /pol/ kind - I could not care less about identity politics). <br>I will always remain a Chud. <br>Even if I have sex with this extremely desirable woman. Or another woman who approaches me herself. <br>Even if we become a long-term couple. <br><br>I will mentally always sympathize with incels: even though I disagree with their misogyny, they remain mostly about how attraction is formed and how men are discriminated against due to their genetics. <br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.", "filename": "45DC9740-B990-4FAA-9051-7711524CB838", "ext": ".png", "w": 640, "h": 734, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673971475805766, "time": 1673971475, "md5": "i1xwm4RTtFzj1xE1ndQdOA==", "fsize": 11418, "resto": 21537113}, {"no": 21538143, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:08:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21538131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538131</a><br>what?", "time": 1673971739, "resto": 21537113}, {"no": 21538146, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:10:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i lived in china for 5 years AMA because im home all day today", "time": 1673971827, "resto": 21537113}, {"no": 21538175, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:23:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537113</a><br>We&#039;ve had a good time together, we laughed, we had interesting conversations, I shared things about my childhood and you did too, yet you never text me and when you do you leave the conversation in the air, you can&#039;t ask me out, putting the responsability in me when I&#039;m not certain that you even want to hangout. <br>You&#039;re a mirror of the things I dislike the most about me but also the few things I can appreciate, I still want to get to know you more, am I a narcisist or just a hopeful romantic? <br>I hate this captcha.", "time": 1673972600, "resto": 21537113}, {"no": 21538184, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:28:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21538131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538131</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

Despite neeting around for a couple of years now, I wasn&#039;t gaming much outside of the occasional castlevania stage and playing picross in waiting rooms, but after introducing one of my younger cousins to crash bandicoot 2, I had the incentive to try out the first crash on the psx since I never had it as a kid. While it&#039;s only moderately challenging for a 3D platformer, it made me realize just how braindead I had become due to all the accumulated neglect. All of my deaths in the game were not related to a lack of pinpoint accuracy or glitches or in-game engine tricks, but they&#039;re all traced back to either a lapse of attention or worrisome forgetfulness. So many times have I died because I kept forgetting to correct a glaring mistake that I had already identified over and over again ; Or I had lost all my progress due to panicking, subsequently becoming unable to grasp the flow of the game again ; Or I missed an obvious detail of the stage because my mind had wandered off into other pastures for some reason. This has me very worried about my constant absence of mind and inability to absorb information from my surrounding, and makes me question just how saturated and/or my mind has come to be. These types of situations can all be abstractly linked to high stress decision making positions in hypothetical jobs, so it&#039;s not just concerned with your ability to play a game, but with your ability to make crucial decision in the nick of time.<br>So I wonder if there is a sturdy way to regain vitality and lucidity in your brain.

This is essentially the same question applied to a non-material thing (logic). Some (nominalists) will argue that the laws of logic will cease to exist, as they are constructed/contained in the mind.

If something seems right to someone, he believes it. I do not believe there is a &quot;great truth&quot; waiting to be discovered by man, that one &quot;true&quot; philosophy will eventually reach. I believe there is the world &quot;as it is&quot;, and people talking about it - having their own ideas, theories, analyses about it. Particularly smart people make particularly elaborate ideas, theories and analyses about the world - philosophies. But these, man-made, philosophies, objective as they seem, are in the end no less subjective than a child licking honey and saying &quot;I like this, it tastes good&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, which one or ones are not?</span><br>One rather objective topic is simply &quot;existence&quot;. There is something. Man came about and put this something into categories, so that he can mentally interact with that something, but these categories are subjective ideas that do not actually correlate to the something that exists. Matter arranged in the form of a chair is not actually a chair, since &quot;chair&quot; is a man-made, subjective, idea that we use to talk about the matter arranged in the form of a chair. But there is something that exists. The chair-arranged matter is objectively existing, but it is subjective that it is supposed to be a chair.<br>From here on, it is hard to pin down topics as objective. I think it is easier to find topics that are &quot;objective within given parameters&quot;. Measurement of temperature, for example, is &quot;objective given the parameters of temperature measurement&quot;. If we agree upon the concept of Celsius, and measure the room to be 20\u00b0C, that is the objective temperature of the room (even though the concept of Celsius is a subjective man-made idea).<br>If a ball crosses a goal line, it is &quot;objectively a goal given the subjective-but-agreed-upon parameters of the rules of football&quot;. But objectively it is not a goal because objectively there is no such thing as a goal, only &quot;something&quot; that someone calls a goal.<br>Science gives the idea of getting close to an objective description of the world, but only insofar that we divorce ourselves from the idea that the words used by a scientists are anything but usefull tools that make it easier for us to describe the &quot;something&quot; that exists. &quot;Man evolved from ape.&quot; is just a shorthand for &quot;something ape-shaped did something to rearrange into something man-shaped&quot; - and that still is just a very brief shorthand.", "time": 1673867092, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533085, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:15:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21533048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533048</a><br>You could have simply written, \u201cI\u2019m a nominalist.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that deep.", "time": 1673867755, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533331, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)08:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531623</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only BASEDENCE is worth thinking pursuing!!!</span><br>You deserve to be ridiculed", "time": 1673874908, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533705, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)10:35:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529241</a><br>Mounier argued that Camus was describing the quintessential Catholic experience of Man&#039;s faith, including in his rejection of God.", "time": 1673883322, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533740, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)10:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529188</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ow do I contradict this man</span><br>You don&#039;t, you agree with him because he provided the proper view of the Absurd and the tools to defeat it.

Ways I&#039;ve started to change a narcissists mind is explaining soul overlap and how we are a little bit overlaped in the spiritual realm, (this is how love kinda works), since they recognize the other sentience this way they become (a little) more considerate.

She leaves her house with a freshly written letter in a sealed envelope. She gets in her car, drives down, stands in line, buys some stamps and then mails the letter. If you wanted external conflict you could have any number of issues appear, but they&#039;re not necessary. If you want more of internal conflict, or offscreen conflict, you could have the contents of the letter weighing on her mind and she&#039;s debating whether or not she should even send the letter out. But none of that is necessary. Maybe she&#039;s sending out a bunch of letters, invitations, to celebrate some happy occasion.

You fight for your own logic can be the absolute same. They can be trying to compete for the same thing such as a woman, sword, last box of gloves at a store. This doesn&#039;t confer moral rightness if both are equal in mentality. It can be in a morally grey way or a morally white way.

Any commentary is fine. <br><br>Main Character:<br><br>Solitary smuggler and mercenary. Wears cutting edge alien biotech armored suit. Driven by desire to do his duty in the form of jobs he takes based on risk/reward. Lives entirely off oddjobs and cultivating a reputation deliberately. Reserved, contemplative, tactical. Thinks a lot and his suit joins him in on that. Backstory and apperance beyond being a HUman who is old/young enough to be doing this is completely unneeded. He does not talk about his past before he got the suit, if so rarely. <br><br>Sidekick Character: <br>Tapped into main characters spine, they have no privacy between eachother. Gendered female because...well. It just makes sense. Fiery, stubborn, and petty. Keeps our protagonist alive in more ways that one. The suit is a life support system and our protagonist ain&#039;t doing good in that department. Sadomaschoistic. Comes with being a weapon of war and being battered by it. Intended as the foil character. <br><br>Initial Story Objective:<br>Transport flash frozen corpses to be eaten by carrion birds on another planet as an alien culture of migrant workers on a planet need this done to have their dead pass onto the afterlife. They are offering a large bounty to do this and supply of quality rations. Inspired by the issues contemporary Zorasterians have in India. They have no vultures to eat their dead due to pesticides killing them. <br><br>Initial Story Conflict:<br>Space pirates jumped our protagonist while travelling to gain the corpses to be eaten by decadent alien crimelords, as a novelty. He must outwit them and get the cargo to the migrant worker homeplanet so the birds can eat the dead correctly then return said bones. <br><br>Initial Setting:<br>Space opera, adventure. Pulpy, different galaxy uses whatever science isn&#039;t annoying to the story but isn&#039;t completely unbelievable. Humans arrived via space anaomly and made a colony. Considered a secondary power. Cold war between larger hegemonic species. Some slug snakes and toad wasps. <br><br>Initial Scene: <br>Debating whether to begin in an argument between the suit and its pilot or a very humble business meeting arranged the deal with said migrant worker aliens.", "time": 1673893174, "resto": 21530805}, {"no": 21534245, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:20:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21534177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21534177</a><br>I will add onto this. <br><br>Big cans is smart.

The digital age fatigues us here. Why can&#039;t it be real combat? How do these games work. How much luck, it sounds like this all skill pro-gaming but pro-gaming is pretty bad in some ways. These games they use for TRIAL aren&#039;t going to be fun. They&#039;re going to be truncated and arranged perfectly for a balanced test of skills and wits.

A lot harder. Abstract games without chance are the simplest and strongest form that allows skill ceiling. This is why Chess ain&#039;t going away. It&#039;s a game with an easy ability to work itself up despite being solved at the highest levels. <br><br>Now let&#039;s go with video games. Okay. They have a lot more fiddly bits and issues.

Less is more for a reason. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9<wbr>LJ-oMosg<br>Pro C&amp;C Generals Zero Hour. <br><br>The USA Air Force is favored massively because the meta for the USA is to use Humvees with fully loaded missile launcher guys in them with their upgrades which outclass tanks in damage. Air Force doesn&#039;t get tanks. They get better versions of the Chinook which transports guys and collects resources (and can combat shoot), attack helicopters who can get stealth which prevents them from dying as quick, and the best jet in the game. Also amazing support powers which can&#039;t be beat and they detect stealth from air. <br><br>The GLA Demolitions is not favored. They can plant bombs and blow things up more. They lose access to residual toxin damage, vehicles cost more, and lack the ability to be as stealthy. They are a downgrade to their base faction. The way they win is simply by microing explosives units way better. More damage by a lot, but they lack many things. The GLA&#039;s meta spam is using AA bearing Quad Cannons that can kill anything in enough number for good cost ratio. They also destroy aircraft which is the GLA hard counter and prevent infantry spam better than anthrax does. <br><br>Watch it and think on this, if you&#039;re going to write simulation combat.

More boys than soldiers, most of them - younger than his own sons. <br>The others were all huddled around their campfires, some staring blankly into the fires, entranced by its dance to the beat of the crackling wood. Van stared at his own. He had watched far too many flames dance over the years - they ceased to speak to him long ago, all they did was just remind him of the hearth in his home where he would be with his wife and sons, watching instead - his granddaughter struggle to walk, while sipping on some sweet pumpkin stew. Damn the glory and honour of a soldier\u2019s life, he thought, as he held his hands nearer to the fire, feeling the pulses of heat lash at his palm and fingers. His ears ached against the frost.

Despite having seen him the most over the years, Van knew him the least. The campfires had a way of making men talkative, at least the ones not yet awakened to the meaninglessness of sentiments against the abyss, and Roskil was always the quietest one around the fires. Van had known likes of him before this company, men who had faced the abyss one too many times. Van had once respected their bravery in continuing to pick up their swords until one day he came to pity them once he realised that it was never bravery, but numbness. <br>\u201cShe\u2019s probably going through her recipes for white boys,\u201d snickered Orbel, the company joker. <br>\u201cWait, witches eat folks?\u201d asked Sims, his face ashen. <br>Orbel angled his head so that half of his face became shrouded under cover of darkness. <br>\u201cWhy do you think they never recovered the bodies of the last squad that paid her a visit?\u201d pressed Orbel, in a convincingly morose tone. <br>\u201cStop,\u201d Van intervened. <br>Orbel winked at Van then gave Sims a rough shake at his shoulders, grinning.

Following an injury in the planting of the fields, the elderly father took to bed rest upon apothecarial orders, from which he never rose.

I had the pleasure of seeing you at the martial tournament of 747, and witnessing your skill with the spear. I was but a boy at the time. Afterward, I found my calling in the faith. As I grew into manhood, I grew my mind with the writings of the angels.

It is understood that such a royal procession will need as many as fifty heads of pig to facilitate the meeting as well as further travel. There is no doubt about this, and we were much prepared to do so.<br> <br>Unfortunately, travelers from neighboring Vassermark have depleted our supplies. The head of these diplomatic pilgrims was none other than Prince Gabriel, second in line to the Vassish throne. He came in earnest pursuit of our library, and brought with him three hundred men as his personal guard.

Comprehensible input is very good and Krashen is right, but there is a large contingent of CI admirers who are really just lazy perpetual 101 learners who would rather spend years speculating about how children&#039;s brains &quot;absorb language naturally&quot; than learning a fucking language. They misinterpret the true power and purpose of comprehensible input, which is basically this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conscious learning of grammatical and syntactical structures, and vocabulary, can only get you so far. You have to see and &quot;experience&quot; the same things repeatedly, in real and living contexts like reading a book you actually enjoy, for them to be taken up by the mind as relevant information to be stored permanently. It&#039;s better to have B-level knowledge of a language and then read a shitload of it than it is to have theoretical A-level knowledge and never read anything. </span><br>by misconstruing it as this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A baby&#039;s brain! Humans learn languages naturally! Absorb absorb absorb! Learn by doing! Watch your favorite movie! I learn by watching anime! </span><br><br>If you look carefully, no accomplished linguist or polyglot is actually saying the latter. Take Steve Kaufman for example, when asked how he learns his dozen or so languages so easily via CI, what does he say? He said it&#039;s because he learned Latin in high school the normal traditional way, and thus actually learned how grammar and syntax work, so every language he learns is just a permutation of that structure for him.<br><br>All of these pseudo-debates are between first and second year learners who, again, would rather speculate about ideal methods for ten years on social media than learn anything. The anti-LLPSI crowd deserves a good deal more respect because at least they are probably actually learning Latin as undergrads or something, and getting rankled by false promises and lazy methods, since they have firsthand experience of both how seriously you ought to take learning Latin grammar, and how powerful and surprisingly easy it is once you just get to it. Notice how all the LLPSI people are your typical terminally online &quot;hobbyists&quot; who really just follow social media and watch videos by influencers who themselves have the hobby. <br><br>Just read a Latin book you like. IF IT WORKED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, IT WILL WORK FOR YOU. Even LLPSI can work, even the magic baby learning CI method would work if any of these LLPSI idiots actually did it instead of arguing about it for eternity because they have personality disorders and feel real animosity for the people criticizing them and now it&#039;s yet another thing they &quot;debate&quot; about online.

Certainly finding out that the average human being in my old profession, decent at home and good to their loved ones, was a creature capable of horrible neglect simple from overexposure to suffering has been something I&#039;ve needed to wrestle with more than blatant abuse, which I&#039;ve always known has existed and had steeled myself for.<br><br>Overall, your post here makes me think of DFW&#039;s essay about Dostoevsky.

I am familiar enough with DFW to know of his New Sincerity, and it certainly resonates with me, being so wrapped in sardonic complexity, the modern age has left the core of art behind somewhere in its path towards progress, towards refinement. As to criticizing your poetry, I&#039;m not in any position, though I can at the very least praise it. The emotion you capture in 165, it is the pressure of the family, the history of horror we all seem to bear, the mundane trust that next time we will be able to figure it out, that if we&#039;re careful we won&#039;t be cut again, the bleakness of backyard plans lay fallow, while relying on the pacifying beauty of nature. your clear resilience in our brief conversation is evident in 165, you have chosen to survive, to take what you can from life and love it, and to let the rough parts build calluses and you&#039;ve committed to love them too, somehow. there is no shortage of the beauty of emotion in you, and whatever function of form you miss are made up for in an extended hand that touches the heart.

I don&#039;t remember who. Plotinus seems to have this but with a source for evil, &quot;Absolute Evil&quot;, which has at least less reality than the Good, since he calls it a substratum/hypostasis for evil. Matter is evil, and translated as &quot;Non-Being&quot;, so unless there&#039;s some difficulty with the linguistic traditions or if everyone had an altered state of consciousness then vs. now, I don&#039;t comprehend why evilness can have a quality and act as a substratum while also being nothingness.

He stopped posting because I humiliated him repeatedly during his Xenosystems days, simply by pulling at the seams of his idiotic thought process. As for Accelerationism, it is nonsense, because it is based on false premises:<br><br>1. That Capital and Intelligence (production) are somehow isomorphic. This is he kind of claim that&#039;s not right, but is not even wrong; no wonder then that Land makes appeals to gibberish production machines like Deleuze &amp; Guattari -- via &quot;deterritorialization&quot; -- to justify this inane equivalence.

That intelligence is some kind of attractor in, let&#039;s call it &quot;universal fitness space&quot; -- which is itself based on two sub-hypotheses:<br>2a. That intelligence is evolutionarily robust, as opposed to fragile i.e. it is a perennial winning strategy. This is an empirically disproven claim. The irony here is that one of Land&#039;s pet peeves during his Xenosystems &quot;era&quot; was dysgenics. The cognitive dissonance was too much I imagine, which is why I suspect he ended up &quot;devolving&quot; into a jelly-brained boomer in recent years.<br>2b.

This is, to say the least, highly speculative (granted, it is the least stupid of his assumptions).<br><br>Given these 2 assumptions, Land&#039;s point is then that Capital, once coming into being, can only continue existing and getting better and better at outcompeting any other thing, not limited to economic systems, but encompassing any system in the universe, including life itself.

So in<br>&#039;My Confession Recollections of a Rogue&#039; by Samuel Chamberlain, which is where much of the historical basis for Blood Meridian comes from, Chamberlain states that the judge has large hands and rapes and kills kids. McCarthy explicitly states that the judge has tiny hands in BM. He also says that the kid had large hands. I think he made those distinctions for a reason. At the end the kid fucks or tries to fuck a dwarf. You can read that as him liking children. When the kid walks into the jakes and the judge locks the door behind him, what I believe is that the kid gives into his dark side in there. I think they rape and murder the missing bear girl together. I believe the guy pissing outside of the jakes who warns the other man not to enter is the kid. He seems to know what went on inside and seems unfazed. Whatever happened in there was horrific to elicit the &quot;Good god almighty&quot; from the other man. We are talking about the most wicked city in Texas where murder was normal. I think he saw something truly horrible like a raped and murdered child. In the end the kid essentially became the judge.

In the white and empty room he stood in his bespoken suit with his hat in his hand and he peered down with his small and lashless pig&#039;s eyes wherein this child just sixteen years on earth could read whole bodies of decisions not accountable to the courts of men and he saw his own name which nowhere else could he have ciphered out at all logged into the records as a thing already accomplished, a traveler known in jurisdictions existing only in the claims of certain pensioners or on old dated maps.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In his delirium he ransacked the linens of his pallet for arms but there were none.

It is this false moneyer with his gravers and burins who seeks favor with the judge and he is at contriving from cold slag brute in the crucible a face that will pass, an image that will render this residual specie current in the markets where men barter.

He characterizes Polus&#039;s first speech about Gorgias&#039; s art as rhetorical, because it failed to say what the art is and instead said *what kind of* thing it is and praised it as if it had been attacked. Dialectic, we are left to presume, answers the question *what a thing is*. But when Socrates later overturns Polus&#039; s assertion that doing injustice without paying a just penalty is better than suffering injustice, the whole refutation turns on the premise granted by Polus (474c) that doing injustice is baser than suffering injustice; it rests, in other words, on an assertion of *what kind of* thing injustice is without making clear *what* it is. At this crucial point of the discussion, then, Socrates refutes rhetorically rather than investigates dialectically.

Fowler, West, and Kremer all agree on straightforwardly translating it as &quot;men of Athens&quot;. Rouse translates it as &quot;gentlemen&quot;; 1) the Athenian Greek phrase for &quot;gentleman&quot; is &quot;kalos kagathos&quot; (lit. &quot;Someone beautiful and good&quot;), 2) Socrates is actually being disrespectful towards the jurors, who, per existing court cases of the rhetoricians, one calls judges, which Socrates declines to do until talking with his friends at the end of Apology, who he goes out of his way to call his judges.<br><br>Jowett and Fowler both ignore the use of the word &quot;atechnos&quot; (lit. &quot;Artlessly&quot;) when Socrates first compares himself to a foreigner. West, Rouse, and Kremer all translate it according to its colloquial use, &quot;simply&quot;; West includes a footnote about both uses. Rouse includes a repetition afterwards (&quot;a stranger, a foreigner&quot;) not in the Greek (both &quot;stranger&quot; and &quot;foreigner&quot; are acurate enough translations of &quot;xenos&quot;; Greeks from other cities, and so of other customs and dialects, would be counted as &quot;xenoi&quot;, so it&#039;s not exclusive to non-Greeks).<br><br>Following the foreigner passage, Socrates entreats the Athenians to ignore the manner of his speech, but with the aside that such would be just. Fowler, West, Rouse, and Kremer all agree on that reading, though Rouse and Fowler translate &quot;dikaion&quot; as &quot;fair&quot;, which isn&#039;t necessarily so far off the mark, but which implies &quot;fairness&quot; in the modern sense, when the Greek word Socrates uses is the same that&#039;s the theme of the Republic, &quot;justice&quot;; Jowett turns the passage into a rhetorical question by Socrates and renders &quot;dikaion&quot; as &quot;unfair&quot;.<br><br>Later in the same sentence, Socrates judges how his speaking might come across, &quot;perhaps x, perhaps y&quot;; Socrates uses the words &quot;cheiron&quot; and &quot;beltion&quot;, &quot;worse/inferior&quot; and &quot;better&quot; respectively. Jowett reduces the two words to &quot;good&quot; (&quot;may or may not be good&quot;); Rouse switches the order, perhaps to suit more natural English phrasing (no biggie, not compared to Jowett). Fowler, West, and Kremer preserve the order.<br><br>(Cont.)", "time": 1673999214, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21539791, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:05:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539704</a><br>Following, Socrates exhorts the Athenians what to focus on. There are two verbs, &quot;skopein&quot; (lit. look/watch) and &quot;prosechein&quot; (hold fast); Fowler, West, Rouse, and Kremer all render the verbs just fine, though only West and Kremer preserve Socrates&#039; use of &quot;noun&quot; (&quot;mind&quot;) with the second verb. Jowett elides it with the following clause in a curious way. All the translators but Jowett render the Greek such that what Socrates tells the Athenians to attend to is whether his speech is just (&quot;dikaia&quot;) or not; Jowett translates &quot;dikaia&quot; as &quot;truth&quot;, which covers up the philosophically interesting issue of whether speaking justly is the same as speaking the truth (consider the Republic on medicinal lies).<br><br>Finally, Socrates makes a claim about what judges and orators do. Fowler, West, and Kremer are close here, bringing out that Socrates speaks of the virtue (&quot;arete&quot;) of a judge and the corresponding virtue of an orator; Fowler&#039;s minor change is a repetition of &quot;virtue&quot; that isn&#039;t in the Greek, but no biggie. Rouse translates it curiously as &quot;merit&quot;, which is alright but imprecise in the sense of being good at something (the other accurate translation of &quot;arete&quot; is &quot;excellence&quot;), but it would be wrong if it implied having to earn something, instead of the innate characteristic excellence of a being, as Plato uses it. Jowett doesn&#039;t acknowledge the word in his rendering. He turns Socrates statement into something hortatory, &quot;let x do y&quot;, switches the order of the judges and orators, and supplies a verb and adverb not present in the Greek (&quot;decide justly&quot;). His choice to translate &quot;rhetoros&quot; (&quot;rhetors/orators&quot;) as &quot;speaker&quot; seems poor since Socrates has just made a big effort to show how he&#039;s not a skilled speaker like the rhetoricians/orators, who, after all, are represented by one of his three accusers, Lycon.<br><br>All in all, West and Kremer, the Straussians, are slavish to the Greek and usually attentive to the order of Greek phrasing. Fowler is very close to them. Rouse takes some liberties here and there, but some might just be differences in the meanings of words from when he translated and now. Jowett takes a bunch of liberties, sometimes eliding clauses, sometimes ignoring important words, sometimes mangling the grammar, for what&#039;s admittedly a more readable product, but less philosophically sharp or rewarding (for a close reader) paraphrase.", "time": 1674000323, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21540406, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:02:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536537</a><br><a href=\"#p21536544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536544</a><br><a href=\"#p21539473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539473</a><br>A more modern version, by George Theodoridis:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don\u2019t be surprised or disturbedin the slightest, gentlemen if, as I go on with my defence speech, I use words which I always use in public, at the tables of the market place,say, or elsewhere in the city, places where many of you would have heard me speak.

(But if it&#039;s true, I&#039;m sure she deserved it.) Anyway, let&#039;s talk about an actually good writer: Ted Hughes!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I came to Lake Victoria, it was quite obvious to me that in some of the most important ways you are much more mature than I am. . . . But in many other ways obviously you are still childish \u2014 how could you not be, you alone among mankind? It\u2019s something people don\u2019t discuss, because it\u2019s something most people are aware of only as a general crisis of sense of inadequacy, or helpless dependence, or pointless loneliness, or a sense of not having a strong enough ego to meet and master inner storms that come from an unexpected angle. But not many people realise that it is, in fact, the suffering of the child inside them. Everybody tries to protect this vulnerable two three four five six seven eight year old inside, and to acquire skills and aptitudes for dealing with the situations that threaten to overwhelm it. So everybody develops a whole armour of secondary self, the artificially constructed being that deals with the outer world, and the crush of circumstances. And when we meet people this is what we usually meet. And if this is the only part of them we meet we\u2019re likely to get a rough time, and to end up making \u2018no contact\u2019. But when you develop a strong divining sense for the child behind that armour, and you make your dealings and negotiations only with that child, you find that everybody becomes, in a way, like your own child. It\u2019s an intangible thing. But they too sense when that is what you are appealing to, and they respond with an impulse of real life, you get a little flash of the essential person, which is the child. Usually, that child is a wretchedly isolated undeveloped little being. It\u2019s been protected by the efficient armour, it\u2019s never participated in life, it\u2019s never been exposed to living and to managing the person\u2019s affairs, it\u2019s never been given responsibility for taking the brunt. And it\u2019s never properly lived. That\u2019s how it is in almost everybody. And that little creature is sitting there, behind the armour, peering through the slits. And in its own self, it is still unprotected, incapable, inexperienced.</span><br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1673957965, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537518, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:20:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537514</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every single person is vulnerable to unexpected defeat in this inmost emotional self. At every moment, behind the most efficient seeming adult exterior, the whole world of the person\u2019s childhood is being carefully held like a glass of water bulging above the brim. And in fact, that child is the only real thing in them. It\u2019s their humanity, their real individuality, the one that can\u2019t understand why it was born and that knows it will have to die, in no matter how crowded a place, quite on its own. That\u2019s the carrier of all the living qualities. It\u2019s the centre of all the possible magic and revelation. What doesn\u2019t come out of that creature isn\u2019t worth having, or it\u2019s worth having only as a tool \u2014 for that creature to use and turn to account and make meaningful. So there it is. And the sense of itself, in that little being, at its core, is what it always was. But since that artificial secondary self took over the control of life around the age of eight, and relegated the real, vulnerable, supersensitive, suffering self back into its nursery, it has lacked training, this inner prisoner. And so, wherever life takes it by surprise, and suddenly the artificial self of adaptations proves inadequate, and fails to ward off the invasion of raw experience, that inner self is thrown into the front line \u2014 unprepared, with all its childhood terrors round its ears. And yet that\u2019s the moment it wants. That\u2019s where it comes alive \u2014 even if only to be overwhelmed and bewildered and hurt. And that\u2019s where it calls up its own resources \u2014 not artificial aids, picked up outside, but real inner resources, real biological ability to cope, and to turn to account, and to enjoy. That\u2019s the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when they\u2019re suffering, when something overwhelms their ordinary, careful armour, and the naked child is flung out onto the world. That\u2019s why the things that are worst to undergo are best to remember. But when that child gets buried away under their adaptive and protective shells\u2014he becomes one of the walking dead, a monster. So when you realise you\u2019ve gone a few weeks and haven\u2019t felt that awful struggle of your childish self \u2014 struggling to lift itself out of its inadequacy and incompetence \u2014 you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve gone some weeks without meeting new challenge, and without growing, and that you\u2019ve gone some weeks towards losing touch with yourself. The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn\u2019t live boldly enough, that they didn\u2019t invest enough heart, didn\u2019t love enough. Nothing else really counts at all.</span><br><br>(2/2)", "time": 1673958026, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537521, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:23:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537514</a><br><a href=\"#p21537518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537518</a><br>What % of people who know who he is only do so because of his connection to Plath?", "time": 1673958185, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537531, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:27:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thinking about her poem Daddy, I find that women are usually better at writing deeply disturbing psychological stuff than men.

They scream out at you for sympathy all day long, they are incapable of giving any in return, for they cannot state a fact accurately to another, nor can that other woman attend to it accurately enough for it to become information. Now is not all this the result of want of sympathy? I am sick with indignation at what wives and mothers will do of the most shocking selfishness. And people call it all maternal or conjugal affection, and think it pretty to say so. No, no, let each person tell the truth from their own experience. They really don\u2019t have sympathy or the ability to empathize, because they are always judging everyone and every thing as a product on a social value scale that relates to their own egos and bounces off of themselves. There is no capability for genuine feeling. This is what I have experienced with women, there is no capability for genuine feeling for other humans, or really in general, except when those feelings are for themselves and the other people are just proxies to bounce ideas off of.</span>", "time": 1673992916, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21539418, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:20:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539350</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, find me the passage where she talks about how she&#039;s disappointed she doesn&#039;t have five eminent lovers to hop between because she&#039;s a woman.</span><br>Okay and what will that prove?

The struggle here isn&#039;t really interpretation besides, but rather against ambiguity and its encroachment upon meaning. Very few people embrace ambiguity, and those who do so are typically individuals who do not profit much from reading in the first place, because their narcissistic echo-chamber hardly lets the mind of anyone else pierce its halls. Unfortunately, ambiguity gets a bad rap for this reason, since the greatest authors have the capacity to utilize ambiguity in such a way that it not only gives the reader space to bring themselves &quot;to the table&quot;, but also can be a sort of trap, that guides one through research into a seeming void that leads exactly where the author wants the reader to go. Chalking everything up to openness of infinite interpretation is an intellectually lazy thing to do, but so is insisting upon there being a definite reason to any piece. Interpretation overall is for the weak. The great man siezes objective meaning from the wraith, upon ripping the author&#039;s ghost from the ether, invoking their eternal souls to dispel all that could not be made seen in their lifetime, whilst leaping upon their phantasmic shoulders, and forming brave new meanings the author could never even come up with himself.", "time": 1674002652, "resto": 21539484}, {"no": 21539955, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539939</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seethe</span><br>You adopt the jargon of this site as a substitute for original thought: you will me to be angry, and pretend it is the case so as to make yourself feel superior.

On the contrary, early Buddhism has acknowledged the possibility of an autonomous realization, exemplified first and foremost by its founder, the historical Bud-dha, who was the prince Siddartha. Considering the progressive materialization of humankind in the course of history, and the consequent development of physical individuality, later forms of Buddhism, especially in the Mahayana tradition, have reaffirmed the concept of initiation (diksha) as the usual way to achieve one&#039;s integration. Initiation, therefore, is defined as a real transmission of a shakti, and as a power and a guiding light. While Catholicism professes that the apostolic succession and the continuity of grace ensure the sacraments&#039; efficacy, in Hinduism there have been dy-nasties of spiritual teachers (gurus), who have uninterruptedly trans-mitted not only the tradition of their own schools but also the nonhuman power (shakti) that is required in order to expound and to activate that tradition. The image that this transmission evokes is that of a flame lighting another; spiritual organizations, called kulas within Tantrism, also follow the same principle. The power is often transmitted from the teacher to the novice through words of power (mantras), in which a shakti becomes intimately connected to a word, thus acquiring a vivifying and fertilizing quality; it propiti-ates a &quot;second birth.&quot;4 The nondualistic premise is reaffirmed, since this is a birth taking place within one&#039;s innermost being. Thus it has been suggested that &quot;those who embrace a person who is initiated into the supreme brahman are embracing themselves.&quot; And during the ritual, the great saying from the Upanishads is whispered: </span><br>&quot;Thou art that&quot; (tat tvam asi), and also: &quot;Think within thyself that I am He and He is I. Free from all attachments [nir-mana, literally, devoid of the sense of mineness] and sense of self, go as thou pleasest as moved thereto by thy nature.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the texts insist on the necessity of seeking the aid of a guru following this &quot;beginning,&quot; however, they may contain exag-gerations; some contingent circumstances may even play a role. </span><br>Considering, for instance, that there were no books containing certain teachings, and that some books were difficult to find, the guru was practically the only source available, even for the most exoteric elements of the learning process.6 Whatever may be found in various teachings that cannot be transmitted through ordinary language or written expositions should not be overlooked.", "time": 1673937407, "resto": 21529870}, {"no": 21536841, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:37:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536840</a><br>Cont.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The same goes for the coded and multivalent character of some texts, which involve a hierarchy of interpretative levels. This set of cir-cumstances, too, dictates the need for a spiritual teacher. Finally, we must consider the continuous relations between a teacher and the person being initiated, besides the transmission of a power, which is not just the guru&#039;s own Shakti but rather a super-individual shakti, connected to the initiatory circle to which the guru himself belongs.

For example, in the HFO I am talking about the hypnotist will try to bring you to mental arousal to the point of demanding semen emission, involuntarily, this is where the active part comes in and where you can yourself take control and completely withold the bindu leading to a state comparable to samarasa, mahamudra in the tibetan tantric tradition etc. you can indeed have a &quot;dry orgasm&quot;

It&#039;s being the head of the biggest clan that is the real eminence, and so the office of thain follows that rather than the other way around. That it actually became a position of explicit prominence with some nominal authority (Aragorn made it gondorian policy to stay completely out of the affairs of the shire, so it still has no real &quot;teeth&quot;) is incidental. It&#039;s more like president of the shire than anything else in a land where the president has no power. Frodo comes from some notable lineages, but I wouldn&#039;t call them aristocratic lineages.

If you&#039;re not aware, Dolan&#039;s translation is an attempt to make the Iliad more relatable to a modern audience, so that the horror and humour hit us with the immediate impact that a Dark Age Greek audience might have felt listening to Homer tell the tale in person. It&#039;s actually not a bad idea in theory - there are certain elements of the Iliad that are lost in the more august, high-minded translations from the 19th and earlier 20th centuries. <br><br>However, Dolan is also infected by the modern tendency to equate disenchantment with insight. &quot;You know they weren&#039;t really heroes, don&#039;t you? That they were just a bunch of thugs?&quot; he seems to sneer from every page. Thus, Agamemnon is now a stupid brute with no further characteristics. Achilles is only a petulant crybaby, and nothing more. Odysseus is (as you might expect) regarded more favourably, but only because Dolan treats him as a modern put-upon professional who just wants to get the job done and go home, ignoring his many nobler qualities. The whole translation is rife with this sentiment, and the intention seems to be to convince the reader (or Dolan himself) that nothing is really noble, that nobody is truly great and that the whole creed of heroic excellence is nonsense designed to obscure structural violence or power relations or some bullshit like that. It&#039;s a very ugly translation in that sense, because it&#039;s clear that Dolan kind of hates or resents the ethos of the Iliad. <br><br>Just read Fagles.", "time": 1673991240, "resto": 21536714}, {"no": 21539280, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:40:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21538740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538740</a><br>He was tricked by Athena in disguise of one of his comrades into standing his ground to Achilles thinking he would have backup spears", "time": 1673991637, "resto": 21536714}, {"no": 21539291, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Fagles is the McDonald&#039;s Big Mac of Iliad translations", "time": 1673991783, "resto": 21536714}, {"no": 21539301, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539227</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beauty is too great a sacrifice</span><br><br>To appreciate the &#039;beauty&#039; of the Iliad you have to read it in Ancient Greek.

This is a Chinese gay romance/danmei cultivation/xianxia written by a Chinese woman for Chinese women that has an official translation. I don&#039;t mind reading what I otherwise wouldn&#039;t from time to time, and that&#039;s certainly what this is. This is the first gay romance and first Asian cultivation novel that I&#039;ve finished.<br><br>This began as a serialized webnovel that after it ended it was revised and became a novel. As far as I know that isn&#039;t uncommon for webnovels that become novel series. Sometimes they&#039;re completely rewritten. I think that at least partially accounts for its quality of writing, the dialogue is especially horrendous, even after considering that it&#039;s been translated. I&#039;m unable to comment on the original work, so I can&#039;t say whether the !!!s, ???s, and various phrases in ALL CAPS are appropriate or not, as stylistic standards in originally self-published works are much looser. There are interspersed illustrations. This has adaptations in various types of media.<br><br>The protagonist is a mass murdering flute playing grandmaster of demonic cultivation/necromancer with a kill count in the several thousands at least. Also, he&#039;s already died before the story begins. Thirteen years later a teenage male homosexual sacrifices his soul to summon an evil spirit to slaughter his own family, and so the protagonist takes residence in his new body. The protagonist decides to jokingly go along with the homosexuality to antagonize and disgust everyone. Since he doesn&#039;t have any powers from his former body, he&#039;s rather useless overall. Not entirely so, but enough to where it doesn&#039;t matter much. Most of the book is him being escorted by the man in love with him and their previous school life together. The assumedly mid-30s man doesn&#039;t mind that the man he fell in love with is in a teenager&#039;s body that&#039;s roughly the same age as when they first met.<br><br>In this first volume in there isn&#039;t much romance. The most that they do by the end of this is arguably cuddling, if it can be called that, since it&#039;s arguably coerced. The protagonist carries on with the &quot;I&#039;ll do gay stuff to disgust him, oh no why isn&#039;t it working?&quot; act the entire volume. It&#039;s difficult to believe that he&#039;s this dense about what&#039;s going on, but it&#039;s a common trope, so it&#039;s probably exactly what&#039;s happening. I don&#039;t know if this eventually becomes a &quot;I&#039;m not gay, I only love you&quot; sort of thing, or something else, but clearly their relationship deepens in some way.<br><br>There wasn&#039;t much of anything for me to enjoy in this, which I suppose is to be expected. It didn&#039;t enrage me, make me regret my life decisions, or wail in anguish, so I can&#039;t it give it my lowest rating, not even rounded down.

DNF<br>read like 6 pages before bed and forgot about it the next day.<br><br>[Book of the New Sun] - 5/10<br>DNF. Just really not my cup of tea. I understand why people like it but there&#039;s an abstractness to it that I dont find comfortable to immerse in.<br><br>[Hyperion] - ??<br>dont think I even opened the epub file. Just downloaded it because nobody ever shuts up about it.<br><br>[The Gulag Archipelago] - N/A<br>Just wanted to know why J.

The formatting in the epub I found had grammar errors and text walls which made it annoying to read, but I enjoyed the story and Louis&#039; perspective of the other characters.<br><br>[Twilight 1-4] 6.3/10<br>Read these initially in high school to get chicks. Reread it every few years because it&#039;s a bit comfy and I can talk to my girlfriend about it. Midnight Sun replacing the first book massively improves the rereads.<br><br>[Cradle 1 - 11] 10/10<br>Did a reread for the release of Dreadgod. I dont know what it is, they&#039;re not even necessarily objectively good, or maybe they are. I don&#039;t know. I just like reading them, a lot. A fucking lot. And I dont need anyone&#039;s fucking permission either, so biased 10 rating<br><br>[Assortment of Sanderson Books] 2/10 <br>I fully read some of these but ugh who fucking cares already they&#039;re a dime a dozen at this point<br><br>[Riftwar Legacy] 6.8/10<br>Finished all of them.

I think it did.<br><br>[Supermage] - 1.5/10<br>Holy christ this is cringe. Something about stats and video game panels but they&#039;re not in a video game? And it&#039;s about some teens running from a comically villanous mayor/girls father. Ehh fuck off<br><br>[Buryoku 1-9 ] - 7.3/10<br>series written by the same author as above. It&#039;s a clone of Cradle in a way that&#039;s almost lawsuit worthy, but it&#039;s still the same shonen esque power climb and it&#039;s not horribly written. Actually quite enjoyed it a fair bit.

Just kept sitting in this odd storytelling spot. The story itself wasn&#039;t necessarily odd, I just... I dunno, my autism created a buffer and I got distracted and left it behind. Probably worth a higher rating.<br><br>[Homeland: The Legend of Drizzt] - 3/10<br>I dont know what it is about R.A.

Not for me, but if you like ching chong bug shit have at it.

There were also things I didn&#039;t like about it. I liked how long it was. I was unemployed at the time of reading, read 8 hours a day and still had a good week of entertainment.<br><br>[Curse of Chalion] - 7.7/10<br>Decent reading. Came looking for paladin shit, stayed for the intrigue.<br><br>[Infinity Blade 1 &amp; 2] - N/A<br>I just like infinity blade shit, Sanderson be damned. This was a reread anyways.<br><br>[Canticle] - 2/10<br>DNF barely even remember what it&#039;s about. More of my own issues with R.A.

The story and character status quo transition between book 1 and book 2 reminds me a lot of Way of Kings but even more clunky, if you can believe it. Lost interest a short way into book 2.<br><br>[Archer of the Heathland: Deliverance] - 4.4/10<br>DNF. Retarded title. Tries to start off edgy, but doesnt linger on any of the implied darkness, which makes it lose a lot of investment value. Basically: &quot;Oh no!

As an unabashed universalist, or religious pluralist (while speaking anonymously, at least), I also believe Muslim or Sufi saints, Hindu saints, and even Buddhist saints, or shamans can also be associated with miracles. <br><br>I use very tortured syntax around the concept of \u201cmiracles,\u201d to not use the sentence \u201cperforming miracles,\u201d as this can imply it as a \u201cconsciously willed ability one \u2018owns\u2019 and has explicit control over.\u201d It might be more theologically correct to say, only God performs (authentic or true) miracles, only God is the real Doer, the earthly personality is not the explicit doer but rather can be a witness to miraculous events brought about by its own submission to the Divine. <br><br>For instance, the hagiography of figures like St. Symeon of Emesa and other Christian saints and mystics tied to miracles, includes what Hindus have even named as \u201csiddhis,\u201d corresponding to the spiritual gifts or charismata (pl.) of Christianity.<br><br>For instance: Prakashya, the ability to inwardly, mentally know or illuminate whatever is happening anywhere in the world in any situation; Dur Shravan: the power of clairaudience \u2014 the ability to hear from afar; Dur Darshan: clairvoyance, or subtle seeing with the Third Eye, scenes of past, present or even sometimes the future of what the Dur Darshan Siddha has no direct physical perception of.", "filename": "64A02483-CFEA-48B7-B638-1836DBD45F8D", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 467, "tn_w": 160, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673986042076095, "time": 1673986042, "md5": "eAekOiMyEvKztjdvpsal+A==", "fsize": 37777, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-literary-pretext-for-this-thread-is-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21538965, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)15:32:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21538845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538845</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On another note: Christians draw certainty from their faith, where do occultists/Traditionalists draw it from?
