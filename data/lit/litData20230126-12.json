A prolonged phase of gradually expanding cooperation with key Eurasian partners, both stimulated and arbitrated by America, can also help to foster the preconditions for an eventual upgrading of the existing and increasingly antiquated UN structures.

Even someone like Rorty who read and actually understood him almost all the way, still had such an analyticlet brain that all he can think of beyond the deconstruction of analytic philosophy is bourgeois quietism<br><br>Just start with Philosophical Investigations and keep in mind that when he talks about his earlier position and the position of &quot;other/earlier philosophers&quot; he&#039;s referring to the Fregean/Russellian point of view which wants to resolve all ambiguous speech into what the speech &quot;really&quot; signifies, and create a logical/symbolic language that is purified of all ambiguity and perspicuously shows the &quot;bare&quot; signification (this is the &quot;ideal language&quot; underlying real, contingent, messy, ambiguous languages). The idea that the solution to ambiguity, error, and lack of consensus is to create and discover such an ideal language is the dominant theme underlying analytic philosophy from Frege onward. Later Wittgenstein flips things by realizing that language doesn&#039;t have a &quot;pure&quot; core signifying predication layer that is then loaded with ambiguities (modalities, redundancies, inconsistencies) in actual usage, the ambiguities are &quot;features not bugs,&quot; they are part of how language itself works. So any logic we create is actually making a grave mistake in thinking it&#039;s bypassing all the ambiguous layers and getting right at &quot;the&quot; pure signifying layer. What it is really doing, at most, is creating a careful and minimalistic predicating syntax that a bunch of analytic philosophers seem to agree on. But this can also be dangerous, as it was historically, because it becomes rigid and taken for granted in the process, which causes unresolved ambiguities in it to be frozen in place and paved over instead of being interrogated for their meaning. That&#039;s what Wittgenstein really means by &quot;meaning is use&quot;: meaning is not some pure predicative core ideal language underlying contingent language(s), the lowest or more basic layer of thought/understanding/communication<wbr> we can reach is the USE layer, the layer of language as it is actually used in flux. We CAN layer a variety of logical languages (like math) on top of this layer, but only if we are mindful that these languages are simply specialist tools, not some magical window into pure language. <br><br>Watch the Ayer interview with Bryan Magee for a peek into the analytic mindset as it developed", "time": 1674691762, "resto": 21572393}, {"no": 21572715, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)19:18:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21572688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21572688</a><br>Also it helps to keep in mind that Wittgenstein is not doing a metaphysics of language, he&#039;s merely noting something observationally, namely that language when we &quot;dig all the way down&quot; to the deepest and most primal layers of it available to us is &quot;language in use.&quot; To put this more simply and prosaically: when an ambiguity arises, like the ambiguity of how to define the word &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play,&quot; an example used by Wittgenstein, the analytic philosophy temptation is to try to find what game/play &quot;really&quot; means, in some hitherto undiscovered/latent ideal language sub-layer. I.e., their approach is to see our messy contingent usage of the word &quot;game,&quot; in contexts as dissimilar as &quot;don&#039;t play games with me&quot; and &quot;chess is a game,&quot; as somehow just a mess-ified version of a REALLY TRUE AND APPROPRIATE definition underlying all these real contingent uses. They thus instinctively think in terms of finding out which definitions are closer to the &quot;real meaning&quot; of game (like chess) and which are &quot;merely incidental/analogous&quot; meanings (&quot;don&#039;t play games with me&quot;) etc. But this approach, again, implies and assumes that there was some &quot;real definition&quot; awaiting discovery and elucidation, in some magical ideal language underlying all our uses of it. If this is the case, where the fuck is it located? In God&#039;s mind? Hard-coded into all of our minds? <br><br>Clearly the answer is that the primary locus of game-language IS IN ITS VERY AMBIGUOUS, REAL USAGE. That we &quot;know what we mean&quot; when we extend certain terms or use them in analogous ways, without thinking &quot;I am using this by analogy; of course, this is not really a game&quot; in some unconscious ideal language way, is how language actually works in reality. So when a philosopher wants to answer the question, &quot;What does &#039;game&#039; REALLY mean?,&quot; his resort should not be to some magical ideal language, or to a logical clarification, but to ACTUAL USE. The philosopher ultimately cannot explain WHY or HOW certain cultures at certain times, composed of individuals with brains and minds, &quot;knew what one meant&quot; when one used game in this or that way. The philosopher can only &quot;therapeutically&quot; refer ambiguities of formalization back to such originating points. <br><br>This is NOT to say that there is no ultimate scientific or metaphysical explanation for how the mind works, what thinking or predication is. It&#039;s simply to say that assuming the mind works by means of an ideal language that just happened to be developed by a couple Englishmen and German in the form of symbolic notation is probably naive. So what we can do until philosophy/science figures out the whole world is attend to language and resist the temptation to put the cart before the horse by trying to explain ambiguities in real meaning with sterile abstractions.

I&#039;d watch those two hours of TikTok, but only after I did what I have to do. Even if it costs me my sleep and mental health, I never give up on focusing on getting better results. Why do I care? Because this is who I am. I don&#039;t give up. There is no compromise there; if I feel like something can be achieved with minimal efforts, I&#039;m going to do it my maximum instead.

Wasn&#039;t it all just irrational emotional impulses? I am genuinely puzzled by the kind of thinking you have. You seem to require a deeper meaning and some profound reason to do difficult things that require your attention and deliberate practice, but this doesn&#039;t seem to apply to other things. I suppose you could say your reason for typing out these posts is exactly that you&#039;re woeful of not having any reason to do anything. But as you say yourself, you&#039;ve hit a philosophical dead end where no amount of reasoning will give you an answer. Which in turn invalidates your posts altogether.<br><br>You need to adjust your own mind to be accommodative of productive activities. Because the human mind is at home when it is occupied in productive, creative pursuits. There doesn&#039;t need to be a rational, logical reason. There doesn&#039;t even need to be feeling for that matter. Acquiring a state of flow and becoming one with your pursuit is in and of itself a goal worth pursuing. A skilled musician or a carpenter or a bodybuilder or a painter could go hours on end in their craft, as if possessed, acting deliberately yet almost automatically. Like walking for a long time, they stop being fully conscious that their legs are taking steps. Seek that state of flow.<br><br>I&#039;ll also take a moment to stress the importance of social connection in creating a sense of meaning. Proper friendships where both you and your friend or family member are fully vulnerable and genuine toward one another can help free your mind from the clutches of excessive rationality. Shallow gatherings will keep you distant both socially and mentally. You need to touch grass to remember what the world feels like if your mind gets too far up your arse. Comedy can help you. If you can still laugh, and I mean really laugh, then you can still become human again.

Masturbation is something that constantly keeps me stuck in a state of addiction. It&#039;s always been a cycle for me that consists of abstinence \u2014&gt; relapse \u2013&gt; indulgence. The only real difference is that my period of abstinence might range from 2 days to 10 days, but I inevitably end up relapsing and starting the cycle all over again. <br><br>I&#039;ve always believed I was a pervert or rapist of some kind who does not have any degree of self-control because of the fact that I&#039;ve never been in control of my sexual activity. I only indulge when my temptations take me over completely, which almost feels like being possessed by a devil. On the other hand, I&#039;ve met people who have told me that their experience with masturbation was similar to mine, and that masturbation is something you&#039;re not supposed to ever be able to quit. What can be surmised is that my cyclical experience with masturbation is not something that&#039;s unique and is actually universal. <br><br>The truth is that I&#039;ve never been able to relate to the general mainstream conversation around masturbation. On one side there are hardcore religious fundamentalists who call you a biological abomination for indulging in so-called self-abuse. I always believed this was a ridiculous and over the top reaction, because I&#039;ve always had pity for people who just like me try to stop masturbating and get caught up in the cycle. On the other side, there are people part of the sexual liberation movement who consider the sex drive to be innocent and fundamentally a force for good. This is also frankly not something I can relate to, because my sexual feelings have always been monstrously powerful and my fantasies are things that I should never act on. <br><br>The comedian Louis CK has a bit where he talks about walking into a library and seeing a pretty girl, and even though he wants to feel like a normal person, seeing her immediately invokes a lot of intrusive thoughts in his mind that he simply cannot ever say out loud.

For example, an excess of the trait of modesty can make you shy and withdrawn, whereas too little of it can make you irritating and boastful. He extends this same argument to the trait of abstinence. Too much of it becomes ascetism (the same thing you advocate for is to him a negative trait), too little of it makes you addictive. The golden mean, according to him, is being &quot;temperate&quot;, which to him is a virtue.

D. Unwin is correct in his assessment of society, this present generation in the Western world may be the last one. In his book, Sex and Culture, professor Unwin studied eighty \u201cuncivilized\u201d cultures and compared his results with sixteen \u201ccivilized\u201d cultures extending over the last 4,000 years. He found that when strict heterosexual monogamy was practiced, the society attained its greatest cultural energy, especially in the arts, sciences and technology. But as people rebelled against the prohibitions placed upon them and demanded more sexual opportunities, there was a consequent loss of their creative energy, which resulted in the decline and eventual destruction of the civilization. Remarkably, he did not find any exception to this trend.&quot;<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

If she conceives, you then receive a child and a bigger team is produced. And don&#039;t think for a second that the man doesn&#039;t receive the hormones and powers of her biology as well.

But *that* question draws out the deeper issue: Euthyphro selects Zeus on account of the latter&#039;s *justice*, *goodness*, *wisdom*, etc., i.e., what Euthyphro is blind to is his own piety *not* being based on what the gods love, but rather on imitation of what Zeus is, because he thinks Zeus is a better god according to these external standards (external since Zeus is not = Goodness Itself, same with Justice, etc.).

Or do you like it because it&#039;s good, or advantageous, or because it protects you and your loved ones, etc.? When one defines piety strictly definitionally like one defines &quot;bachelor&quot;, one ignores what the content of the &quot;loving&quot; amounts to for the gods; i.e., do they love prayers to them because it appeals to their love of honors? Do they love sacrifices because they like the smell or like that kind of attention given to them?

We can see this e.g. in his treatment of dionysiac castration and mother-goddess cults in metaphysics of sex.

The speed and unevenness of the latter parts of the book are like a runaway train on a coastal mountain that went off the tracks and is now soaring through the air until it makes quite the splash. It would&#039;ve been better for me instead if it had proceeded at a leisurely pace and took in the scenery. Much of the early parts are about the character&#039;s daily life as everything changes around him for the worse, or at least for the different, and he doesn&#039;t quite understand why at first.<br><br>This is science fiction, though that&#039;s mostly to establish the setting. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d quite call it social science fiction, but it&#039;s close. Romance plays a significant role, but this isn&#039;t a romance book. Possibly the closest description would be that it&#039;s a book about coming of age in a collapsing dystopia filled with ethnic conflict and how to survive that regardless of the costs. Horrific and ugly decisions are made out of malice, ignorance, or simply wanting to survive. This isn&#039;t misery porn though because it doesn&#039;t delight in its tragedies, but rather presents them as The Way Things Are Now.<br><br>Almost the entire book takes place in a single city on an outer world whose colonization was supported by all three members of the Triumvirate, the ultimate authorities of humankind. They reminded me of the Ekumen in Ursula K. LeGuin&#039;s Hainish Cycle if they were instead short-sighted, ineffective, and created various problems for themselves without realizing, or perhaps not caring. The usual sort of world powers stuff.<br><br>The story follows a young man throughout the course of his life, which when considering the length of this book has to be by necessity rather condensed. The ambiguous ages and chronology in general are a sticking point for me. At the start he&#039;s na\u00efve and thoroughly indoctrinated in ideals not dissimilar from North Korea&#039;s Juche or other variants of Marxism-Leninism. Those ideals entirely suffuse their society which provides for a somewhat different perspective than usual. The narrative is presented in first person present which ought to allow for more understanding of the protagonist, but his inner thoughts and commentary don&#039;t add much. His actions are far greater than anything else and story may suffer for the closeness of its perspective.<br><br>This was better than I expected from an author&#039;s self-published debut, considering how unknown it is. If it had maintained its highest level of quality I could recommend it with some reservations, but as it is, I can&#039;t. I don&#039;t regret reading it though and I&#039;m open to giving the author another chance, which is more than I can say for a lot of other authors.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5", "filename": "57339383", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 313, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674669778294975, "time": 1674669778, "md5": "ZH/iARprG8oAFgpG0hELmw==", "fsize": 43260, "resto": 21565496, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21571506, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:04:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21571494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21571494</a><br>Since there isn&#039;t anything else I&#039;ve read that I&#039;d be posting here for this thread, I thought I&#039;d post something I wrote a few months ago and didn&#039;t post at the time.

Even his name is not reaveled in the beginning portion of the story. He is a rover with no meaning in his life but to survive, the meaning to which he himself does not know why. Yet he perseveres to do so. Dabrowski is a character in a place where he doesn\u2019t belong: the long aftermath of the global nuclear holocaust. It leaves nothing behind but ruins of old earth and the worst of humanity for him to fend against; rapists, murderers, and cannibals. Dabrowski\u2019s morals are conservative and decent at best. He hasn\u2019t committed heinous acts like others and tries to keep a fairly moral compass regardless of the situation he\u2019s in. However he isn&#039;t blinded by good faith and does what is needed to survive. Patriotism is an underlying theme which fuels Dabrowski\u2019s character. He constantly reminisces of the old world, being young at the time when the bombs dropped he never truly experienced what it was like to live in a proper civilization. He wishes to be a part of a time of democracy, freedom, and peace. Disregarding its unfortunate reality it leads to and which Dabrowski now lives in. Dabrowski\u2019s name itself is deep with patriotic meaning. Jan Henryk D\u0105browski born 1775 was a polish general who fought in the Napoleonic wars and French invasion of Russia. Described as a national hero for his patriotic attitude who spent his whole life restoring the legacy of Poland, even being awarded the Order of the White Eagle; one of Poland\u2019s highest honors and one of his many accomplishments. The song \u201cPoland is not yet lost\u201d, the national anthem of Poland, mentions D\u0105browski personally. Its initial purpose was to raise the morale of his troops of his polish legionaries during the Italian campaign of the French Revolutionary wars. The lyrics of the song reflect Dabrowski\u2019s character throughout the story of A Boy and His Cat. As stated \u201c The main theme of the poem is the idea that was novel in the times of early nationalists based on centralized nation states - that the lack of political sovereignty does not preclude the existence of a nation.These words mean that people who have in them what constitutes the essence of a nation can prolong the existence of their country regardless of it political circumstances and may even strike to make it real again.\u201d Alluding to the fact that as long as Dabrowski keeps his strong morals and spirit, the remnants of the United States are still alive; to be a leader to others as he calls them to arms.

Shaking torches with veil-covered face, he had cast a black cock upon a fire of sandarach before the breast of the Sphinx, the Father of Terror. He had descended into the caverns of Proserpine; he had seen the five hundred pillars of the labyrinth of Lemnos revolve, and the candelabrum of Tarentum, which bore as many sconces on its shaft as there are days in the year, shine in its splendour; at times he received Greeks by night in order to question them. The constitution of the world disquieted him no less than the nature of the gods; he had observed the equinoxes with the armils placed in the portico of Alexandria, and accompanied the bematists of Evergetes, who measure the sky by calculating the number of their steps, as far as Cyrene; so that there was now growing in his thoughts a religion of his own, with no distinct formula, and on that very account full of infatuation and fervour. He no longer believed that the earth was formed like a fir-cone; he believed it to be round, and eternally falling through immensity with such prodigious speed that its fall was not perceived.<br><br>From the position of the sun above the moon he inferred the predominance of Baal, of whom the planet itself is but the reflection and figure; moreover, all that he saw in terrestrial things compelled him to recognise the male exterminating principle as supreme.

Was it not for her that the grand-pontiff had once advanced amid the tumult of cymbals, and with a patera of boiling water taken from him his future virility?

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay.

It&#039;s also important to note that the word Ousia has been translated to &quot;Being&quot; by Heidegger in his work, and he developed the concept of Dasein, or human existence, as the way to understand Being.</span>", "time": 1674659781, "resto": 21552286}, {"no": 21571108, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)10:49:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21571042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21571042</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I asked chatGPT.</span><br>I asked my cat and he said meow", "time": 1674661798, "resto": 21552286}, {"no": 21571979, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)15:29:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21570921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21570921</a><br>I think we&#039;ll find out in 2.9, but I&#039;d guess that since everything is an emanation from the One, being is good while real non-being, matter, is evil.

But make no mistake. This &#039;studying&#039; cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who &#039;feel for the people.&#039; In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all instinct, are capable of realizing.

Later SS works clearly translated this in 4 so called life laws which made up the &#039;&#039;racist worldview&#039;&#039; which is more accurately called a natural worldview since it is largely based on biological concepts.

There is a prevailing notion that &quot;the Greeks were gay&quot; which is not only false, but false based on firsthand accounts. Athenians and two other Greek states were recorded to engage in pederasty, but the rest either have no evidence of such activities, or were confirmed to have opposed it or banned it entirely. Even in Athens the practice was still contentious. and the following quotation from Plato will illustrate this point:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And in different countries there is a difference of opinion about male loves. Some, like the Boeotians, approve of them; others, like the Ionians, and most of the barbarians, disapprove of them; partly because they are aware of the political dangers which ensue from them, as may be seen in the instance of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. At Athens and Sparta there is an apparent contradiction about them. For at times they are encouraged, and then the lover is allowed to play all sorts of fantastic tricks; he may swear and forswear himself (and \u2019at lovers\u2019 perjuries they say Jove laughs\u2019); he may be a servant, and lie on a mat at the door of his love, without any loss of character; but there are also times when elders look grave and guard their young relations, and personal remarks are made. The truth is that some of these loves are disgraceful and others honourable. The vulgar love of the body which takes wing and flies away when the bloom of youth is over, is disgraceful, and so is the interested love of power or wealth; but the love of the noble mind is lasting.</span><br>Note that even in the Symposium, regardless of how Academics desperately attempt to frame the Athenian pederasty as similar or equivalent to modern homosexuality, the evidence just does not support that. An unbiased reading of Plato is enough to demonstrate that Socrates was attempting to combat the widespread sexualization, rape, and molestation of boys as young as 12 (and younger) by predominantly rich, bourgeois Athenians and morally corrupt Athenians like Thrasymachus, Gorgias, Prodicus, Meletus, and more (many of whom would later seek to put Socrates to trial and kill him).<br>A final interesting note is the Christian view: Plato&#039;s texts survived Christian scrutiny. Why? Because Plato and Socrates were not encouraging homosexuality, but agape, or the unconditional love of both men and women in a non-sexual fashion. Socrates even demonstrates this clearly by refusing to ever engage in intercourse with Alcibiades, essentially taking the place of a caring and loving father. At the same time, lends some credence to the common liberal arguments that Paul&#039;s charges against Corinth over reported homosexual acts are against the rape of boys which was common. Of course, academics want it both ways and aren&#039;t keen on noting their hypocrisy.", "filename": "iStock-801468792", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2124, "h": 1411, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1674728529821167, "time": 1674728529, "md5": "3fTKUFFZjgFxdEYcxwo/Zg==", "fsize": 1500637, "resto": 21566677}, {"no": 21574189, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)05:25:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21574181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21574181</a><br>tl;dr: Socrates refuted the bussy, criticized elite athenian pedophiles, and got sentenced to death for &quot;corrupting the youth&quot;. aka, saving them from becoming bussyslaves", "time": 1674728707, "resto": 21566677}, {"no": 21574196, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)05:29:06", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "64720274-F9A4-41FF-814E-A0F5C79264AA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 496, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 57, "tim": 1674728946280956, "time": 1674728946, "md5": "k/JnOJiqOARmHmK+Pwc3Qg==", "fsize": 168545, "resto": 21566677}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21573991, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:18:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are the best books about manipulation &amp; psychology?", "filename": "psychological-manipulation-techniques-4-600x400-3397806097", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 338, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674721086417141, "time": 1674721086, "md5": "sDsucC3C9jBGXmZsv2SrYg==", "fsize": 11144, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-the-best-books-about-manipulation", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21574016, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)03:29:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21573991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21573991</a><br>Picrel is best book against manipulation", "filename": "472bb40f21a8e0fc1b3809f2f645ec59d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 309, "h": 500, "tn_w": 77, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674721787499958, "time": 1674721787, "md5": "AZJEeTdEKiSs3bfURGmNFA==", "fsize": 28353, "resto": 21573991}, {"no": 21574191, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)05:27:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "DSM-V", "time": 1674728832, "resto": 21573991}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21573311, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why this deleuzian-hoppeanist boy who talking a lot about Kant and Heidegger is soo popular for masses?", "filename": "VF_NickLand", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1674703982753694, "time": 1674703982, "md5": "/eFY7hQ/YHzUJgwOk18jwQ==", "fsize": 94955, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-this-deleuzianhoppeanist-boy-who-talking-a", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 8, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21573460, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)23:30:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21573311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21573311</a><br>So I was working at a mass unskilled union plant as I do in order to subsist (food, rent, etc.) by selling my labour power to a capitalist who profits on the difference between the cost of my labourpower (collectively, averaged) as hours of standard units of labour, and the sale price of the commodities I produce for them.<br><br>Nobody had heard of Nick Land.

One problem is that Nicean-clean-up-brigade paint all non-Niceans as &quot;gnostic&quot; at times, whereas there are clear differences between various theologies worshipping Jesus painted as gnostic. So the social history of the early Church sees problems, like faithless bishops conducting mass potentially invalidating the remission of sins.

It&#039;s not Christian nor Biblical.<br><br>The idea of a rebellion by satan is present throughout scripture, from the mention of the serpent in Genesis 3 to the defeat of this same entity at the end of Revelation. It is in both Old Testament and New Testament. The prophecy in Genesis 3:15 is, that the seed of the woman shall crush the serpent&#039;s head. This finds fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the anointed one spoken of in those prophecies.<br><br>&quot;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&quot; - Gen. 3:15<br><br>However, Satan or the devil is not an equal to God anywhere in the Biblical account. Indeed, in Isaiah 14:12 it mentions Lucifer being cast down from heaven. In Ezekiel 28 it says that iniquity was found in him, and that he was cast, as profane, out of the mountain of God. And furthermore that he shall be destroyed, &quot;from the midst of the stones of fire.&quot; So this does not present a dualist worldview, such as that of gnostics. It presents the rebellious entity of satan as being predestined for destruction, but still causing trouble on the earth for a limited time according to the Scriptures. However, as we see in (for instance) the book of Job, first two chapters, his actions can never exceed the bounds that God has placed.

I have actually researched this subject so allow me to say a couple of things.<br><br>The differences between the editions of the TR amounts to little more than background noise. Almost every variant within that family is of the nature of a spelling change, as multiple words in Greek have more than one spelling. It would translate the same regardless. Less frequently, it will be some other kind of change, such as an untranslateable (if present) definite particle being present or absent, or a grammatically equivalent difference in word order, but one that always results in a well constructed sentence either way.<br><br>Now compare that to the difference between the TR itself and something like the Alexandrian manuscripts, which is what many modern versions like the NIV are based on. The text that has been made is unnatural, as it is an agglomeration of several different deficient and non-agreeing texts, but it results in removing about 7% total of the words of the Greek New Testament. About 5% omitted, and another 2% substantially changed. That is equivalent to the entire books of 1 and 2 Peter, approximately, with effects that spread out to virtually every page.<br><br>In Aleph (Cod. Sinaiticus) and B (Cod. Vaticanus) - two of the main manuscripts on which post-KJV translations are based - it is easier to find two consecutive verses in which these two manuscripts differ from each other, than two consecutive verses in which they entirely agree. Furthermore, B does not consider Revelation, Philemon, I and II Timothy, Titus, or Hebrews 9:14-13:25 as part of the Bible. In their place, it adds apocryphal books such as Epistle of Barnabus.<br><br>On one passage (Luke 8:35-44) we notice the following among these minority manuscripts:<br>Aleph omits three readings while inserting two which are found nowhere else<br>B omits 12 words and inserts six readings found nowhere else<br>C omits 4 words and inserts 15<br>D omits 7 words and inserts 5<br><br>Now, a conglomerate text from these, that removes ~15.4 words (in Greek) from every page, stands in stark contrast to the received text, which exhibits remarkable agreement. Yes, there are the occasional obvious typographical variants (which result in an invalid sentence), and some orthographical differences that make no change to the translation within the TR. Almost none affect translation. (I know the few that do).

Put briefly, the Nazi apparatus was not so much a well-functioning machine but an utter mess where expectations of superiors were often left vague. There was not really much coherent legislation to base one&#039;s actions on either so to fill this gap -- Kershaw contents -- the &#039;idea&#039; of Hitler (basically asking oneself &#039;what would ol&#039; Addie do?) served as the basis for much Nazi policy and action.

A nice long paragraph with a logical beginning and end, with branches of thought that flesh out the character or the setting in-between, all of which lead naturally to the next paragraph, demonstrates, to me, that the writer is capable of an exploration of themes and emotions in a more complex way than a writer who lacks long paragraphs. When I look at a new book, and just by flicking through I can see that there are essentially no long paragraphs, with all the paragraphs taking up no more than five lines in an already large font, I feel doubtful about how good the book can be. It makes the impression that the writer never stops to explore something on a deeper level.

All passerby would remark the house empty, but it was not. Less than 20 years on this EarthLem short for Lemuel Augustus Sorodoun was playing at his computer. A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. <br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. Nothing but the codified New England berms on Janice lane. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle. He could hold onto her large ears as she bound o&#039;er hill and river. Behold! Ptolemist! That which lies under brow unbeaten. Massing with the stones and the leaves.

She wore a polished stone threaded on a thin silver chain and certain movements made it knock against her sternum. The knock rang through the other sounds. When I first saw her I thought, If I grip you hard you&#039;ll bruise violet. I tried but she had no give at all. My fingertips ached for two days after that.<br><br>The context in which we first started talking was the network of paths that ran between the buildings on campus. The paths were lit at night by solar-powered lamps studded in the soil. The lamps were spaced too far, so the paths were more dark than not. They covered miles in total and she knew them well. She must have walked them alone many times. But she devised false shortcuts, and selected the moment, below an unmarked breezeblock building or on the far edge of the artificial lake, to turn to me and say, I believe we&#039;re lost.<br><br>After university we lived together off campus and getting lost was harder. So we found online a place you could rent for a weekend. The woman who owned it was called Greta and she gave us a code for the gate. I repeated the code in my head while we stopped for petrol, while we waited for sheep to clear the road, while she found a stone wall to pee behind.<br><br>But when it came to punching it in the buttons felt like loose teeth. Eventually Greta was there with a flashlight, her face behind the bars of the gate. Chunky pearls gripped the flab of her neck. She owned the land right up to the oaks it was now too dark to see. She unlocked and said, Is your friend arriving later? I turned round and my girlfriend wasn&#039;t there.<br><br>She showed up ten minutes later, wet, when Greta was explaining the rug to me. Above us was the high space of black timber and we stood in the middle of the rug&#039;s vegetal pattern. Beyond the rug my dripping girlfriend darkened flagstones. She grinned too wide and said, So warm in here! When Greta was facing the wine fridge, my girlfriend put a wet hand on the back of my neck and her mouth close to my ear and said, I&#039;ve made a discovery.<br><br>[Unfinished.

It was nice he thought, much nicer than anywhere he\u2019d ever get to live. Luxurious, secluded, extravagant enough to make the richest men feel drunk with power to own such a solar system. He even noticed himself getting off a bit at the thought of being that lucky man. This was the same reaction that could be expected of any of his coworkers, but unlike him they couldn\u2019t be bothered to actually bring their bodies over to see the site in person before the construction was nearing completion. He was the opposite way, he could see no good reason to travel all the way over there just to torture himself with envy by stroking his fingers along the perfectly carved, ever so slightly curved pure rubidian walls. But he liked to go over there in person before construction had begun, see the design virtually through his headset, and then take it off to reveal the natural scenery of the solar system, including all the planets and other objects whose demolition he was in charge of overseeing. Generally a fresh hire would board a cargo ship to see the celestial demolition in person maybe about three or four times, during their first few months. Certainly in awe at first, but quickly becoming less and less impressed with each visit, eventually resigning to simply glance occasionally at the automated machinery from a screen that blends into the background of the office. But after over 3 years with the company, in spite of being terribly disinterested in anything or anyone else the place had to offer, he would almost always take the opportunity to watch these things in person. He understood why others would be less interested, most of the locales they worked did look strikingly similar, but he thought that was a short sighted way to see things. See even if you can\u2019t distinguish between them at first glance, each and every one of them contain within their naturally accumulated composition a unique story stretching so far back in time and making him feel so tiny and insignificant that he felt the urge to punish himself. Not for any reason related to the morality of destroying a natural beauty, that would be done wether it was him or another cog in his place, he didn\u2019t feel he had much of anything to do with it and so hardly gave the question any thought. What he thought he needed to be punished for was his reaction to it, or lack thereof.

My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird!

He spends a long time justifying his mathematical phenomenology. He also doesn&#039;t equate Faustian simplistically with racially or culturally Germanic. Faustian civilization really begins with the Middle Ages, not with the many centuries of Indo-European and proto-Germanic migrations before that. <br><br>Ancient astronomy studied the heavens as visible geometry, as ciphers for tangible (superlunary and &quot;rarer&quot; but still concrete, <br>&quot;crystalline&quot;) things. Faustian (European) civilization platonized the heavens and turned them into completely abstract mathematical space, infinitely expansive and infinitely divisible Cartesian-Newtonian mathematical space. Later Faustian civilization abstracted from all geometrical concreteness with modern abstract algebra and the discovery of completely unintuitive, unintuitable Einsteinian space. Check out &quot;From the Closed World to the Open Universe&quot; by Koyre. The ancients could never imagine a truly infinite manifold or plane. They referred EVERYTHING back to concrete intuitive geometry. Algebra and arithmetic for them were only ciphers of actual intuitive, constructible geometrical objects, whereas the reverse is the case for us moderns. Even when they thought of infinities that appear strikingly modern to us, they turn out on closer analysis to be highly physical and concrete &quot;picturings&quot; of infinity. I would argue that the Greeks even had trouble with infinitesimals, whereas we think intuitively in them at least since Cartesian corpuscularism and the Keplerian-Galilean-Newtonian perfection of classical mechanics. Ancient physics seems &quot;coarse&quot; and qualitative to us, whereas ours is &quot;pristinely&quot; quantitative. Why is this? Because there are no &quot;leaps&quot; in it, no harsh and uneven grades of being, as there are in the old Great Chain of Being concept (see Lovejoy). We think in infinitesimals and infinities reflexively. Again, look at Koyre&#039;s book. <br><br>Spengler is definitely onto something although as usual it&#039;s presented in an unsystematic and visionary way. The transition to abstract spatiality did happen and it&#039;s fascinating to think it had something to do with something innate to European (as opposed to Classical) civilization. He also usefully draws attention to the radical discontinuities between different civilizations, emphasizing (as Werner Jaeger also does) that the Classical is not simply the first &quot;stage&quot; in the development of European thought but is something both inevitably close to us and insurmountably far from us when we try to really meld with it. <br><br>Much of what Spengler says also overlaps with the characteristically German conception that the Greeks were more &quot;embodied,&quot; more sensuous, more in touch or in tune with nature, more en-worlded, etc. They had a naive fusion with nature. This is Hegelian but ultimately it&#039;s drawing from a tradition as old as Joachim de Fiore&#039;s three ages, which itself goes back to older mythic ideas of ages of fallenness and redemption.", "time": 1674685631, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21572348, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)17:27:42", "name": "Strange Love", "com": "<a href=\"#p21572301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21572301</a><br><br>The &quot;Apollonian&quot; does look for higher meaning inside &quot;itself&quot; ... the &quot;Faustian&quot; is kinda cut off from this route and instead seeks it in the infinite surrounding it.", "time": 1674685662, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21572350, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)17:27:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21572301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21572301</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germanics never discover astronomy</span><br>What about every western astronomer post copernicus?

The best purge is painful, like all medicines of a drastic nature,\u2014the purge which hales to punishments by means of justice linked with vengeance, crowning the vengeance with exile or death: it, as a rule, clears out the greatest criminals when they are incurable and cause serious damage to the State. A milder form of purge is one of the following kind:\u2014when, owing to scarcity of food, people are in want, and display a readiness to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the wealthy,\u2014then the lawgiver, regarding all such as a plague inherent in the body politic, and in the friendliest possible way, will say they should be (as it will be tactfully put) &quot;transferred to a colony.&quot;", "filename": "1671677312762670", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 501, "h": 800, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674702084598381, "time": 1674702084, "md5": "fChRHJ9NLDWtslwQo5OTuA==", "fsize": 344945, "resto": 21573207}, {"no": 21573222, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:02:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Since, however, our present object is political excellence, it is the natural character of a country and its legal arrangements that we are considering; so that we differ from most people in not regarding mere safety and existence as the most precious thing men can possess, but rather the gaining of all possible goodness and the keeping of it throughout life. This too, I believe, was stated by us before.<br><br>Cronos was aware of the fact that no human being (as we have explained) is capable of having irresponsible control of all human affairs without becoming filled with pride and injustice; so, pondering this fact, he then appointed as kings and rulers for our cities, not men, but beings of a race that was nobler and more divine, namely, daemons. He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them. In like manner the God, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of daemons who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Cronos, as tradition paints it, and order both our homes and our States in obedience to the immortal element within us, giving to reason&#039;s ordering the name of \u201claw.\u201d But if an individual man or an oligarchy or a democracy, possessed of a soul which strives after pleasures and lusts and seeks to surfeit itself therewith, having no continence and being the victim of a plague that is endless and insatiate of evil,\u2014 if such an one shall rule over a State or an individual by trampling on the laws, then there is (as I said just now) no means of salvation.", "filename": "1671677819656849", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 548, "h": 746, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674702177367127, "time": 1674702177, "md5": "9xFs0rzLQc7J/g5jwGZ5tw==", "fsize": 121507, "resto": 21573207}, {"no": 21573226, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:04:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Let us, then, speak to them thus:\u2014\u201cO men, that God who, as old tradition tells, holdeth the beginning, the end, and the center of all things that exist, completeth his circuit by nature&#039;s ordinance in straight, unswerving course. With him followeth Justice, as avenger of them that fall short of the divine law; and she, again, is followed by every man who would fain be happy, cleaving to her with lowly and orderly behavior; but whoso is uplifted by vainglory, or prideth himself on his riches or his honors or his comeliness of body, and through this pride joined to youth and folly, is inflamed in soul with insolence, dreaming that he has no need of ruler or guide, but rather is competent himself to guide others,\u2014such an one is abandoned and left behind by the God, and when left behind he taketh to him others of like nature, and by his mad prancings throweth all into confusion: to many, indeed, he seemeth to be some great one, but after no long time he payeth the penalty, not unmerited, to Justice, when he bringeth to total ruin himself, his house, and his country.\u201d<br><br>What conduct, then, is dear to God and in his steps? One kind of conduct, expressed in one ancient phrase, namely, that \u201clike is dear to like\u201d when it is moderate, whereas immoderate things are dear neither to one another nor to things moderate. In our eyes God will be \u201cthe measure of all things\u201d in the highest degree\u2014a degree much higher than is any \u201cman\u201d they talk of. He, then, that is to become dear to such an one must needs become, so far as he possibly can, of a like character; and, according to the present argument, he amongst us that is temperate is dear to God, since he is like him, while he that is not temperate is unlike and at enmity,\u2014as is also he who is unjust, and so likewise with the rest, by parity of reasoning. On this there follows, let us observe, this further rule,\u2014and of all rules it is the noblest and truest,\u2014that to engage in sacrifice and communion with the gods continually, by prayers and offerings and devotions of every kind, is a thing most noble and good and helpful towards the happy life, and superlatively fitting also, for the good man; but for the wicked, the very opposite.

The horde of Iriqotans advanced slowly over their slain brethren, cautious of the Northman&#039;s barbarian ferocity. Out from the crowd stepped their aged chief, his lined, square face was a block of granite and his withered hand held the end of a chain leading from the crowd. &quot;You red men insult me by presenting this old crow as champion, I will snap his limbs like kindling and crush his brittle skull if I fight him. Are the rest of you women that you send your grandfathers to fight for you?&quot; but the chief pulled his chain to reveal the real champion: a gigantic, dark man with the negro features of the Massai Impi, he was far from his savanna home. The behemoth must have been over seven feet, Styr knew his enemy would have longer reach so he&#039;d have to get in close. The gigantic creature carried a spear, a foot taller than itself, and thrust it aloft with a savage arm, gripping it with such tribal fury that every sinew shewed, then uttered an animal bellow that came straight from the deepest recesses of its half-human ancestry.<br><br>While the beast was still screaming, Styr threw one tomahawk which spun in the air and bit into the enemy&#039;s wrist, half severing the clawed hand which dangled and spurted blood as the creature&#039;s scream turned from fury to pain. Styr sprinted in and instantly closed the gap, the giant scraping at his back with fingernails sharpened to pointed talons. Styr ignored the searing pain and arced his arm upwards in a perfect swing, the second tomahawk crunching through the savage&#039;s chin, splitting it in two and scattering sharpened teeth on the ground. The beast gripped Styr by the throat and flung him into the crowd of whooping braves, Styr collided with one then hit the stone floor painfully, managing to half-roll into a crouched position for counter attack. The braves immediately formed a circle around the combatants, their headdresses bobbing with primitive excitement at the spectacle. Styr gripped a flat rock from the ground and let his northern instincts take over as the black giant charged. He ducked and rolled to the side, then while the beast turned he charged himself, first making a dummy throw of the axe as a distraction, and threw the rock with enough force that it split in two and cut an ugly gash in the brute&#039;s head. He followed with a sideways strike towards the abdomen which was caught by the enemy&#039;s great hand. The black held the tomahawk in a vice grip, cutting its own palm so the dark blood flowed onto the slate floor. <br><br>[Continued next month in Adventures of Abomination #148]", "filename": "j8p814aujfy41", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 625, "h": 625, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674678610675382, "time": 1674678610, "md5": "r/KSN9RQx5PUu2zjhRSm3g==", "fsize": 43473, "resto": 21569722}, {"no": 21571997, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)15:33:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21571932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21571932</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re probably seeing a bifurcation of the species into literate and illiterate.</span><br>I 100% agree with this and their emotional responses to it, by anonymous troll logic, must mean we&#039;re right and over the target.

It&#039;s clearly a compilation from earlier traditions.", "time": 1674600310, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568494, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:26:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This faggot <a href=\"#p21567805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21567805</a>", "time": 1674602809, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568496, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)18:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21566525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21566525</a><br><a href=\"#p21566642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21566642</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;filtered by the undescended soul</span>", "time": 1674602859, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568669, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)19:15:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Me, and fuck all of you.", "time": 1674605707, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568738, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)19:30:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21568669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21568669</a><br><a href=\"#p21566024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21566024</a><br>why are you guys pretending to be me?", "time": 1674606608, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568771, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)19:36:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21568289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21568289</a><br>Some takes are so based that they ruin entire civilizations", "time": 1674606983, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568791, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)19:40:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565895</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leibniz</span><br>No", "time": 1674607202, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21568876, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)20:03:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565672</a><br>Nietzsche ofc", "time": 1674608584, "resto": 21565672}, {"no": 21570419, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)05:17:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565672</a><br>LMAO this guy&#039;s an idiot can&#039;t he see how beautiful life is?

Connelly&#039;s ability to bring a scene to life; his ability to make Harry&#039;s drive to solve the murder believable, and to get me to share that feeling (in the case of this book, through my sympathy with the tragedy of Meadows... the loser who nonetheless &quot;counts&quot; for Harry; and that beautiful, low-key detail of Meadows withholding the hidden pawn ticket despite being tortured). Also, the authenticity that he brings, which I&#039;m sure is the product of his having spent ten years on the crime beat in Los Angeles. There is a realism that Connelly brings to the table that other crime writers mostly lack, the greatest exception being Hammett, and George Higgins, at least in his one great book, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. A couple of others, too, I&#039;m sure, but those two come to mind atm.<br><br>*I don&#039;t think deep thematic content is really Connelly&#039;s strongpoint. The one book I can recall where he really presses hard on that pedal is City of Bones. It&#039;s well done, but the fact he does that sort of thing so rarely is, to my mind, an indicator that it doesn&#039;t come naturally to him.", "time": 1674704660, "resto": 21570924}, {"no": 21573376, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)23:02:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21573335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21573335</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reading for plot only</span><br>I think that says more about you than about Connelly.
