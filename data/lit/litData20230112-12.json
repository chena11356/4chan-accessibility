He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them.

By chance a vanishingly rare phenomena occurs where his car is collides with a momentarily manifesting tear in space-time, completely halting the spin of every atom from the outer layer of the vehicle all the way inside. Including his own. He and the car are completely frozen in time, totally immovable and anchored to the earth below it and possessing a hardness that withstands any force that is applied to it. The incident gains world-wide renown almost instantly. &quot;The Frozen Man&quot; becomes the most famous person on earth. He&#039;s voted Time man of the year. Millions of people flock to the spot where his car is frozen to catch a glimpse of him. The man&#039;s wife and children are obviously devastated by this. The section of the highway is eventually cordoned off and covered by a large hangar, turning it into a giant lab for research, only accessible by authorized scientific delegations, US intelligence, military and the president...but the Frozen Man&#039;s immediate family are also allowed visitation. As years pass, many profound scientific discoveries are made as to the nature of matter. Frozen man&#039;s oldest son becomes the most frequent visitor among his family as wife can no longer bear the pain of seeing him. The son is a bit of a prodigy studies in school and eventually grows up to specialize in plasma physics. He becomes a regular researcher at the facility. He comes up with a novel method to observe the frozen matter and eventually dislodge and capture some particles from it using a particle accelerator. These captured particles were found to be capable of seeding a process to create exotic materials, capable of withstanding astoundingly high levels of heat. At year 20 after the freeze, the son is having a coffee break talking to his dad behind the glass and he notices that his dad&#039;s hand was slightly off of the steering wheel which wasn&#039;t the case. He also observed the beginnings of a squint in his eyes...as if he&#039;s about to flinch. Calling an emergency meeting, the scientists take measurements and discover that the frozen vehicle is in fact accelerating exponentially. They calculate that within 3 days, the car and everything in it will hit an inflection point and very rapidly come out of the freeze. They prepare by clearing a path for the vehicle through the hangar and out to a now abandoned section of the freeway.. With the whole world watching and anticipating on the third day, the car starts rolling forward slowly and then suddenly accelerates to 65 MPH and Frozen Man, who was a split second ago driving on a freeway was now driving inside a giant hangar. He pumps the breaks just as his car exits the end of the hangar in full view of news helicopters. His son, and others run out to the car as he steps out into a world that has left him 20 years behind.", "time": 1673339705, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21505222, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:36:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505219</a><br>This would be the first half of the story.

If he had desired something for me I would have desired it too. Happiness for example or fame. I only had the desires he manifested. But he must have manifested them all. All his desires and needs.

Whatever it was he meant I made off without looking back. Gone from reach of his voice I was gone from his life. Perhaps it was that he desired. There are questions you see and don\u2019t ask yourself. He must have been on his last legs. I on the contrary was far from on my last legs. I belonged to an entirely different generation.

The free or outer hands hung bare. He did not like to feel against his skin the skin of another. Mucous membrane is a different matter. Yet he sometimes took off his glove. Then I had to take off mine. We would cover in this way a hundred yards or so linked by our bare extremities. Seldom more. That was enough for him. If the question were put to me I would say that odd hands are ill-fitted for intimacy. Mine never felt at home in his. Sometimes they let each other go. The clasp loosened and they fell apart.

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective.

His parents driveway empty. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead.

But I think I will leave in &#039;Defeat&#039;. Because I think that first &#039;Defeat&#039; in the line &#039;Defeat, defeat me.&#039; is important for referring to the character&#039;s conception of Defeat he has created. Not defeat the word, but a figure of Defeat itself. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m explaining it properly, but I suppose it is a personification of defeat, like how there is death, but then there is also Death. <br><br>On your suggestion <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; change &quot;and I will be defeated, defeated as soon as I finish this drink&quot; to &quot;and I will be defeated as soon as I finish this drink&quot;,</span><br><br>That&#039;s an option worth considering, but I think it is stylistically more interesting to have the repetition of defeat. In contrast, your aforementioned cutting of &quot;it is in, is in my chest&quot;, I thought was a good cut because the phrasing is a little awkward and it interrupted the rhythm. But as you mentioned, you liked the repetition. So if you had any more specific reasons behind why some repetitions worked and these one&#039;s didn&#039;t, I would love to hear it. Although I think I know the problem is that the repetition is probably to repetitive. Who would have guessed?<br><br>Another point of yours that I would like to discuss is your perception of &#039;post-incel&#039;. The concept of incel crossed my mind when I was writing, and it is exactly what I wanted to avoid. Because it comes with misanthropic and hyper-sexual connotations that I think aren&#039;t present in many men that want to be a part of the collective.<br><br>The piece was a proof of concept more than a full story, so regarding his objective, while I don&#039;t think the piece shows it super clearly, this is what I am attempting with the character and would go into more depth in a longer story: <br>The character is self-conscious about his reclusive position in society. He is attempting to become more active in the collective of society. So he goes to the club to join the collective. This requires a defeat of his self-conscious tendencies and identity as an outsider. It requires him to dance. Though it would not solve his problems, this act would be a step in the right direction. Because regardless of what one thinks about the club, there is benefit in being able to dance with others. It proves an ability to exist in a group. But to dance, his self-conscious identity must be overcome by his desire and the infectious atmosphere of the club. If he could overcome his identity by himself, then the story would be about victory. But because he needs his identity to succumb, he must be defeated. But at the end he is still standing by the wall. He has a strength to resist the collective, but that does not bring him the defeat he desires. <br><br>Bit rambly, but this is all rough stuff at the moment.", "time": 1673432595, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21510227, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21504225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21504225</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;been working on my book for 5+ years</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20k words</span>", "filename": "1650466782269", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673433831086904, "time": 1673433831, "md5": "BUr8Lu3RKsvyWg9+CcBG4g==", "fsize": 27960, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21510253, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:51:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505739</a><br>Harassment Architecture is great, if you read it knowing the author is laughing at you for identifying with it.

Just try putting all the religions into one bag and then make for example what is called a history of religions. It\u2019s truly horrific. There is only one true religion, and that religion is Christian. The only thing is to know whether this truth will hold on, whether it will end up able to actually drown us in the meanings spews forth. I\u2019m sure it will be able to because it does have resources. Lots of things are ready-made for these purposes. It will interpret the Book of Revelations. A lot of people have already taken a stab at it. It will unearth correlations between everything. This is its function in fact.<br><br>The analyst on the other hand is another thing entirely. He inhabits a kind of coming-of-age moment. For a short period of time, we caught sight of what the intrusion of the Real really is. The analyst remains tied to this point. He is there like a symptom and can only endure as a symptom. But you shall see, the day will come when humanity will be cured of psychoanalysis. This symptom will eventually be repressed by dint of its being drowned in meaning, religious meaning of course.\u201d<br><br>From this, we can infer that Lacan had considered what effects different religions had on their societies and which one stood out as one providing meaning to all things - which religion was the \u201cintrusion of the Real?\u201d<br><br>Paganism did not generally deal in meaning, and pagan societies were typically inspired more by honor and glory and the like than anything more deeply real. Philosophical religions (e.g. Buddhism) had their merits, but were entirely too human and mundane: his work in psycho-analysis had convinced him that the Real lies beyond and behind, and would not be discovered by a mere teacher.<br><br>That leaves the revealed religions: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, each of which had its prophets claiming outside knowledge. Presumably, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were too narrow, being too deeply rooted in culture.

It would be a serious problem if he took at face value the idea that more women going to college than men means they are more educated (in the deep and edifying sense) rather than more credentialed (in the sense that college itself has changed and become a way to push debt, and occupations that never required degrees in the past have since professionalised and began to demand degrees).<br><br>There is also the increasing ideological content of degree programs. Training people in useful idiocy is what the Soviets did when they chose to gut their education system. It would be fascinating if the West were doing something similar, but from the angle of maintaining debt driven economic growth at all costs. An important question here is whether the lack of men in college might actually be a signal of the ill health of colleges, rather than the social decline of men.", "time": 1673522312, "resto": 21514419}, {"no": 21515127, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:17:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;OPs dominate public acts of masturbation</span>", "time": 1673525842, "resto": 21514419}, {"no": 21515135, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)07:23:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514996</a><br>Blah blah blah.

Corey (Daniel Abraham &amp; Ty Franck)<br><br>I&#039;ve seen complaints that the second book is too much of the same. There&#039;s a lot of structural similarity and although the content itself differs that may not be enough. I don&#039;t mind that much about between book repetition, but I do have concerns about within-in book repetition. Despite these similarities this one has more silly moments, which isn&#039;t what I prefer in this context, but they don&#039;t affect much. The plot is unknown forces trying to provoke a war between Earth and Mars, protomolecule mishaps, subterfuge, investigation, and political metaphors. This series isn&#039;t so much about the plot for me, which could deliver far more on what one might presume it to eventually be about, as it is about the characters and how they make it through the various situations they find themselves in.<br><br>As for the viewpoints, I hope you didn&#039;t mind Miller because they have all similarities with him. Particularly in that they&#039;re traumatized, obsessed, and prone to recklessness bordering on self-destructiveness. James Holden retains his savior complex and sense of moral superiority that leads to the occasional narcissistic and paranoid moments. Chrisjen Avasarala is the UN deputy undersecretary who treats everything as a political game. Roberta (Bobbie) Draper is a traumatized Martian marine seeking revenge and has an especially imposing stature. Praxidike Meng is a botanist who is divorced from his wife and arguably reality, whose only goal is to find his missing four year old daughter. He&#039;s one of my least liked characters in the series, book and show. I like the female cast of characters considerably more overall. In the TV series anyway, though it seems that it&#039;ll be the same here.<br><br>My primary complaint this time is the chronology. There are seemingly conflicting statements about how much time has passed since the first book. That may be because of how unclear the durations of their space travels often are. This is one of my most common complaints, though in most cases I let it slide by without much notice. I also felt that child prostitution, which is only mentioned, was an inordinate focus. The first thought of almost every character seems to go in that direction when thinking of children, especially the aforementioned missing daughter. The population dynamics are so dumb that I try to entirely ignore them. None of this does much to damper my enjoyment, though in the context of a book that I liked less they would.<br><br>The differences from the show so far aren&#039;t of any major consequence that I can remember. Bobbie is different, mostly in her sexual effect on men and how they respond to her, which more than flirts with fetishization. There was one point where I was surprised because it didn&#039;t happen in the TV series, but it turned out not to matter that much, which was disappointing. Overall, I still rather enjoy it.<br><br>Rating: 4/5", "filename": "Caliban&#039;s War", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 779, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673499638118757, "time": 1673499638, "md5": "7i334J27ZxbLRPS+qBPZzw==", "fsize": 90780, "resto": 21510242, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21514180, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:12:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514141</a><br>updooted", "time": 1673500377, "resto": 21510242}, {"no": 21514213, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:22:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21512701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21512701</a><br>His best imo is Transmigration of Timothy Archer.

And as a person of faith, I also believe in the power of God to guide us on our path in life. To me, these two beliefs are not mutually exclusive. To me, these two beliefs intersect in the idea of laissez faire capitalism. The idea that every individual has inherent rights to life, liberty, and property.<br><br>You see, capitalism is a system of choice. It is a system in which individuals are free to make their own decisions about how to use their resources and talents, and to pursue their own goals and aspirations. It is a system in which people are free to succeed or fail based on their own efforts and abilities.<br><br>And what could be more in line with the principles of God than the idea of free will and personal responsibility? After all, isn&#039;t God the ultimate source of all freedom? did he not give us the ability to make our own choices, and to take responsibility for the consequences of those choices? Indeed, what makes moral choices moral is that they are what they are, choices. And did he not create us in his image? In creating man in his own image, did he not give man the gifts of creativity also?<br><br>So when I look at free market capitalism, I see a system that reflects the values and principles of God. A system that allows people to fully express their God given talents and abilities, and to use them to improve the lives of others. Indeed, it is a system that aligns with the golden rule to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; by recognizing that when we take care of ourselves, we are better equipped to help and serve others. So in short, capitalism and my faith in the Lord are inseparable. Free market capitalism is not only the most practical system because it is the most efficient, but the most moral one as it enables things to be the way God intended, giving me and every individual as a whole the ability to choose. surely, it is no coincidence that communism, the antithesis of capitalism, has implimented mandatory athiesm in every major country it was in. It is because communism is an enemy of the Lord, and the Lords enemies are my enemies also.", "time": 1673396974, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508240, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:30:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where is that slave?", "time": 1673397053, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508262, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508240</a><br>Woof", "filename": "713defc92cacaa7c39298e6521f04088", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1574, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673397323513976, "time": 1673397323, "md5": "jVfOVOn6QOFSO4FRAFwBaA==", "fsize": 443356, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508264, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:35:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508236</a><br>gr8 b8 m8", "time": 1673397335, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508305, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:45:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508262</a><br>I hate myself for being turned on by this", "time": 1673397910, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508329, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:49:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what it is what it do", "time": 1673398183, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508531, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)20:42:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I lost my larpring capabilities.

He was born to the Ghifar clan, found to the western south of Medina.[8] Abu Dharr was apparently typical of the early converts to Islam, described by Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri as &quot;young men and weak people&quot;.[9] They were a part of the Ghifar clan of the Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat tribe, part of the Kinana tribes, which also included the Quraysh tribe of Muhammad. Popular accounts of Abu Dharr[10] say that his tribe lived by pillaging caravans, but that he preferred to live a poor but honest life as a shepherd. Having heard the contention that a new prophet had arisen in Mecca, Abu Dharr and his brother travelled to Mecca to find the prophet. The young seeker converted instantly and rushed out to declare his new faith in front of the Kaaba, which at that time was a pagan temple. He was beaten for his religious belief.

It&#039;s fantasy and they are hunting a lich. Therefore you can logically assume they are outside. The dry branches snapping confirms this. The moonlight is a nice detail to add as moonlight usually confers a sense of mystery and awe in people. Random berries staining armor, mud caking boots, not so much. Sometimes less is more. You have to remember that usually it is the reader that does most of the work. They take the gaps you leave and fill them with the unbridled power of their imagination. They can literally see and feel the branches and the moon, and anything else they feel inspired to conjure up as you set the scene. If you describe nearly every aspect of what&#039;s happening, then there&#039;s nothing left for the reader to occupy their minds with. It becomes boring and dull. You cannot compete with the ever shifting tides of the imagination. Also you have to keep up the pace. Nothing really happened in 11 sentences, just exposition dump.

On a non-biological standpoint, it doesn&#039;t make sense to love someone unconditionnally all their life. Okay, it&#039;s easy to love your baby or your seven year old kid who adores you, but what about loving your 30 year old scruffy and rude kid who is like a stranger to you? I have barely interacted with my parents after the age of 10 and I&#039;m absolutely convinced they would trade their lives to save mine if they had the choice. Why is family love seemingly everlasting and above logic? If the answer is biology, it feels so damn cheap. What&#039;s the point of getting on high horses and being proud of loving your children if the only love you have towards them has been programmed into your brain? It&#039;s like some kind of wet robot being proud of accomplishing the most basic it&#039;s been given. I myself am a victim of this. It&#039;s so damn infuriating that &#039;loving&#039; is really never something you choose.

In so doing, you find that he becomes more ignorant, ignorant of the nature of his problem. Travis\u2019s problem is the same as the existential hero\u2019s, that is, should I exist? But Travis doesn\u2019t understand that this is his problem, so he focuses it elsewhere: and I think that is a mark of the immaturity and the youngness of our country. We don\u2019t properly understand the nature of the problem, so the self-destructive impulse, instead of being inner-directed, as it is in Japan, Europe, any of the older cultures, becomes outer-directed. The man who feels the time has come to die will go out and kill other people rather than kill himself. There\u2019s a line in Yakuza which says, \u201cWhen a Japanese cracks up, he\u2019ll close the window and kill himself; when an American cracks up, he\u2019ll open the window and kill somebody else.\u201d That\u2019s essentially how the existential hero changes when he becomes American.

I&#039;ve never thought about this before, but I do have some experience with -STJs, and seeing as I&#039;m an INTJ, perhaps I can help. <br><br>First off, an INFJ may have the most difficult time of all writing for an ESTJ in my opinion. For reasons I won&#039;t go into here, I believe your type represses the dominant function of the ESTJ, Te, more than any other function. Conversely, the ESTJ does the same. Ni, your and my dominant, is their most repressed function - just like the ESFJ. With that in mind it might be helpful for you to think of a sort of cloud of other types which fluidly relate to the ESTJ and which might be easier for you to comprehend the perspective of. <br><br>On the one hand you have the following: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ESTP - alike in preference for thinking and extroverted judgement, both repress their feelings to the point of not noticing - ESTJs less so, thus more driven by an undercurrent of feeling heavily rooted in a Te-Fi &quot;objective, generally common-sensical&quot; morality</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISTP - their mirror - both are driven to act quickly and efficiently with no frills. The ISTP tends more towards doing this with a stylish and idiosyncratic eye due to hyper-repressed Fi, while the ESTJ, repressing Ni is striving for insight and manifestation of a longterm vision (the 4-7 link Fi-Ni). As with all types, this will be best viewed through the lens of their 2-5 function link. Si-Ti. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISTJ - possibly unhelpful for you, I&#039;m not sure. The ISTJ, sister type of the ESTJ, stuggles with Ne-Fe the relationship of Fe to the immediate big picture, and the micro-interconnections of the social sphere to the big picture. The ESTJ struggles less with this, and in fact, though not being much better at it than the ISTJ in certain regards, almost seems to pride themselves on it. I believe it is the nature of our weaker functional links to take on this aspirational nature and in so doing, orient our dominant functions to those domains. Like the ISTJ, ESTJs like dead-pan, punchy humor, generally.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ENFP - They share all functions with an ENFP, in some ways it may be useful to imagine ENFP, ENFJ, ESTP, ESTJ as one group to get a sense for these extroverted types. Regardless, like an ENFP, they hold strong convictions and will, unlike an ENFP, try to fulfill the role of these convictions stoically, stolidly - as opposed to like a firecracker or a whip. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;INFP - I find ESTJs to be most similar to INFPs in how they enjoy company. Again, these two types share all the same preference of cognitive function in a different order, but the weaknesses of the INFP are the strengths of the ESTJ and vice versa. Beyond that, they are quite similar. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ESFJ and ISFJ - these may be the most useful for you, being Fe-Ti users with Si-Ne preference, but I am an INTJ. Explaining Fe types to an INFJ would be comical. Fe-Se is my weakest link, thus all INTJs tend to have a lot to say about Ne-Fe via Te (which this entire post could amount to, no doubt). </span><br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1673426613, "resto": 21509298}, {"no": 21509875, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)03:47:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509861</a><br>In summary, ESTJs seem to like clear archetypal characters who lean towards action.

All science relies on labelling and categorization. It is a necessary, if sometimes overused process. People hear these MBTI labels and buck against them instinctually like a stallion being corralled and bridled, but taking the time to comprehend the nature of the processes and their interrelations to one another will alleviate this reaction. Most simply do not. This is why I say to look into the cognitive functions. It isn&#039;t about predicting your life path. It is about comprehending the machine (i.e. any person). It is about apprehending the mechanics behind a sentence or a metaphor even. It is about being able to look at someone&#039;s writing, infer a person&#039;s type, and have their internal processes take on greater life within the mind&#039;s eye. For instance, you may have noticed, but not probably, INTJ authors have a tendency to layer metaphor back to back. Rand, Sartre, Nietzsche, they all do it. Do you know why? I do. I do it as well, but hadn&#039;t noticed until I saw it in Rand and Satre, and couldn&#039;t explain the phenomenon until comprehending functional links with the aid of an ENTP friend of mine. I won&#039;t explain it here - only mentioning. It would probably need a 3000 character post on its own. I&#039;m only saying this to illustrate a point: there is an entire dimension of every human subject you encounter - whether via art or in person, which is knowable, comprehensible, and examinable for which Jung and Myers-Briggs has provided the keys. Anyone sufficiently intelligent and dedicated can pick them up. <br><br>Now - I don&#039;t know or care what it means to be a Virgo-Dragon (perhaps because I&#039;m a Scorpio-Rabbit; whatever that means), but we&#039;ve disproven that assumption of eternally recurring rectitude today.

rarely say this buzzword meme phrase, but nice cope. Those restrictions were part and parcel of the metapolitical framing of the war. &quot;All&#039;s fair in love and war&quot; is a phrase for a reason. So is &quot;war is politics by other means,&quot; and so is its inverse. This isn&#039;t 1685, we aren&#039;t fighting cabinet wars. All 20th century war is assymmetrical and self-consciously so. Vietnam played the possibilities of its situation perfectly and won at the strategic level fair and square. <br><br>It&#039;s no surprise that minor nations like Vietnam can&#039;t compete with industrial juggernauts like the Cold War era USA, one of the two remaining superpowers and geopolitical hegemons on the planet. For the USA to say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t drop our thousands of nukes on every single rice farmer, because then international opinion would have turned on us and our tactical victory in Vietnam would have been geostrategically pyrrhic!!&quot; is pathetic. Vietnam fought an incredible war using every single means at its disposal and proved that the pawns can outmaneuver the queens on the board of realpolitik. Vietnam&#039;s victory was so incredible that it&#039;s philosophically significant, it&#039;s a modern Thermopylae, Marathon, or Salamis. Who cares that the Persians burnt Athens? Does anyone even remember that? No, they remember Thermopylae, Marathon, and Salamis. <br><br>To say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t disregard all metapolitical factors!! if we could have done total mobilization and destroyed our geopolitical hegemonic position and caused revolution on the home front, we could have had more tanks than you!! you had a worse K:D ratio!!!&quot; is childish and shows a lack of understanding of war.

But in addition, since here is some broad cultural agreement on the notion of modernity being a kind of crisis, reading older workks of math and science offer an opportunity to grapple with their development and increasingly important role in culture and politics. For example, Vieta is read in sequence with some equations by Diophantus and followed up with Descartes&#039; Geometrie to see how arithmetic comes to treat geometrical quantities and magnitudes.

For Nietzsche, Enlightenment Now, though it regularly pays lip service to the ramshackle, reversal-prone nature of progress, serves to conceal the empirical fact of cognitive ecology, that we remain, for all our enlightened noise-making to the contrary, animals bent on minimizing discrepancies.

Nietzsche is very often always looking forward to the future, and in many ways it precludes the present being a rather botched but necessary part of it. there is no &quot;slave bad, master good&quot; type of thinking, though he obviously lavishes the master morality at the expense of the slave&#039;s, it is of necessity since in his timeline, the slaves have largely won, obscuring the master morality that predated it.<br><br>it&#039;s okay. you&#039;ve been filtered. you just need to pick it up again after reading the parts that make some of his ideas more legible. but if you&#039;re bent on reading it badly, i think you might benefit more from just putting it down. more than anyone else, he himself knows he&#039;s not for everyone. he willingly misleads so that people who weren&#039;t meant for him never get much closer to his actual ideas.", "time": 1673509195, "resto": 21513454}, {"no": 21514588, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)02:59:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21513454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21513454</a><br>WTP follows from Kant, oddly enough. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATY<wbr>YMZQCbYo&amp;list=PLeKqw0EgTxgcrETROSlQ<wbr>tajSKqLEwgpOe&amp;index=6<br><br>tl;dr Read the Genealogy of Morals, then Frederick Beiser&#039;s German Idealism history, then return to BGE.", "time": 1673510361, "resto": 21513454}, {"no": 21514874, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)05:24:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514177</a><br>Yeah, he contradicts himself.

The reason of this is that you cannot undo an experience. You cannot cut off a man or a society from their past, and the world of Christendom has had the experience of the Faith. When it moves away from the Faith to return to Paganism again it is not doing the same thing, not producing the same emotions, not passing through the same process, not suffering the same reactions, as the old Paganism did, which was moving towards the Faith. It is one thing to go south from the Arctic towards the civilized parts of Europe; it is quite another thing to go north from the civilized parts of Europe to the Arctic.

The trouble is that you are not yourself familiar with Aquinas, but only with summaries of his arguments as presented by &#039;people&#039;. Who are these people you&#039;re referring to, by the way? Aquinas was not particularly concerned with natural theology, which is a part of philosophy really; the Summa is not an attempt to demonstrate the existence of God from naturally observed principles. Rather, since that truth is clearly observable, Aquians uses it as the starting point for the Summa, which is really a demonstration and summary of almost the entirety of Theology--a science which, in treating of higher things than philosophy, is a higher science than philosophy. Furthermore, as Aquinas explains, there are two senses to the word faith--the sense most are familiar with today is the notion of a strongly held opinion, but this is really the second sense. The first and more proper sense of the word is to place trust or confidence in someone or something--after all, Fide is the very root of the word con-fid-ence--with faith. Having faith in God is more properly believing God than it is believing that God exists. I know that if I drop an apple, it will fall; if I have faith in gravity, is that some speculative opinion that gravity exists? The Faith with which Aquinas treats, and of which scripture speaks is that first meaning of the word, less commonly understood today--believing God. That is, in knowing that God is all good and therefore cannot deceive nor be deceived, we must have a perfect confidence--we must have faith--in all that God communicates to man. This is faith properly so called. And because we can be sure of all that God reveals, we can be sure of all necessary conclusions drawn from revelation. The study of these conclusions and apparent conclusions is the science of Theology. The &#039;leap of faith&#039; as you describe it is a novelty coined by Kierkegaard which has no place in actual Catholic theology. It is debatable whether Kierkegaard&#039;s writings are orthodox. No &#039;leap of faith&#039; is necessary, and neither Thomas nor his adherents would ever suggest so. Of course, if you do not trust a man, you will not trust what he says.

There is no faith required for this, just analysis of the arguments given. The same arguments are applicable to many different religions, as far as only the existence of such God is concerned. The identity of God of classical theism with any particular deity is different matter. Its not really possible to say with absolute certainty that God of any religion is the God of classical theism, since most religions depend on some form of divine revelation. You can, however, make a probable argument based on various religious scriptures that this or that religion better approaches what has been proved(if it has been proved) to be logically necessary.

If the purely actual actualizer were imperfect in any way, it<br>would have some unactualized potential, which, being purely<br>actual, it does not have.<br>29. So, the purely actual actualizer is perfect.<br>30. For something to be less than fully good is for it to have a<br>privation\u2014 that is, to fail to actualize some feature proper to it.<br>31. A purely actual actualizer, being purely actual, can have no<br>such privation.<br>32. So, the purely actual actualizer is fully good.<br>33.

Any potential that is actualized is either actualized by the<br>purely actual actualizer or by a series of actualizes which terminates in the purely actual actualizer.<br>35. So, all power derives from the purely actual actualizer.<br>36. But to be that from which all power derives is to be omnipotent.<br>37. So, the purely actual actualizer is omnipotent.<br>38. Whatever is in an effect is in its cause in some way, whether<br>formally, virtually, or eminently (the principle o f proportionate causality).<br>39.

For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal\u2014 to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.<br><br>I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.<br><br>\u201cTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles \u2026 \u201d (Shakespeare)<br><br>And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal.

In arguing i&#039;ve raised the aspect of pair-bonding as differentiating non-procreative sex between spouses from promiscuous sex between strangers, but a Catholic would not agree that pair-bonding is the Ends of sexuality. Non-procreative sex is understood, by a Thomist, as innately and INDIRECTLY frustrating procreation. A Catholic would say, I believe, that when you engage in non-procreative sex you&#039;re engaging in something abjectly lustful, therefore, you&#039;re completely objectifying your partner and thus implicitly denying their dignity as a human person. This has implications for your capacity to properly raise children (i.e, I care about her body, not her), meaning, you&#039;ve indirectly frustrated procreation. To get here, the reasoning is, as you&#039;ve touched on with Aquinas, that sex and sexuality has the telos of procreation and anything short of a genuine attempt to conceive is simply mutual masturbation and serves only to denigrate the dignity of yourself and your partner - because you&#039;re a human person, not a toy, - and in damaging that human dignity you&#039;ve made yourself and your partner less excellent people, and so less excellent parents. <br><br>Of course this does not mean a married couple who used a condom a decade ago are doomed to raise crack babies, rather, if you&#039;ve two identical couples, differing only in engagement with non-procreative sex, the refraining one will be more effective parents insofar as they&#039;re closer to the potential excellence of the human person. Since sexuality is a very major aspect to human life, the misuse of it will have major consequences.

I mean, for Christ&#039;s sake, Fitzgerald had a copy of nightingale stitched to his ribcage and more than once just snagged a phrase or two from it. <br><br>That all said, there just isn&#039;t enough of Keats to warrant such a place.

Sure, he&#039;s considered. But a handful of odes (great may they be), the better parts of Hyperion, and whatever you can take from Endymion does not a number one poet make. I remember in my youth being dumbfounded that everyone praised him so highly, as most of it went over my head and didn&#039;t make a lick of sense. It wasn&#039;t until I delved into the period that the brambles of Keats&#039; dark and deeply metaphysical mind unraveled in their paradoxical way and led to beauty. Reading him alongside contemporaries, not just Shelley and Byron, but John Clare and Felicia Hemens leads to the most graspable and lovable quality of Keats. Not to say those last two are lame poets, Clare especially is interesting to me for some reason (maybe the mental hospitals), but Johnny Keats just bent around himself and his fundamental Grecian predilections in a (and I mean this next word as fully as I can) poetic way. <br><br>So yes, he&#039;s great. The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew, who died on the promise of fruit and all that. Maybe he was even the best of the period, though again, Shelley and Byron (Wordsworth, too, at least his early stuff (love ought to be paid to the origin of things (and let&#039;s not forget Coleridge, Blake, and, God forbid, the women.) are all worth a look. <br><br>I&#039;m rambling, and with all these parenthetical I&#039;m afraid one of you might confuse me for Salinger (or a bored Pynchon), and I do have more to say about another names in the thread (ask me about Joyce.

This is a clique of New York-oriented writers and critics who control much of the literary scene through the influence of the quarterlies and intellectual magazines. All these publications are Jewish-dominated and this particular coterie employs them to make or break writers by advancing or withholding attention. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any conscious, sinister conspiracy on their part\u2014just a determination to see that members of their particular clique rise to the top. Bernard Malamud and Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and Isaac Bashevis Singer and Norman Mailer are all fine writers, but they\u2019re not the only writers in the country, as the Jewish literary Mafia would have us believe. I could give you a list of excellent writers, such as John Knowles and Vance Bourjaily and James Purdy and Donald Windham and Reynolds Price and James Leo Herlihy and Calder Willingham and John Hawkes and William Goyen; the odds are you haven\u2019t heard of most of them, for the simple reason that the Jewish Mafia has systematically frozen them out of the literary scene. Now, mind you, I\u2019m not against any particular group adhering to its own literary values and advancing its own favored authors; such cliques have always existed in American letters. I only object when any one particular group\u2014and it could just as well be Southern, or Roman Catholic, or Marxist, or vegetarian\u2014gets a strangle hold on American criticism and squeezes out anybody who doesn\u2019t conform to its own standards. It\u2019s fine to write about specifically Jewish problems, and it often makes valid and exciting literature\u2014but the people who have other messages to convey, other styles and other backgrounds should also be given a chance. Today, because of the predominance of the Jewish Mafia, they\u2019re not being given that opportunity.

Basically, non-Mormon WASPy America started to use scientific racism to argue that Mormons, though predominantly of British and Scandinavian descent at the time, were literally evolving into a new, but lower race. They associated their religious beliefs/practices (living Abrahamic prophets and polygamy) and their living in a literal desert (Utah wilderness) with the emergence of a new race. They also felt that part of the evolution was a result of Mormons intermarrying with non-whites through their proselytizing efforts worldwide, as well as with the native Americans they preached to, and that the lower clases from Europe were the ones usually drawn to Mormonism. So they were able to explain the mutations partly from these supposed unique racial origins concentrating in one isolated place, and they took the religious practices as evidence of psychological degeneracy, while they saw the desert location as a conditioning agent helping the mutation. The best part of anti-Mormon orientalist scientific racism is that people started to say that Mormons were actually physically starting to look post-white. Here&#039;s my favorite description of supposed Mormon post-whiteness:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an expression of countenance and a style of feature, which may be styled the Mormon expression and style; an expression compounded of sensuality, cunning, suspicion, and smirking self-conceit.

For example, Anglo-Saxon England is cool but not especially interesting IMO. Medieval England is captivating because of its complexity and activity - the wars in France and the crusades are super cool. If you like knights, you should read up on the reign of Richard the Lionheart for sure. He&#039;s like the quintessential knightly prince. After the medieval period, personally I find English history really boring up until the modern period when suddenly shit hits the fan every which way. Victorian era to 1930 is peak history kino.<br>IMO one of the best things about England is reading about the cultural, philosophical etc work that was being done.

But he was not great in either - merely good/very good.<br><br>Back in the day, science was easier, way less specialized, so you could have people like Omar Khayyam and some Ancient Greeks who could be important mathematicians/scientists and also major poets at the same time.<br><br>It&#039;s easier to find &quot;polymathy&quot; when the areas are related. For instance, Jean Cocteau was a major writer, but also a major filmmaker and a fine draughtsman and decent actor. Nietzsche was a major writer, philosopher and an important philologist. Wagner was a major composer, essayist and playwright.<br><br>I also believe that the sciences, outside of biology and others for which careful observation is key, demand somewhat different abilities than those demanded by literature. I believe this because of people like Paul Dirac, who was such a scientific master, yet completely blind to poetry and many other things. Apparently, he even had a hard time learning French as a young boy, though his dad made a conscious effort to teach it to him. Literary kids, on the other hand, will usually learn foreign languages by themselves, with sheer joy, and even invent new ones.<br>With that being said, there is a lot that is similar between literature and, say, mathematics.

If yes, listen to an audiobook right where you are.</span><br><br>Of course there are other places, like driving a car, where you are not really bored, but still have free space in your head to listen to an audiobook, especially on the highway. You could even argue that audiobooks make you more aware of your surrounding, because your whole brain gets stimulated and if something on the road changes, your brain can instantly use all of its capacity to react.<br><br>Personally, I listen to audiobooks on three occasions<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when driving a car</span><br>When I drive, I listen to self help audiobooks. Those audiobooks are great because I re&quot;read&quot; them anyway and even if I forget some things, I will always profit from listening to them, even while driving.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when doing time consuming, but completely easy and safe, stuff</span><br>For example when I cook, clean the room, wash my dick, be an evil sullying coward of the Machiavellian kind, do laundry, or do anything else that is basically just existing, I always have an audiobook nearby. You have no idea how god like audiobooks are. I literally cleaned my whole home without even noticing it while listening to audiobooks. The same with cleaning dishes or cooking. If you hate doing the needful at home, try listening to an audiobook while doing it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;to sleep</span><br>I always had problems to sleep. There were simply so many things going on, that my brain was always occupied with something. Thanks to audiobooks I now sleep whenever I want without problems. I just use the timer in audible to set it to one hour and listen with my whole attention to the fantasy book. If I still can&#039;t sleep after one hour, I simply repeat this process until I sleep. The best part is that if it takes me hours to sleep, I now have read hours of books. And guess what? Since this win/win situation of either reading or sleeping, I barely even scratch the 30 minutes mark before I&#039;m asleep.<br><br>I exclusively use audible and I buy my audiobooks through audible (I only buy really long audiobooks, so I don&#039;t really care. Especially because I love to relistening). I know Youtube has insane amounts of free audiobooks, but the audible app is good enough for me.

For Guenon it is Advaita. For Evola it is Magic of which Alchemy and Yoga are examples par excellence. For Eliade it is shamanism. The lattermost was most accomplished scholar and rose to prominence. We must however question the politics of his move to place shamanism first. Is it most correct? Or most politically correct? Are shamans roots of all religions? Are modern so-called capitalist oppressed civilization avoidant shamanic indigineous cultures today really how all of primitive man lived? Eiade himself says drug use is degenerate shamanism lol. Many scholars nowadays also argue for schismogenetic religious experience and schismogenetic prehistoric culture. Polyphony. Plurality. Multivalence.

But latter led to GD and Thelema and stuff now. Whole mess of masonry illuminati and rosicrucians mixing. But also gnosticism. Christian theosophy. Not to be confused with theosophical society. Tho same milieu as Crowley Evola Guenon etc. Neoplatonism and Hermeticism crosspollinated. Both integral to western proto sciences like alchemy and astrology and magic. Catholic church is ambivalent.

This has diluted the term somewhat and now there is much new age alchemy bullshit on the market but at the same time this is nothing new. Spirituality was always an integral part of such. Also, hermeticism as an esoteric philosophy is much broader than the mere practice of alchemy. Jung used alchemical principles to develop his theories of individuation and create what is now called active imagination. This latter practice he believed was more helpful and healing to the world than all his psychological theories combined -- provided people actually practice it. Which admittedly he worried was more dangerous and difficult. People like Lull also used techniques similar to active imagination to create vast memory palaces and turn themselves into what is almost like, if you&#039;ll pardon my Dune reference, a human mentat, or walking encyclopedia.", "time": 1673270410, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501763, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)10:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Larry Principe is one of the few legit alchemists of our day<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ea<wbr>lYU2ICnU&amp;ab_channel=BytesizeScience<wbr>", "time": 1673279115, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21502845, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)15:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any French anon alchemists here? <br>What do y&#039;all think of Patrick Burensteinas and his Voyage Alchimique and books on alchemy?", "time": 1673296090, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21503849, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)19:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673311605, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21504993, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the Count of St. Germain legit?

Half a century ago there was little doubt in the West. It was a superstition among ignorant ancients that, by certain manipulations, base metals could be turned into gold.<br><br>Then, when Freudian and Jungian ideas began to circulate in Europe, a new, enlightened view of alchemy became fashionable. The alchemists were psychoanalysing themselves. They were sublimating and calcining their own subconscious. Their real aim was not to make gold but to make a non-aberrated man.<br><br>As pursuits of this kind in the Middle Ages overlapped territory which the Church held to be its own, the alchemists had been obliged to conceal what they were really doing behind an apparently lunatic attempt to turn lead into gold.<br><br>Even for the new psychological avant-garde this explanation was not entirely satisfactory, because it was well known that even in the 20th century highly intelligent men in Fez, Cracow, Damascus, Paris and London were currently engaged in attempts to make perfectly tangible yellow gold. They had given up charcoal furnaces and were using Calor gas, but they were manifestly doing something with pots and pans, and not with Egos and Ids.<br><br>Perhaps all external ideas about the nature of alchemy could be put into four views, separately or in combination:<br><br>First View: It is possible to transmute one element into another. One such transmutation is lead or iron into gold. From some unimaginable antiquity, a mighty secret has been handed down which shows how to do this. It is the most closely kept secret in human history.<br><br>Second View: Alchemy is the science of purifying man\u2019s inner nature and arriving at a non-aberrated individual. Such an individual would have, by comparison with ordinary men, certain advanced powers. For political reasons, this exercise had to be concealed in a pseudo-science of metal refining to which the Church would have no reason to object.<br><br>Third View: Metals CAN be transmuted. Lead CAN be turned into gold. An alchemist knows how to do this, and also knows a greater secret. If he is in a certain relation to the crucible in which the process happens, a comparable transmutation takes place in his own common presence. As lead turns into gold in the crucible, the operator\u2019s mind is transformed. He is subjected to something like nuclear radiation. Also, certain chemical by-products in the crucible are capable of being stored and used to either make more gold or to transform other men. Hence legends of \u201cThe Sly Man\u2019s Pill\u201d and the Elixir which Saint-Germain is supposed to have offered Casanova when he was dying.<br><br>Fourth View: An alchemist is a man who knows an immensely powerful method of cleaning the Augean stable of his own subconscious mind. Pushed far enough, this process gives rise to a true soul-body inholding the properties of a different order of things. If this soul-body is directed on the base metals in a certain way (projection), it will accomplish a comparable transmutation in inorganic matter.", "filename": "803E7E06-8AC9-4A31-B6C1-27A448D86814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 251, "h": 400, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673393798699408, "time": 1673393798, "md5": "HxhBJkP2vV1I4eCx+A9+KA==", "fsize": 19795, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21508123, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21506706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21506706</a><br>That somewhat lowers my opinion of Evola sadly.

He died in 1928 at Max Gate, a house he built for himself and his first wife, Emma Lavinia Gifford, in Dorchester, a few miles from his birthplace. Hardy\u2019s youth was influenced by the musicality of his father, a stonemason and fiddler, and his mother, Jemima Hand Hardy, often described as the real guiding star of Hardy\u2019s early life. Though he was an architectural apprentice in London, and spent time there each year until his late 70s, Dorset provided Hardy with material for his fiction and poetry. One of the poorest and most backward of the counties, rural life in Dorset had changed little in hundreds of years, which Hardy explored through the rustic characters in many of his novels. Strongly identifying himself and his work with Dorset, Hardy saw himself as a successor to the Dorset dialect poet William Barnes, who had been a friend and mentor. Moreover, Hardy called his novels the Wessex Novels, after one of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon Britain. He provided a map of the area, with the names of the villages and towns he coined to represent actual places.</span><br><br>Full biography here<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ets/thomas-hardy", "filename": "9c7ae0e739d75e2a8bbea445ef312c54", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 969, "h": 647, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1673447724965114, "time": 1673447724, "md5": "kkzHDRVIyt3Lr3d4/D/yBQ==", "fsize": 110026, "resto": 21510859}, {"no": 21512553, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)17:12:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21510859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21510859</a><br>Bump", "time": 1673475175, "resto": 21510859}, {"no": 21514110, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)23:50:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673499042, "resto": 21510859}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21512421, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)16:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Definitive History of Rome before 48 BC</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Definitive History of Rome after 180 AD</span><br>Goddammit!<br>So what can I read to cover the 228 years in between?", "filename": "imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-8GIw5FCImerUB", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1837, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 185, "tim": 1673472871171524, "time": 1673472871, "md5": "6EfawVhgukqWB8dZ/AwQzQ==", "fsize": 528979, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "definitive-history-of-rome-before-48-bc", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 15, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 14}, {"no": 21512729, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)17:53:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21512421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21512421</a><br>Wait the decline and fall doesn&#039;t cover octavain&#039;s reign or the civil wars??? those events seem relevant desu I know that was the &quot;republic&quot; but still.", "time": 1673477631, "resto": 21512421}, {"no": 21512739, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)17:56:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21512421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21512421</a><br>The Star Wars prequel trilogy (novelizations).", "time": 1673477787, "resto": 21512421}, {"no": 21512744, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)17:57:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21512729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21512729</a><br>It only really covers Commodus&#039; reign onwards.
