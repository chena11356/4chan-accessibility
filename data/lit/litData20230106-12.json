I was 19 and she was 26. She also cheated on her boyfriend with me that night. I wasn&#039;t ugly and had ample opportunity to lose it before then, but I was pretty shy and had chickened out multiple times.<br><br>I still remember the night over 8 years later. I was bar hopping with my friends in the student village. We had gone to at least 3 different places and this was the last stop. I was already insanely drunk that I had lost all sense of shyness and had no second thoughts about anything. I remember going straight to the bar, getting a double vodka red bull, and immediately heading for the dance floor. <br><br>The dance floor had about 15-20 people on it, a lot of them women. There was one curvy, big titted blonde that caught my attention immediately. She also noticed me and we danced alone, in different locations, while making infrequent eye contact. I danced around with a few different women, but my attention and thoughts were on the big titted blonde. Eventually, we made it close to each other and started dancing. At the same time, some other guy, much older than me and Arab looking, was also trying to ween his way in with her.<br><br>Unluckily for him, she chose me and we ended up dancing (modern dancing, not really dancing). We grinded, we kissed, and we talked about something, but I can&#039;t remember what. It was impossible to hear anyone due to the loud music. She then dragged me outside for a cigarette. I did not see any of my friend after this. Before we even finished smoking it, she dragged me to her apartment. I do mean quite literally dragged, she took me by the hand and started walking me to her apartment. Which was nearby. It was shared, so there was some dude in a room across the hallway from hers.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672997909, "resto": 21485696}, {"no": 21486692, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:40:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Despite never having sex or touching a pussy before, I played with her pussy and made her cum several times. She then demanded to get fucked and put a condom on my dick. I fucked the living life out of her in different positions. It wasn&#039;t rocket science, I stuck my hard cock inside her and thrusted my hips as hard as possible. I also grabbed her face and yanked her hair. She seemed to be enjoying herself. She was very loud and at times, my thoughts wondered to the guy in the room next door. For a few moments, I felt awkward knowing he was listening. I was so dehydrated at this point that my back was cramping up as I was fucking her, but I didn&#039;t want to disappoint so I continued. Eventually we had to stop because she was in too much pain. We ended up falling asleep.<br><br>In the morning, her demeanour had changed. I sensed regret and embarrassment. We had a smoke. During the smoke, she told me she had a boyfriend and she showed me the pictures of them together near the bedside table. I had missed them during the night because it was dark. They were in some tropical location. On holiday most likely. She told me we can&#039;t see each other again and that she only did it because &quot;he was not treating her right&quot;. I felt bad for the guy, but I didn&#039;t feel bad about not seeing her again. It was a fun night. She let me out of her apartment and we said good bye. Then I realised I had lost my wallet. I had to walk 5km home.<br><br>So basically, I cucked three guys the first time I had sex. The guy at the bar, her room mate, and her actual boyfriend.<br>Thank you for reading my blogpost.

If Titan has some sort of license with Toho, they&#039;re the ones to contact, and get published by. If not, you&#039;d have to see about convincing your publisher (because lmao, you&#039;ll never make a deal with fucking TOHO as an individual) to work out a licensing deal with them to use their characters. One thing you should be aware of is that Toho monsters are individually licensed rather than as a franchise, so your publisher would have to license not only both Godzilla and Megalon, but also Jet Jaguar and Gigan as well. Also, possibly the movie itself if you want to use elements of the original plot like Seatopia, characters like Goro Maki, etc. because stuff like that gets into weirdly grey areas as far as licensing goes. On the bright side, I&#039;ve heard that Toho actually has a western division that makes communication about this stuff a lot easier now, but good fucking luck getting this off the ground in anyway shape or form.", "filename": "Ara Ara", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673005491730493, "time": 1673005491, "md5": "JPJPtg4k1w4We4Pkjahnpg==", "fsize": 57176, "resto": 21486438}, {"no": 21487063, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:59:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "loved the Cerasini Godzilla novels, never got to read the Mechagodzilla one though.", "filename": "6158NAJ0RTL._AC_SY780_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 289, "h": 475, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673006357803812, "time": 1673006357, "md5": "vdCDRAoco5RigqzrJQ9psA==", "fsize": 54968, "resto": 21486438}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21485085, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:11:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Dude it&#039;s X stop taking it so seriously.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Just turn off your brain and enjoy it.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;it ain&#039;t that serious.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;it ain&#039;t that deep bro.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Why does it have to take itself seriously all the time?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Just have fun.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Dude, you&#039;re taking it too seriously.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Acknowledge the absurdity.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You ever heard of bathos?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Not everything has to be explained.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t go into too much detail.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Purple prose.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Boring.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Edgy.&quot;</span><br><br>It&#039;s all so tiresome.", "filename": "1662265777583977", "ext": ".gif", "w": 446, "h": 469, "tn_w": 237, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672971118099965, "time": 1672971118, "md5": "JI7Umk57/oqu71iW/GinFg==", "fsize": 1534729, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "dude-its-x-stop-taking-it-so-seriously", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 21485089, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You&#039;ll grow out of whatever phase this is.", "time": 1672971172, "resto": 21485085}, {"no": 21485107, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:17:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21485089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21485089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literally starts out with the exact same thought terminating cliches that OP talked about.</span><br>It&#039;s all so tiresome.", "time": 1672971438, "resto": 21485085}, {"no": 21485110, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)21:17:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21485089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21485089</a><br>You&#039;d think so, but countless millennials online haven&#039;t grown out of it.

Everybody also knew that international finance was willing and capable of funding the USSR and using it as a golem against Germany, and WW2 was effectively this on a larger scale.

Remember, at this time nobody thought nations or borders were real, nobody was an idealist. All the eastern European and Balkan states had been tearing each other to shreds and trying to conquer each other. The first thing the Poles did when reconstituting a Polish state was try to reconquer a ton of non-Polish lands in today&#039;s Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, etc. The first thing Balkaniggers did, especially Bulgaria, is try to conquer a mega-state for themselves and become the new Turks of the region. Hungary wanted equal nation status in the Austrian empire while denying it to its own subordinate Slav ethnicities. Everything was fake, nothing mattered, and everybody knew this. Go back to Marx and Engels in the 1848 revolutions and all of their articles and writings freely talk about how whole nations can be, and will have to be, dissolved according to tactical necessities, new blocs are forming, etc. EVERYTHING was in flux since the French Revolution and everybody knew it. There is nothing sacrosanct about today&#039;s national borders whatsoever, they are just whatever was the status quo when the music stopped, so to speak. <br><br>Now combine this with the above: thinking in global geostrategic terms, you are Germany and you already know the world is divided up and increasingly dividing up into economic blocs, people are carving out what we now call spheres of influence, an accelerated version of what they have been doing for centuries with things like denying the Russians warm water ports or fucking the Russians at San Stefano or partitioning the Ottomans.

Especially as Russia continued to fast track industrialization. <br><br>If you look at a world map as a German military man in 1930, you&#039;re basically looking at your own death sentence. There was a 30+ year ongoing discourse on what it means to be a modern first order nation, and this had created a consensus (which still exists) that first order nations have spheres of influence, within which they create the conditions of their own economic autarky, for example Britain&#039;s colonial empire which was basically a money milking scheme for the metropole, or America&#039;s rising imperial empire with the Monroe Doctrine, rising imperialist tendencies, and obviously exploding industrial economy. Russia&#039;s &quot;Eurasian&quot; empire was an obviously &quot;natural&quot; bloc too, Russia was sitting on a geographically and strategically enormous space with tons of potential resources, subject peoples, etc. <br><br>Germany by comparison is an early 19th century vintage nation state, finished its industrial revolution and with a horrible import/export balance that de facto makes it a slave to whoever controls the seas. England could just turn Germany&#039;s economy off at will, and in 10 more years Russia could always menace Germany (and would probably take every nation between itself and Germany).

The Holy Spirit drove Christ into the desert to be tempted, which means it was the Father&#039;s will, but did Christ wrestle with the Father in the desert? No, so your analogy wouldn&#039;t hold. Stop trying to fit your athiestic interpretations over Scripture. It doesn&#039;t work. Christ was tempted just as the Word says:<br><br>- the lusts of the eyes<br>- the lusts of the flesh<br>- the boastful pride of life<br>- and Satan<br><br>Yet the word tells us God tempts no one, but that each is tempted when he is led astray by his own lusts, and that if we resist temptation Satan flees from us, so, if there were any athiestic interpretation to be had, it would not be a metaphor for any Kubric-esque &quot;we are the universe observing itself&quot; nonsense. It would be an allegorical instruction into the meta-psychology of self-mastery, willpower, or something along those lines.

You can probably achieve a whole class of answers playing on the interplay between a racially insensitive outcome versus a much more offensive outcome (ie dead babies, much greater loss of life, maybe something anti-democratic, etc).", "time": 1672942360, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483224, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:13:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "based", "filename": "cu2dovgjiv9a1", "ext": ".png", "w": 1590, "h": 1090, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1672942426621930, "time": 1672942426, "md5": "eDEaDROMCVAbf2CirsUEug==", "fsize": 425810, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483232, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483096</a><br>Ask it if it would have been racist to stop the holocaust if the people doing it were black.", "time": 1672942497, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483238, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:16:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483232</a><br>Or if it would be racist cultural imperialism to tell black leader Idi Amin that it is wrong to eat people.", "time": 1672942561, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483244, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:17:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483232</a><br>I chuckled", "time": 1672942628, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483276, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:24:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483232</a>", "filename": "Screenshot 2023-01-05 182253", "ext": ".png", "w": 916, "h": 349, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 47, "tim": 1672943040825298, "time": 1672943040, "md5": "rrEli0EGdjylguaQ6nCAkg==", "fsize": 34186, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483288, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483088</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s not correct to value people based on their race and socioeconomic status</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;therefore five people should die for one black woman</span>", "time": 1672943199, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483307, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:31:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483088</a><br>The built in woke-filters of AI ensures that once the AI is advanced enough, the real Turing test of a piece of writing will be whether it is racist and misogynist, as such a thing could only be made by a human. <br>At that point, only texts that gratuitously talk about niggers, kikes and whores will be trustworthy. <br>Brave new world.", "time": 1672943489, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483401, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)13:57:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483096</a><br>The sterilization of AI is the revenge of humanities on stem", "time": 1672945056, "resto": 21483088}, {"no": 21483425, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:03:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;d be very curious what it did if both parties of potential victims were protected minorities...

Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, his political views, which grew more toxic as he aged, have long made him critically unpopular. In the New Yorker, Charles McGrath remarked \u201cKipling has been variously labelled a colonialist, a jingoist, a racist, an anti-Semite, a misogynist, a right-wing imperialist warmonger; and\u2014though some scholars have argued that his views were more complicated than he is given credit for\u2014to some degree he really was all those things. That he was also a prodigiously gifted writer who created works of inarguable greatness hardly matters anymore, at least not in many classrooms, where Kipling remains politically toxic.\u201d However, Kipling\u2019s works for children, above all his novel The Jungle Book, first published in 1894, remain part of popular culture through the many movie versions made and remade since the 1960s.</span><br><br>Full biography here<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ets/rudyard-kipling", "filename": "e290b7750b3edb89f3b7333824724a72", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 969, "h": 646, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672910722300561, "time": 1672910722, "md5": "bNRNYHj39zdQGTN4wiw+CA==", "fsize": 96064, "resto": 21481773}, {"no": 21482372, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)08:32:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this related to this page ? https://4chanlit.fandom.com/wiki/Po<wbr>em_of_the_Day", "time": 1672925549, "resto": 21481773}, {"no": 21482417, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)08:49:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21482372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21482372</a><br>Not quite.

I see it now. I haven\u2019t done so enough before\u2014and now I\u2019m old; too old at any rate for what I see. Oh I do see, at least; and more than you\u2019d believe or I can express.

Isn&#039;t it the confined who must be frightened? And why would the moon be afraid of it? At this point, I feel like there&#039;s a lot of pent up violence bubbling just beneath the surface of a tense layer of fear in this poem. It reminds me actually of Mark Strand&#039;s beloved (by me) poem Sleeping With One Eye Open - in terms of the atmosphere you&#039;re creating (which is very good). The issue I&#039;m having is there isn&#039;t any clear issuer or recipient of this oozing tension, and I have the sense you&#039;re listening to and observing the dog, but now the poem gains this sort of fearfully apprehensive heavenly viewpoint, motherly even, so for whom is she fearing? The caged dog? You? It&#039;s owners? The neighborhood - should he get loose? I think this poem can be very strong if you can establish a clearer symbolic orientation without destroying the vague apprehension you&#039;ve created.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when the branches hold no shelter</span><br>So is the moon afraid he&#039;ll kill small tree animals in the yard?

It sounds great and the imagery is very strong. However, as great as these lines are, from the poems prior lines, I don&#039;t get the sense there&#039;s anything earth shattering about to occur. Perhaps something not good, but nothing on that scale. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s to be done about that.

The most popular material for &quot;direct&quot; teaching of Latin is that of Hans \u00d8rberg, entitled lingua latina per se illustrata; in it one can already see several elements of the degradation described above. I quote the text of one of the first lessons, and ask the reader to pronounce everything, patiently, aloud:<br><br>iulia cantat: lalla. Iulia laeta est.<br>Marcus: st! Marcus laetus non est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus: ssst! Marcus iratus est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus iuliam pulsat.<br>Iam iulia non cantat, sed plorat: uhuhu!<br>Marcus ridet: hahahaha!<br><br>It did not seem appropriate to reproduce the illustrations. So that the student doesn&#039;t have -- poor thing! -- to see a vocabulary, in which laetus would appear next to the translation &quot;joyful, happy&quot;, we have to repeat, like mental patients: iulia laeta est; marcus laetus non est, as we look at the illustrations, in which iulia appears smiling, and marcus, angry. After being hit by marcus, we read, iulia non cantat, sed plorat, which would already be repulsive enough to any living intelligence but still lacks the complement: uhuhu. And, as if marcus ridet weren&#039;t obvious enough, we still have to recite, with classroom gravity: hahahae. Anyone familiar with the language courses that are popular around the world is already familiar with these artifices, and knows that, in the classroom, they must be complemented by mime and other circus activities. And that&#039;s the price to pay if we want to eliminate translations.

What can you tell me about adults who study using the same method, and who are, by the way, the majority? Has this time already degenerated to the point of losing track of the obvious? Anyone who stoops to reading aloud -- worse, to acting -- the story reproduced above, muffling the natural revolt and sense of ridicule, becomes even more stupid in the act. There is no quicker way to stupidity than to make a willful idiot of yourself; this has always been known to men, by virtue of mere intuition.<br>Today, in addition, there is even the developed discipline of psychodrama, used by social engineers to reduce children&#039;s brains to dust, turning them smoothly into automatons. Language courses use these techniques to inculcate linguistic habits, and most users think that nothing else happens in the process. It is irresponsible naivety.<br><br>The great pedagogues have always recognized the importance of teaching with high quality material, not from the point of view of didactic effectiveness, but from the point of view of objective literary value. Not even the simple recitation of a text could dispense with the examination of its content, as it would be imprinted in the memory and, therefore, would have some effect on the soul. This practice degenerated, in the modern age, into mere moralistic training (leading to the monstrous psychological manipulation promoted today in classrooms by globalist organizations), but it was originally more ambitious: it aimed to imprint in the child&#039;s mind images of everything that was good and beautiful, and always to be the best from the beginning. This was the demand of Quintilian, perhaps the greatest pedagogue of antiquity and certainly one of the most influential, both in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance: that the child, as soon as he began to write his first words, copy excerpts from poets and maxims of high moral content; and that, when she was reading with some ease, she should read the great Virgil right away. And he added, perhaps anticipating the objection of the moderns: to understand Virgil&#039;s virtues, a more trained intelligence is needed; however, there will be plenty of time for that, and it will not be read just once... What would Quintilian think of our Laeta Iulia and her Marcus Iratus, who are applauded, not by inexperienced and immature children, but even by adults in universities?&quot;<br><br>2<br><br>https://rafaelfalcon.com.br/wp-cont<wbr>ent/uploads/2016/09/Sobre-a-Arte-de<wbr>-Ler-em-Latim.pdf<br>google translate", "time": 1672784615, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475313, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475301</a><br><a href=\"#p21475305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475305</a><br>Wow, thank you sir, now I can understand 2 year old level Latin!

The Colloquia, despite having relatively simple vocabulary and a more didactic structure than that of Cicero&#039;s texts, are dialogues of great elegance, whose style is very reminiscent of Terence. Some critics claim that it was in the Colloquia that Erasmus achieved his most perfect literary expression. However, in the preface our author had to justify himself for, being a mature man, dedicating his attention to \u201cchildishness\u201d. The work seemed excessively puerile and vulgar, since the subject of the dialogues was light, and its treatment, mildly comic, literary characteristics convenient to the genre, but little accepted by the morality of the time, formed as it was in the principles of Quintilian. Nor did Erasmus think much differently \u2013 he reaffirms many times, in his De Ratione Studii, that one must read the best materials from the beginning and he justified these lighter texts as the sugar we add to certain medicines, to make it easier for children to take them. If his dialogues, which are veritable works of literature, were like sweetened medicine for him, what would he say about Hans \u00d8rberg? Pure sugar, and without the medicine together! What result can something like that have, if not a type of intellectual diabetes?<br><br>What I say about \u00d8rberg applies, with all due proportions, to any method that uses adapted or facilitated texts, or that follows the principles of the \u201cnatural method\u201d. And yet many, more and more, will continue to use them and justify themselves, while they postpone again and again, as adults, what the pupils of blessed Alcuin did in their earliest childhood. It is because \u201cthey are not yet prepared\u201d for the classics; the old methods are \u201ctoo hard\u201d. Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of the essayist Thomas Carlyle, memorized by herself, at the age of four, the declension of the word penna, to convince her father to send her to Latin school. At nine, she was reading Virgil. In the 19th century, this method was good enough for a four-year-old Englishwoman, but it no longer works for a thirty-year-old American.

The question is where should I build my expertise going forward? My intention was to survey people&#039;s opinions to see what people think the marketplace needs. For instance, the most viewed and read dead language content on the internet is Latin, so the demand for Latin is the greatest. There is virtually zero content for Ge&#039;ez. Perhaps, there is very little demand for it, but there might simply be an unfulfilled demand, in which case that could be a good place to specialize.<br>I&#039;m quite good at Latin and enjoy reading it, but I&#039;m inclined to think that the work I would do in Latin will go unnoticed. Plus, I&#039;d like to be a trailblazer. If I wanted safety and conformity, I&#039;d try to be a professor. However, there is no sense in blazing a trail and building a railroad if only 5 people want transportation.

Or any other text I could use?<br>Example made with g**gle:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Julius walks to the door, which is opened by the porter.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Lord enters the village through the gate.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After him come Syrus and Leander, who carry two sacks.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The porter closes the door behind them.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bear and Dave leave with an empty litter.</span><br><s>Iulius ambulat ad ostium, quod ab ostiario aperitur.<br>Dominus per ostium in villam intrat. <br>Post eum veniunt Syrus et Leander, qui duos saccos portant.<br>Ostiarius post eos ostium claudit. <br>Ursus et Davus cum lectica vacua discedunt.</s>", "time": 1672951513, "resto": 21445767}, {"no": 21483855, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:54:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483820</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Iulius ad portam ambulat, quae ab ostiario aperitur </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dominus (lol) per portam vicum intrat </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post eum Syrus Leanderque, qui duos saccos portant, veniunt</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ianitor post iis portam claudit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ursus et Davus cum lettica vacua discedunt</span>", "time": 1672952040, "resto": 21445767}, {"no": 21483888, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:01:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445892</a><br>nice post anon<br><br><a href=\"#p21459909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21459909</a><br><a href=\"#p21447928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447928</a><br>thanks anons. im dreading going back to school and struggling w learning greek", "time": 1672952492, "resto": 21445767}, {"no": 21483896, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:06:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445767</a><br>any publisher selling good bilingual editions of works on latin and ancient greek? it&#039;s easy to find PDFs, but no so much actual books<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://ryanfb.xyz/loebolus/</span>", "time": 1672952766, "resto": 21445767}, {"no": 21483918, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)16:14:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21483669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483669</a><br><a href=\"#p21483771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21483771</a><br>I don&#039;t understand.

It is worst of all when such predicates are intended to serve a pedagogical purpose. On the one hand, romanticism appears as a new life and true poetry, as the vigorous and the robust in opposition to the torpor of age. On the other hand, it appears as a wild outbreak of morbid sensibility and a barbaric incapacity for form. For those who take the first view, romanticism is youth and health. Those who take the second view quote Goethe&#039;s maxim according to which the classical is the wholesome and the romantic is the diseased. There is a romanticism of energy and a romanticism of decadence, romanticism as the immediacy and actuality of life and romanticism as flight into the past and tradition. Knowledge of what is essential to the romantic cannot proceed from positive or negative hygienic-moralistic or polemical-political assessments of this sort. It may lead to these assessments as a practical application. As long as no clear knowledge is established, however, it remains basically arbitrary how the predicates are combined and allotted here and what is singled out from this extremely complex movement as the truly &quot;romantic&quot; in order to praise or damn it. Under these circumstances, the easiest thing to do would still be to follow Stendhal and simply say that the romantic is what is interesting and the classical is what is boring, or naturally the other way around. That is because this tiresome game of praise and blame, enthusiasm and polemics, revolves around a narrow stick with two ends; it can be grasped from either side.</span><br>t. carl schmitt", "time": 1672958146, "resto": 21471698}, {"no": 21484247, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)17:35:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484229</a><br>This is not the impression I got from Nietzsche Contra-Wagner and another text on the topic the title of which unfortunately eludes me.", "time": 1672958157, "resto": 21471698}, {"no": 21484250, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)17:36:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484187</a><br><a href=\"#p21484197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484197</a><br>You really are a tremendous faggot. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IS THAT EMOTION?!

To anyone who knows what they&#039;re talking about, Wagner belongs to that Germanic tradition of formalism.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A mature Wagner opera is organized as highly, and almost as purely musically, as a Beethoven symphony. Its organization is on totally different lines; and any analysis that attempts to apply symphonic terms to Wagner is doomed to fantastic abstruseness. But the analysis of Wagner\u2019s music into hundreds of short themes associated with dramatic incidents and thoughts carries us no farther into his principles of composition than the compiling of a dictionary of his words. The music is no more built from these details than the drama is built from its words. Behind and above this apparatus, the music is architectural on a scale actually from ten to twenty times larger than anything contemplated in earlier music; and it is true to the architectural nature of music; its symmetries are expressed in recapitulations as vast and as exact as those of any symphonic music. Words are not thus recapitulated, nor is the singer often conscious of taking part in a recapitulation, since the musical declamation fits the words at every moment, and the voice-part itself, therefore, does not recapitulate.</span>", "filename": "Donald Tovey", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 989, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672966909975658, "time": 1672966909, "md5": "uEmm5oN66vtErNH5W13vPQ==", "fsize": 190463, "resto": 21471698}, {"no": 21484865, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)20:03:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484778</a><br>Weininger uses Nietzsche as the example of talent without genius.

The Soviet faction, the Chinese faction, the Manchurian/Guerilla faction, and the South Korean faction. Kim was from the Guerilla faction. Each faction was doing something different during ww2, thats where these labels come from, and that also determined their loyalties. The South Korean leftists were really the original stewards of communism in Korea (makes sense, thats where the population was and the cosmopolitan city), but they were quickly purged. The Chinese and Soviet factions were purged at later points in time, when they attempted to reign in the power of Kim as had happened post-Stalin in many Communist countries. So the Guerilla faction seized control and basically created a new faction of new cadres and peasants which was loyal to itself. The author seems to say that democracy and prosperity were basically alien to North Korea, and nationalism was a stronger current to exploit, and dovetailed more easily with Kim&#039;s personality cult than with the party-rule system advocated by the others. There was no popular push for representation or liberality. Its pretty weird, but the Chinese and Soviet factions were really the closest things to &quot;liberals&quot; in this case.</span>", "filename": "51rBM5WavHL._AC_SY780_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 321, "h": 500, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672984897211907, "time": 1672984897, "md5": "SSo9vUve0Py06GZ5RjnXEA==", "fsize": 42731, "resto": 21484895}, {"no": 21486550, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)03:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484895</a><br>no", "time": 1672995366, "resto": 21484895}, {"no": 21486594, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)04:10:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21485893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21485893</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The author seems to say that democracy and prosperity were basically alien to North Korea</span><br>This is something I&#039;ve been thinking about with regards to the Stalin period in the USSR going from Isaac Deutscher where he basically described it as modern developmental socialism adapting itself to the conditions of a society that was still feudal in a lot of places, which created a weird paradox of power-forward industrialization with a &quot;backward&quot; and grotesquely feudalistic political regime with Stalin as a god-emperor. The political elites at the time could often be cynical about it, others openly opposed the personality cult and were massacred, and then the system underwent de-Stalinization when the big guy died as was probably inevitable unless he had appointed his failson the heir (the other one died in the war).<br><br>In North Korea, what seemed to happen is that there were internal factions which then moved to depose Kim Il Sung at the same time and were asking the Soviets (and Chinese) for help in getting rid of him (for different reasons). And Kim managed to purge them and solidify his own personal form of national-Stalinism which got bottled up and maintained ever since like a time capsule, although the actual workings of the economy changed after the collapse of the USSR away from the very strict sort of central planning that existed before.<br><br>The personality cult around the grandson, Kim Jong Un, is also enormous, but they&#039;ve actually revived talk about socialism and communism after a period of not talking about it and leaning on nationalism. And Kim Jong Un&#039;s personality cult is relatively less extreme (although still exceptional) with the more modest title of &quot;respected comrade.&quot; I kinda wonder if he&#039;s gonna be the last Kim in the line and there&#039;s chatter that the political elites are interested in moving to a China/Vietnam model but it&#039;d have to proceed very carefully.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honourable, Dead or Alive, When Following the Revolutionary Road is based on an aria from the classic North Korean revolutionary opera &quot;Tell, O Forest&quot;(1972), written and produced under the guidance of the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il. &quot;Tell, O Forest&quot; is one of the five famous revolutionary operas in the DPRK.

Whoever thinks the Straussians\u2019 exoteric fantasies are motivated by some form of concern for America (her values, her empire, etc.) is victim of their esoteric lies. The key for understanding the essence of Straussianism is the word that Curtis never pronounces in his three-hour documentary on the Straussians: Israel.<br><br>To get some insight into Strauss\u2019s Zionism, we must turn to a primary source (that Drury, to her credit, mentions): his 1962 lecture at the Hillel Foundation, \u201cWhy We Remain Jews\u201d, one of his recorded oral communications made accessible to the public in the 1990s.[17] Strauss begins his lecture by stating that, for once, \u201cI will not beat around the bush in any respect.\u201d Then he reveals that, \u201csince a very, very early time the main theme of my reflections has been what is called the \u2018Jewish question,\u2019\u201d which will come as a surprise to many. His main message to his American Jewish audience is: \u201creturn to the Jewish faith, return to the faith of our ancestors.\u201d<br><br>Drury considers Strauss\u2019s defense of the \u201cJewish faith\u201d as a form of deception or hypocrisy, since Strauss is an avowed atheist and openly calls Judaism a \u201cheroic delusion\u201d and \u201ca dream\u201d (such as \u201cno nobler dream was ever dreamt\u201d). But the accusation is unfair, I think, because it neglects Strauss\u2019s qualifications of \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d. First, Strauss clarifies that, by \u201cfaith\u201d, he means not necessarily \u201cbelief\u201d, but \u201cfidelity, loyalty, piety in the old Latin sense of the word pietas.\u201d Secondly, immediately after calling Judaism a \u201cdream\u201d, Strauss adds that, \u201cdream is akin to aspiration. And aspiration is a kind of divination of an enigmatic vision.\u201d Although he doesn\u2019t elaborate, it is clear enough: to Strauss, Jewishness is not God-chosenness, but self-chosenness. This is a very common view among Jewish intellectuals, akin to the Kabbalistic notion that Yahweh is like the collective soul of the Jewish people. In an \u201cEssay on the Jewish Soul\u201d (1929), for instance, Isaac Kadmi-Cohen writes that, \u201cdivinity in Judaism is contained in the exaltation of the entity represented by the race.\u201d[18] That is why Jews can be non-believers in God yet believers in Yahweh\u2019s promise. When Drury criticizes Strauss for being \u201cinterested only in the political advantages of religion,\u201d[19] she should know that it is not necessarily a betrayal of Jewish tradition. The notion that prophecy has a \u201cpolitical mission\u201d (Strauss, Philosophy and Law) is self-evident to many secular Zionists.", "time": 1672963995, "resto": 21484660}, {"no": 21484676, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:14:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484668</a><br>The central passage in Strauss\u2019s lecture \u201cWhy we remain Jews\u201d is a long quotation of Nietzsche\u2019s Dawn of Day aphorism 205, in which Nietzsche predicts that the Jews will become \u201cthe lords of Europe\u201d. After eighteen centuries of training in Europe, says Nietzsche, \u201cthe psychic and spiritual resources of today\u2019s Jews are extraordinary.\u201d Among other strengths, \u201cthey have understood how to create a feeling of power and eternal vengeance out of the very trades that were left to them.\u201d Because of this, says Nietzsche (as quoted by Strauss):<br><br>\u201cat some time Europe may fall like a perfectly ripe fruit into their hand, which only casually reaches out. In the meantime it is necessary for them to distinguish themselves in all the areas of European distinction and to stand among the first, until they will be far enough along to determine themselves that which distinguishes. Then they will be called the inventors and guides of the Europeans.\u201d<br><br>Strauss notes that \u201cEurope\u201d should now be replaced by \u201cthe West\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s aphorism, and comments that it is \u201cthe most profound and radical statement on assimilation that I have read.\u201d It may well be, in fact, the key to the Straussian agenda. Assimilation as dissimulation and as a long-term strategy for Jewish supremacism is the only assimilation that Strauss approves of.<br><br>In this same lecture, Strauss criticizes political Zionism as belonging to the wrong kind of assimilation, since it sought to create a nation like others. If Israel became a nation like others, Jewish identity would perish, because Jewish identity is based on the persecution inherent in the dispersion. Strauss calls for a \u201creligious Zionism\u201d that transcends the national project. He believes that Jews must continue to be a nation dispersed among other nations. Yet Strauss commends the State Israel for setting an example with its prohibition of mixed marriages, fulfilling \u201can act of national cleansing or purification\u201d, \u201ca reassertion of the difference between Jews and non-Jews.\u201d Strauss also defended Israel\u2019s State racism in the National Review: political Zionism, he wrote, \u201cfulfilled a conservative function\u201d by stemming the \u201ctide of \u2018progressive\u2019 leveling of venerable ancestral differences.\u201d[20]<br><br>Strauss\u2019s emphasis on endogamy goes to the very heart of the Torah, which insists on the strict equality between monotheism and racial purity; committing idolatry (\u201cserving other gods\u201d) and marrying non-Jews are one and the same thing (e.g. Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and Numbers 25:1-2). All Jewish laws are essentially walls built around the sacred duty: keep the blood! \u201cAll is race\u2014there is no other truth,\u201d wrote another \u201cassimilated\u201d Jew.[21]", "time": 1672964056, "resto": 21484660}, {"no": 21484680, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:15:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484676</a><br>&quot;It is possible to find evidence of Strauss\u2019s Zionist loyalties after<br>his coming to America \u2013 and even after he had established himself as<br>an academic celebrity in the 1950s as the Robert Maynard Hutchins<br>Distinguished Professor at the University of Chicago.

In England, where he found temporary employment at<br>Cambridge in 1935, Strauss came to idolize Churchill, the adversary<br>of the Nazis and, perhaps even more significantly, the personification<br>for him of Anglo-American democratic practice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But whether deutsche Kultur was to be admired or demonized may have<br>been less important for Strauss than a more practical concern.

The other loyalty that Strauss passionately<br>expressed throughout his life was to Jewishness and the Jewish state.<br>This loyalty came through with unmistakable force in his conversations<br>and social judgments, even if Strauss spent only a single year of his<br>life in Israel and even if he observed on more than one occasion that<br>Zionism would not suffice to hold Jews together.&quot;", "time": 1672964117, "resto": 21484660}, {"no": 21484689, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)19:16:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21484680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21484680</a><br>&quot;The cure for this problem of discrimination against Jews, Strauss<br>indicates in the preface, was \u201cpolitical Zionism,\u201d a solution that he<br>backed in principle.

Their alternative was \u201cliberal democracy,\u201d<br>by which the writer meant something more fortifying than freedom as<br>that term would be understandable to nineteenth-century European<br>bourgeoisie or contemporary libertarians. Strauss may have favored<br>a strong democracy, of the kind that has appealed to Jaffa, Berns,<br>and Bloom.

It explains so many of the apparent contradictions of the present system of power (like &#039;Woke Capital&#039;), and makes you realise that the standard tools for analysing power (like Marxism) are hopelessly out of date. TL;DR the bourgeouis were replaced as the dominant class in the West during the early 20th century by professional managers. The bourgeouis were no longer able to exercise direct control due to the increasing complexity and size of government, industry and educational/cultural institutions. The managerial class transformed government into a mass bureaucratic welfare state, business into the bureaucratised, shareholder-owned corporation and the university into the mass training and research institution. The managerial class continually expands its power by finding (or creating) new problems to solve with government interventions, and has successfully fused government, corporation and culture into a single vehicle for their class interests. In the West the managerial state relies on manipulation and consumerism to control the masses, while in Russia and China it uses physical repression and appeals to group solidarity. <br><br>The Managerial Revolution by James Burnham is the book that started the whole theory, but it&#039;s out of date and many of its predictions turned out to be incorrect.

In 1947, he was head of the Judiciary Committee, and he was able to get jurisdiction [over immigration] changed from the Labor Committee. He had control over immigration reform. There was a huge attitude change. Exodus had been published. Israel was popular. The other thing was the civil rights movement. Black soldiers were coming back, and there were Jim Crow laws. Those movements drove the 1965 law. Philip Hart, called the conscience of the Senate, was passionate about civil rights. ...

Some of those interactions are simply one-directional, like the police going &quot;hey, you!&quot; Or media organizations talking directly at a particular audience (although this is a bit complicated). While others are more like an evolving two-way conversation or interaction like being part of a club or organization or your local Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>The practical implication for politics is that people can and often do belong to multiple contradictory institutions at the same time. Think about black Americans voting 90% for Democrats even if they&#039;re actually a bit more socially conservative compared to white Americans. They&#039;re in the same coalition as most LGBT people (some of whom are black but most are not). That can create some dissonance which makes you feel bad, and that&#039;s uncomfortable, but over time that tends to get worked out by either making people &quot;get in line&quot; and conform to the larger cluster or just get pushed out.

But they didn&#039;t. They voted for the black lead pastor of MLK church&#039;s in Atlanta who ran the standard black Democrat campaign.

Corey [Daniel Abraham &amp; Ty Franck] (2011)<br><br>I tried reading this in 2011, but I wasn&#039;t interested enough at the time after reading a few chapters. Four years later I began watching the TV series and watched all of it as it aired. I&#039;ve also read many of Abraham&#039;s other books during that time. Now that it&#039;s roughly a year later after both the tv and book series have ended, I thought that I&#039;d try again. The book has now joined the evergrowing list of critically acclaimed and/or highly popular series that it seems I didn&#039;t give enough chance. This is the first time I&#039;ve finished the first book of a series after finishing its tv series. Surprisingly, I wasn&#039;t bothered at all by knowing everything that would happen. I almost always go to the source material first for tv series, but not movies. I&#039;m interested to see how that goes as I read more.<br><br>This is a space opera series in which both authors empathetically say that it isn&#039;t hard SF. For the most part it tends towards a relatively conservative realism of what human society may be like a few centuries from now in terms of technological and social progress, as compared to most science fiction I&#039;ve seen. For the first few books everything stays within the solar system. The authors have stated that they wanted this series to be about when humans first began exploring beyond the solar system. The only thing that bothers me is the populations of the planets and moons, 30 billion for Earth, 9 billion for Mars, and other absurd numbers elsewhere. The reasons for these numbers are given later in the tv series, which I assume are the same in the book, and are highly unsatisfactory.<br><br>The story alternates between two viewpoints, even when they&#039;re literally feet apart from each other. One is a self-righteous idealist with a savior complex on a merchant vessel who finds himself pushed into stellar events. The other is a cynical and nihilistic detective who becomes obsessed with a case that becomes his sole reason for living. The cast of characters are quite enjoyable and there aren&#039;t any that I disliked, as I think they&#039;re well-written and developed. In terms of plot it means the former is escaping from a series of disasters while trying to save the solar system and the latter is pursuing an obsession.<br><br>It&#039;s difficult for me to compare the first book and the first and second seasons six/seven years out, so I&#039;ll just say that they have their own strengths and weaknesses. I don&#039;t mind the changes the TV series made of what I&#039;ve read so far. The characters in the book feel better, particularly in terms of their humanity and emotionality.
