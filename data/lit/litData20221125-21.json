In a way, this is a good point (the beautiful and profound heritage of the West should not be thrown out, and we\u2019re intimately tied up in it anyway if we\u2019re Westerners, even in trying to revolt or break away from it \u2014 Orientalist chauvinism, that anything of worth is only or mainly to be found in the East, is just as bad as Western chauvinism), but I also see this as a subtle blindspot of Jung\u2019s, and in a way have to give at least one point to the Traditionalists on this. Vedantic emancipation is not \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201cpsychic\u201d (as Jung\u2019s work is) in the sense of delving into the subconscious and analyzing the contents of the psyche, but rather about stilling and transcending the psyche (as in Patanjali\u2019s systematization of yoga in his Yoga Sutras, in which the deliberate cessation of cognitive functions will immediately reveal the nature of the Purusha, or Self). Jung avoided meeting with Ramana Maharshi in his travels in India perhaps intuitively/subconsciously because he sensed how explosively different it was from his life\u2019s work, and consciously he claimed in a letter to an acquaintance who highly respected R.M. that it was because Vedantic emancipation/moksha, as exemplified by Maharshi, seemed \u201cinhuman\u201d to him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was very much interested in your news about the Maharshi. I\u2019m well aware of the fact that my very Western criticism of such a phenomenon of the Maharshi was rather upsetting to you. I consider a man\u2019s life lived for 65 years in perfect balance as most unfortunate. I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t chosen to live such a miracle. It is so utterly inhuman that I can\u2019t see for the life of me any fun in it. It is surely very wonderful but think of being wonderful year in year out! Moreover I think it generally much more advisable not to identify with the self. I quite appreciate the fact that such a model is of high pedagogical value to India.</span><br><br>https://carljungdepthpsychologysite<wbr>.blog/2020/04/12/carl-jung-and-rama<wbr>na-maharshi/amp/<br><br>However, both Jung and Traditionalists would agree there\u2019s a sort of psychic fissure in the modern West represented by the \u201cNew Age\u201d, or indiscriminately, naively believed watered-down popularizations of Eastern doctrines and following of fraudulent gurus. Jung would probably have had some interesting things to say on his concept of \u201cinflation\u201d as applied to, say, grandiose Eastern teachers or New Age gurus intoxicated by their fame in the West, figures like Rajneesh or Adi Da, their ego inflated by an identification of themselves with the archetype of the enlightened sage or wise old man.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A state of mind characterized by an exaggerated sense of self-importance ...

He was a Protestant and member of the Anglo-Irish community. He spent childhood holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</span>", "filename": "William Butler Yeats", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1069, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669424638310913, "time": 1669424638, "md5": "xMaMwBhz1MjzZgTccVRaVg==", "fsize": 373913, "resto": 21302136}, {"no": 21302197, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)20:20:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1669425653, "resto": 21302136}, {"no": 21302318, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)21:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21302136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21302136</a><br>Yeats is neat, but this ain&#039;t great Yeats.<br><br>Language and imagery are plain as F.

Rowling embodies just about everything that he hates about his own mother, but can&#039;t outright say to her. An aging neoliberal single mother with an inflated sense of self-importance using twitter to cope with her increasing irrelevance. The sort of woman who hasn&#039;t seriously thought about any of her opinions, but feels the need to push them on to others and condescend to anybody who might think differently.<br><br>She is an archetype. Neither insightful nor funny nor controversial. She is a consummate mediocrity basking in the praise of similar mediocrities the world over who have projected their own aspirations on to her, satisfied that somebody like them is a billionaire. Her Christianity is an accessory. She takes everything that she&#039;s been taught by public school and daytime television and fashions a god out of it.<br><br>She conceives of public affairs in the nebulous terms of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot;. The fact that an action might fall outside of either of these two categories, or that something she deems &quot;hateful&quot; might in fact be the wiser choice has not occurred to her. Despite this, she is shockingly easy to bait into a bitter, spiteful rage. Furthermore, her generosity only extends as far as her personal comfort. At the end of the day, it&#039;s little more than virtue signalling and if social opinion undergoes some vast sweeping change then she&#039;ll fall in line.<br><br>In many ways, she&#039;s already missed the boat. Her brand of comfortable feminism has already fallen out of style. She just doesn&#039;t know it yet. The second wave man-hating sexual phobia that sees rape everywhere. Its frigidity is evident in her writing. Then the bizarre merger with proud slut queer positivity. The post-hoc declarations of characters&#039; sexual proclivities. The rationalization of racial retconning. It&#039;s like she discovered a Harry Potter fan tumblr, followed a couple links, and incorporated whatever she saw, resulting in an incoherent schizophrenic worldview.

She has zero self-awareness when it comes to her emotions, but defends them with religious fervor.<br><br>Clumsily, she makes her way toward the living room where her son is playing video games. She sits down on his lap, suffocating him with her embrace and exhaling the stinking fumes of cheap wine right into his face. For a couple minutes, she rants about what a BITCH Leslie at the office is, before muttering the he&#039;s the only on who understands her. Briefly, she looks into his eyes, trembling all over. Then she locks her mouth with his and begins to kiss him passionately. At first he is paralyzed, but his mom is kind of hot and he&#039;ll probably never have another chance like this. He&#039;s thought about it before. He kisses back and before long she&#039;s between his legs, pawing at his penis like the cats she collects.

There is no longer anything integral, anything non-negotiable, anything personal nor anything impersonal. There is only &quot;the spectacle&quot; and its mass of passive observers. The opining of individuals in the audience changes nothing. Critics betrayed the final life line of hatred when they channeled all hate into the containable reservoir of opinion. Worst of all are those who participate. The namefags. The overwhelming majority of actors in the ridiculous events of the last 10+ years are the arch enemies of the values they supposedly represent.

The origin of this duality comes from the fact that we are not &quot;All-Powerful&quot; and that we are defined by our powerlessness, and, through our free will, we can act in a way that strives to create a feeling of power in ourselves (will to power) and connection with existence (being in time), or we can reject (or give up) the conditions that produce the powerlessness and act destructively. Where Sean Goonan differs from Nietzsche is wherein that he says we have to strive for a nuanced, subtle, and balanced power, highlighting, that people collectively cooperating and working together create more power (or energy) for all instead of people acting individualistically and achieving less (or killing others). Sean Goonan also talks a lot about how &quot;excessive power-seeking&quot; is destructive.<br><br>Sean Goonan then applies his powerful concepts of the original philosophy into the construction of all areas of society.

It pits human nature, which is to find importance and meaning, against the modern age which inevitably shatters all illusions about the transitory and contingent nature of all beliefs and values. The Compsons, a formerly gentried Southern family in Mississippi with a rich antebellum history, come to terms with the spiritual and material desolation of the South following the Civil War. Born and raised on the values and stories of the Old South, the three brothers cope in different ways with the disconnect between the South they were raised on and the sad reality. Aside from the material disintegration of their estate, this disconnect is framed most overtly through the narrators&#039; sister, Caddy, who represents the most drastic departure from the old and outdated Southern values by becoming a slut, sleeping around, getting knocked up, and attempting to fix it by getting married to a milquetoast Northerner.

He did a lot of esoteric prophecy/visionary stuff, claiming to have gained access to the Akashic records, and also spawned a lot of ideas that had subtle influence on other fields usually in diluted form, like Waldorf education and biodynamic farming, as already mentioned. He basically wanted to take the nature mysticism of Goethe and Schelling, combine them with Neoplatonism and occultism, and create a new way of life to save the modern world. It has to be saved in his opinion because we are at the end of a long period of developing mere &quot;cleverness&quot; at the expense of spiritual and metaphysical insight, which causes us to become very good at technology and surface-level logical reasoning, while the actual natures of things become invisible to us. A lot of his ideas hinge on how you need to cultivate and awaken faculties, because like Goethe he views platonic ideas as organic living souls that need to &quot;grow&quot; in your soul (by focusing on them attentively and cultivating them, while subordinating their material elements and perceptual data to the &quot;unfolding&quot; of the metaphysical idea, which governs over them). <br><br>This all relates to the prophecy stuff, because basically the mere technological cleverness side of humanity that has grown since the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment is running amok and trying to smother our other latent potentials, so that a spirit of techno-materialism called Ahriman can manifest in this world by twisting humanity to expect and accept him, which will gradually create a vessel or vessels for him (mostly agreed to be AI). Prior to the scientific revolution mankind was in the Luciferic stage, which was a stage that had direct access to spiritual realities, but in a dreamlike undifferentiated way, and the danger of the Luciferic manifestation was that we would be absorbed in magical pagan dreams basically, the dreaming soul smothering the other potential aspects of the fully realized human being.

I have a tiny bathroom and as soon as I walked in I realized that from about waist height up the room was covered in disorganized pockets of spider webs, and there was a black widow perched on a web above my at eye level. I&#039;ve found a black widow in my room before so this wasn&#039;t especially terrifying, but I thought I&#039;d run over to the main house (I live in a shack in the back yard of a residence) to show my brother before I moved it. <br><br>When I went outside I looked at the sky which was cloudless and blue like on many summer mornings here except for the full moon, which was still clearly visible. It looked strange in that you could hardly see the low parts of the moon at all in the blue sky and the high parts appeared more haphazard and less uniform, sort of like a meteor. Then the moon began to fall towards the horizon, slowly at first and then more and more quickly. When the moon made contact with the horizon it flashed and then looked like it disintegrated. <br><br>I thought that that was strange, and when I looked back towards the house I saw my brother standing next to me. I asked him if he saw the moon and he said no and asked me what happened. I told him it was nothing but saw him stare into the sky. I looked back up and saw what looked like stars that were clearly visible in the blue sky begin to fall towards the horizon and flash and disintegrate like the moon did. <br><br>My brother and I looked at each other and I said something to the effect of &quot;that&#039;s weird&quot; and got over it and was going to tell him to check out the black widow when I saw him look to the sky again and express surprise (&quot;woah&quot;). I looked up. Beside the sun appeared burning golden characters in Hebrew, in two rows of three or four characters each. Then underneath the characters a burning golden rectangle like a door or a window appeared and then opened after a few seconds. After another second or two of being open, another sun shot through the door into the sky and towards earth, rapidly becoming larger. I had time to yell in surprise before the sun filled the sky and I woke up.<br><br>Almost without exception my dreams are lucid, and I know pretty well before the end that I&#039;m dreaming.

However the realization that Husserl was never a realist and that he never had distinct phases is starting to congeal in some places. <br>Additionally, you should understand that the hermeneutic of Husserl is qualified geographically. There&#039;s a Austrian, a German, a French, a British and an American reading of Husserl, and each focuses on completely different aspects of his philosophy, to the point where he appears as a completely different author if you picture him through those readings exclusively. <br>The Americans in particular are 99% lost.

The standard German reading sees Husserl as one who accords primacy to the Ego within whose &quot;reduced&quot; life all constitution takes place, and who is therefore concerned with to what extent this egological theory can make room for history, time and body. Thus Landgrebe could emphasise history and body in Husserl&#039;s tought, and Klaus Held the living present as containing intersubjectivity and so transcending the egological thinking. Landgrebe reflects on how each monad&#039;s &quot;inner historicity&quot; is &quot;com- munalised with others&quot; and how thereby history is internalised. Held finds a fundamental equivocation in Husserl&#039;s thinking such that all its basic concepts such as &quot;intentionality&quot;, &quot;immanence&quot;, &quot;transcendence&quot;, &quot;life-world&quot;, &quot;reduction&quot;, &quot;noema&quot;, &quot;hyle&quot;, &quot;living present&quot; are all equivocal. Amongst the German interpreters, Fink stands apart, and exercises more influence than any one else on the French interpreters who drew upon Husserl. Fink emphasises the necessity of a non-intentional dimension in phenomenology, raises the question of being within phenomenology, identifies being with the world, and regards the world as pre-given, beyond constitution and beyond epoche, emphasises the &quot;splitting of the ego&quot; into the consistuting trancendental ego, the philosophising reflecting ego and the observing ego, raises various questions about the relation between the transcendental, the empirical and human egos. Many of these themes and apories arising from them influenced such thinkers as Derrida.&quot;", "time": 1669405715, "resto": 21300777}], "last_modified": 1669405715}, {"no": 21300911, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)13:32:56", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "R.I.P.

Many of his poems also feature themes of civil unrest over economic and class based issues. Though primarily a poet and essayist, he also made excursions into theater, film, opera, radio drama, reportage, translation. He has written novels and several books for children (including The Number Devil, an exploration of mathematics) and was co-author of a book for German as a foreign language (Die Suche). He also invented and collaborated in the construction of a machine which automatically composes poems.
