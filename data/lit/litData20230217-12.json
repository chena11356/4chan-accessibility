The very shape of the Divine had presented itself in anthropomorphic guise; it was the body of the quintessence of all pitying Love, stretched out upon the cross of pain and suffering.

But what was bound to prove her ruin, and lead at last to the ever louder &quot;Atheism&quot; of our day, was the tyrant-prompted thought of tracing back this Godliness upon the cross to the Jewish &quot;Creator of heaven and earth,&quot; a wrathful God of Punishment who seemed to promise greater power than the self-offering, all-loving Saviour of the Poor.

This is why the Old Testament and the New Testament are diametrically opposed and their unification forms a weird centaur. For the Old Testament is optimism, the New Testament pessimism. The former stems demonstrably from the doctrine of Ormuzd, the latter is related to Brahmanism and Buddhism in its inner spirit and therefore can probably also be traced historically to it somehow. The former is music in the major key, the latter in the minor.

This is how Christ\u2019s teaching, stemming from Indian wisdom, has covered the rough trunk of Judaism, which is entirely different from it; what had to be preserved of its basic form was transformed by his teaching into something different, something lively and true which appears to be the same, but is really something different.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus the creator who creates from nothing and is separate from the world is identified with the saviour and through him with mankind; he stands as their representative, since they are redeemed in him, just as they had fallen in Adam and ever since lay entangled in the bonds of sin, corruption, suffering and death. For the world manifests itself as all this here as well as in Buddhism \u2013 no longer in the light of Jewish optimism which had found \u2018everything was very good\u2019 (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bd); on the contrary, now the devil himself is called \u2018prince of this world\u2019 \u2013 \u1f41 \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 (John 12:32), literally ruler of the world. The world is no longer an end but a means; the kingdom of eternal joys lies beyond it and beyond death. Renunciation in this world and directing all hope to a better one are the spirit of Christianity. But the way to such a world is opened by reconciliation, i.e., the redemption from the world and its ways. In morality the right to retaliate has been replaced by the command to love one\u2019s enemy, the promise of innumerable progeny by the promise of eternal life, and visitation of the misdeed upon the children into the fourth generation, by the holy spirit who overshadows everything.</span><br>t. schopenhauer", "filename": "schoppi_d8rw6__please_credit[palette.fm]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 476, "h": 525, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676629932097195, "time": 1676629932, "md5": "6nQhytnFxyERCCcuoUnLmg==", "fsize": 60258, "resto": 21670574}, {"no": 21671484, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)05:32:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670705</a><br>Because they want more people getting to heaven instead of burning in hell<br>Considering how easy it is, I can&#039;t blame them lol", "time": 1676629979, "resto": 21670574}, {"no": 21671539, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)06:01:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670753</a><br>No one is atheist because of &quot;le problem of evil&quot;.

I simply don&#039;t see a point in the rationalization of the divine and see it more as a cop-out of true experience and encounter with God. God is inherently ineffable and beyond our understanding. And our logic pales in comparison to what he is. The only thing theology is really good for is better humbling yourself that you really no nothing about God. This is seen by the inherent holes and logical contradictions of literally everything. You can basically poke a hole into every argument possible.

You yourself say that we have to encounter God in order to know him. This means, that we have to understand the revelation - we have to do theology. Of course, you emphasize the personal aspect of it, which I do not in the same manner as you. Studying philosophy and theology can be a personal thing. Not everyone is a visionary. Some people, (like me) have to rely on scripture and try to understand it in order to get to know God. I can speak to God in my prayers, that is my personal relationship with God, but God only speaks to me through the Church, (as far as I am aware of), through the scripture and through the sacraments and the teachings of the church. I think that I am much clearer on what this personal aspect of my relationship with God actually is.

Pretty sure Aquinas ends the summa basically saying that.<br><br>I do think the root of the issue as you say is the interpretation of a personal understanding of God. Where I believe that it can only happen through personal revelation and understanding in a subjective mode of thinking. (subjective, not relative). The opposite would be as you say, receiving the revelation through the words of others. Which is then after the fact, rediscovered for the self. An external objective, then becomes subjective and a personal understanding flourishes from there. But the danger there, is that the truth never enters the domain of subjective experience, and thus never becomes an infinite, self-sustaining truth based on Faith. It will always be tested and analytically dissected which in the unforgiving reality of self-defeating logic will lead to a despair and nihilism. <br><br>A while ago I was skimming summaries of Jung (yeah I should probably just read the primary texts but oh well) and it talked about his definition of introversion vs. extroversion. Which was highly illuminating. The real root of the definition, is which way information flows. Whether it&#039;s primarily suited towards the self (subjective) or external (objective). In reality it has nothing to do with parties or social battery or whatever (although those tend to be manifestations of the dichotomy). Basically, if the external world is secondary to the internal world it would be introversion. Whereas if the internal world is secondary to the external, it is extroversion. I think an extroverted individual would be more inclined to rationality, logic, and scriptures. Whereas an introverted person would be more attuned to internal workings and intuitive based knowledge or &quot;feeling&quot;. Perhaps it&#039;s better to think about a synthesis of the two ideas. But that&#039;s just something to think about for later.<br><br>This is particularly why I think I&#039;ve been attracted to the monastic vocation for my whole life.

And I mean not only that this is an entirely unconvincing point, philosophically speaking. I also mean that it stems from an idea which is not easy to reconcile with the teaching that man is made in the image of God. John Damascus and Aquinas wrote about this well, I think. A great part of what constitutes our being-images is that we have reason, unlike any other animals. I don&#039;t think that God gave us reason, if reason will &quot;always test and dissect&quot; until we have despair and nihilism. Also, I don&#039;t think that reason is that flawed as you claim! It is a gift of God, and it determines what we are. We are reasonable animals. And even if angels or demons might be much smarter than we are, I don&#039;t think that our use of reason is so limited that it would necessarily lead us away from God. I even think that philosophy and theology can be ways of worshipping your creator with your mind. What do you make of the beatific vision? Isn&#039;t the beatific vision some form of worshipping God with your mind, through knowing and understanding (!) God? And a very beautiful one at that, if not the most beautiful one even?

I think they are fine, but the issue it building your faith on these arguments. God is something completely above, by virtue of the fact that his existence is paradoxical. Jesus is both god and man, infinite and finite. God is three distinct persons in one, without delimitation. We are insignificant and mortal (materially speaking), yet we are the center of attention for an incorporeal and immortal being. Embracing this paradox and absurdity is the beginning of faith. Faith begins where reason leaves off. But more than that, it completely runs circles around logic. No level of ontological argumentation and rhetoric will make any of it make sense, or accepting it any easier. <br><br>I wouldn&#039;t say that reason and logic are bad, but they are creations of our own mind. As finite humans we understand according to our senses, these senses are limited, and to a certain extent self-referential. Of course mathematics perfectly describes reality. Because the same mind that perceives reality also created the rules for mathematics. We know logic is limited, given that we can formally prove these for example godel&#039;s theroems. We also know that logic is not necessarily intuitive at all times, higher dimensional mathematics is a great example of that. Further logic can come to inherently paradoxical conclusions (also godels theorems, but there are many mathematical paradoxes). <br><br>There is a possibility that I am misunderstanding quite a bit of what I am reading. I&#039;m still reading the preliminary works of real analysis and elementary abstract algebra.

This is applied after the fact. Assuming that you believe in God, yes this is a logical statement to make.

You use rational apologetics to get 99% of the way to God, to make a 1% leap of faith, and then use that faith to clean up whatever else doesn&#039;t fit. It&#039;s applied after the fact, completely beyond the realm of pure rationality and logic. It just doesn&#039;t seem like you can argue that in good faith.<br><br>I think there is a mutual unintelligibly between us, given that our perception of things intuitively seems to be radically different, and we are both disagreeing on a major, life-affirming choice of belief<br><br><a href=\"#p21668287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21668287</a><br>This isn&#039;t very convincing..

When I said that Catholics use the Vulgate, I meant that they use the Vulgate in the Liturgy. This decision was made, when the liturgy of the roman church was still almost universally in latin, and the Vulgate was considered that it should become the golden standard, and encouraged to be used by all theologians alike. This decision to use the vulgate in the liturgy remained, even when people started to celebrate in the vernacular, also because initially the vernacular mass should be nothing else than just a translated form of the old latin mass. (Certain regions celebrated the Tridentine Rite in the vernacular even before the Novus Ordo was celebrated in the vernacular.)

I don&#039;t read much Greek, but I can compare the Vulgate to some translations into modern languages. What I find really interesting is how for example the word &quot;fiat&quot; pops up in places where the modern translations do not always render it with the same word. Examples:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dixit: Fiat lux. Et lux facta est.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum et Verbum caro factum est </span><br>[actually from the Angelus, so not sure if that counts, but the fiat-factum parallel to the passage passage from Genesis is striking and it illustrates my point rather well]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fiat voluntas tua</span><br><br>I think that something profound can be learned by realizing that in some way Mary is becoming alike to God in some quality of holiness through doing exactly the oposite what the creator did when he said the same word &quot;fiat&quot;: God ordered, Mary obeyed orders. Jesus teaches us to obey the will of the Father. But for the Father it is good to order, while for us it is good to obey, since this means that everyone takes the place assigned to one. I should not order or say &quot;non serviam&quot;, but rather I should say &quot;fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum&quot;. I could not have realized this if I didn&#039;t read the Latin text, as the languages which I speak all use different words here, wheras the Vulgate uses &quot;fiat&quot;. <br>It is things like these, why I really love the Vulgate and consider Jerome&#039;s act of translating the Greek into the Latin as an act of creating art.", "time": 1676625831, "resto": 21663771}, {"no": 21671316, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)04:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663771</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Ignatius Catholic Study Bible New Testament RSV 2nd Edition</span><br>Don&#039;t recommend a Bible-version for pederasts.

But outside of that I see no way how one could believe anything, without grasping it and taking it to be true. Therefore, in some sense, there is no faith without theology. The best someone like Kierk-anon can do is to argue for a &quot;minimal&quot; theology, but he cannot eliminate theology without eliminating faith.

From the unenlightened perspective it&#039;s a pointer that misleads many, I assume this is why the Buddha avoided teaching it.

Buddhist way to nirvana is by training the attention function of the mind/brain such that we can use it as a tool to examine our mind and break the pattern/chain of karma/causation. <br>Nominally, the beefy karma leads your mind to have delusions about the nature of reality, which then at the end of your life, when your mind is grasping for a second life, clings to various emotional aspects, and then rebirth happens. <br>But with a trained mind, the part of the mind that &quot;clings&quot; is no longer functioning. The part of the mind that inferences from the karma/mental habits directly is stalled and the attention center of the mind puts a mental fire wall. On top of that, the previously strong mental habits aren&#039;t an issue since the attention center have been honed in over time to break down old karma/habits. <br><br>In short, skillful input (perception) + (weakened) karma -&gt; (attention firewall) -&gt; clear consciousness -&gt; (clinging aspect abolished) -&gt; clear mind -&gt; no rebirth, no formation of new karma<br><br>vs<br><br>unfiltered input + bulk of old karma -&gt; muddied consciousness -&gt; unclear mind -&gt; new karma -&gt; rebirth", "time": 1676595202, "resto": 21668443}, {"no": 21669442, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)19:55:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21669434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21669434</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unfiltered input + bulk of old karma -&gt; muddied consciousness -&gt; unclear mind -&gt; new karma -&gt; clinging -&gt; rebirth</span><br>forgot the clinging part, which leads to rebirth", "time": 1676595313, "resto": 21668443}, {"no": 21669515, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)20:13:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21669434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21669434</a><br><a href=\"#p21669442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21669442</a><br>so what happens with no rebirth?", "time": 1676596388, "resto": 21668443}, {"no": 21669580, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)20:24:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21669515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21669515</a><br>Its the final end of chain of suffering, at the death of the body.

Technology can still be a very helpful tool for communication, data processing, information search, etc. I believe most of the tech that anti-tech people rebel against is propagandist, controlling tech, that shows you what it thinks will keep you hooked, gobbles up attention, harvest your data and polarizes society. Twitter would be an example: imagine a twitter-like interface in which a timeline would be sorted temporally (not algorithmically), you can only have friends that are in close proximity to you, there are no likes (so there is no incentive to post clickbaity articles for popularity)... This could be a useful tool to serve as, for example, a local bulletin board for a neighborhood (things that are lost and found, events/parties close-by, organizing cleanups/garage sales...)<br>Now compare this to how current-day Twitter actually works. These are all design choices. Facebook implemented red notification bubbles (red=danger) and notifications for being liked/tagged on purpose. They might state that their mission is to &#039;connect you with your friends&#039;, but that statement doesn&#039;t ring true anymore when you&#039;re a public company that has to make a profit for shareholders.<br>In my personal opinion, tech can still be a worthwhile tool to help humanity, especially if it&#039;s non-profit, local, anonymous, non-complex (no algorithms), uniting and transparent in design. The extent to which tech should be tolerated in this &#039;movement&#039; is up for discussion; every movement has their extremists and moderates. Some anons will probably advocate for computer and smartphone use, but making things open source and self-hosted. Others will stop at nothing to attain a forest hut without internet.

Next are unions between French and Europeans, with 7,300 mixed marriages (22%), followed by those between French citizens and people of Sub-Saharan African nationality, with 4,900 mixed marriages (14%).<br><br>The distribution of mixed marriages celebrated in France by nationality of the foreign spouse has changed significantly since the 1970s. Marriages between French and Italians or Spaniards were still among the most numerous at the end of the 1970s: in 1977, they represented nearly a third (31%) of mixed marriages. Their importance dropped sharply in the 1980s and since 2002, fewer than 1,500 mixed marriages involving a person of Spanish or Italian nationality have been celebrated each year. In 2015, these marriages represent only 4% of mixed marriages.<br><br>Mixed marriages involving a nationality from the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, or Tunisia) have seen two significant spikes. First, they increased rapidly from the end of the 1980s. In 1987, 5,700 mixed marriages involved a person of Algerian, Tunisian or Moroccan nationality, or 27% of the mixed marriages celebrated that year; four years later, in 1991, their number had more than doubled to 12,900 marriages, or 39% of the mixed marriages of the year. The number of mixed marriages decreased thereafter and increased again to 20,900 marriages in 2003, representing 44% of the year&#039;s mixed marriages in France. The number of marriages involving a person of non-Maghrebi nationality has fluctuated in much the same way.<br><br>These changes partly reflect changes in migration flows. After the Second World War, immigration came mainly from European countries: Italy and Spain in particular. Portuguese migrants arrived a little later, in the 1960s and 1970s.

Newer generations will just accept it as a given - they won&#039;t have known anything else, and the last dissidents will be some old guys whom their urban mothers and left-leaning teachers will invariably denounce as &#039;evil&#039; and &#039;sexually frustrated&#039;.

People don&#039;t read, and in the future they will read even less.

The old image of Paris as the Eiffel tower surrounded by attractive couples drinking wine and eating cheese will be long, long gone. <br>If a future archaeologist finds the records, he will just assume there was a new Muslim Conquest and the French were defeated in war by Arab hordes until they became a minority in France itself through endless rape and pillage. <br>But, as I said, it will be just like Colombia, Peru, or Brazil. People will live in it. Some will be happy, some will be sad, some will be rich, some will be poor. It&#039;s precisely this lack of a real disaster, precisely this lack of something actually terrible - an actual Arab horde -, that will prevent the native population from fighting.

I don&#039;t know, I guess it&#039;s possible that we just have different tastes in fantasy, but very rarely has sexual assault been used to good effect in stories, I think. It&#039;s often used as this thing that&#039;s just thrown in to make a character more tragic or as a Kick The Puppy moment, but it&#039;s a lot more sour than the other evil shit someone can do. I think because of how fantasy violence is, sexual assault is even more insidious and vile than straight up murder. Like, a villain killing a bunch of people is par for the course, but raping people is going to make people uncomfortable a lot of the time, and even if it didn&#039;t, I just feel like it&#039;s a sort of low blow, so to speak. I think having to rape someone makes a character more pathetic, so if that&#039;s what you want to go for then certainly, but it would either bungle up the magnificent bastard personality I want some antagonists to have, be completely out of pocket for the stalwart overlord types. That&#039;s just my feel on it, I guess.

Well, he went to prison for assaulting his dad with a hammer and his cellmate was a devout Christian who only went to jail because he confessed to all his crimes. He would have otherwise walked free, but his conviction it was the right thing to turn himself in was very strong. Anyway, this cellmate, Randy, I believe, would argue with David like no other Christian he had met before. He wouldn&#039;t back down. He questioned how David concluded he knew evolution was true, that the universe was not created, etc. Eventually, David realised he needed to read the Bible to effectively argue against Randy. He didn&#039;t know enough about what he was talking about.

Most of the self-proclaimed christians don&#039;t even believe in most the basic dogmas of the religion. Here&#039;s a little excerpt from The Catechism of the Crisis on the Church:<br><br>Many statistics for the US can be found in Kenneth C. Jones&#039;s Index of Leading Catholic Indicators. For example, 77% of American Catholics in 1999 did not believe one must attend Mass on Sunday to be a good Catholic. Only 17% of young Catholics in America believe the priesthood should be restricted to males. Only 10% of Catholic elementary school religion teachers agree with the Church&#039;s teaching on artificial birth control. A 1992 poll in Der Spiegel showed that only 56% of Germans believe in the existence of God, 38% in his omnipotence, 30% in original sin, 29% that Jesus is the Son of God, and 24% in the existence of hell.7 Likewise catastrophic is the situation among Catholics. Only 43% of them believe in the fundamental dogma of the Resurrection of Christ. Of those who attend Mass on Sundays, only 55% believe in the Virgin Birth and only 44% recognize papal infallibility. Amongst all Catholics only 32% believe in papal infallibility.

In addition his face was almost without flaw\u2014a good face as well as a beautiful one, and when he lifted his hat, which he did just then to a passing lady, I saw that his head was covered with little golden curls growing close to the scalp.<br><br>\u201cGood gracious!\u201d I said to my friend, with whom I was walking, \u201cwhy, that fellow looks like a statue of Apollo come to life.

They call him \u2018the Greek god\u2019; but look at the other one, he\u2019s Vincey\u2019s (that\u2019s the god\u2019s name) guardian, and supposed to be full of every kind of information. They call him \u2018Charon.\u2019\u201d I looked, and found the older man quite as interesting in his way as the glorified specimen of humanity at his side. He appeared to be about forty years of age, and was I think as ugly as his companion was handsome. To begin with, he was shortish, rather bow-legged, very deep chested, and with unusually long arms. He had dark hair and small eyes, and the hair grew right down on his forehead, and his whiskers grew right up to his hair, so that there was uncommonly little of his countenance to be seen.

He confined himself to his Brooklyn apartment, obsessively translating and retranslating the same short passage from Rousseau\u2019s \u201cConfessions.\u201d A decade earlier, a mobster named Charlie Dark had attacked Phaedo and his wife. Phaedo was beaten to within an inch of his life; Mary was set on fire, and survived just five days in the I.C.U. By day, Phaedo translated; at night, he worked on a novel about Charlie Dark, who was never convicted. Then Phaedo drank himself senseless with Scotch. He drank to drown his sorrows, to dull his senses, to forget himself. The phone rang, but he never answered it. Sometimes, Holly Steiner, an attractive woman across the hall, would silently enter his bedroom, and expertly rouse him from his stupor. At other times, he made use of the services of Aleesha, a local hooker. Aleesha\u2019s eyes were too hard, too cynical, and they bore the look of someone who had already seen too much. Despite that, Aleesha had an uncanny resemblance to Holly, as if she were Holly\u2019s double. And it was Aleesha who brought Roger Phaedo back from the darkness. One afternoon, wandering naked through Phaedo\u2019s apartment, she came upon two enormous manuscripts, neatly stacked. One was the Rousseau translation, each page covered with almost identical words; the other, the novel about Charlie Dark. She started leafing through the novel. \u201cCharlie Dark!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI knew Charlie Dark! He was one tough cookie. That bastard was in the Paul Auster gang. I\u2019d love to read this book, baby, but I\u2019m always too lazy to read long books. Why don\u2019t you read it to me?\u201d And that is how the ten-year silence was broken.

You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.

They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to return home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.&quot; </span><br>Achilles doesn&#039;t say a word about his own girl.

Or, that Nietzsche only conceived his criticisms of Wagner in the context of his universal fame and support, while privately, he declared Wagner to &#039;have been the greatest benefactor of my life&#039;, and that their names &#039;will always be associated in the names of men&#039;.

That you unthinkingly took them on shows how little you understand him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche\u2019s criticisms of Wagner are read and discussed. There is no reason why such readers should be music-lovers, though. They are therefore not normally in a position to take an independently critical view of Nietzsche\u2019s criticism. Even more to the point, they are often lacking in any serious understanding of Wagner\u2019s intellectual capacity and influence and they mistake him for a lesser figure than Nietzsche. They frequently accept and absorb Nietzsche\u2019s disparagements of Wagner at their face value, and then voice these as their own.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

This question is addressed in the Republic. In the first place, obeying law is a phantom of true justice (443c), and in the second place, while the hypothetical philosopher of the hypothesized city of the Republic owes something to his city insofar as it reared him *as* a philosopher (520a-b), this isn&#039;t true of Athens. Ergo, the reasons for allowing Athens to put him to death, while still mysterious, are not those expressed in the Crito, which is an argument for a non-philosopher (see Crito&#039;s lack of participation in Phaedo, and his incredulity throughout the Euthydemus towards Socrates).<br><br>As for his paying attention to death, he clearly in that passage means with respect only to whether he would be put to death, since, as per Phaedo, philosophizing is practicing death and dying.", "time": 1676473016, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21662049, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)09:58:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21662040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21662040</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;by the action of the any</span><br>*many", "time": 1676473118, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21662907, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)13:44:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21657454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21657454</a><br>I didn&#039;t read any other posts but from what I remember my favorite interpretation was that Socrates was getting old and decided to martyr himself for philosophy by making a mockery of the court system.", "time": 1676486678, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21663611, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:24:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661577</a><br>Yeah.

So I&#039;ll offer a different tact:<br><br>Plato alludes to the trial in other dialogues, by either setting or foreshadowing in discussion (Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Phaedo all take place around the trial; Theaetetus, Gorgias, Republic, Meno all allude to the philosopher not being able to persuade the many in a court or the dangers philosophers might be exposed to). If Plato had wanted, for the purposes of maintaining any coherent set of teachings, he would&#039;ve been able to rework passages from the dialogues, destroy dialogues, or offer something not far from commentary on dialogues via subsequent writings, keeping what he wanted and changing or ridding himself of what he came to differ with.

Get like 5-20 chapters into the Greek (just so you have some basic familiarity and basic vocabulary to work with, even if it&#039;s just recognizing simple single-clause sentences) and start reading Plato with a parallel edition that has literal English translation, and see how much of the Greek you can follow. The main difficult stuff will be all the indirect speech. But you can learn a LOT of vocabulary and race past the textbook/classroom environment&#039;s teaching of it by doing this, because you actually care about what you&#039;re learning/reading and aren&#039;t just memorizing abstract lists at the ends of chapters for the sake of tests. Also, you will get a ton of practice with core syntactical and grammatical structures, like subordinating conjunctions. Just do this for fun with no expectations whatsoever, tell your brain that you&#039;re just reading Plato for Plato&#039;s sake and &quot;also glancing at the Greek,&quot; so that it doesn&#039;t feel like a chore or an additional assignment. You will soak up way more than you think this way, and this will both aid your progress in the course and give you a massive boost to REALLY reading Plato when you make even further progress in the course and reach the level where you theoretically should be able to translate.<br><br>Also remember, reading Greek is always hard. Don&#039;t wait for that magic moment when it becomes easy, or when you finally know &quot;enough&quot; stuff that translating becomes automatic. You will ALWAYS be looking stuff up, always thinking about the multiple ways of translating a sentence and trying to figure out the correct or most plausible way based on context. Learn to love this and do it every day and you will get better and better, and in years you will be a real reader of Greek. Hate it or fear it, because of a misguided assumption that it means you still suck at Greek and should feel bad about yourself, and you will never really learn Greek.<br><br>Greek is a fucking mess and the only way to have fun is to just jump in and have fun as soon as you feel even a slight ability to do so.

It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening.

However, it might be that if the Athenians understood no difference between not believing in the gods of the city and atheism, it might be more probable that Socrates and Plato were atheists by such a definition. As pointed out at <a href=\"#p21665621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665621</a>, you do have expressions in the dialogues that do suggest Socrates was guilty of impiety, some examples being:<br><br>- The argument in the Apology with Meletus, where Socrates lures him into calling him an outright atheist. The alternative that Socrates offers beforehand was in fact the actual charge, not believing in the gods of the city and introducing new divinities. Socrates notably does not defend himself by asserting he worships the Olympians, but rather that, since Meletus knows about his daimonion, that&#039;s sufficient proof that he&#039;s not an atheist. But, again, this dodges the actual charge, since 1) the daimonion by Socrates&#039; argument could still be a novel introduction, and 2), he at one point equates daimonions with heroes, but this leads to the absurdity that Achilles, who died and went to Hades, qualifies to be functionally a god.<br><br>- The already mentioned Euthyphro&#039;s dilemma, where either piety is irrational ad no worship of the gods can help you, or there&#039;s some Form making the pious lovable, in which case you don&#039;t need the gods when you can lok to the Form. This in addition to his expressed irritation in the traditional myths at the beginning.<br><br>- Socrates&#039; denial that Eros is a god in the Symposium (and the fact that Phaedrus, Eryximachus, Alcibiades, Critias, and Charmides were all Socratic associates implicated in either desecration of the Herms, or blasphemy of the Mysteries).<br><br>- Socrates&#039; assertion in the Theaetetus that Homer and the poets concealed a teaching about Becoming being sovereign.<br><br>- The Republic moves from &quot;the gods&quot; to &quot;the god&quot; to &quot;the Idea of the Good&quot; and then back to &quot;the god&quot;. No room for Olympians. Not to mention the critique of the traditional view of the gods.<br><br>- Timaeus&#039; cosmology denies the account of Hesiod&#039;s Theogony, and the gods are replaced with a demiurge.<br><br>- Socrates is led to admit in Parmenides that an implication of the Forms is that if there are gods, they&#039;re with the Forms and don&#039;t have knowledge of us.", "time": 1676530425, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665799, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:56:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665790</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but this leads to the absurdity that Achilles, who died and went to Hades, qualifies to be functionally a god.</span><br>Heracles became a god", "time": 1676530595, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665808, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665799</a><br>Did Achilles, who Socrates explicitly refers to after his argument with Meletus?", "time": 1676530798, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665835, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)02:09:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665808</a><br>He had a cult and was sacrificed to, yes.

Throughout the Biblical narrative God consistently promotes the lower to raise them up higher while humbling the proud by casting them down. Esau is also exceedingly impatient and this becomes his folly. He sells his own birthright for a single bowl of stew and hastily marries insufferable Hittite thots that do nothing except cause grief to his family. All in all, the reason Jacob was favored isn&#039;t just related to his attitude and characteristics, but has to do with him even being willing to follow God in the first place. It is Jacob who has the dream of the stairway to Heaven and who makes the altar to commemorate it, and it is Jacob who even decides to walk with God at all. Meanwhile, Esau&#039;s exact relationship with God is unclear and his descendants do not appear to honor God at all.", "time": 1676590922, "resto": 21661155}, {"no": 21669124, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)18:43:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21668991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21668991</a><br>Man.. the projection.

Just as &quot;priest&quot; has baggage, it should now be apparent that &quot;scholar&quot; does too. This isn&#039;t irrelevant trivia. Your point is that Jacob is representative of a certain type: the scholar. My point is that he is a terrible representative of such a type. Applied to Plato or Aristotle, the predicate would be a correct one. Not exactly sure what that has to do with brainwashing. This is /lit/ of course words are relevant, and you&#039;re showing me a staggering lack of command over them. Obviously, if your making a case it should be rigorous enough to withstand basic scrutiny. Not to mention, my problem wasn&#039;t just with words but with the concept/symbol/structure/whatever you are thinking in terms of. The things that the words signify. Scholar is a poor fit for Jacob. It is doubtful that what the story represents is the triumph of the scholar over the warrior. Not to mention, Jacob didn&#039;t come off as particularly cerebral and he did manual labor for his Uncle for a long span of time.

Yeats, who was a senator later in life, made a famous speech opposing the bill banning divorce, pointing out that the new nationalism was excluding the Anglo-Irish from society - and hence cutting out some of the most educated, creative and intelligent people in the country who had a long history of governing it (tbf he was correct to some degree)<br><br>This lasted really until 2008 when the political order in the country began to shift somewhat as the economy melted down (the movie Calvary is a very good depiction of the aftermath of this) and the Church fucked up one too many times and lost the good will of the people.<br><br>But tbqh a much better outcome would have been that the United Irishmen gained independence and we just accepted that Prods were now part of the general makeup of the country and moved on.

Hence, Ambrose says (De Virgin. i, 5) that &quot;virginal chastity is integrity free of pollution.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now venereal pleasures offer three points for consideration. The first is on the part of the body, viz. the violation of the seal of virginity. The second is the link between that which concerns the soul and that which concerns the body, and this is the resolution of the semen, causing sensible pleasure. The third is entirely on the part of the soul, namely the purpose of attaining this pleasure. Of these three the first is accidental to the moral act, which as such must be considered in reference to the soul. The second stands in the relation of matter to the moral act, since the sensible passions are the matters of moral acts. But the third stands in the position of form and complement, because the essence of morality is perfected in that which concerns the reason. Since then virginity consists in freedom from the aforesaid corruption, it follows that the integrity of the bodily organ is accidental to virginity; while freedom from pleasure in resolution of the semen is related thereto materially; and the purpose of perpetually abstaining from this pleasure is the formal and completive element in virginity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As stated above (A[1]), the formal and completive element in virginity is the purpose of abstaining from venereal pleasure, which purpose is rendered praiseworthy by its end, in so far, to wit, as this is done in order to have leisure for Divine things: while the material element in virginity is integrity of the flesh free of all experience of venereal pleasure. Now it is manifest that where a good action has a special matter through having a special excellence, there is a special kind of virtue: for example, magnificence which is about great expenditure is for this reason a special virtue distinct from liberality, which is about all uses of money in general. Now to keep oneself free from the experience of venereal pleasure has an excellence of its own deserving of greater praise than keeping oneself free from inordinate venereal pleasure. Wherefore virginity is a special virtue being related to chastity as magnificence to liberality.</span>", "filename": "aquinas chad", "ext": ".png", "w": 523, "h": 533, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676491433084408, "time": 1676491433, "md5": "zXouRuGr0nEuxZGpwfYTlQ==", "fsize": 80389, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663313, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:08:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663233</a><br>Look at the schnoz on dat hoe", "time": 1676491694, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663324, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663285</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is Indonesia</span>", "time": 1676491844, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663325, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:10:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude, it doesn&#039;t matter if any key can open the lock, just trust your life and salary with it.</span>", "time": 1676491848, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663330, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:11:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663293</a><br>Wow yikes sweaty", "filename": "legreenface", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 214, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676491888730432, "time": 1676491888, "md5": "YGHt9sNUsYm0/MvkLXqFYA==", "fsize": 15605, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663336, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:12:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663301</a><br>I hate reading him so much, but the ideas are ok somewhat.", "time": 1676491967, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663359, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663214</a><br>Were all of them white?", "time": 1676492240, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21664000, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:40:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663214</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Do you think it MATTERS with how many people a woman has slept with!?</span><br>Yes, because it shows a lack of commitment, loyalty and trust for a long term relationship to function properly.

Just sit down and read it.<br><br>Most of the fun in math comes once you get to the formalism. Proofs and logic are the actual substance of math, and they are also where most of the fun is.<br><br>The bad thing is that mathematical logic and formalism can seem pretty alien if you&#039;ve never actually had to do it before. The good thing is that the basic concepts and techniques formal math logic/proofs are very simple, and it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to pick up.<br><br>The very first thing you need to do is pick up any kind of intro to proofs book. Just sit down and start reading, do the problems. Once you get to grips with proofs, you can move on to deeply and rigorously learn whatever you want to in math, provided you have an understanding of the prerequisites.<br><br>I recommend starting with the intro to proofs book, and then try to get to grips with calculus.<br><br>You say you&#039;re at a middle school level, which I take it as you just being self-deprecating. If you&#039;re at the level of high school algebra, and you can solve basic equations and whatnot, then go pick up a precalculus book. I recommend Stewart Precalculus. Just read through the whole thing, a little bit each day, do enough problems until you think you understand the material.<br><br>Once you&#039;re done with precalc, go pick up any standard Calculus textbook. Learn it up to right before Calc III topics. With precalc and the calc you should be mainly focused on intuitive understanding, but be sure to follow along with the proofs and note how you use mathematical logic in an implicit way when you&#039;re doing any problem solving. If you want, you can learn the Calc III topics too.<br><br>Then, go back. You&#039;ll probably be at an advanced enough understanding to rigorously re-learn mathematical logic. I recommend at this point to pick up Suppes&#039; Axiomatic Set Theory. It&#039;s pretty dense, sure, but stick with it and it will open up serious new vistas of understanding.<br><br>Then, go for a rigorous understanding of Calculus. Spivak&#039;s Calculus is great, as well as Apostol&#039;s Calculus. Note that Apostol has Calc III topics plus some linear algebra and also some introductory analysis stuff, I think.<br><br>After that, you have a good solid foundation within higher mathematics. Go forth! Maybe Linear Algebra or Discrete Math next. Eventually, you&#039;ll want to tackle Analysis and Diff. Eq., but so far that&#039;s above my pay grade.<br><br>Good luck! Math can be a whole lot of fun. I also recommend you mess around with some random problems on the internet once you get to grips with the basics of proofs. The Putnam problems are very tough, but fun.

As a rational human being, it is my desires that are paramount. Since as a reasoning animal I have the power to choose, and since I am not bound by any demand to subordinate my desires to that of an outside party who wishes to use force or guilt to make me sacrifice my values to their values or to the values of some purely hypothetical collective, it is what I want that is imperative in this transaction. However, since I am dealing with you, and you are also a rational human being, under capitalism we have an opportunity to mutually satisfy our values in a way that leaves both of us richer and more fully human. You participate in the project of affirming my values by providing me with the coffee I want, and by paying you I am not only incentivizing you for the transaction, but giving you a chance to excel as a human being in the field of producing coffee. You do not produce the coffee because I am demanding it, or because I will use force against you if you do not, but because it most thoroughly represents your own values, particularly the value of creation. You would not make this coffee for me if it did not serve you in some way, and therefore by satisfying my desires you also reaffirm yourself. Insofar as you make inferior coffee, I will reject it and you will go bankrupt, but insofar as your coffee is truly excellent, a reflection of the excellence in your own soul and your achievement as a rationalist being, it will attract more people to your store, you will gain wealth, and you will be able to use that wealth further in pursuit of excellence as you, rather than some bureaucracy or collective, understand it.

It was published posthumously because the author was supposedly unsatisfied with its ending, which is reasonable because it&#039;s rather abrupt.<br><br>Even though this was one of the books voted for in in this second month of my ill-fated reading experiment, now ended, I strongly considered not finishing it early on several times. It&#039;s not that it&#039;s badly written, or even the racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, and other derogatory material. I simply found it to be terrible satire, in both the frame story and the the story itself. It&#039;s definitely worth an &quot;AUUUGGGHHHHH&quot; rating. Maybe it would be tolerable if I saw as it more than contrarianism for the sake of it.<br><br>Almost of all the novel explores the idea of &quot;What if Western Traditions were inverted?&quot; and also what if there were dinosaurs still around. Within the context of the story, it doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. It tries to present an entirely serious satire explained in detail about their customs and general way of life, but I couldn&#039;t get past how they hadn&#039;t entirely collapsed from attrition. It&#039;s possible that the speculative ideology is the entire point, but if it is, it&#039;s maddening and I didn&#039;t care about it at all. Unfortunately it falls into several different categories that I tend to dislike.<br><br>The frame story is somewhat better metacommentary on the work itself, which they&#039;re reading aloud. It alternates between academic lecturing and literary criticism. I don&#039;t know nearly enough about literary history to say whether this was an early example of postmodernism, or if it falls into some earlier tradition. The characters speculate what others would think about the book and provide arguements both for and against possible theories. This is mildly amusing, but is irrelevant compared to how atrocious I found the rest to be.<br><br>What this made me think about the most though what how even at this time it was difficult to locate a reasonably unknown place where some previously unknown civilization could exist. I wonder if this sort of concern was a primary driver of the secondary world fiction fantasy that was to come. The world was no longer mysterious, exotic, or had a sense of wonder, so elsewhere had to be created. The concept is still used today, but it almost always entirely abandons any sense of realism or plausibility.<br><br>That also relates in a way to the racism, where a people are described in an entirely monstrous and grotesque way, and while unpleasant, shows how alien the narrator thought them to be. That too lost appeal and fantastical races and other alien sorts had to be created to approximate the the disgust that was felt. That too seems be quickly losing appeal. Perhaps it&#039;s now beliefs rather than being. That&#039;s just idle speculation on my part though.<br><br>Rating: 1/5", "filename": "45157388", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 313, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676587896667720, "time": 1676587896, "md5": "CR2AY/l8NwPn3Va5vYm2gQ==", "fsize": 63709, "resto": 21666424, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21668905, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)17:53:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21668874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21668874</a><br>Never used Discord (owned by tencent who is owned by china) and while I liked bakker years ago, after he said he was never going to publish again after the publishing house dropped him, I eased off posting about it.

The tale of this young wizard and his hardships and coming to terms with his own darkness is one that has been redone again and again, from Rowling to Jordan to Goodkind, and so far, despite adding gobs of length and endless details, no one has managed to improve upon it.<br><br>Though she isn&#039;t the first to explore the Bildungsroman-as-Fantasy (Mervyn Peake precedes her), he was an author who eschewed symbolic magic, and so has been duly ignored by most authors and readers in the genre. Le Guin&#039;s approach is much more familiar, able comfortably to abide alongside Moorcock, Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis.<br><br>Yet her work has none of the condescension or moralizing that mark the last two, nor the wild pulp sentiment of the first. Her world unfolds before us, calmly and confidently, as we might expect from the daughter of noted anthropologists.<br><br>As is often the case in her work, we get poignant asides on human nature, but overall, her depiction here is less novel than in, for example, the Hainish cycle. There is something flat in the plot progression, and as has been the case with every Le Guin book I have read, I found myself longing for her to take things a little further, to expand and do something risky. Often she seems just on the cusp, but rarely takes the step.<br><br>Part of the flatness is the depiction of the characters, who fall victim to the &#039;show, don&#039;t tell&#039; problem. Again and again, we are told of conversations characters had, of how they reacted, of whether they were clever or unsettling, but we never actually see these conversations take place. Many times, the conversations would not have taken any longer to read than the descriptions of them, so why Le Guin chose to leave so much of her story as an outline of action is puzzling and disappointing.<br><br>Fundamentally, what characters do is not interesting. What they do does not differentiate them. What is most important is how they do it--their emotional response, their choice of words, the little pauses and moments of doubt. At the end of the day, the four musketeers are all men in the same uniform, with mustaches, dueling and warring and seducing women, but they each go about these things in such distinct ways that we could never mistake one for the other.<br><br>The import of personality is also shown in Greek tragedy, where we know what is going to befall the character (the plot), but we have no idea how they will react when it happens. All the tension lies within the character&#039;s response, not with the various external events that inspire it.<br><br>So I found it very frustrating that, again and again, Le Guin didn&#039;t let the characters do their own talking, and so I often felt estranged from them, that I didn&#039;t know them or understand their motivations or interrelationships because the fundamental signs were missing.", "time": 1676615768, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670887, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:37:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670872</a><br>Thanks anon :)<br><a href=\"#p21670884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670884</a><br>And for this wherever you found it.", "time": 1676615876, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670889, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:38:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670868</a><br><a href=\"#p21670884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670884</a><br>As others have pointed out, Le Guin covers a lot of ground in a short span, and perhaps it was a desire to make things brief and straightforward that caused her to take the words from her characters&#039; mouths, but again, it seems backwards to me. I would rather see a story shortened by taking out specifics and leaving promising implications instead of the other way around. A single, well-written action or turn of phrase can reveal more about a character than paragraphs of narration.<br><br>In her influential essay on fantasy From Elfland to Poughkeepsie, she talks about how Dunsany does not really use dialogue the way other authors do--that indeed, she finds it difficult to locate any sustained conversations in The King of Elfland&#039;s Daughter . Perhaps on some level, she was trying to imitate his style. But, while it works brilliantly for him, it does not serve her as well.<br><br>The main reason for this is that Le Guin is much more a modern, psychological, realist author than Dunsany. Her fantasy setting is sensible, physical--it feels like a different place, a world like our world. Her characters are inhabitants of that world, the product of its cultures and history. So, when she removes their discourse and means of expression, she closes the reader&#039;s window onto the character&#039;s inner life.<br><br>Dunsany, on the author hand, takes a different approach: his worlds are dreamlike, the worlds of fairy tale. His story takes place in the clash between the possible and the impossible, the real and the dream. His characters are not self-contained psychological portraits of individuals, but symbols, appendages of the dreamland he weaves. So it makes sense that they do not express themselves through the dialogue of psychoanalysis, but through the instinctual pre-knowledge of the dreamer.<br><br>Indeed, Le Guin herself (in that same essay) talks about the danger of imitating Dunsany&#039;s style, that it is so unique, and his pen a master&#039;s, so that any attempt to recreate what we has done is bound to end in embarrassing failure. Yet, she also remarks, it&#039;s a stage most fantasists seem to go through: attempting to produce that sort of natural, lovely false-archaism. She managed to leave that behind, but now I wonder whether she didn&#039;t simply end up imitating another of Dunsany&#039;s stylistic modes without realizing it--one just as problematic to a thoroughly modern, anthropological writer.<br><br>What is most interesting about her story is how small and personal the central conflict is. Many authors in fantasy have tried to tackle the conflict of the &#039;Shadow Self&#039;, from Tolkien&#039;s Gollum to the twin alter-egos of Anderson&#039;s The Broken Sword , but none have used it as a representation of the internal conflict of the adolescent which must be overcome in order to transition to adulthood.<br><br>By so perfectly aligning the symbolic magical conflict in her story with the central theme, Le Guin creates a rare example of narrative unity in fantasy.", "time": 1676615884, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670893, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:39:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670887</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And for this wherever you found it.</span><br>Found it using goodreads, you know the one site that lets people talk about their thoughs about a book?", "time": 1676615950, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670895, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:39:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670887</a><br>It\u2019s from goodreads.", "time": 1676615972, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670901, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:40:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670893</a><br>Thanks I just like to come to the 4chan /lit/ board and talk about stuff in their relevant generals instead!", "time": 1676616043, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670908, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:42:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670901</a><br>Sounds really stupid and a waste of time.", "time": 1676616123, "resto": 21666424}, {"no": 21670934, "now": "02/17/23(Fri)01:48:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21670872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21670872</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tombs &gt; Farthest Shore &gt; Wizard &gt; the other 3</span><br>This desu. <br><br>I only read Wizard long time ago and recently decided to have another go and do the entire series.
