I downloaded WakingUp app, i did it every day until free period ended. Then i turned into non-guided meditation, but because i never read books about it, my method was similiar to WakingUp one and inspired by anon posts too - i breathe in and out with closed eyes, sometimes i count breaths but then i try to stop counting, and turn to &quot;passive observer&quot; of breaths - keeping concentration on breath, yet letting it flow automatically, without controlling it. Success of my method is various, sometimes i can do 10 or 15 minutes no problem, but often when i do 20minutes i get restless, my mind wanders and it starts to become uncomfortable. Anyway my method is probably most similiar to thing commonly called as &quot;mindfullness&quot; method - pleb shit.<br>Recently i read few chapters of pic related (McMindfullness) where guy writes &quot;mindfullness&quot; trend is created by bloodthirsty capitalists to help wagies cope. I thought this guy has a point. For example today i listened to guided mindfullness meditation on DailyYoga app, and not only it was strikingly similiar to WakingUp one it also had mantra like &quot;next time you will be in stressfull situation you will be calm and collected&quot;. Not only i felt dejavu (like i heard the same exact mantra before) but it sounds like clear cope for me - like stress is inevitable part of capitalism and your only choice is to &quot;deal with it&quot;. I also use &quot;yoga nidra&quot; guided meditation videos to help me sleep. I thought its pretty helpful for that but i also felt this vague feeling of sadness toward end of this recording. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mM<wbr>5Oks8yZc<br>She says something like &quot;imagine you are at the beautiful lake and you watch this big setting sun and you feel warm and calmness, and air is just like after the thunder, fresh and joyful&quot; and i had this image of office drones in their 4 walls who never see things like that, and they need to be hushed and told bedtime stories like children or else they risk getting nervous breakdown.

Some guy suggested &quot;Keeping the Breath in Mind&quot; as best &quot;true&quot; meditation manual. So i start to read it... I think in preface it had something about mantras and praying or something. And in first method guy says to inhale and say &quot;BUU&quot; than exhale and say &quot;DHAAA&quot; and some maybe usefull advice to find your breath comfortable so it will be easier to no longer control it. Thing is - i am not a buddhist, and i don&#039;t want to become one. I grew up in deeply religious family as a christian and even though i no longer attend church i dislike idea of converting to any other religion. Maybe i am even scared, if i get too deep into budhism i will get thrown into christian hell (years of indocrination must had some effect on me, and idea of sin is still real to me). Thing is i distrust christianity cause it&#039;s all about suffering and then eventual reward in heaven. There is no such thing as enlightment in christianity. They never teach you in church you will be happy alive if you stop caring about material things and dissapear inside yourself, its not about losing ego and being calm, but its about &quot;carrying your cross&quot; and shit. In that sense buddhism/hinduism seems more interesting to me, because there is some possibility of self-improvement, happiness here in the present. Not all about bowing before ever-present god who tries to make you kill your own son.<br>Anyway i heard about christian meditation and read bit about it, but it still feels fishy to me - you are supposed to concentrate on word of God? So you are supposed to memorize some Bible passage and &quot;meditate&quot; on it, just remind yourself of this quote over and over again? But then how is it meditation? Sounds like opposite of meditation to me, because you are constantly obsessing over thought (this single Bible quote or psalm), instead of &quot;letting go&quot; and just passive observing of physical processes of the body. How you can be passive observer if you have to constantly remind yourself of this &quot;word of god&quot;? But maybe its because of my misunderstanding of what meditation is and only knowing one variant of it.<br>So please guys can you recommend me some books about christian or secular meditation, that is not some cringe mindfulness marketing bullshit, but also not total buddhist bullshit?

Can soup be milk?<br>- Yes.<br>- And you - do you think a soup is anything cooked as a stock?<br>- According to Wikipedia, yes.<br>A smile of superiority appeared on the professor&#039;s face<br>- Ah yes, Wikipedia!<br>And after a moment&#039;s thought he adds:<br>- I have an example for you. Let&#039;s say you have a stock of vegetables and meat. You add pants, stones and sawdust in there. Will it be a soup?<br>- Of course not, professor.<br>- So soup is something else than stock with additives!<br>- I think you can&#039;t put it that way.<br>- But why not? After all, this definition is on Wikipedia.<br>Faced with the student&#039;s silence, the professor goes on:<br>- It doesn&#039;t help, does it? My brother was a Wikipedia moderator and died of bitterness not being able to define soup.<br>The student is still silent, so the professor adds<br>- You can&#039;t give an answer, can you?<br>To give the student a moment to think, the professor reaches for a glass from his desk and takes a sip of borscht.<br>- Let&#039;s start at the beginning boy. Is milk a dish?<br>- Well, no... it isn&#039;t.<br>- And when you add cereal in there is it a dish?<br>Without a moment&#039;s hesitation, the student answers<br>- Yes.<br>- Then what does being a dish depend on?<br>The student twitches all the way:<br>- On the method of preparation....<br>- Well, that&#039;s right. So it is the addition of the cereal that makes it a dish. Now tell me more son - is there a fruit soup in the world?<br>- There is Mr. Professor ...<br>- That is, fruit soup is present in the Universe. And it is, after all, the addition of pasta that creates, by analogy with cereal, a soup, right?<br>- Right.<br>- So spaghetti with sauce is a soup? Since adding cereal to warm milk makes soup, so does adding pasta to soup! And since adding pasta to compote makes soup, according to the rules of logic, adding it to tomato sauce also makes soup.<br>The student is again unable to find an answer....<br>- And are there stews, puddings, kisiels? All these foods that appear in the world around us and resemble soups without being them?<br>The student answers in a trembling voice<br>- They do appear.<br>- And are they soups?<br>Silence has fallen in the room, so the professor repeats the question<br>- If not, why not?<br>In the absence of an answer, the professor halts his step and begins to look around the auditorium. All the students freeze.<br>- Tell me - the lecturer turns to the next person<br>- Do you believe in the only correct definition of soup, that is, by enumeration?<br>- No professor, I don&#039;t believe it.<br>The firm tone of the answer catches the professor&#039;s attention. The older man turns to the student:<br>- Ahh, then why don&#039;t you suggest something better?<br>- Soup has no definition honestly.<br>The professor smiles slightly while looking at the student.

How are you going to explain this to me?<br>- The assumptions of your considerations are based on an incorrect use of language, the student explains. You believe that there are definitions of all the phrases we use by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for being something. There are similarities between words like the similarities between family members. Family members do not have a single characteristic that distinguishes them.

The professor looks at the student with eyes wide with disbelief. After a moment of silence, which to everyone seems to last an eternity, the professor chokes out:<br>- It seems that we need to look at how we use language when talking about games..........<br>So, you admit that certain definitions do not exist, and what&#039;s more, words that cannot be defined are an essential part of our everyday life. Now, Professor, tell me, is there such a thing as a common characteristic of all soups?<br>Unsure of the answer, the professor says:<br>-Being an element of a set of theories of soups defined by enumeration....<br>-And what determines assignment to this set? An arbitrary decision by the professor?

James was one of North America\u2019s first psychologists, and one of the first to take religion and mysticism seriously. In contrast with Freud, who characterized religion as fundamentally \u201cinfantile\u201d, James argued that \u201cGod is real because his effects on the human psyche are real\u201d (paraphrasing). And the truth of an idea, according to James, is judged by how it influences human action. He lauds religions like Buddhism and Christianity in which \u201cthe pessimistic elements are the most developed\u201d, as they presumably brace people to confront tragedy. He loves Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.<br><br>I think in this area JP owes more to James than to Jung, as his argument about the validity of Christianity is an inchoate version of James\u2019. I\u2019m not sure whether Peterson was actually directly influenced by James, or just came to similar conclusions by reading a bunch of boomer shit like Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell.<br><br>In general, I think in North America today there\u2019s a popular pragmatic revival of which Jordan Peterson is a part.

So Job is asking &quot;Does &#039;hallamut&#039; slime have any flavour?&quot;, this is a rhetorical question meaning that it has no flavour, shown by the previous line &quot;Can one eat tasteless foods without salt?&quot;<br><br>Several scholars have identified &#039;hallamut&#039; as a plant, but unfortunately Biblical commentators aren&#039;t botanists and use common names which could refer to several different species. A common identification is mallow, which usually refers to several edible species of the Malvaceae family which produce mucilage used in herbal medicines. Another plant candidate often cited is &quot;purslane&quot;, the name of several edible plants, usually species of the Portulaca or Claytonia genera. Clines (1989) confusingly refers to it as leguminous, despite none of the common Purslanes being in the legume family (Fabaceae). UBS (1980) interprets it as yet another plant, the edible succulent Suaeda asphaltica, which they confusingly call purslane. UBS (1980) also notes that Hebrew peasants might not have distinguished between different plants and that the same Hebrew word could also refer to Atriplex halimus, the Tree Purslane, which the book oddly calls mallow.<br><br>The edible plant interpretation is supported by the later Aramaic usage of the word &#039;hallamut&#039; to mean the &quot;juice of mallow&quot;, and by the possibly related word &#039;sam hilimitu&#039; (from the Amorite Alalakh tablets) referring to an unidentified substance associated with grains, so possibly an edible plant product.<br><br>Other scholars have identified it as the white of an egg, supported by the interpretation in the Aramaic Targum translation. Presumably raw egg white which is slimy and not very tasty. Yet another interpretation is that &#039;hallamut&#039; is cognate with the Arabic &#039;halum&#039; (halloumi) and would refer to the milky liquid exuded from raw soft cheese. A medieval rabbinic interpretation from the commentator Rashi is that it refers to saliva produced from eating strong-tasting foods such as garlic, he bases his view on etymological word play.<br><br>So what we know is that it was an edible liquid or slime without much taste, which Job uses to illustrate his lack of appetite for continuing either his suffering or argument with his friends.<br><br>Clines, David J.A.

A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called \u201cyoung bucks,\u201d in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille.

All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines. The black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet was delicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a doubt, but the velvet was delicious. Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she glanced at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance\u2014Kitty was never one of that throng\u2014when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky. He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom\u2014that is to say, a few couples who had started dancing\u2014he caught sight of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to directors of balls. Without even asking her if she cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist.

She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she was in the middle stage between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had sufficient self-possession to be able to observe. In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together. There\u2014incredibly naked\u2014was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky\u2019s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were. In that direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach. There, too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown. And he was there. Kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused Levin. With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and was even aware that he was looking at her.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cAnother turn, eh? You\u2019re not tired?\u201d said Korsunsky, a little out of breath.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cNo, thank you!\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhere shall I take you?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cMadame Karenina\u2019s here, I think ... take me to her.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWherever you command.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner, continually saying, \u201cPardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon, mesdames\u201d; and steering his course through the sea of lace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin\u2019s knees. Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna. Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin\u2019s knees, and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists. The whole gown was trimmed with Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black hair\u2014her own, with no false additions\u2014was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace. Her coiffure was not striking. All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples. Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.</span>", "time": 1668708119, "resto": 21268760}, {"no": 21268773, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)13:04:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21268770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21268770</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured her invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black, she felt that she had not fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her. And her black dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only the frame, and all that was seen was she\u2014simple, natural, elegant, and at the same time gay and eager.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her head slightly turned towards him.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cNo, I don\u2019t throw stones,\u201d she was saying, in answer to something, \u201cthough I can\u2019t understand it,\u201d she went on, shrugging her shoulders, and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty. With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty, signifying approval of her dress and her looks. \u201cYou came into the room dancing,\u201d she added.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis is one of my most faithful supporters,\u201d said Korsunsky, bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. \u201cThe princess helps to make balls happy and successful.

She expected him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him. He flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her own, and long afterwards\u2014for several years after\u2014that look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cPardon! pardon!

Definitely an eye-opener for the uninitiated.For a more balanced worldview I&#039;d recommend Ship of Fools by Tucker Carlson, The Divide and Griftopia by Matt Taibbi, Death of the West by Pat Buchanan, and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail. All great in their own right.<br><br>For some entertainment purposes, Hunter and The Turner Diaries are fun if not particularly well-written, and Siege reads like a schizophrenic&#039;s diary. If you&#039;re looking for mindless brutality written by folks exposed as actual federal agents for the express purpose of radicalizing potential domestic terrorists, Iron Gates (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called) is kind of a WN version of an Edward Lee book replete with rape and torture. Adjustment Day by Palahniuk is an ambitious and entertaining read, but the execution of a great idea admittedly leaves something to be desired.<br><br>If you want something heavier, go with just about anything from David Irving. Hitler&#039;s War is probably his masterpiece, but his Goebbels&#039;s biography is great as well. Hitler&#039;s Table Talk is also a good read, although I&#039;ve heard its veracity has been called into question on more than one occasion. Of course read Mein Kampf. Can&#039;t go wrong with Machiavelli either.<br><br>Saving the best for last, Jim Goad&#039;s Redneck Manifesto might be my all-time favorite book of any genre.

However, as soon as I got to uni and realised that girls actually existed (outside of internet pornography, which unfortunately had been my main exposure to them), I began to realise after about a year and a bit that I was lying to myself and was actually always attracted to girls. I sort of knew this, but I convinced myself that I was only capable of same-sex romantic attraction because that was all I had known previously, and it was also a convenient way of ignoring self-esteem issues which convinced me I wouldn\u2019t be capable of getting attractive girls. It actually took a girl \u2014 who unfortunately I wasn\u2019t interested in \u2014 taking me out on three dates until I realised that I could be attractive to some girls, and even then it took a couple of months to realise what I actually wanted and change my Tinder settings to women.<br>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m typical of most \u2018formerly homosexual\u2019 people at all, although the experience of people going to non-co-ed boarding schools and developing attractions to the same sex that they then grow out of is fairly common. I still feel attraction to feminine looking men, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that, I just don\u2019t act on it, mainly because there are a higher number of attractive women and also because having a woman in one\u2019s life is more of a sense of achievement and fulfilment. Check your digit ratios, whether you have gay voice, whether you have ever experienced attraction to women \u2014 if you have a high digit ratio and almost never experienced anything other than same-sex attraction then it might just be genetic and something you just have to accept about yourself, if you have low digit ratio and have experienced attraction to women before, it\u2019s more likely to be a case of inhibiting psychological factors.

faggot queen impulses by being adored and worshipped by those most capable of it, i.e. men.<br><br>The same fundamental explanation goes for his books, with all their boring bourgeois pseudo-transgression, expertly tip-toeing the exact line between a harmless eccentricity vis-a-vis social norms, attracting large crowds on account of its peculiarity and shocking nature to pearl-clutching normies, but never once crossing the line into real transgression, something that would alienate the normie crowds in his book. Oh wow, the character killed a cat and seems indifferent, very transgressive, such symbol.<br><br>However, this not being enough to satisfy his giant attention-whoring faggot queen impulses, he established the perfect situation for himself with his poorly attempted coup: either he would succeed and be the primus motor of a return to imperial Japan, or he would fail and spectacularly kill himself. Both options would secure him a place in the history books, satisfying his giant attention-whoring faggot queen impulses. It could not fail, or so Mishima thought.<br><br>In a pure show of ironic force crafted by the hand of God himself, his feeble 5&#039;1 body was not capable of producing enough volume in his voice, in the speech to instigate the coup, for the soldiers below the balcony to hear him - it cannot be stressed enough what a fundamental and metaphysical failure this was for the faggot queen who craved nothing but attention. One can only speculate, but it is possible that this alone was enough for his seppuku to be motivated by more than attention-whoring, that he felt, for once, actual shame. Even further getting blown the fuck out by God, his backup plan, that would honorably remove him from this world in a faggy-aesthetic way, failed - his secondary, who was to decapitate him after he had disemboweled himself, was too weak to do so, and tried three times to separate head from body, failing each time.<br><br>In short: he did it to satisfy his narcissist, faggot queen urges; what he attained instead was becoming a joke so sophisticated and perfect that it must have come about by divine intervention.", "time": 1668676495, "resto": 21254987}, {"no": 21268218, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)10:10:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21267352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21267352</a><br>Mishima eternally btfo", "time": 1668697848, "resto": 21254987}], "last_modified": 1668697848}, {"no": 21267750, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:40:14", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Audiobooks recommendation thread", "com": "What audiobooks can you recommend or listened to?", "filename": "CP6w2+wX8B3P6+Pi6t2ydViRRqGu19LAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "ext": ".png", "w": 80, "h": 33, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 33, "tim": 1668685214333708, "time": 1668685214, "md5": "z7aKkiOgnZYEVf6GSpxasw==", "fsize": 517, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "audiobooks-recommendation-thread", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21267759, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:43:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21267750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21267750</a><br>I&#039;d recommend you to listen to audiobooks and read at the same time (the same book obviously).<br><br>Your question is subjective, I don&#039;t know what your interests are.", "time": 1668685410, "resto": 21267750}, {"no": 21267764, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)06:46:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Steve Parker Audiobooks has the best audio performances og books that I&#039;ve ever heard.", "time": 1668685604, "resto": 21267750}, {"no": 21268145, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:40:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lonesome Dove", "time": 1668696039, "resto": 21267750}, {"no": 21268177, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:52:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The with books are really good darth bane and tarkin are great to listen to", "time": 1668696754, "resto": 21267750}], "last_modified": 1668696754}, {"no": 21268157, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:44:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are those kinds of bookcases (more specifically the netted doors) called?
