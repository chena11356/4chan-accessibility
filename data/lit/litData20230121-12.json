This is all stemming from internet opinions that you have subconsciously internalized as &quot;facts&quot;. So you spend all day listening to people say &quot;that&#039;s not real acquisition, it&#039;s just translating in your head&quot;, then you buy the book that they tell you not to buy and then you quit halfway through because you feel like you are supposed to. <br><br>You are part of the problem, you pick up textbooks and don&#039;t finish them based on memes and online shitposters ordering you around telling you what to read. If you actually finished a book - regardless of what that book was - you could then supplement your knowledge with an absolute XP grind of intermediate reading.

Of course secular rulers taking over their local churches was the main reasons protestantism spread with backing from political leaders (like the rogue princes gave a damn about the tranny soteriology, at most they wanted to divorce and have harems) or why easterners kept the schism. <br>Third, the office of pope is from the earliest apostolic tradition but the specifics of the job have changed a lot through history and that relative power (which I assume you are alluding to).

These neighborhoods are not self-contained in the important sense; there is no work in these neighborhoods. The necessities are not only produced outside, they are bought outside as well. There is no intermingling of work and play, in fact they are kept strictly segregated. That these communities are nonproductive stems from this fact, not the safety/prosperity/homeless-less aspect.

Obviously things have changed to the point that even in these towns it is very common, for example, that the parents commute to another town for work, but humor me. The children don&#039;t use the parks and schools to play at; they use the town. A few minutes walk and they are at the commercial center of town where real human beings live and work career jobs from low to high end and everywhere in between. Small business owners manage and run stores. Maybe to get home from school they have to walk a couple miles. Maybe their parent(s) work in the area, i.e. as contractors, shop owners, policemen, professionals, etc. Maybe they come home for lunch, etc.<br><br>Even if it is not strictly true that these traditional towns are more self-sufficient in that they produce more of what they consume internally, I hope you don&#039;t think I make a large leap when I say that that appears to be the case to a much higher degree than in the isolated suburbs of Irvine.

The idea that everything about where you live will be planned out by some other group you&#039;ll never even see is a completely modern way of life.<br>Maybe you can already put the pieces together but if not I&#039;ll spell it out for you. Suburbs were not created to feed some new demand after thousands of years of human history in which people, left to their own devices, lived and built things in a way that served their own needs. They were created as part of a grander design that views everything as a commodity to control and exploit. A design that is far more concerned with limiting and taking away what worked and made sense in the past because it is far too empowering to the average person. You&#039;d think there are few better ways to control people than to control the very environment in which they live. To put it simply suburban life became &quot;comfortable&quot; only by making you uncomfortable beforehand.<br>But the point here is that this isn&#039;t just about suburbs. It&#039;s all part of the grand design. Suburbs, as the name suggests, are only defined by their relation to urban centers. People seem to think suburbs are the disease when really they are just one little symptom. The one that stands out because instinctually it seems so wrong but people just don&#039;t think critically enough about it to see what this instinct is really trying to tell them.", "time": 1674143524, "resto": 21542901}, {"no": 21545903, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)10:59:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21544102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21544102</a><br>Asians are the greatest enemy of the Aryan race.

It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man&#039;s power over Nature and man, a place of slavery par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the city&#039;s origins. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man&#039;s return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the New Jerusalem. &quot;This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts.&quot; Thus, from Genesis to Revelation, Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the fall of man and redemption in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do.</span><br><br>i have yet to read this however, but in due time i will.", "time": 1674237747, "resto": 21542901}, {"no": 21550601, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)13:11:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You hate suburbs because white flight was a thing.

The subject matter seems a bit scattered, almost feeling a bit &quot;generated&quot; rather than having a particular poetic purpose. The variance in meter appears from lines 3 to 6. Unsure what the intention behind this was. Line 9 particularly sticks out as varied in rhythm compared to what preceded it with the &quot;silvered&quot; construction. Line 13 ends rather softly as &quot;with&quot; &quot;er&quot; and &quot;ing&quot; are all usually unstressed sounds (although not always in the word itself), but it felt maybe you were dissipating the stress here. Line 15 shifts again as I think &quot;metal shavings&quot; becomes trochaic depending on the rest of the line. There&#039;s no need not to vary it but I&#039;m struggling to see the purpose or pattern; maybe you can illuminate me. &quot;Back at&quot; in line 16 also feels a bit awkward at the start of the line, but that is probably due to the grammatical construction forcing you to use it. &quot;al dente&quot; followed by &quot;and&quot; is a bit odd, since I&#039;d put in &quot;rending small&quot; instead of &quot;and rend small&quot;. The mentions of potentially Athena or Metis being related to Zeus was a nice touch.<br>Some of it reminds me more of Rossetti and maybe Shelley with the seemingly freer, more energetic form of iambic pentameter (as opposed to some more rigid iambic pentameter), which is not a bad thing, but to know why you chose certain pressure points and moments of waning from pressure would be good.

My guideline is not metre as much as it is a syllabic structure (the Milton part is subterfuge, for the most part, but explicitly intended to reference the syllabic construction of the poem). I know this is probably pretty highly unconventional, but I wanted to free myself to create unconventional rhythms that are guided more by intuition of elision than anything else.

Once you become comfortable with just being in the gym, you might walk on a treadmill, because it gets pretty boring just being in a gym for ten minutes without doing anything. The point is to treat it all incrementally, and to recognize that even if there are some people who might think it&#039;s weird to stand around in a gym without doing anything, they&#039;re not the ones who have problems with it. They are irrelevant to you being in the gym. And, hey, you&#039;re paying to be there so you have as much a right to use the space as they do.", "time": 1674302946, "resto": 21553169}, {"no": 21553544, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:12:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "As a Man Thinketh", "time": 1674303168, "resto": 21553169}, {"no": 21553551, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:17:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21553169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21553169</a><br>I don&#039;t know, but I found Buddhist practice to have cbt-like elements.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

Like nigga, don&#039;t you known most white Europeans are racist towards other groups of white Europeans just as much as they are to other races? Look into the Balkans and see how mich value the average Serb, Albanian, Greek, Croatian or Bosnian puts into the concept of a white race that includes his blood enemies. <br><br>In terms of Islam, it&#039;s not as big of a threat in Europe as Americans make it seem.The vast majority of Muslims have children that become extremely secular and often are more degenerate than their European counterparts. If anything is killing this world, its secularism and glowies promoting retarded internet ideologies like socialism, white nationalism (which is only promoted for the sake of having an eternal enemy and not its actually effective at what it foes) and globohomo capitalism.

Later, i realized i had been manipolated, gaslighted and cheated on by him and perhaps he had narcissist tendencies. <br>So that was my wake up call: i started working out, eating well, non-stop walking, walking, walking. Journalling and writing stuff. Unstuck myself with my studies, went into therapy to improve myself. <br>Meanwhile - i admit - i kept stalking him online and on dating apps (which he always was online, even while we were together) for a while. Found out he jumped into another relationship the same week he left me. (he proclaimed himself polyamorous during our monogamous relationship). 2 months after he dumps the new polyamorous guy and gets back to monogamy (what a surprise). He has some hook-ups with other 3-4 guys, i get to know this thanks to a spy (another funny story i could develop further). he seemed he couldn&#039;t find his mr. right during his obsessive research.<br>Meanwhile, i kept going and improving myself throughout the summer. by pure luck i match with a 10/10 looking dude and i get to know him and meet him. he lived 2 hours far away. The new guy looked so into me. So sweet at first, a bit cold perhaps. I meet him once and twice. We kiss and have sex. seemed like he was into me for a relationship, despite always having the fear he wants to use me running on background.<br>Meanwhile, my ex was alone. You&#039;d say now: &quot;well, seems like there&#039;s some justice left in the world&quot; right? not at all. <br>August comes, i had my planned trip to Canada (I live in italy and this was my first trip in america, i planned it right after my ex dumped my as a mean to move on). <br>I get back from holidays, in the meanwhile the new guy starts to pull away and gives me breadcrumbs. I try to stay chill, but i die inside, too afraid to speak up. <br>Someday in september i tell him: &quot;well, if you&#039;re not interested anymore just tell me, no prob&quot;. He doesn&#039;t *actually* say yes or no, and keeps stringing me along. I can&#039;t manage to hang out with him a third time because he keeps bailing. Finally he accepts. Felt like he friendzoned me.<br>Finally, after two months of anxiety and war flashbacks, i got the courage to speak up. he gives me some weak ass excuse and that day i ended the situationship. Mentally destroyed by this second dude. Meanwhile my ex got together with this gay guy from a group chat he used to lurk in and is now totally happy. he deleted all his dating apps. And i&#039;m here, alone, with nobody in sight. working on myself. <br>At this point, there&#039;s no logic in this world. no justice, no balance, just cruel randomness at best.

The ending shows this especially: despite expressing a deep sense of (non-sexual) love for Sonoko and wishing they could get together regardless of her marriage, Kochan reveals his true nature in his keen, detailed (and seemingly sexually motivated) observation of a young street tough.

Their economic policy also was not fully developed but if you want some from that period the 3 main books of gottfried feder are pretty close to Hitlers views. Italian Fascism actually has the same problem which is why some historians viewed it as having no clear ideology or it just being irrational, they just didn&#039;t write that much of it down. Shame National Socialism doesn&#039;t have someone who can make sense of it like A.J. Gregor did for Fascism. With the BUF it&#039;s the exact opposite.

The Hudson&#039;s Bay Company that James Douglas inherited had a series of forts covering most of the American Pacific. Under his rule it became the number one power of the American West. A strange power too, being a rigidly hierarchical paramilitary company composed almost entirely of mixed race men. But American Westward expansion had it&#039;s eyes on the Pacific, so secret societies of American settlers would form who would slowly immigrate to key towns and cities, then once they had reached a critical mass start race riots and seize government buildings in order to provoke a drawn out standoff with local authorities. This would then provide the US government pretext for military invasion to &quot;protect&quot; American citizens. This was the strategy in Mexico and Hawaii, and it was also used in the area West of the Rocky Mountains, stretching to the Pacific Ocean, which was the Hudson Bay Company&#039;s land of New Caledonia.<br><br>James Douglas probably could have fought them off, but the Canadian parliament capitulated almost immediately to American demands, as did factions of the British Parliament who saw their ideology reflected by American Imperialism. So instead of a glorious war, James Douglas was tasked with a messy retreat from Fort Vancouver (City in Washington) to a Northern deep water port that he named Vancouver in honour of the HBC&#039;s fallen capital. <br><br>Once the American Civil War broke out, James Douglas saw an opportunity to seize the moment (and take advantage of still numerous local forces who had seen systemic seizures of property and political rights under the new regime) by a fast navel attack on Seattle that would be reinforced by inland raids conducted through major river systems. This would completely cut America off from the Pacific, and torn between the South and the Canadians they could be pushed back over the Rocky Mountains and forced into a draw whereby the Industrial North and Plantation South were two medium sized countries jealously preventing the other from expanding too large or too fast.<br><br>You can find a letter he wrote to the governor general on Wikipedia.

The Argument from Motion: Our senses can perceive motion by seeing that things act on one another. Whatever moves is moved by something else. Consequently, there must be a First Mover that creates this chain reaction of motions. This is God. God sets all things in motion and gives them their potential.</span><br>Assumes there has to be a first mover, then merely declares it to be God.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2.

The Argument from Necessary Being: Because objects in the world come into existence and pass out of it, it is possible for those objects to exist or not exist at any particular time.

The Argument from Gradation: There are different degrees of goodness in different things.

Therefore, there must be a being of the highest form of good. This perfect being is God.</span><br>If that is true, then God must not exist yet, since animal complexity is still being evolved.

A second essential element consists in ruthlessly destroying the &quot;myth&quot; of Technique, i. e., the whole ideological construction and the tendency to consider technology something possessing sacred character. Intellectuals attempt to insert the technical phenomenon into the framework of their respective intellectual or philosophical systems by attributing to it a quality of supreme excellence; for example, when they demonstrate that Technique is an instrument of freedom, or the means of ascent to historical destiny, or the execution of a divine vocation, and the like. All such constructions have the result of glorifying and sanctifying Technique and of putting the human being at the disposal of some indisputable historical law or other. A further aspect of this element is the sacred, i. e., the human tendency spontaneously to attribute sacred value to what so manifestly possesses transcendent power. Technique, in this view, is not solely an ensemble of material elements, but that which gives meaning and value to life, allowing man not only to live but to live well. Technique is intangible and unattackable precisely because everything is subject and subordinate to it. Man unconsciously invests with a holy prestige that against which he is unable to prevail. It seems to me that the only means to mastery over Technique is by way of &quot; de-sacralization&quot; and &quot; de-ideologization.&quot; This means that all men must be shown that Technique is nothing more than a complex of material objects, procedures, and combinations, which have as their sole result a modicum of comfort, hygiene, and ease; and that it possesses nothing worthy of the trouble of devoting one&#039;s whole life to it, or of commanding an excessive respect, or of reposing in it one&#039;s success and honor, or of massacring one&#039;s fellow men. Men must be convinced that technical progress is not humanity&#039;s supreme adventure, but a commonplace fabrication of certain objects which scarcely merit enthusiastic delirium even when they happen to be Sputniks. As long as man worships Technique, there is as good as no chance at all that he will ever succeed in mastering it.</span>", "filename": "ellulsnap2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674241634748645, "time": 1674241634, "md5": "orHqESUwkhNVhISSPr40LQ==", "fsize": 116762, "resto": 21550330}, {"no": 21550873, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)14:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21550723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21550723</a><br>rightnow the republican party is trying to genoicide trans people through legislation.

To make things clear, his view of freedom is one in which an individual is unrestricted by the will of others, but it is not the Marxian view of freedom where the greater your opportunities, the more &quot;freedom&quot; you have. The latter is actually the prevailing notion of freedom in the western world, though I digress.<br>Ted has a problem with permissiveness because it is transient, unreliable, and hollow. For example, while you are theoretically &quot;free&quot; to speak your mind, it is merely because you have been given &quot;permission&quot; by 4chan and, by extension, the United States Government. I don&#039;t think you or I really believe that we have freedom of speech, but merely permission to speak. You raise a good point again, and that is &quot;where does permissiveness begin and freedom end?&quot;<br><br>Let&#039;s begin with something extreme: imagine there is only one single man left on earth. In Kaczynski&#039;s view, this man has ultimate freedom. He must receive permission from nothing at all to do anything, even if he must slave tirelessly every day to meet his physical needs. I don&#039;t think Kaczynski believes that it is possible to cultivate true freedom in the context of an actual society. The problem being that rules, duty, and obligation are absolutely and incontrovertibly necessary in any social interaction, whether unstated and unconscious or dictated and conscious. However, Kaczynski does seem to believe that it is possible to limit the power of individuals to enforce their will, primarily that of large organizations over the individual and small groups (such as tribes or families).<br><br>The fact is that freedom and permission are, as long as there is a social system in place, naturally entwined-- at odds some places, and together in others. For Kaczynski, a proper compromise could be found in the fact that, even if one does not have permission by their authority to commit some act, so long as that authority is unable to monitor and enforce its will, then the individual has freedom to commit the act. In the past, as Kaczynski states in paragraph 94-95, and as can readily be known from a simple perusal of history, while governments were highly restrictive and authoritarian, small communities and individuals paradoxically possessed a far greater level of freedom than the average person does today. This is because of the difficulty in enforcing the will of high-status or large organization without the aid of industrial technology.<br><br>This increase in capability given by industrial technology to large organizations forms the pillar of Kaczynski&#039;s belief that freedom cannot be reconciled with -industrial- technology. However, there is no real way to prove that freedom is good in and of itself, and so it is left to the reader to discern for himself what he believes will create a more just future.", "filename": "a man who is free", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 830, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674281847726960, "time": 1674281847, "md5": "/PG9Sc4i6UIxs/Wd6sG6Bg==", "fsize": 157093, "resto": 21549903}, {"no": 21552756, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)01:22:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21550200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21550200</a><br><a href=\"#p21552744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21552744</a><br>I think there is also an interesting thought in this problem, although I have not explored it:<br>Fascists, Bourgeois Leftists, Capitalists, and Libertarian Paternalists, and Marxists have highly similar views of freedom in opposition to Kaczynski, with Marxists and Fascists having slightly nuanced differences in other respects (I.E, alternative axes to levels of freedom)", "time": 1674282152, "resto": 21549903}, {"no": 21553067, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)03:59:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21549903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21549903</a><br>Hasn&#039;t this been refuted?", "time": 1674291541, "resto": 21549903}, {"no": 21553081, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)04:04:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21553067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21553067</a><br>Not yet.

The story follows its protagonist, a young boy named Faggot Gardner (no relation to F. Gardner, the author), as he searches the grimy streets of Chicago for &quot;the Crocodile&quot;, a local leather daddy notorious for putting bad little boys like Gardner in their place.<br>Young Faggot Gardner searches high and low for the fabled dominant: in dilapidated crack dens, in public restrooms, in subterranean glory holes. Yet no matter how assiduously he searches, how quickly he moves from clue to clue, how many dirty men&#039;s toes he sucks (an activity constantly referred to in the novel as &quot;pussing the boots&quot;), Gardner seems always to be one step behind the object of his obsessive desire.<br>The twist comes near the end of the novel, during a scene reminiscent of Polanski&#039;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;, where the beautiful Carole, played by a young Catherine Deneuve, finally descends into madness, and hallucinates human arms reaching oot of the walls of her apartment and grabbing her, thereby externalizing her fear not only of sexual assault, but of any form of intimate contact whatsoever. F. Gardner (the author) parodies this scene, effectively turning its tone and implications upside down, by having his protagonist, the now cock-starved and desperate Faggot Gardner (again, no relation) crawl on his knees through a dark apartment, groping along the walls to find his way, only to feel, poking proudly oot of the holes in the walls, not scary arms with grabby hands, but dozens of diamond-hard dicks. They poke him in the eyes. They shoot gobs of bitter gravy into his nose and ears. They wag reproachfully at him, like the index fingers of the stern private school teachers who buggered him in his earliest childhood memories, as he slowly makes his way to the end of the hall. The twist is this: when he finally reaches the end of the hall, and opens the door there, he finds himself staring into a blinding white light. He believes that when his eyes finally adjust to the glare, he will see there, waiting for him, horse-whip in hand, croc-skin chaps pulled snugly against his obese thighs, the man he has been seeking for so many days, seeking, in a way, for all of his life. But instead what he sees is a hospital room. He is lying in a hospital bed. The bright light is coming from the naked bulb above him. There is a nurse at his side, changing his IV fluids.<br>&quot;Where am I?&quot; he asks.<br>&quot;Loretto Hospital,&quot; the nurse replies.<br>&quot;I was eaten by a crocodile, wasn&#039;t I?&quot; he asks.<br>&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;You were violently assaulted by hundreds of corpulent and diseased men, with disgusting rotten teeth and putrid breath.

Nothing would be more humiliating for him than to live out his final days imprisoned in the anatomical labyrinth of a normal sized human. Every inch of my intestines would be a mile of torment for Warwick, every little step of his a reminder of his puny insignificance. In order to sufficiently break his will, I\u2019d ensure that his death came slow.

His infantile stride is assisted by the corrosive flow of my digestive system but gradually, Warwick\u2019s candy-colored armor degrades. The exposed tissue of the vile homunculus starts melting, limiting his movement even further (as if that\u2019s even possible).<br><br>Engulfed in agony, his LED bulb depleted, the midge finally collapses. The world around him is now a pitch black void, a meaningless pocket of space inside my body but for Warwick, his tomb. Suddenly, a glimmer of light emerges. Warwick fixes his beady, partially corroded eyes on it. The light grows brighter until suddenly he begins moving toward it, as if carried by angels to the gates of heaven. But alas, there is no heaven for the odious midge. I reach with toilet paper in hand, wipe and feel an odd sensation like popping a zit. Upon the paper I find the smeared visage of Warwick Davis\u2019 upper half, his face a squished skin mask streaked in browns and reds.

I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do.

The Anglo-American bloc couldn&#039;t let a distinct continental bloc exist, because its own survival conditions required global financial tyranny and &quot;soft power&quot; imperialism, what we now call globalism. For smaller Rhodesias (plural) to survive, aka European countries, they had to be part of a larger strategic bloc, an umbrella, which was what the Fascists and Nazis were trying to provide. Similar organizations were attempted after the war by people like Mosley and Thiriart, and the project then passed to Alain de Benoist&#039;s Nouvelle Droite and its Euro-federalist ideal. <br><br>Also, many former Nazis continued to spread the ideals of a third world to the rising Arab world, effectively creating modern Arab and Islamic nationalism.

Basically, you can&#039;t just live and let live, because your enemy could develop a technological or economic lead that makes you de facto subject to him. It&#039;s a larger version of the situation of the Germans wanting a colonial empire and a navy so they could have the same economic prospects as England, America, and France, with their colonial empires.

They don&#039;t care about whites, or only subsets of them do because the subsets are also being used/manipulated by the whole. Whether the whole has real goals or is just the aggregate behavior of a quasi-organism, who knows. But one thing is clear, it cannot allow for independent ethnically homogeneous states, because it can only allow for a world of loose economic zones that fundamentally are dominated by foreign finance capital, and now they are transitioning to China-style surveillance regime stuff, probably some kind of UBI + social credit + &quot;unified health passport&quot; combination system once it&#039;s fully implemented. It only allows nations like China and India to continue to manifest ethnic or religious or national solidarity because they are still weak and living in the past, they aren&#039;t really challenging the system as a whole.

It is theoretically indifferent about &quot;local&quot; solidarity, like Poland remaining BASED WHITE AND CONSERVATIVE for an extra generation or even an extra century of lagging behind the more western countries, because the net tendency of the system is overall toward homogenization and destruction of all effective identities, including European, white, Christian, etc. Already you can see that all Poland&#039;s major cities are typical progressive globalist trash. The system knows that it dominates the urban elites so nothing else matters. If Poland actually made itself into a major problem, like a few states like Italy and Hungary are sort of trying to do, it would be isolated and destroyed in a brutal and humiliating fashion like Rhodesia was. Again it doesn&#039;t even matter whether what the system is doing is intentional or it specifically hates whitey or not, it&#039;s just a fact that the system will tend toward destroying all EFFECTIVE whiteness over time, just like it will eventually come for India and the Hindu nationalism there, and just as it has a thousand and one plans for how to break China apart and prey off the ensuing warlords and civil wars. It isn&#039;t sure of winning every battle but it knows how to win the war. <br><br>How do you react to this? There is no way except to fight it equally globally, in an equally totalizing fashion. You have to not only create white nationalism in one nation but spread the ethnostate model to an alliance of nations that have a common enemy in globalism.

You don&#039;t have to do this in a vacuum, because obviously huge crises are looming on the horizon. The question is whether those crises will be &quot;met&quot; by a divided Europe that still delusionally thinks it&#039;s living in a permanent 1990s (watch the documentary Hypernormalization by Adam Curtis if you can), or whether, when those crises begin to set in and the world starts to feel like it did around 1910 or 1935 again, there will be a general consensus in Europe that a powerful and united Europe is the only way to overcome the challenges, and this will inevitably also mean forming a united front against countries like China, which will further increase solidarity if we&#039;re lucky.", "time": 1674287590, "resto": 21550025}, {"no": 21552927, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)02:54:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21552926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21552926</a><br>Basically, you have to re-do what the fascists were trying to do, but do it successfully this time. All the other blocs are already trying to do this: Dugin is just applying all the ideas I have mentioned here to Russia. China is doing the same. They are waiting for the Anglo-American system to have moments of weakness and hoping they can make very lucky rolls of the dice, theoretically possible but longshots, but still better to make the throw than to just give in and let finance capital rape your ass and destroy humanity. The only question facing Europe and white people is: if the world is inevitably about to be a final face-off between this Anglo-American bloc, China, Russia, and whatever other blocs try to cobble together some form of resistance (maybe India), do we want to be a passive party in all this, effectively absorbed into one or other of the victorious blocs or destroyed when their fighting just ends the world? Or do I want to be one of the blocs, fighting to impose my own victory conditions on things? <br><br>No matter what, someone has to win the conflict, unless we all lose because everybody dies. What this means is that to fight at all means to fight 100%, globally. You either fight a global total war and aim at becoming the global hegemon or you accept that someone else will. What this means is that white European civilization only has two options: accept either death or slavery to some other bloc, OR accept that victory means a reunified and powerful European empire that also dominates the world to some degree, the same way the Anglo-American system does currently. That doesn&#039;t mean enslaving the world, it just means imposing the same kinds of control conditions on it that the USA already imposes, for example by not allowing nations to nuke each other because everybody simply knows that the USA and its vassals would &quot;intervene&quot; to &quot;restore order.&quot; <br><br>Because Europeans innately believe in rule of law and pluralism, and because alliances are more useful than slavery, this would probably mean an alliance structure with other blocs like India, ideally Russia, and other things like a Monroe doctrine forbidding China from economic activity in Africa, for example. China would be very useful as a common enemy for a good while. But the main goal is first to dismantle the Anglo-American system that is poisoning the west from within by making it think it&#039;s awake while it&#039;s really in a coma and being picked apart by a million enemies. <br><br>To maintain perspective, just keep reminding yourself that this is what the World Wars were really about.

Quaker Whaling Hyper industry and maximum frugality kinda stuff. Most period sources and analysis seem to agree on this general pervasive mentality.

But those who are truly holy will advance in them, and find the infinity hidden in such seemingly simple things.

What I mean is that Christ is also experiential and that if we only approach the matter from a rational perspective we can harden our capacity to accept anything. That goes for any other philosophy or ideology. Likewise, when we are too reliant upon our emotions, we get swept away with any wind that comes across our path. Ideally, there needs to be a movement in both because both faculties are to operate in symphony. Discussions about the heart are extensive in both Christ and the writings of His saints. <br><br>Above all else, pray that He may reveal Himself to you in some way that you understand. And pray for a supple heart to be able to accept this revelation in a humble way. I know it sounds ridiculous and I know that when someone first starts praying if feels mechanical and silly. But if you take one step towards God, He will take a hundred towards you. His love for you is beyond measure. Also, maybe visit a church near you and talk to the priest there and maybe also attend a service. I&#039;d personally say to attend an Eastern Orthodox church if you can.

Is this attempt at establishing a causal relationship correct? Maybe, but what I am sure of is that these cultures that Urwin studies certainly had a variety of different social, economic, and cultural factors other than sexual restraint that made them decay. These societies experimented war, economic downturns, leadership problems and other issues. These societies were not brought down solely because of sexual restraint, although this factor is very influential. <br><br>That being said the book establishes a correlation of past cultures and societies before the industrial revolution. The past 200 years have changed the entire landscape of the productive and social relations in human societies, which means the such relations, although important, are not neccesarily irrevocable as Urwin says.

Correlation tells you that two things are co-occurring. This *could* be because one is causing the other, but it could also be that something else is causing both. Bold mathematical speculation: Could it be true that it&#039;s less likely one causes the other considering that there are myriad other potential factors that could be causing both? I don&#039;t enough math to say if that makes any sense. But anyway, the problem is that humans psychologically default to assuming causation.

I used to exclusively write short stories so it was a new experience for me at the time. I didn&#039;t really go in with any kind of overarching theme in mind, but after working on it for a while, a couple emerged, and I realized it was a lot more coherent of a narrative than I ever really intended it to be. Ever since, I&#039;ve been slowly thinking through the structure, over and over, piecing it together into something that, when it&#039;s finished, I really think I&#039;d be proud of. However, my progress with actually translating my ideas into prose was always really slow, and I never thought I&#039;d really get anywhere with it. I get writer&#039;s block easily, probably because I don&#039;t read enough (and I also don&#039;t force myself to keep writing if nothing&#039;s coming to me), and even now, I&#039;ve only got 30,000 words of what I&#039;m expecting to be closer to 180,000 by the time I&#039;m finished. <br><br>However, recently, I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;ve been making progress a lot faster than I used to. I think it&#039;s because I&#039;ve got a much more detailed idea of the final product in my mind than when I started, thanks to how much time I spent thinking over the structure and keeping track of important links between events and the themes they represent. Now that everything&#039;s almost entirely planned out, the words have been flowing so much faster than they ever used to. It feels really good to finally know not just what I want to say, but how I want to say it, after years of struggling to find a consistent voice for my narrative. It feels like everything is coming together so much better than I ever could have anticipated, and it almost feels too good to be true. (I think one thing that really helped was that once I had the structure more solidly laid out, I was able to start jumping around and writing different parts instead of writing it linearly. That way, if I&#039;m having writer&#039;s block on one part, I can jump to a different part where I already know what I want to say.)<br><br>I thought I was still years off from finishing it, but I realized recently that I might only be a year or two away. Have any anons had their novel published before? I don&#039;t know the first thing about how to find a literary agent or break into the publishing industry, but I realized I might have to start looking soon. It&#039;s scary, but it feels so good to know I&#039;m close to the end. This has been pretty much my only literary endeavor since I started it, and I have no idea what I&#039;m gonna do next. I&#039;m really enjoying finishing it up though, and finally being able to get to the meat of my story after waiting so long.<br><br>This post doesn&#039;t really have a point other than that.

As for my own background, during my teenage years I read roughly 200 novels that had related D&amp;D campaign settings and played as well. I was really deep into it for some years, which contributed to why I didn&#039;t like this at all. One might think it&#039;d be the other way, but I couldn&#039;t help but it think it was a bootleg knock-off.<br><br>The main reason I didn&#039;t like this is because of how it&#039;s written, which I&#039;m unable to explain in detail. Unfortunately I have more problems with it than that. The worldbuilding is expansive but shallow and oftentimes didn&#039;t make sense. This is a quest-based book, so as with many *RPGs it&#039;s almost entirely sidequests, detours, along the to the destination/main quest. To be clear, this is not LitRPG. There&#039;s a dungeon near the end in which the narrative shifts to ruin delver mode, but it doesn&#039;t last long until the book ends. I would be able to put all of these problems aside better if it didn&#039;t take itself so seriously. I see that as a disconnect between tone and content, which is more of a problem than I thought it&#039;d be. All these problems would be less for someone who can accept its self-seriousness.<br><br>The protagonist is assigned party members from the ruin explorers guild which he&#039;s a retired member of. He&#039;s in his middle age after having survived almost 30 years of ruins exploration and has PTSD, from both domestic and adventuring life. His nightmares are provided in detail. There&#039;s not really anything that I want to say about the other party members, who are there to fill their relevant role. I didn&#039;t care for any of them and didn&#039;t have any engagement. There are many other NPCs that they meet and there are various encounters, but I couldn&#039;t care enough for any of it to matter, regardless of what happened to them.<br><br>The Hanifax Imperium, which is where all of this takes place, is ruled by a Queen well past her 100th year of rule. She made a pact with the trickster god to continue living, but that rather changed her. Now she&#039;s a chaotic evil dictator that everyone must follow or be killed by divine intervention as he&#039;s been made into the state religion. This is a problem for the Imperium, but it&#039;s much more so for those who meet her in person. I really wondered at what kind of cosmology would allow for the other gods, of which there are many, to be seemingly unconcerned about this. I looked at the synopsis for the two other books and all was revealed. I don&#039;t agree with a synopsis being complete spoilers, but it happens.<br><br>This is far better rated and reviewed by others and if it seems like something you&#039;d enjoy, then it&#039;s more likely that their opinion has more predictive value for you than mine, so you may as well try.
