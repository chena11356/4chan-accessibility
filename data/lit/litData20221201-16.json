You think he would tolerate anyone&#039;s nagging at all? He&#039;s just returned from hell, from a battlefield where half his friends were butchered, where he butchered half a dozen men in cold blood, his face up against theirs as the light faded from their eyes and the color drained from their cheeks. He faced certain death, and though presently victorious, he still has no idea if he&#039;ll die tomorrow in the next battle, and you think he&#039;ll bother asking anyone for permission to fuck his wife tonight? You think that wife would dare say no to him even if she wanted to? You think ANYONE on God&#039;s green earth would dare say no to such a character? (and btw, to PUAs reading this, this guy is beta, the alpha is his king and gammas don&#039;t exist at all because they died in childbirth). That&#039;s how masculinity works. Everything else is faggotry. &quot;I do what I want up to the limits of my strength and no one can stop me&quot; is masculinity 101, and white knighting is the exact opposite of that. If you think that anyone should, let alone COULD, ever have rights over and above this type of character\u2014let alone such a pathetic midwit creature as a female\u2014you are a faggot, and you do well to believe in such rights because they are the only things standing between you and annihilation or slavery; convincing half the warriors to protect you from the other half (cops vs. robbers) is the only way a non-warrior has of surviving in this world, after all.</span><br> Now imagine such a character\u2014this fearless Viking warrior\u2014returning from the dead and taking a look at our society today, at men abandoned by their women, their families destroyed; at women running courtrooms and entire countries, passing judgement on men and telling them how to live their lives. How would he react to such a sight? I think he&#039;d shake his head in disbelief and say, &quot;What happened to men? Why are there no men today? Where did they all go?&quot; He wouldn&#039;t blame feminism, or society, or some religion or philosophy; he wouldn&#039;t know any of that stuff, he&#039;d be immune to such ridiculous phantasms. He would look purely at the REALITY in front of his eyes not at the stupid counter-factual ideas of contemporary midwits ABOUT this reality, and this reality would simply be that &quot;There are no men left alive today&quot;.", "time": 1669929535, "resto": 21328712}, {"no": 21329355, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)16:20:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21329348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21329348</a><br>And of course, everything that&#039;s not men deserves slavery, whether to a state, a corporation or a nagging female is immaterial: most likely to all of them at the same time.

I am a bit worried because the concentration of new, important information seems to be higher in Plotinus, and it&#039;s also often sandwiched by more boring polemical material so my concern is my attention slipping throughout the reading because of the uninteresting polemical aspect and then not being able to retain the new information</span><br>Other than this, I don&#039;t think I have any major questions for now.

Worth, value, quality, are all interchangeable, the conquering of time through song, and the Jew lacks confidence to even sing for himself. Character, appearance, soul, talent, are all just the attempted attachment of worth, and as much strength as worth can muster corresponds to obliterating vanity, which is just the Achilles heal of the artist. Art is \u2018universal\u2019 only when it hides how much the artist is straining to overcome his retardation, trying to bubble his way past his own crooked timber thoughts and attach real value to existence. Men just have the self worth to be themselves, but the point isn\u2019t the worth, but the being, it\u2019s all a by product of something originally worthy that has to be found internally. Women are not themselves, they live in deceit, they live cut off from whatever quality femininity might have derived from, but only because they don\u2019t believe in themselves, like the Jew who won\u2019t sing.

His language and structure serve its purpose, only occasionally rising above mere utilitarianism, and then he rushes to florid flourishes that fall flat as often as they succeed. Sometimes, it is downright dull. The prose of the second book is stronger than the first, but its plot and characters are more linear and predictable.<br><br>I appreciated his &#039;created language&#039; more than most fantasy authors, but I didn&#039;t find it particularly mysterious or difficult, because all of his words are based on recognizable Germanic or Romantic roots. Then again, after three years of writing stories about Roman whores in Latin, I had little problem with &#039;meretriculous&#039;. Even those words I wasn&#039;t familiar with seemed clear by their use.<br><br>The terms are scattered throughout the book, but rarely contribute to a more pervasive linguistic style, as might be seen in The Worm Ouroboros, The Lord of the Rings, Gormenghast, or The King of Elfland&#039;s Daughter. Wolfe&#039;s terms pepper otherwise and unremarkable modern style, which hardly helps to throw us into a strange world.<br><br>He is better than the average fantasy author, but he resembles them more than he differs from them. His protagonist started off interestingly enough: an apparently weak and intelligent man, which made it all the more disappointing when he suddenly transformed into a laconic, wench-loving buttkicker who masters sword-fighting, finds the Super Magic Thing and follows the path of his Awesome Foretold Fate. Again, I must agree with Nick Lowe: Wolfe&#039;s plot owes more to magic and convenience than good storytelling.<br><br>It relies on the same tricks over and over: any time a character is about to give important information to us, there will be a sudden attack or other interruption, as convenient and annoying as the moment when the dying man says &quot;I was killed by . . . aargh&quot;. We also get problems solved by divine intervention whenever things start to slow, which doesn&#039;t leave the characters much room to be active.<br><br>He also seems to suffer from the same sexual discomfort that plagues so many fantasy authors. There is an undercurrent of obsession with women and their sexuality, complete with the sexualization of rape and murder. It&#039;s not so much a case of misogyny as it is an inequality in how characters behave.<br><br>The women always seem to end up as playtoys for the narrator, running around naked, desiring him, sparring with him coyly, but ultimately, conquered; and the camera pans away. They always approach him, desire him, pretending they don&#039;t want him, then give themselves up to him.

The one function discourse can have is to point beyond itself at non-discursive experiences. One of the most helpful ways to understand how Buddhism has historically seen itself is by thinking of Buddhist teachings and writings not as &quot;theories&quot; or &quot;descriptions&quot; but as MAPS of transcendence. Maps are not the territory they map, and all maps are a little different, and there are different maps for different people and purposes. That&#039;s all fine, as long as the map gets you where you&#039;re going. A simpler map can often even be better than an incredibly over-detailed map that only the most specially trained specialist could use and enjoy. And for this reason, there is a dangerous possibility that people will spend their whole lives studying maps and map-making instead of USING the maps AS maps. Maps should get you to and through the things they map, not to more maps.<br><br>The entire Indian philosophical tradition, which has many overlapping and intermingling strains of thought in it going back three thousand years at least, and is actually many separate traditions that periodically re-convene and re-converge with each other, has this presupposition built into it. Not every single Indian thinker has thought it. Just like in the West, Indians (as in, inhabitants of India broadly conceived) are diverse, and there are Indian materialist and nihilist schools and every other kind of school. But what you could call negative theology and a focus on metaphysical proof by direct experience (as opposed to discursive, logical proof) are, all things considered, pretty dominant and recurrent themes in Indian thought. <br><br>The exact questions of influence are complex, and basically impossible to disentangle. It&#039;s possible to say Buddhism postdates the Upanishads, but it mostly postdates the ones that are the least obviously negative-theological, and that waver between different forms of nondualism, as opposed to being strictly Advaita-style nondualist. It&#039;s also possible to say that Buddhism especially developed a certain style of nondualism that only became dominant in India around 400 AD, and that the later Advaita school adopted many of its ideas. But you could just as easily invert these points and say X is clearly derivative from Y, so even where Y appears to be derivative from X, it&#039;s only a subordinate case of derivation.", "time": 1669920518, "resto": 21326656}, {"no": 21328751, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)13:49:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21328746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21328746</a><br>There are conflicting theories about where the different approaches and ideas developed in India, with some saying the Sanskrit cultural complex in the west generated most of them, others saying there were two cultural complexes and Sanskrit was only a lingua franca, and now even others saying that there was a large and continuous influx of western Indo-Aryan (Persian) ideas. Each of these positions has its respective nationalist defenders. It&#039;s probably some combination of all of them. <br><br>The real question is how similar the metaphysics are in what they ultimately purport to be mapping. But here too, no simple answer is possible, for a very simple reason: none of these traditions is monolithic in the way &quot;philosophical traditions&quot; were in the West for different historical reasons. For lots of Indian history, you could be highly heterodox, at least privately and often publically, and still practice all the same methods and refer to all the same texts and traditions as some &quot;school&quot; you are working within. Schools could split into subschools based on regionally influential teachers unconsciously emphasizing certain features and deemphasizing certain other features of their supposed school, and then a century later people would have forgotten this and simply know, there are two kinds of monks in our region for some reason. Then the existing differences between those monks would be accentuated by contingent factors like the sheer accidental fact that mostly rich northerners of the region joined one school and poor southerners joined the other, or mostly one ethnic group joined one school etc. <br><br>There have been metaphysical Buddhists who don&#039;t deny the existence of something very like Brahman, and there have been purely method-based radically agnostic Buddhists who say asking questions about what comes after moksha is only trapping you more in samsara. Likewise there are Advaita practitioners who sound very Buddhist and Advaita practitioners who almost become monistic rationalists. And there is every possible degree of shading and mutual borrowing between traditions, schools, local folk rituals, etc. It&#039;s probably MORE common to have &quot;heterodox&quot; schools that freely incorporate tantric and devotional elements, which forces us to question what orthodoxy even is.", "time": 1669920589, "resto": 21326656}, {"no": 21328766, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)13:52:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21328751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21328751</a><br><br>What binds it all together is the emphasis on practice and direct experience.

Nobody to this day can tell you what Nagarjuna &quot;really&quot; meant, other than that he is practicing an extreme form of negative theology. What would you rather do, delve into elaborate discussions within discussions about Nagarjuna for a thousand years or just do what all the Indians inspired by him for centuries did and use his writings as best you can for your own purposes? The former is interesting, and also helpful if it makes Nagarjuna more available and comprehensible, but if you hit a point of just not being able to know for certain despite doing everything you can to reconstruct Nagarjuna&#039;s mental context and personal intentions, what&#039;s the use of arguing about it forever.

fecundity, it is a sketch, remaining at quite a high level of generalisation \u2013 throws several currently contentious issues into sharper relief. Noting the anxiety and defensiveness that criticism\u2019s never wholly successful claim to professional status has generated, he links this to the grossly exaggerated justifications that tend to be offered for academic literary studies. He notes that the tendency to overstate the significance of the discipline has in our time taken the form of exaggerating the political effects of teaching English literature.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As academic scholars in the humanities feel increasingly vulnerable in societies governed by the imperatives of global capital, so they seek to ratchet up their \u2018relevance\u2019. The main form such claims currently take, particularly among professors of English in the US, is to argue that their pedagogic and scholarly work is, at bottom, a kind of radical political activism. This does not mean teaching Marlowe and Austen in the day job and then also having a role in radical politics: it means treating one\u2019s teaching and writing about Marlowe and Austen as a form of radical politics in itself. Guillory is severe on this particular form of professional self-delusion.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These various forms of exaggeration are, fundamentally, expressions of a lack of confidence rather than its opposite. Guillory wants quietly to remind English scholars \u2013 his characteristic tone is quiet, even though the effect of his writing is both conclusive and devastating \u2013 of the value of their basic activity: that of extending knowledge and understanding of English literature. \u2018The study of literature is a rational procedure for what can be known about an object\u2019 (the literary work). This is a cognitive enterprise, and it centres on the study of writing that is \u2018sufficiently wrought\u2019 for the writing itself to be of interest.</span>", "filename": "F1841892-A700-48FB-BCED-C86DFD34B9ED", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1284, "h": 1324, "tn_w": 242, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669919407960165, "time": 1669919407, "md5": "S7v9ZqnW7VOuhOsKFvTcKQ==", "fsize": 344976, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "recent-article-on-the-cureent-state-of-literary", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21328676, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)13:33:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Guillory identifies further tendencies in the current malaise afflicting literary studies, tendencies that grow out of the unstable settlement universities first negotiated with works of the imagination. Early courses in English could assume agreement about a relatively fixed canon of major authors, mostly poets, and the pedagogic task was to deepen acquaintance with these masterpieces. But social change undermined these confident assumptions. Instead, \u2018students who enter into literary study today are the products of a system in which the representational function of literature and the criticism of society are axiomatic.\u2019 As Guillory implies, both of these \u2018axioms\u2019 are highly debatable, to say the least, but their combined effect is to concentrate attention on recent and contemporary prose fiction, most frequently understood as the expression of one or another kind of gender or ethnic \u2018identity\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pressure of a similar kind has been exerted by the demand that the works set for study should be \u2018relatable\u2019. Teachers want to engage the interests of students, while, for larger political reasons, people want to encounter individuals who are in some major dimension \u2018like\u2019 themselves \u2013 whether as political representatives, or teachers, or, more ambiguously, as authors. Yet one of the most important functions of an education in a humanities subject is to introduce students to worlds that are different from the one they think they know, and chronological and cultural distance are among the most important forms of such difference. In some cases this argument may involve retaining traditional and now unfashionable texts; in others it may justify \u2018rebalancing\u2019 a selection by including historically neglected authors or genres. Either way, the search for \u2018identification\u2019 \u2013 with a character, a story or a writer \u2013 may be an incitement to youthful reading, but a too-easy endorsement of this quest soon impoverishes a syllabus.</span>", "time": 1669919597, "resto": 21328666}, {"no": 21328875, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:21:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any particular reason why you shared this?", "time": 1669922474, "resto": 21328666}, {"no": 21328917, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:31:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any particular reason why you shared this?", "time": 1669923111, "resto": 21328666}, {"no": 21328922, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:32:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any particular reason why you shared this?", "time": 1669923147, "resto": 21328666}], "last_modified": 1669923147}, {"no": 21327774, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)08:25:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are some good man vs society books?", "filename": "file-20180416-587-7554t", "ext": ".png", "w": 1000, "h": 1237, "tn_w": 202, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669901137838310, "time": 1669901137, "md5": "IeP00rCzKawkXDPNwGG+rA==", "fsize": 1737699, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-some-good-man-vs-society-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 13, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21328036, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)09:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21327774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21327774</a><br>A Confederacy of Dunces", "time": 1669906194, "resto": 21327774}, {"no": 21328852, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:14:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21327925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21327925</a><br>sorry mate but this book is shit, one of my big disappointment in terms of universally recommended scifi classics", "time": 1669922050, "resto": 21327774}, {"no": 21328890, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:25:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21327774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21327774</a><br>The Catcher in the Rye.", "time": 1669922714, "resto": 21327774}, {"no": 21328907, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)14:29:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21328852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21328852</a><br>Ah, really?

His illumination of the dangers and consequences of the path that the West in general has been on is shown each day to be more and more prescient. <br><br>But it&#039;s easier to criticize something than it is to fix it. Lasch&#039;s proposed solutions to the problems he points out so concisely are vague or imprecise in comparison. Not that he doesn&#039;t have anything to say; anyone familiar with his works will know how deeply he cares and that he truly believes in his solutions, at least as a first step. But as a student of pragmatism in the vein of Pierce, his solutions occasionally strike me as wishful thinking, or coming from a very flowery view of human nature. <br> <br>To be specific, we can consider his defense of religion at the end of Revolt of the Elites. Lasch spends the last essay exploring the ubiquitous modern concept that Weber calls the &quot;disenchantment of the world,&quot; and its parallel in Freud, Jung, and some others. After pointing out what Lasch believes are the misconceptions common to each (specifically the likening of modern man&#039;s spiritual journey to an irreversible &quot;coming of age&quot; into modern adulthood from the medieval or otherwise religious childhood [perhaps stemming from an underlying belief in some sort of &quot;Progress&quot; that Lasch explores in more detail in True and Only Heaven]), his conclusion, clearly well-argued from a pathos standpoint and very touching, is strange.

It is a simple story. There is little to tell and it may sound as if I had invented it; but to me it seems like a poem. This young woman knew that she would die in the next few days. But when I talked to her she was cheerful in spite of this knowledge. &quot;I am grateful that fate has hit me so hard,&quot; she told me. &quot;In my former life I was spoiled and did not take spiritual accomplishments seriously.&quot; Pointing through the window of the hut, she said, &quot;This tree here is the only friend I have in my loneliness.&quot; Through that window she could see just one branch of a chestnut tree, and on the branch were two blossoms. &quot;I often talk to this tree,&quot; she said to me. I was startled and didn&#039;t quite know how to take her words. Was she delirious? Did she have occasional hallucinations? Anxiously I asked her if the tree replied. &quot;Yes.&quot; What did it say to her? She answered, &quot;It said to me, &#039;I am here \u2014 I am here \u2014 I am life, eternal life.&#039;&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth \u2014 that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way \u2014 an honorable way \u2014 in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, &quot;The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.&quot;</span><br><br>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever read a more beautiful book. <br><br>I have such incredible love this man in a way I&#039;ve never felt for any other author", "filename": "images (12)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 183, "h": 275, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669865113372873, "time": 1669865113, "md5": "6r0XTt9N81HVahQQDwFcnw==", "fsize": 6375, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "mans-search-for-meaning", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 14, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 9, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21327108, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)03:19:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21327037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21327037</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trees don&#039;t live forever?</span><br>Holy bugman.", "time": 1669882741, "resto": 21326129}, {"no": 21327120, "now": "12/01/22(Thu)03:26:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21327097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21327097</a><br>I&#039;m not hurting.
