The others she has condemned to the oldest fear and the most corro-sive one, without offering or even suggesting a means of recovery. If it is normal to die, it is not so to dally over death nor to think about it at every tum. The man who never takes his mind off it betrays his van-ity; since he lives in terms of the image others form of him, he cannot accept the notion that one day he will be nothing; oblivion being his continual night-mare, he is aggressive and bilious, and misses no op-portunity to display his temper, his bad manners. Is there not a certain inelegance in fearing death? This fear which preys on the ambitious leaves the pure untouched; it grazes them without taking hold. The rest suffer it testily and resent all those who simply do not experience it. A Tolstoy will not forgive their luck, and will punish them by inflicting it upon them, by describing it with an exactitude which renders it both repugnant and contagious. His art will consist in making every agony the agony and in obliging the reader to tell himself, horrified and fascinated: &quot;That is how you die.&quot;</span><br><br>Cioran The Fall Into Time", "time": 1671155471, "resto": 21388531}, {"no": 21389882, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)21:33:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read it a few years ago and all I can remember is him sitting in an airplane a lot, thinking about hitler.

The legal inequality of the two partners, bequeathed to us from earlier social conditions, is not the cause but the effect of the economic oppression of the woman. In the old communistic household, which comprised many couples and their children, the task entrusted to the women of managing the household was as much a public and socially necessary industry as the procuring of food by the men. With the patriarchal family, and still more with the single monogamous family, a change came. Household management lost its public character. It no longer concerned society. It became a private service; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all participation in social production. Not until the coming of modern large-scale industry was the road to social production opened to her again \u2013 and then only to the proletarian wife. But it was opened in such a manner that, if she carries out her duties in the private service of her family, she remains excluded from public production and unable to earn; and if she wants to take part in public production and earn independently, she cannot carry out family duties. And the wife\u2019s position in the factory is the position of women in all branches of business, right up to medicine and the law. The modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual families as its molecules.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/archive/ma<wbr>rx/works/1884/origin-family/ch02d.h<wbr>tm", "time": 1671095466, "resto": 21386174}, {"no": 21386260, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386174</a><br>Engels has evidence for his claims regarding the past.

Men generally spend more hours in paid work than women. Women are often forced to seek employment by the meagreness of their partner&#039;s wage. But since they are trying to earn a mere increment on top of their partner&#039;s wage, an additional sum to secure the family&#039;s survival, they don&#039;t need to be as picky with their choice of employment as men - they take up part-time, poorly remunerated jobs. Men, by contrast, need to earn enough to function as the primary &#039;breadwinner&#039; so that their wives can look after the household. Women are also paid less for the same work because, with their tendency to get pregnant and/or take time off to raise their children, they are a riskier business proposition.

They must shoulder the &#039;double burden&#039; of housework (including childrearing) and wage-work, whereas men can focus more exclusively on their jobs.

Homosexuality is actually extremely comfy as an idea when you divorce it from the cringe as fuck aesthetics of the pride parades and rainbows and shit like that. Take homosexuality, and implicate it in an outwardly amoral and dark aesthetic, and it becomes very attractive to the sorts of deviants who spend their days on 4chan. The problem I think most people really have with homosexuality is that the alphabet soup crowd gays are extremely annoying moralfags who lack cool vibes, and they are infantilized and stuck within this sort of retarded cosmopolitan liberal humanism which is just ugly and boring. They pretend to be happy, and like they are not a threat to anyone, but this is dumb. I like men who ARE a threat to other people, and who have the vibes, you know. And, unfortunately, that doesn&#039;t describe most homosexuals, because most of them are just lame poseurs with assworms.

To start with, the prose - often Kerouac writes sentences that just don&#039;t make sense. I don&#039;t mean a bit hard to parse the way Pynchon or Woolf&#039;s prose can be, I mean filled with grammatical errors and seemingly referring to nothing relevant. I&#039;ve heard he was often high on marijuana while writing and I definitely believe it. Another issue I had was that every single character was incredibly unlikable. I&#039;ve read plenty of books with protagonists the reader isn&#039;t meant to like (Hunger, The Trial, Dorian Gray etc.) but the characters were still compelling and at some level relateable, so it was completely fine. But in On The Road every single important person featured (except for that one Mexican girl Sal hooks up with) was absolutely awful, and in no way could I sympathize with them. The themes about free living and being independent were also incredibly laughable given that Sal was funded by his aunt for the whole book, which is also a reflection of the whole post-war mindset of Boomers who think they worked hard for their prosperity when it was really their predecessors doing everything. I also couldn&#039;t take any of it seriously because Sal and Dean never seemed to face consequences for their negative actions, didn&#039;t see anything wrong with them and didn&#039;t really grow as characters throughout the book. And to wrap all this together, On The Road is supposed to be an almost auto-biographical account of one period of Kerouac&#039;s life, so the whole book is him trying to sell the reader a vision of himself and Dean as American heroez of the open road, when he&#039;s truly just a massive dick and his friend the &quot;Holy Goof&quot; is anything but.", "time": 1671116331, "resto": 21386911}, {"no": 21387153, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387089</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I mean filled with grammatical errors and seemingly referring to nothing relevant</span><br>I read the book some time ago, but aren&#039;t most of the grammatical errors just colloquialisms (which he does on purpose)?<br>I agree with you about the characters not growing.

It&#039;s hard to pin down differences where it&#039;s more closer to Advaita specifically because it&#039;s not clear exactly Buddha&#039;s positions were on a lot of things and which later Buddhist school is closer to his actual intended teaching. As one sort of example there is a greater emphasis on monastic renunciation in Advaita compared to other types of Hinduism (just like in original Buddhism this was a big emphasis), but even in the other Hindu schools where ascetic renunciation is not required or isn&#039;t seen as the main spiritual path (like in Advaita) it&#039;s still typically seen as a respected thing that a minority of adherents of that school engages in regardless.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Does the idea of the illusory world form part of both doctrines?</span><br>It&#039;s not clear in what way Buddha meant to say the world is illusory or possibly that our perception/view of it is, some Buddhist schools interpret him as saying so but others disagree.

Shankara criticizes Vasubandhu&#039;s/Dinnaga&#039;s/Dharmakirti&#039;<wbr>s position with regard to external objects in his Brahma Sutra Bhasya and he calls their position illogical. According to Shankara, objects exist conventionally in a mind-independent way and he says there is no rational grounds for denying that they are mind-independent. Shankara only accepts the dream-analogy to the extent that it can be used to undermine belief that the waking world is itself the actual true reality (instead of Brahman being reality) but he does *not* accept it as a valid basis for rejecting the independence of exterior objects from the mind and he instead calls this irrational. <br><br>&quot;Consequently, Sankara\u2019s attempt is not to show that Vasnbnndhu is wrong in rejecting proof of externality, for Sankara himself accepts that rejection. To say that Sankara\u2019s argument does not prove that externality exists would be to miss the point His attempt, rather, is to show that Vasubandhu is wrong to reject the assumption of externality in any account of experience. So, the argument is over whether a coherent account of experience can be given while rejecting the externality of objects\u2018 i.e., without referring to objects as extrinsic to cognition.

Once initiated into an Advaita monastic order you are told the truth about your true Self and so on, and then you study Shankara&#039;s works (sometimes other works too) and teachings under the close guidance of a teacher. If someone is ready to fully grasp the teaching then liberation and enlightenment will just naturally dawn on them at some point during this process, and if it doesn&#039;t happen that is just because they didn&#039;t cultivate the necessary qualities first or didn&#039;t study and focus long enough until they overcame their own misunderstanding.<br><br>There are lists in the Advaita writings of certain qualities and things like self-control and purity of intention etc that someone is supposed to cultivate first before even being qualified to pursue liberation as a monk. The normal steps in the process of arriving at liberation are held to be Sravana (listening to the teacher or teaching), Manana (reflecting on the teaching and grasping its meaning) and Nidihyasana (focusing on or meditating on the core truth of the teaching to the exclusion of all else or directly intuiting it), but these can all occur just in a normal session of studying Shankara&#039;s writings with a teacher or listening to their verbal teaching by a riverside etc somewhere. Sometimes, a particular lineage of teaching Advaita will teach a certain mantra to recite or meditation to perform that will a supplementary practice that one can do when not studying Advaita texts, but this differs by lineage and it&#039;s never taught to be what produces liberation itself (which happens via knowledge and not an act) but it is only supplementary. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apart from the liberaion through gnosis what sort of practices form part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition?</span><br>They will do things like hatha yoga or worship deities.

Instead, you can just go about your life or even practice other religions and spiritual teachings while still appreciating and benefiting from the wisdom offered by Advaita. Some people find that studying Advaita changes their life and produces lasting peace and happiness even without becoming a monk and without otherwise altering their external behavior. <br><br>According to Advaita anyway people who are unenlightened but yet who spend their lives engaging in spiritual contemplation and meditation/yoga (like many practicing Hindus of non-Advaita schools), when they die they will either have a very good rebirth or they go to Brahmaloka (a heaven lasting billions of years that you have an opportunity to reach liberation from before your stay there ends and you start being reborn again): and either of these options are good and bring you &quot;closer&quot; to liberation in a sense.

I think what ai art really threatens us with is, through the pure economics of profit, is the total economic and social marginalisation of visual works that are produced by humans but presently occupy quite kistch contexts, like designs on mugs or little images on postcards, logos for businesses, designs printed on the surfaces of disposable packagings, and eventually print advertising media.

Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.<br><br>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Ach\u00e6ans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant&#039;s wreath, and he besought the Ach\u00e6ans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.<br><br>&quot;Sons of Atreus,&quot; he cried, &quot;and all other Ach\u00e6ans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.&quot;<br><br>On this the rest of the Ach\u00e6ans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. &quot;Old man,&quot; said he, &quot;let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.&quot;<br><br>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto had borne. &quot;Hear me,&quot; he cried, &quot;O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.&quot;<br><br>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.", "time": 1671114911, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387123, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386929</a><br>I bet you haven&#039;t read it in homeric greek", "time": 1671116871, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387181, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21383093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21383093</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw got the FAGles translation</span><br>bros there&#039;s absolutely no metre, it&#039;s horrid<br>it&#039;s truly over", "time": 1671117862, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387214, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:32:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;hasn&#039;t read the old Attic version</span><br>it&#039;s like you aren&#039;t even trying, \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03ce\u03c0\u03b5\u03b5\u03c2", "filename": "sneed", "ext": ".png", "w": 635, "h": 724, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671118350970904, "time": 1671118350, "md5": "5W4hTLK6wBS0WFAJTFOkeA==", "fsize": 1382248, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387233, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387014</a><br>Is this E.V.

It was not even implied, because your story was about a naked couple in the woods by a lake. Why should I be led to believe that you just ended the whole lake/woods thing to now not have a naked woman and just explore the world from your boat?

I wasn&#039;t ready yet. One day, while reading another book and jerking my crusty dick for the hundredth time, I heard a strange sound behind the cabin. Is that a bear? I wondered.<br>Opening the backdoor, I was surely surprised. There she was! She stood tall and regal, her naked body exactly as I remembered it. &quot;What is this? Where-where did you come from? HOw did you get here?&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, anon,&quot; she cries, &quot;I have missed you so. And look what I&#039;ve brought you.&quot;<br>I looked around, floored that she was really here. I immediately stripped down to nothing. We stood there, together again, naked as jay birds. Suddenly, I heard a great roar from the forest. &quot;What is happening?&quot; I asked.<br>She only turned and smiled. Walking over, she brushed her fingers against my chest and picked off a few cheetos pieces caught in my burly hair. &quot;I remembered our talks, anon.&quot; <br>Then, it burst forth over the canopy. A boat! She&#039;d bought and brought a fucking boat.<br>&quot;Incredible. Oh, anon, this is incredible,&quot; I hollered. I was so overwhelmed. All the memories and feelings of those hours beside the lake came flooding back. I was whole, again. She was here, my desert spring, my muse, my winter fire. <br>I walked over and embraced her. She hugged me close. I felt the warmth of her mound upon my overgrown pubes. I looked deep into her eyes and leaned in for a kiss. &quot;Oh, no no,&quot; she said, stopping me. She distanced herself.

I know that you are a gay man, and that you want to travel the ocean in your boat, sucking off strange, foreign men.&quot; <br>I was devastated. Then, another sound came from the forest. I heard it over the sound of the chopper leaving us. I heard it over the sound of my own sobbing. <br>A bear. I heard the roar of a bear.<br>Suddenly, he appeared at the edge of the forest. He stood almost nine foot tall, in a tuxedo overcoat, and he walked towards us as a man. Stopping short, he only looked at the two of us, one then the other. Finally, she walked over and hugged him. &quot;I&#039;d like you to meet my husband, anon. After you . . . after you left . . . I was destroyed. I was unwanted by the man that I so loved. Even as a beautiful nude woman, I knew that I would never be enough. So, I found Ruffles here. He is a Kodiak, and he works in Anchorage. We&#039;ll be leaving, now. It is just too much. Too tough.

The princesses of the nearby kingdoms were too old or he did not find them to be suitable in one way or another. He could not possibly marry a commoner, that would be against the rules of the kingdom. <br>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d he bemoaned, \u201cperhaps a bit of fresh air would be for the best.\u201d Taking his horn, he blew a bellowing cry for his steed; a Dragon given to him by his godfather, the Wizard of Pillarime.<br>A gust of wind and a loud thud could be heard on his balcony. The large red dragon knelt in front of the prince, knowing what was desired. Securly mounted, the two took flight across the kingdom of Pillarme. They flew past the forests and into the mountains, finally landing near a large secluded lake surrounded by the snowy peaks that guarded it. It was their spot, a spot no one else knew, except one other; a girl of ashen hair and hazel eyes. She was drinking from the lake undisturbed nor worried about the man and beast in front of her.<br>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Prince, \u201cI\u2019ve never met another person here.

Let me show you.\u201d<br>With a wave of her hand, sparks of mana took shape. She performed for the Prince, dazzling his mind with the beauty she conjured. <br>\u201cWow! How did you learn to use magic? And can I do it too?\u201d<br>Meredith smiled at the Prince. Her eyes welled with tears and her smiling lips drooped into a frown. <br>\u201cIt is a curse which I would never wish upon another. To mock Nature is a crime upon itself.\u201d<br>\u201cI wish to learn anyways. A talent this powerful could never be a curse.

The beast stepped back and arched his neck. Smoke formed from its nostrils, and in a single instant it blew a fire directly at the girl. <br>\u201cDraco! Stop!\u201d the Prince cried.

Meredith touched the nose of the beast and in an instant, decay set upon its body. The Prince was shocked; speechless at the events that took place.

It doesn&#039;t need to be so crude - the crudity is not profound and it&#039;s not any more illustrative of the autismo mind of the protagonist than his general autismo-ness.<br><br>Mentioning specific policies makes this look more like authorial diatribe than a standalone work, so you&#039;d do better to leave that vague. Even if it&#039;s not authorial diatribe, and I don&#039;t think it is, it feels enough like it could be to be sickening.<br><br>There are a couple of moments that wrench me out of the writing a bit. For example, I can&#039;t take the name Asher Lockman seriously; it sounds too edgy, even though it&#039;s a real-enough name. The sentence &quot;there were goofy mechanical rubber hands that removed her clothes, sort of like the famous contraption from Wallace and Gromit.&quot; needs to stop at the comma; goofy mechanical rubber hands is enough, and insisting that the reader imagine exactly the thing from that TV show that one time is... too insistent. The further crudity at this point is again undermining the writing.<br><br>The tweest at the end is good and I like it, but it doesn&#039;t seem fully developed. The crudity makes more sense when you get the tweest but the problem is that the crudity just feels crude until you make it that far. It would be better if it felt sinister - instead of making the reader feel like he&#039;s reading someone&#039;s bad erotic fiction you want him to feel like he&#039;s reading a well-written horror story about a woman who is trapped in someone&#039;s bad erotic fantasy; you want it to read sinister instead of reading crude. As for the &quot;point&quot; that Asher makes, it&#039;s fine to make it so briefly but only if the rest of the work is adding context to it. You want the &quot;point&quot; to tie together all of the &quot;evidence&quot; that your story has presented in a lightbulb moment. As I read it your story only contains a point in that single sentence and the rest of it is an entirely separate train.<br><br>The fourth-wall &quot;imagine what you want&quot; breaks seem to come out of nowhere and add nothing while being distracting, I&#039;d drop them but if you don&#039;t want to then develop them into something more than throwaways.<br><br>In short the writing is mechanically competent and the premise and idea is interesting. The delivery was good enough that I actually read the whole thing which is something I almost never do in this threads. It&#039;s just not &quot;fully realised&quot;, in my view - it doesn&#039;t strike the right tone for me and the argument is not expressed with force or impact or clarity. If you made it more sinister and &#039;erotic&#039; while being less crude and developed the point throughout the whole story (subtly) then it would be closer to complete.<br><br>These are just some thoughts and opinions that came to me while I was in my underpants drinking warm Coca Cola from a can that has been on my computer desk overnight.", "time": 1671062491, "resto": 21381156}, {"no": 21384456, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:03:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21384440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21384440</a><br>Replace &quot;bad erotic fiction&quot; with &quot;overly intimate and personally revealing erotic fiction&quot;.

However, bad literature sells. Young women are the biggest demographic for book sales and they gravitate towards shitty &#039;young adult,&#039; rebranded now as &#039;new adult&#039; fiction. I recently read one of these books because a girl I was seeing raved about it. It wasn&#039;t too far off from the type of prose you&#039;re writing. I noticed two major things while reading this book:<br>1. Write as if writing for children. You&#039;re already 95% of the way there. Your style is probably at a 4th grade reading level. However, writing for children also includes inserting a &#039;reach&#039; word for them every once in awhile. That is to say, include an SAT word once every two pages or so. It&#039;s cheap but it works. Somewhat related, in the Young Adult novel I mentioned, the author included the words &quot;well, fuck&quot; in the first chapter of the book and then proceeded to never write another curse word in the book for the next 400 pages. I assume this was to get young people &#039;hooked&#039; by a blunt, humorous, and edgy tone that never really reappears. The author also wrote in the present tense which was strange but it gave the feeling of immediacy. <br>2. Insert hollow John Greenisms based on pop-science or otherwise pseud knowledge. &quot;If the theory of parallel universes was true, there was a -insert character name here-, in some other world, who proudly and defiantly took to the dance floor. Of course, there was even a -insert character name here- that did not watch the dance floor at all, but watched another servant watching the dance floor. Even in her unlimited universes, she was forever the middle ground.&quot; It&#039;s terrible, I know. It took me 15 seconds to write, you can think of a better one. The more pseud the better. Shit like that; retarded women in their 20s with the minds of 13 year olds, the kind of people who unironically declare &quot;I don&#039;t think I want kids until my 30s&quot; when they are 22, consider &#039;deep.&#039; <br><br>If you are trying to be a solid author then no, you&#039;re nowhere near that. How could you be? There are some people who can write at a young age but they are few and far between and generally a brimming with strange life or experiences most would not have had. What can you teach someone about life? What do you have to say about it? As others mentioned, your story is very cliche. It doesn&#039;t even include extrapolations. By that I mean, read someone like Dostoyevsky or Steinbeck who, when they write, allow the narration to take an experience of a character and make it fit for us all. If you&#039;re on instagram, you may often see people commenting on certain posts &quot;no unique experiences&quot; as they discover the post describes something they thought was completely unique to them-- something they did in childhood or when no one was around. Through that post they discover that it is a shared behavior. That&#039;s what a &#039;good&#039; version of this might be able to accomplish.", "time": 1671129294, "resto": 21387116}, {"no": 21387913, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)13:55:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387554</a><br>See <a href=\"#p21387813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387813</a>", "time": 1671130517, "resto": 21387116}, {"no": 21388471, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:52:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387116</a><br>it&#039;s terrible but keep on trying, you might become a decent or great writer", "time": 1671137559, "resto": 21387116}, {"no": 21388527, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:04:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387554</a><br>man just take a gap year or even just a semester off at the very least. focus on your writing for that time and then at least if it doesn&#039;t work you can still fall back on college. i reckon get back in contact with them and try and explain you&#039;ve changed your mind and don&#039;t want to drop out completely. give them some focusing on mental health bullshit reason for wanting to take a break and i&#039;m sure they&#039;ll eat it up.", "time": 1671138297, "resto": 21387116}, {"no": 21388558, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)16:10:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The quality of your prose is better than 95% of YA authors&#039;.

To get in you need to have very good letters of recommendation ideally from professors who present you as a &quot;get&quot; for the department, not just as a smart guy from 5 years ago, if they even remember you enough to say something distinct. In Philosophy especially I think there is a concern for poaching students who are obviously plugged into hot or soon to be hot trends, maybe slightly more so than in other disciplines, because Philosophy &quot;moves&quot; in trends and schools and figures associated with them.

Remember this is coupled with the ongoing retirement of older professors, and their replacement by &quot;up and coming&quot; late gen-x&#039;ers and early millennials, where &quot;up and coming&quot; is defined by the standards of the current liberal consensus, so, often but not always, woke networking by oversocialized drones. The old professors who remember the golden era of rubber stamping and smaller admin are leaving, and the new professors who have only known the days of bloated admin and cutthroat networking and trend-chasing are arriving.

Even the luckiest and most brilliant graduates will probably do a postdoc or adjunct, or a tenure track job at a less prestigious institution, with salaries in the mid five figures for most postdocs and adjuncts and still not great for tenure track. And you also don&#039;t control where you get a position, so you will once again probably have to move and start over, now 35-40 minimum. If it&#039;s a postdoc or adjunct position, this is all so you can just restart the process and move again wherever your next position is. If it&#039;s tenure track, you&#039;ll still be hunting for a higher prestige/pay job, and likely have to move again. Once your PhD is done you will still be slogging to publish and stay relevant for a couple more years, while also hunting for these jobs and moving as necessary.

The only reason I grew and actually developed my skills and interests is because I was forced to, by one absolutely pointless deadline or another. This still happens on a regular basis, I pile up a bunch of &quot;oh yeah I&#039;ll definitely have that project underway or done this year,&quot; and I don&#039;t do shit but daydream for 10 months, and then the responsibility I signed up for forces me to actually do it because I&#039;ll be shamed or fired otherwise. <br><br>If by some miracle you can impose these strictures on yourself without external compulsion, then I agree that academia has nothing to offer you.

Only this can settle whether he is merely a clever architect of systems and principles, versed in definitions and analyses, or whether it is the very soul of his time that speaks in his works and his intuitions. A philosopher who cannot grasp and command actuality as well will never be of the first rank. The Pre-Socratics were merchants and politicians en grand. The desire to put his political ideas into practice in Syracuse nearly cost Plato his life, and it was the same Plato who discovered the set of geometrical theorems that enabled Euclid to build up the Classical system of mathematics.

What they do not possess is real standing in actual life. Not one of them has intervened effectively, either in higher politics, in the development of modern technics, in matters of communication, in economics, or in any other big actuality, with a single act or a single compelling idea. Not one of them counts in mathematics, in physics, in the science of government, even to the extent that Kant counted. Let us glance at other times. Confucius was several times a minister. Pythagoras was the organizer of an important political movemen akin to the Cromwellian, the significance of which is even now far underestimated by Classical researchers. Goethe, besides being a model executive minister \u2014 though lacking, alas! the operative sphere of a great state \u2014 was interested in the Suez and Panama canals (the dates of which he foresaw with accuracy) and their effects on the economy of the world, and he busied himself again and again with the question of American economic life and its reactions on the Old World, and with that of the dawning era of machine-industry. Hobbes was one of the originators of the great plan of winning South America for England, and although in execution the plan went no further than the occupation of Jamaica, he has the glory of being one of the founders of the British Colonial Empire. Leibniz, without doubt the greatest intellect in Western philosophy, the founder of the differential calculus and the analysis situs, conceived or co-operated in a number of major political schemes, one of which was to relieve Germany by drawing the attention of Louis XIV to the importance of Egypt as a factor in French world-policy. The ideas of the memorandum on this subject that he drew up for the Grand Monarch were so far in advance of their time (]671) that it has been thought that Napoleon made use of them for his Eastern venture. Even thus early, Leibniz laid down the principle that Napoleon grasped more and more clearly after Wagram, viz., that acquisitions on the Rhine and in Belgium would not permanently better the position of France and that the neck of Suez would one day be the key of world-dominance.

Yes, it would be good if the entire world could laugh and play and jump around bonfires with glee, but that isn&#039;t reality. Tribalism is really the preservation of one identity against others. Tribalism isn&#039;t inherently bad, but due to its nature it is competitive. Generally, this will entail harming other &quot;tribes.&quot;<br>If we talk about the most obvious example, ideology, you can see the example illustrated clearly. If you believe in &quot;anti-tribalism&quot; and want to ensure that the world is peaceful and &quot;humanistic&quot;, you will have to defend your &quot;tribe&quot; against the others that will very gladly tear it to pieces and replace it with a far less tolerant ideology. Because the more tribalistic peoples will have no qualms with crushing anything and remaining intolerant of your ideals, your tribe will inevitably disappear through out-competition. We can see this with the failure of liberal democracy to assimilate minority groups and extremist minority religions.<br>For the example of race, we have to talk in pragmatic terms. Jews are highly tribalistic, and this isn&#039;t a bad thing. The fact is that Jews, whether they overall like the Jewish community or not, are forced to rally together at every turn to defend themselves from possible racial or ethnic threats. They are tribalistic to survive. Blacks must be tribalistic in the same way, and their tribalism is what kept their culture alive. Whites are far less tribalistic, and their tolerance is being rewarded with the disappearance of their race and culture. This won&#039;t result in a more tolerant world; they will simply disappear and be replaced with more tribalistic peoples.<br><br>Tribalism is just a fact of human evolution. You cannot and should not avoid it, unless you&#039;re okay with being replaced.

And just because the little half niglet is born of the white womans womb does not make it Aryan, because although it has physical characteristics similar to the Aryan, it will lack those characteristics exclusive to a being of pure Aryan blood, the form of a pure Aryan being necessary as the vehicle which biologically makes these higher powers possible.

It would make sense that tribalism formed for reasons that are similar to the familiarity and safety that is inherent in most families. These tribes would then either through intuition or experience come to certain conclusions as to what activities or beliefs would be practiced and held by the ideal society. They would then actively oppose tribes that are in disagreement with them, first for the survival of their tribe and later on this line of thinking and acting is continued for tradition-sake which then leads to people like OP oppose previous tradition.

Pushkin and Lermontov occupy a class of their own above everyone else, with Pushkin being the clear superior. After that it is more a matter of taste but I love Zhukovsky, Balmont, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, and Gogol. I dont know that much about russian literature, but I have a grasp on the basic shape as well as the rules of Russian poetry.<br><br>The reason I love Dostoevsky is that he combines an absolutely overwhelming love for humanity and existence, marred by periods of intense suffering, with a psychological acuity and a theatrical flair that creates these insane melodramatic sequences where the characters are practically shouting out the dialectics of the inner torments of his soul. The sequences in which Dmitri and Alyosha or Alyosha and Ivan basically scream at each other in TBK are among the most affecting things I have ever read. The Father Zosima death sequence may as well have been writtten by a mystic or prophet. He just completely understood the sense of simultaneous love for everything and confusion over the brokenness of everything and he managed to express this through the travails of the characters he has set up as kind of mouthpieces for aspects of human existence. The brothers and the father all represent magnified dimensions of personality(monk, rake, intellectual) which correspond also to basic principles of reality(the spirit, body, mind), but he has arranged them into this almost delirious theatre of circumstance where you lose track of whether the characters are even really being characters or just acting out some kind of conversation. His prose is overall not great but he does possess the ability to make you feel a sense of excitement and foreboding, a breathless anticipation, with the way he chops up his sentences and paragraphs with digressions and cutoffs, you are always fully attendant even when he goes on a 20 page detour about some minor character&#039;s backstory because you understand why this is important to the overall conversation being had by the voices of the novel. <br><br>He is not a first rate artist, but he is a monumental impact on literature.

It is the word for bee, which has always been a symbol of those who collect the precious &#039;honey&#039; of traditional wisdom and preserve it for further generations. A collection of legends, well known in Armenian and Syrian circles with the title of The Bees, was revised by Mar Salamon, a Nestorian Archimandrite in the thirteenth century. &quot;The Bees&quot; refers to a mysterious power transmitted from the time of Zoroaster and made manifest in the time of Christ.... Man is Persian meaning as the quality transmitted by heredity and hence a distinguished family or race. It can be the repository of an heirloom or tradition. The word sar means head, both literally and in the sense of principal or chief. The combination sarman would thus mean the chief repository of the tradition.&quot; Yet another possibility was &quot;those whose heads have been purified&quot;, in other words: the enlightened.</span><br><br>Tl;dr Bees are hence reputed to be one of the symbols of the Sarmouni (an obscure Central Asian religious sect), because they gather nectar from flowers to form honey, much as the Sarmouni hold themselves as gathering religious lore and teachings to produce enlightenment. \u201cSarman\u201d means bee in Persian, and yet another etymological dissection of \u201cSarman\u201d has it as \u201cthose whose heads have been purified\u201d or \u201cthe chief/head repository of the tradition.\u201d", "time": 1671039737, "resto": 21377731}, {"no": 21383272, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:57:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The True Gospel of Chrishna-Jeseus <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The True Gospel of Chrishna-Jeseus is a facsimile of The Book of Sa-Heti by J.

Heaven is therefore blue, earth yellow, and hell--or the underworld--red. The fiery condition of the inferno merely symbolizes the nature of the sphere or plane of force of which it is composed. In the Greek Mysteries the irrational sphere was always considered as red, for it represented that condition in which the consciousness is enslaved by the lusts and passions of the lower nature. In India certain of the gods--usually attributes of Vishnu--are depicted with blue skin to signify their divine and supermundane constitution. According to esoteric philosophy, blue is the true and sacred color of the sun. The apparent orange-yellow shade of this orb is the result of its rays being immersed in the substances of the illusionary world.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the original symbolism of the Christian Church, colors were of first importance and their use was regulated according to carefully prepared rules. Since the Middle Ages, however, the carelessness with which colors have been employed has resulted in the loss of their deeper emblematic meanings. In its primary aspect, white or silver signified life, purity, innocence, joy, and light; red, the suffering and death of Christ and His saints, and also divine love, blood, and warfare or suffering; blue, the heavenly sphere and the states of godliness and contemplation; yellow or gold, glory, fruitfulness, and goodness; green, fecundity, youthfulness, and prosperity; violet, humility, deep affection, and sorrow; black, death, destruction, and humiliation. In early church art the colors of robes and ornaments also revealed whether a saint had been martyred, as well as the character of the work that he had done to deserve canonization.</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/st<wbr>a/sta11.htm", "time": 1671042797, "resto": 21377731}, {"no": 21383549, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)14:24:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21377731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21377731</a><br>IM NOT TAKING YOUR FUCKING RICE BAGS", "time": 1671045850, "resto": 21377731}, {"no": 21383933, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)16:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21377731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21377731</a><br>If you study the axial age, it seems like all these revealed religions pop up all over the world once trade routes like the silk road connect peoples.

If God does not produce all beings, then either there is something else that produces beings or beings arise without a cause. In either alternative God must either be able to eliminate/prevent the arising of any being that arises contrary to his will, making him effectively the producer of all beings, or he is not omnipotent and thus is simply a being like any other being. <br>Therefore everything that occurs is in exact accordance with the will of God. Considering the \u2018will of God\u2019, is it possible to act contrary to the will of God? If it is impossible, then how could blame be incurred? Although we differentiate sinful and non-sinful actions, there would be no difference from the divine view, otherwise we would have to admit that God willed an action which was against his will, which is contradictory. If it is possible, then objects arise which are contradictory to the will of God, which compromises his transcendence and omnipotence. Furthermore, no distinction can be made between the will of God and the objects of reality, because God\u2019s will is either all-pervading or God is not omnipotent. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God voluntarily chooses to do nothing</span><br>Not possible, because \u2018choosing to do nothing\u2019 is only conventionally designated as non-action and is a course of action like any other.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free will</span><br>If people have free will, then how are they affected by circumstances?

His protagonist is good at most things he does without a realistic explanation or arc. Especially in the second book, this crosses the line into brazen wish fulfillment, which is fun, but is also a popular aspect of stories to criticize. <br>A somewhat related reason that I can offer is the pacing of the stories. Aside from the fact that the third book is forthcoming for what, a decade, I still remember my impressions from reading the first two.

The issue is that &quot;broken&quot; is entirely abstract and subjective. Everyone has their own view of what the world should be, so as long as two people exist the world is broken. But it&#039;s actually worse than that because even a single person has conflicting desires and ideas, resulting in a &quot;broken&quot; world.<br>For instance in LotR the world is &quot;broken&quot; because Melkor is trying to insert his corruption into it n the form of Sauron and other evil creatures. But from their point of view the world is broken because that corruption ISN&#039;T present and they&#039;re the ones fixing it!<br> <br>I guess from a story point of view, the world is only &quot;not broken&quot; if the conflicting views of the characters within it don&#039;t escalate to that level. Like if everyone agrees on the overall state of the world, or simply don&#039;t care, but disagree on more personal lower level issues. But it&#039;s incredibly common for even minor personal issues to be escalated to existential &quot;broken world&quot; levels ala Romeo and Juliet &quot;if only the world were different&quot; etc...<br>So I guess you can&#039;t have a world that isn&#039;t broken if there&#039;s any conflict at all. Or at best if the single narrator/writer sees no issue and only the internal characters see &quot;flaws&quot; because of their own personal limitations.

In my view, Evola is overly shakti-tantrist, and Guenon is a bit arid in his metaphysics as well, being pure jnana yoga over karma yoga. Tomberg expresses the power of God&#039;s love as a symbol that can reconcile the paradox of dualism better than a &quot;pointless&quot; maya/samsara can, in the chapter of Meditations on the Tarot on the High Priestess.<br><br><a href=\"#p21372062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21372062</a><br>Yeah Guenon was surprisingly optimistic about &quot;the East,&quot; in a very general sense, still having intact traditions. I think Evola saw more clearly initially that the East is just as fucked as the West, they&#039;re just about 30-60 years behind, and he even says in some places that because the processes of degeneration were perfected in the West first, they are taking place faster and striking deeper in the East. <br><br>Guenon also seems to have realized, probably after moving to Cairo and seeing Islam up close, that the Islamic world has its own problems and doesn&#039;t have much of an active esoteric core either (or didn&#039;t at that time).

But because it&#039;s typical of the Traditionalist view, it&#039;s very exclusivist in measuring everything against jnana, and in Evola&#039;s case, against the tantric &quot;active&quot; path. Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above.

Essentially, Traditionalism&#039;s critique of Christianity is very similar to the Theravada critique of Mahayana Buddhism&#039;s soteriological and eschatological elements. <br><br>But these criticisms potentially force Traditionalism itself into a passive and quietistic position, which it is supposedly criticizing Christianity for. If there is no collective mystery or collective quest for redemption or struggle against Satan, if religions can&#039;t have an eschatological, soteriological, world historical character, because the only real truth lies in the universal metaphysical truth attained through individual initiation, then why bother fighting the occult war at all? In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all? Why seek immortality? Why desire to order society according to divine models if it&#039;s all cyclical or indifferent anyway? Guenon and Evola both emphasize that there is nothing &quot;moral&quot; in what they are doing, and that the vulgar sentimental and moral religion of everyday faithful is merely exoteric, basically its only value is containing dumbed down versions of symbols that keep ordinary people anchored in their Traditional-Platonic republics, while maintaining pathways of symbolic ascent for talented individuals to pursue to their eventual initiation. But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares? Why do things even happen contingently in history, like Evola says when he says that it&#039;s bizarre that such a sentimental religion took hold in the &quot;active&quot; West, if everything is cyclical? <br><br>It seems to me like there are contradictions in the Traditionalist worldview, because it wants to take history seriously, it wants to take the occult war seriously, it wants to be active in the world (except for some extreme Guenonians), it has or wants to have an eschatology, but it can&#039;t admit this to itself because it views all of these things as inadmissible in pure metaphysics. It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions. Similarly Traditionalism doesn&#039;t want to taint itself with mere samsaric, dogmatic, sentimental, tribal superstitions.

Ironically it ends up &quot;confusing the planes&quot; itself, by assuming that the only thing between man and the Absolute is this metaphysical hierarchy of symbols, and that there are no other beings with plans for us, that the cosmos is a cyclically autorenewing stage on which a few Guenons and Evolas periodically become immortal (for what? where do they go? if it&#039;s just to a purified paradisiacal state, isn&#039;t that what they criticize Christianity for promising?). Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active. From this perspective, Evola and Guenon would be doing exactly what they criticize New Agers for doing: stripping people of their everyday protections and throwing them into trans-personal psychic experiences in which they will simply be subject to whatever forces are nearby. <br><br>In rejecting all claims to revelation as contingent and samsaric, Traditionalism also misses out on the possibility of a symbolic interpretation of &quot;dispensationalist&quot; revelation, in which history is not merely samsaric and cyclical, and attaining enlightenment is not merely optional and always potentially open to amoral initiates, and the occult war is not merely a particularly bad patch in the most recent kali yuga in an infinite cycle of them, but instead, history is not cylical, there is a fixed goal here, there are win and lose conditions, enlightenment is not just &quot;available&quot; to initiates but is a responsibility and a duty, and thus enabling others to be enlightened is also a duty, etc.", "time": 1670832087, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of them<br>start with the mystery of the grail", "time": 1670832095, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373699, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21370825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21370825</a><br>Evola was influenced by the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich so it&#039;s not like he disregarded all protestantism.", "time": 1670832118, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373700, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373697</a><br>And therefore, the mythic-eschatological content of a religion like Christianity, with its publically available emphasis on resisting Satan and imitating Christ in daily life, is not just an incidental exoteric form of symbols that are only really relevant to autistic initiates, there is actually a purpose to the &quot;opening&quot; of the mysteries, which, yes, vulgarized them from a certain perspective, but perhaps only because this was analogous to sprinkling thousands of seeds, formerly been contained in neatly condensed form in individual pots, over a huge field of soil and manure, so that at first they seem merely &quot;lost,&quot; but in time they grow and become many thousands of fruit-bearing, seed-bearing trees themselves? <br><br>If all of history can be interpreted symbolically in this way, then we can begin to ask questions that the Traditionalists are afraid to ask: What does it MEAN, using symbolic interpretation and sympathetic intuition, that Christ figures appeared and managed to embed moral messages and fundamentally change history, turning pagan Europe into a moral and even sentimental Christian Europe - which Evola can only view as an aberration, from his Traditionalist perspective? What does it MEAN that analogous developments occurred in India, with Mahayana and other soteriological movements introducing new ideas into the stagnant and formalistic ritualistic cults?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

But personality and freedom are symbolically analogous to history: apparent contingency that can contain or reflect symbolic truth. Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence. But if the nature of all being is that of essence, which is pure in itself but which struggles to manifest clearly in becoming, then why shouldn&#039;t becoming itself (and its subordinate aspects: personality, freedom, history) have its own essence and meaning? Why not interpret ALL temporal contingency, all becoming qua &quot;mere negation of, or derivation or divagation from, atemporal being,&quot; as itself the symbolic emanation of an essence that combines and explains both being and becoming, instead of merely LEAVING becoming as an empty/negative category as almost all nondualist metaphysicians, including Traditionalists, do?

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function. To unite with God means more than to honour him in your heart - it means to become one with him, literally, and consequently also transcend everything, as he does. That&#039;s henosis. If you don&#039;t reach that level, you are still dealing with manifestation rather than with the source, the essence.", "time": 1671013978, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21382633, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382153</a><br>I can see why that apply to Abrahamic religions, but i dont get why Evola (and Guenon too) then do not offer the same criticism to Islam, which also relies on faith, a fallen view of man, and the inadequacy of man without God.", "time": 1671028721, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21383195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382633</a><br>It&#039;s because Islam has institutionalised Sufism which knows much higher metaphysical heights than exoteric Islam.

They spend more attention and time on Islam than on anything else, and almost all the major figures heavily specialise in Islam and constantly promote it or support Islamic groups. The ones that are not pro-Muslim are just vaguely perennialist, which would be fine if the rest weren&#039;t so heavily pro-Muslim.
