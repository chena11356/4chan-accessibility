Jesus says: &quot;When you have done all that is commanded. . . .&quot; Jesus is not evading the problem of law and order. There is a divine law, which is a commandment, and which is addressed to us. Hence we have to fulfill it to the letter. We have to do all that is commanded. The sense or conviction of the utter futility of the work we do must not prevent us from doing it. The judgment of uselessness is no excuse for inaction. It is not before doing or praying or preaching that we are to proclaim their inutility. It is not before their work that Elisha, Jehu, and Hezekiah proclaim the uselessness of their work, which is only a fulfillment of God\u2019s action. Pronounced in advance, futility becomes justification of scorn of God and his word and work. It is after doing what is commanded, when everything has been done in the sphere of human decisions and means, when in terms of the relation to God every effort has been made to know the will of God and to obey it, when in the arena of life there has been full acceptance of all responsibilities and interpretations and commitments and conflicts, it is then and only then that the judgment takes on meaning: all this (that we had to do) is useless; all this we cast from us to put it in thy hands, O Lord; all this belongs no more to the human order but to the order of thy kingdom. Thou mayest use this or that work to build up the kingdom thou art preparing. In thy liberty thou mayest make as barren as the fig-tree any of the works which we have undertaken to thy glory. This is no longer our concern. It is no longer in our hands. What belonged to our sphere we have done. Now, 0 Lord, we may set it aside, having done all that was commanded. This is how Elisha and Elijah finished their course.</span>", "filename": "ellulsnap2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671985177612029, "time": 1671985177, "md5": "orHqESUwkhNVhISSPr40LQ==", "fsize": 116762, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432184, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)11:20:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432182</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second point to be noted in the verse is that it is not God or Jesus who passes the verdict of inutility. It is we ourselves who must pronounce it on our work: &quot;We are unprofitable servants.&quot; God does not judge us thus. He does not reject either us or our works. Or rather, he does not echo the verdict if we have passed it ourselves. If (as Christ demands) we judge ourselves in this way when we have done all we could do and accepted all our responsibilities, if we are able to view our own works and most enthusiastic enterprises with the distance and detachment and humor that enable us to pronounce them useless, then we may be assured of hearing God say: &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant&quot; (Matthew 25:21). But if we pass in advance this bitter judgment of uselessness that paralyzes and discourages us, if we are thus completely lacking in love for God, or if on the other hand we magnify our works and regard them as important and successful (Jesus, little Jesus, I have so wonderfully exalted you, but if I had attacked you in your defenselessness your shame would have been as great as your glory. . . .), if we come before God decked out in the glory of these lofty, grandiose, and successful works, then . . . &quot;Woe to you that are rich&quot; (Luke 6:24), for the rich man today is the successful man. Everything is useless, and we are thus tempted to add: Everything, then, is vanity. We are tempted, for it is a temptation to do only what is useful and to assimilate the judgment of Ecclesiastes on vanity (1:2ff.) to the inutility which we have been briefly sketching. Now this spontaneous reaction raises a question. Why are we so concerned about utility? Why do we regard what is not useful as worthless? In reality, we are obsessed at this point by the views of our age and century and technology. Everything has to serve some purpose. If it does not, it is not worth doing. And when we talk in this way we are not governed by a desire to serve but by visions of what is great and powerful and effective.

As Ellul explains, humanity was once directed to tend to the garden for no apparent reason. Mankind rebelled by consuming the fruit that allowed us to judge, to leave the protection of God and supply those reasons for ourselves, and now we have no choice but to be enslaved to the necessity of work. And, in this way, faith in Christ&#039;s sacrifice is a way of abdicating this responsibility back to God and returning to the &quot;purposeless&quot; freedom found in the Garden of Eden. I can see why Ellul loves Ecclesiastes so much as well. Zooming out further, now we understand the soteriological context behind Ellul&#039;s analysis of technique\u2014the technological society threatens to annihilate every vestige of the possibility of a Christian life. <br><br>I still find it difficult to square Ellul&#039;s complete disregard of morality, as I see it more as an exaggeration or maybe a way of subordinating morality to God, highlighting the &quot;double morality&quot; of the world vs. the impossible standard of the divine, but I can see where he&#039;s coming from if we mean coming to grasp with the limitations of man&#039;s perspective.", "time": 1671986275, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432267, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)11:54:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432229</a><br>At the same time, I can&#039;t help but think there&#039;s a certain emptiness to this understanding of the meaning of life as told from Ellul&#039;s Christian perspective.

I would like to go back to what we discussed earlier, namely, the matter of declaring good and evil by saying: This is good and that is bad. What this really means is to put oneself in the place of God. Only God speaks the good. Either you say what God says or you say something else, and that is a problem. Putting yourself in God\u2019s place inevitably involves breaking the relationship with him; and since he is the living one (the totality of all being), any claim of replacing him involves cutting oneself off from life, which results in death. The text is commonly translated as: On (or from) the day you eat of it, you will die. However, the Hebrew text is in the imperfect tense; consequently, the future tense should not be used. It is not at all a punishment or penalty that is imposed. What the text is literally saying is that from the very day you ate of it you would be dead. It is not that you will die sometime in the future. What this means is that from the very moment you would wish to decree what is good and what is evil, it would mean that you are already dead. It is not a matter of a punishment, but of a process of breaking off with God by no longer listening to him, putting yourself in his place, from then on saying by yourself what is good and evil in his place; and you have begun to be dead. At this point, living in freedom is impossible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The situation is analogous to one in which a parent warns a child not to touch a hot stove because she will burn her hand. Burning her hand is not a punishment. There is only a punishment if the parent says: If you try to touch the stove, you must go to your room. The parent warns the child of the reality: to touch something hot is to burn your hand. We have hopelessly confused God\u2019s warnings with commandments. In the entire Old Testament, God only warns his people of what will happen if they do this or that.</span>", "time": 1671995211, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432643, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432639</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What our text reveals, therefore, is that the freedom of humanity exists only if they remain in communion with God, this communion being a relationship of love. All along we have seen the importance of love and sexual communion and so on, and all this is directed at the relationship of love between God and humanity, even in the most physical sense. Hence, what is commonly understood as a commandment is not at all a law imposed on humanity; it is not an imperative, a constraint, or something negative, but a condition for being alive. Humanity is told that in order to continue to live, it is not enough to eat from the tree of life, but you must remain in your relationship with God and receive the spirit, the spirit that comes and goes as an element of freedom; and because of this, you cannot claim the right of deciding what is good and evil in God\u2019s place, instead of listening to the Word of God. It is the very condition of freedom, because God reserves for humanity the possibility to do otherwise.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next comes the question of service. In the fifteenth verse we read that Yahweh takes humanity and puts them in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. It is rather amusing that many commentaries say something to the effect that this is ridiculous. Why work in a garden when it has already been explained that the soil produced all kinds of fruit by itself? Why did the garden have to be guarded? Father Chaine, in his commentary, concludes that the writer had a bad day and even a lapse of memory. I think, on the contrary, that this text is full of meaning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humanity is called to render a service, but one that is useless. Of course, the garden did not need to be cultivated since it was fruitful, and it did not need to be guarded since there were no external enemies. This is exactly the point: there is no necessity to work and there is no necessity to be productive. All there is, is the Word of God. God tells humanity that they are there to cultivate and keep the garden. What humanity is therefore faced with is: \u2018God says that I should do this, it serves no purpose, but I will do it.\u2019 What God says is the good. If, on the other hand, humanity begins to say, \u2018Of what use is it?\u2019 that is like the tree of knowledge of good and evil. \u2018Since the garden doesn\u2019t require cultivation, I do not need to work, and since there are no enemies, I do not need to guard it, so I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 That is the evil. This response may be morally legitimate: \u2018Since it serves no purpose, I will not do it.\u2019 But God said: \u2018Do it\u2019; and that is the trouble, to have confidence or not in the Word of God. This is the situation humanity had to face. In any case, it is clear that it is impossible to derive from these well-known texts the law of work. Work as such does not exist for humanity as a law of creation.</span>", "time": 1671995271, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432653, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432643</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That this text isn\u2019t about real work is confirmed by the use of the Hebrew word used for working the garden, namely, avoda, which means worship. In other words: \u2018You will worship God through working and guarding it, knowing very well that these actions are unnecessary; but it is simply a form of worship, and you honour and adore him by it. It is not in order to produce, but to honour in reciprocity.\u2019 All the early Jewish commentaries have strongly suggested that what this means is that God did not create humanity for nothing. He did not launch humanity into an emptiness. Humanity has a role to play. Leisure is not a life, and empty leisure is not good. This role, according to the Hebrew word avoda, is to bring the whole of the garden of Eden before God so that all of creation will adore God through this human service. When humanity serves God for nothing and without an objective, they bring the creation to worship God.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The above, I believe, is the meaning of verses 15 to 17. We begin to see where the story of good and evil comes from. Humanity could refuse to work, but this has consequences that we will soon examine. **The refusal to work for nothing led to the necessity of having to work for something.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don&#039;t like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.", "time": 1671972899, "resto": 21431659}, {"no": 21431760, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:56:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431745</a><br><a href=\"#p21431758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431758</a><br>Then there is the fact that every character you meet in the story turns up again, hundreds of miles away, to reveal that they are someone else and have been secretly controlling the action of the plot. It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

I might vet female erotica harder next time, to read one focused on romance or adventure with romance, rather than this reverse harem stuff.<br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>------------------<br><br>Title: A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor<br>Author: Kathryn Moon<br>Rating: 4/10<br><br><br>[Plot]<br>The premise of the book is simple - a young and pretty maid in victorian London(?) is a wicked, lustful girl, fucking and ruting with pretty boys at every opportunity, which cost her multiple jobs. Eventually, a tall and handsome doctor with broad shoulders invites her to his office for obvious reasons, where they immediately fuck. However, in the middle of the coitus the man turns into a big monster. She doesn&#039;t mind much, which leads for her being invited to work in a Rooksgrave Manor, place where adventurous young women &#039;service&#039; monster men. <br><br>[Review]<br>This book is almost exclusively porn. Seriously, there is very little plot, if at all. Majority of it is just the main character being fucked in different positions or combination of partners. Despite how well-written the book is (on a technical level), it did raise my opinion of typical male Harem Erotica. In a typical male erotica book the protagonist has adventure, rivarly, fights for what he believes, etc. Fucking is an addition to that, the girls have to be given at least symbolic courting. In this book the protagonist is wanted and desired from the get-go.<br><br>Female sexuality is different from male, that is obvious for everyone with three brain cells. However, the protagonist in this book has no real character traits or personality aside of being a whore. Her character starts and ends with wanting to fuck handsome men, multiple at times, especially monster men. There is nothing more to say about her. Every handsome, powerful man metaphorically falls to his knees in front of her due to her being so fuckable; it&#039;s not even about beauty, I don&#039;t think the author called the protagonist beautiful or pretty even once. Still, she is extremely desired by everyone, all men care about is spoiling her and talking how her constant urge to fuck makes her special. <br><br>This might be the most radical Female Fantasy you will ever read - woman just has to exist and want to fuck, and everyone calls her queen and love of their life. Maybe it&#039;s because lately I&#039;ve taken significant amount of mental damage due to loneliness and going into the Blackpill rabbithole, but reading this book literally drained life from me. There are male equivalents of this book, but they are extremely niche.

Some people are very good at absorbing systematic learning, repeating verb forms, practicing nouns with flip cards; others don&#039;t progress at all that way and instead do much better the language bum way, by improvising and doing things wrong but over time getting an &quot;ear&quot; for what&#039;s correct and what isn&#039;t, and learning words organically through exposure.

He was an early champion of a number of avant-garde and modernist poets; developed important channels of intellectual and aesthetic exchange between the United States and Europe; and contributed to important literary movements such as Imagism and Vorticism. His life\u2019s work, The Cantos, remains a signal modernist epic. Its mix of history, politics, and what Pound called \u201cthe periplum,\u201d that is a point of view of one in the middle of a journey, have given countless poets permission to develop a range of poetic techniques that capture life in the midst of experience. In an introduction to the Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot declared that Pound \u201cis more responsible for the 20th-century revolution in poetry than is any other individual.\u201d Four decades later, Donald Hall reaffirmed in remarks collected in Remembering Poets that \u201cEzra Pound is the poet who, a thousand times more than any other man, has made modern poetry possible in English.\u201d Pound never sought, nor had, a wide reading audience during his lifetime; his technical innovations and use of unconventional poetic materials often baffled even sympathetic readers.

Its no different than how Eurangatangs used to give AIDs-riddled blankets to Native Americans and call it charity.

In the 60s white people could be trusted to unconditionally support the system, and the only thing the system worried about was uppity blacks, so it focused all its power on turning blacks into permanently retarded and dependent welfare slaves. When the last vestiges of post-war prosperity died down, white people began to get uppity too, and do that &quot;actually potentially voting for independent politicians who make concrete political promises&quot; thing the system doesn&#039;t like. <br><br>So the system switched to using blacks, who were already perma-retarded from decades of welfare/ghetto neo-slavery, as weapons against whites. Existing problems in the black community (insane crime, poverty, misery rates that they bring with them wherever they go) were denied and covered up by media gaslighting and university PC brainwashing, so that whites couldn&#039;t even conceptualize and confront the worsening conditions of their daily life, while those worsening conditions slowly eroded their sanity and ability to act politically. This is called anarcho-tyranny. <br><br>Blacks, understandably still uppity from all the racism, wanted revenge for the damage the system did to them most recently, and a minority of white slave owners (and black slavers) did to them not so recently. The system came and told them &quot;whites did this to you,&quot; meaning, the tens of millions of the poor white people suffering under anarcho-tyranny, whom the system needs to keep from getting uppity because they still have enough numbers, votes, and combined power to change the system. <br><br>&quot;Whites&quot; are not your enemy. Peoples enslave and conquer each other. Africans did it to Africans, everyone did it to everyone else. That&#039;s in the past. The system is your enemy, and it&#039;s using you. Whites will soon be your enemy too however, because the one thing holding whites back from reverting to old world rules and conquering and enslaving blacks and venting decades worth of repressed rage at underreported black crime is the system&#039;s brainwashing. Whites are currently doing what every minority does just before a major revolution happens, getting formlessly angry and building up to a huge, poorly directed and mostly unconscious, radial explosion. When they do that, they will repudiate everything the system has been forcing them to think and say, and probably deliberately do the opposite of it. <br><br>You are way better off strategically aligning yourself with &quot;racists&quot; right now and creating a robust dialogue on mutual racial respect than you are siding with the dying system against the &quot;racists.&quot; Most people are NOT racist right now because the brainwashing is still bone deep, but they&#039;re about to become racist in a way nobody has seen for a few centuries.", "time": 1672046654, "resto": 21430026}, {"no": 21435180, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:54:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435131</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two more weeeeeeks</span><br>this is what happens when your highschool crush had the basketball team run a train on her", "filename": "E9un9E3XoAQA1Ow", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 427, "h": 570, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672048442603464, "time": 1672048442, "md5": "qXFD+biFTGDueoqSWaaJlQ==", "fsize": 24210, "resto": 21430026}, {"no": 21435212, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)05:24:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21430069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21430069</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is madness to betray your own pattern regonition and to deny facts</span><br>There are so many assumption that are going on here.

After slavery ended they were made to be scapegoats by the kkk and just about every other white person. Imagine trying to live in a country where 99% of the people hate you. That would be incredibly difficult just to survive yet alone get an education (from white teachers who hate you) or raise kids with a level of care and nuance to create emotionally mature adults. Today, racial hatred isn&#039;t the issue. It&#039;s the fact that we have outsourced all of the jobs traditionally done by African Americans. The mainstream world offers no real path forward for most people and black people are at the bottom of the pile. I teach at a 90% minority school and I can tell you that most of these kids are just mirroring the behaviors of their parents who did the same thing with their parents, etc., ad nauseam. I always have like 2-3 black kids every year that were adopted and raised by white families and those people have been some of the kindest, most determined, most intelligent, most emotionally mature human beings I have ever encountered in my entire life. Just thinking about some of the things they did for their classmates in need makes me tear up. Anyway, the truly low IQ thing is to see something and just accept it without trying to understand or process it in some way. This is why racists have a low IQ. They purposefully ignore the bigger picture and subscribe to the just world fallacy. It&#039;s the same instinctual, animalistic behavior that causes low IQ and low emotional regulation. It&#039;s also just morally bankrupt. You see someone lower than yourself and you take it not as an opportunity to help them but rather as an opportunity to assume that you are inherently superior. Even the most ghetto black kids today have higher IQs and emotional intelligence than 95% of white boomers.

The town is (was) named after its first resident, a woman that moved to the Arabian desert, to escape the claustrophobia of The Land of Liberty. A handsome lady with pale skin and green eyes where in their shine you determine a spiritual aptitude unlike others. She initially moved to a village called Al-Riyadhah. The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil. When she moved, the people of Al-Riyadhah were so accepting (they are so even to this day) a stranger could mistake her for a native.</span><br>You can delete like 1/2 of that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She found an occupation by fixing broken electrical appliances and selling them. Apparently, she had a background in the electrics. She greatly reduced a great pile of broken machines that fostered vermins of all kinds so her value manifested sharply and was quickly appreciated. After saving enough money, she expanded her business by importing new electrical appliances from The Middle Kingdom. The town was only a couple miles from a popular trading route. They were mainly tools like saw machines and drills or conveniences such as lights and fans.</span><br>Pacing bro pacing. You&#039;re just listing exposition after exposition.

A good analogue for an imaginary person is: a person in your dreams. You know they are a part of you and come from within, but you wouldn&#039;t think of them as yourself if you were talking to them; and you can tell they have somewhat separate wills from yours. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t much different from these dream people, except you can be aware of them while you are awake. In practice, imaginary friends can provide many benefits. They can provide companionship, motivation, love, understanding, or all these at once. It is up to each person to figure out why they are making an imaginary friend, and what void are they hoping to fill with them.<br><br>I also want to be abundantly clear about the following: there is nothing paranormal about this. There is no mysticism or magic here. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t demons or entities from another realm, and they certainly can&#039;t directly change the world around you. That being said, some of these interpretations can be fun\u2014even useful\u2014to play with, when you consider anything is possible within your inner realm; just as long as you remember that this is the only realm where these things are true.<br><br>To summarize the process: our goal is to create a character and get to know them, and play with them in our heads well enough that eventually our subconscious begins taking the lead.

People&#039;s functions start leaping out at you all the time, and sometimes you&#039;ll recognize correlation between persons you wouldn&#039;t necessarily want mentally associated, and it can have emotional effect.

Jung would be excited. Personality Types was a major part of his work, yet most of it was relegated to the past, and he was largely eclipsed by Freud in mainstream psychology. It&#039;s only with advanced development of his theories that the correlations to modern neurology will become fully clear. Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences.

Celine referred to himself solely as a &quot;stylist&quot; in the radio interviews to deflect from the reputation he had built following the war. He was beloved by a select of French writers and politically-ignorant Americans, but despised by the establishment. Hence he tried to repurpose his work as an exercise in style and nothing more. But the style serves a purpose, it isn&#039;t l&#039;art pour l&#039;art, but a style necessary to communicate disgust toward the world that fell apart before his eyes. This is why he favored Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, Conrad... writers who confronted the darker side of the human spirit.

He mentioned somewhere, maybe to Milton Hindus, that slang is the language of hatred. The worker hates his boss so he invents his own lingo, his own form of verbal disgust. C\u00e9line transformed this into his protest against the cruelties of human nature. But now even the most respected C\u00e9liniens in France act as if he was a kind of language-theorist or a stylist somewhat akin to Nabokov or Updike.

Now nobody reads Montherlant, and his would-be reactionary fans read C\u00e9line! But after the war it all fell apart and he became a dirty name in France. Only the fascists and weirdos wanted anything to do with him (not a bad thing of course!). The \u201crehabilitation\u201d of a writer is different in France, as the idea of greatness still exists there, unlike in the US of A. By the 60s, just after he had died and successfully passed off his novels as stylistic exercises, all the big names began to praise him as a genius.

He is part of the old European tradition of literature, one that dates back to Rabelais in France (and even earlier if we look at the medieval chroniclers he read late in life)... but he is distinctively apart from the classical, mannerly, pretty writers that were in vogue in the early 1900s. As such a lot of modern artists, like Dubuffet, and leftish types, like Sartre and Debord, came to love his spirit, whereas I do not think Brasillach&#039;s writing really lends itself to such a thing. Brasillach is not as good as Celine... that is one thing you have to understand. Celine is at the level of Dante in terms of what he can evoke with words, how it flows, the drama he can build in a single sentence, the severity of his statements. So naturally it would have been hard to ignore him, even without the non-fascists who came to like him. Celine was not a fascist himself, but that is another story...<br><br>France, as I&#039;ve said, has a reverence for greatness in a way that is unheard of in America and I assume the UK.

Celine is closest to Proust in his pessimism toward &quot;the good life,&quot; only instead of attacking the aristocrats and the nouveau riche he tore down the dignity of war and the mechanistic world that has entirely destroyed the human spirit.

The essence of Celine (as he himself said) was emotion via distortion, you have to distort with words to achieve the real feeling. Gide said something to the effect of &quot;Celine is not reality, but the residue of reality.&quot; If so, then yes, it works with Mannheim.

To a Frenchman, literature is number one, and you can get away with a great deal of things as a writer... countless French writers were pederasts who went to Algeria to have their way with the local boys, but their names adorn the streets of Paris. Yet Americans won&#039;t read Lolita simply because it is ABOUT something they find disturbing. So in general, one has to do a lot to really lose out on immortality if one is a great writer in French.</span><br>Perhaps some time ago, but in my recent experience, young French people are mentally Americanized and have fallen for the same interminable conversations in which one party insists upon the alleged sins of an artist&#039;s personal life while the other strikes up an insipid plea to separate the art from the artist. The idea that one can engage with these things unapologetically, that one owes no explanation for what one finds moving, grows increasingly foreign.

A girl came walking up, wearing those tight black jeans and a thin green top, the rolled up sleeves exposing her alabaster white skin and her long smooth brown hair falling down to her back. She wasn\u2019t voluptuous or anything but certainly had a nice shape to her. As she walked up to the shelf directly behind me she stopped for a moment and glanced towards me, as if appraising this odd creature sitting there. I ignored her as I ignore all women. What came next is still inexplicable to me. In one smooth motion she tucks her hair behind her ear, bends over and slightly swivels her body so that her bottom is directly aligned with the side of my head, not even a full ten centimeters away. Seeing that wonderful heart shaped peach even more accentuated by those dark pants so close to me was a very pleasant surprise at first. But then it hit me. The smell. The stench. Her bottom half had a truly rank, powerful stink to it and I was shocked, I had never experienced anything like it before, how can such a beautiful girl carry this smell with her? I always thought they clean themselves very thoroughly. In the first moment I was taken aback but in the second I had to force myself not to inhale deeply because I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I loved her stink. My nethers were throbbing and I feared that she might hear the sound of my flesh pulsing and rubbing against the fabric of my clothes. I quickly checked the room, which was empty, and tried to guess if there were any cameras set up in a library, I even thought that perhaps getting kicked out of university and maybe even getting a minor conviction might not be so bad, I was still young after all. I had never gotten so close to\u2026well, you know. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity both pleasurable and torturous, pleasurable for my eyes and nose and torturous for the inability to indulge, she picked her book, stood straight again and danced off, leaving me aching and yearning for her dark smell. I had to remain sitting down for a few minutes until I was finally able to get up and walk off to clear my thoughts.

In the dimming light and against the last pastel vestiges of sunset came belching an unbroken stream of incendiary rounds from the nose of the plane, appearing as one solid, unbroken beam of light. The sound that followed, seconds after, set my ears to ringing. The plane climbed steeply, came back on station.

I stand at the stop on my morning route to work, watching the approaching bus. Will she notice? Will she remember me? I step through it&#039;s automatic door. She&#039;s there, as always; long brunette hair and a beautiful somber face peering down at her phone. I quickly pass her by and take a seat near the back. This is the second year since I began taking this bus and, aside from the brief occasion here and there, it feels as though we have always been together. Though she doesn&#039;t know my name, I know hers; May. I thought that name fitting-- today is the thirty-first of April, and tomorrow-- it will be May. I lean my head on the seat in front of me. The day goes by as usual; she gets off after two stops at K. S. Library on E.M. Street, and I get off the next stop over to work at M. Automotives. After work I take the bus back home, alone.<br><br>The time is ten-forty P.M. I pull the journal from under my mattress and set it on the desk. Sixty-seven pages, all addressed to May. I begin writing.<br>&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve become quite bored if you&#039;ve made it this far. The good news is that this will be the last entry. I want to speak with you tomorrow, but, as usual, I am afraid. It dawns on me just how creepy I was, how disgusting I have been observing you in this one-sided relationship. Tomorrow will be my lowest point yet, perhaps, but also my highest. Will it hurt you? I tried to think of any other way. I didn&#039;t want to become what I am now. Every day hurts me, every moment that I am alone throws me into painful conniptions. I&#039;m being melodramatic, I suppose. The truth is that I know what I&#039;m doing now and what I am soon to do is inexcusable. I cannot escape the simple fact that I am alone for no other reason than this: that I am a monster. You did well to avoid me, as everyone else has. Even now, in this very written letter, I demonstrate how wrong I am.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So many times I resolved to ask your name, to introduce myself; each time I simply passed you by. I always knew that even if we were to have a simple friendship, you would sense my inner wrongness and turn away in disgust. I don&#039;t blame you. This letter is proof enough that as dignified as I attempt to appear, I am little more than a stalker. But even if you were to put up with me, I understand that there is a problem more fundamental to my being. I could never make you happy. I wouldn&#039;t be able to bear slowly corrupting your innocent joy with my sadistic melancholy. This is why I have resolved to acknowledge what I am; A creep. A stalker. A monster.

It just seems that people really don&#039;t know what love is about, but they just want someone to make then feel less lonely. My guess is that most people are just not able to see why true friendship is necessary between a man and woman in a relationship nor are they willing to go that far with their spouse becuase when you really get to the heart of it, they don&#039;t love theur sppuse. Their spouse is a means to an end (for men, to get laid and to have kids. For women, to get laid and for protection).

It\u2019s hard to put into words but getting a first hand account of how one of the great artistic presence saw art and life. I find the letters inseparable from the artwork. Vincent was a cankerous oddball that was poor socially so he pours his heart out to his brother and benefactor who always believed in him. It manages to be sad and inspiring at the same time. On one hand you have the starving artist who would not compromise his vision and sellout commercially to make money; his brother always believing in him and supporting him financially; the heartbreaks and breakdowns that Vincent suffered; his early death not knowing success or fame; his brother not giving up after his death and pushing his artwork; his brother\u2019s death 6 months after Vincent\u2019s with neither succeeding. On the other hand Vincent had some profound thoughts and saw the world in a beautiful way. He reminds me of a peasant savant. It is such a unique look through the lens of a great artist. I\u2019ve probably read it 5 or 6 times and it\u2019s worthwhile every time. One day I\u2019ll get the complete set though it is a bit pricey. I like the Penguin edition because it has a little blurb or summary before every letter explaining various situations and circumstances. I strongly recommend trying it out.

People at least try to do an accent when they speak Spanish, even a bad one. Anglos don&#039;t even attempt an Italic accent when speaking Latin. They just pronounce it like it&#039;s English rearranged in some kind of code.

We could go in the weeds a little deeper, especially since you think Mary refers to Jesus&#039; mother, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the olive tree thing.<br>I&#039;m interested in buying rather old things. I almost bid on a lot containing a couple Ethiopian texts and some metal objects this week. I never bid, and it went out of my price range. But in that same auction, there were a bunch of signet rings and cylinder seals. I really like the look of that stuff and cameos too. It looks like you might know a thing or two about them. What do you look for in terms of provenance and authenticity? Can you give any further information about your collecting? All the people that I know from university hate privately held antiquities and such, meaning they won&#039;t give advice. I&#039;m very much of the opposite position. Several years ago, before even studying Classics, I think I looked at the online store of one of the most prolific and shitty forgery factories before some people at my university exposed it and the FBI shut them down. Thus, I&#039;m quite concerned about provenance and doing my due diligence when a bunch of an item&#039;s value is wrapped up in it being really old or made by a particular person.", "time": 1671785081, "resto": 21409393}, {"no": 21422248, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21421931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21421931</a><br>Because it basically died out in favor of reconstructed pronunciation.

They walk the line between caky and greasy\u2014it is just right. Their eyes are sharp, penetrating, bright. Sometimes they are contoured, sometimes not. Regardless, their eyes penetrate\u2014one wonders if the young woman has appropriated the symbolic phallus of the man that makes possible the infamous masculine gaze. The gaze is their\u2019s now\u2014as a man, you look at them and feel your gaze repelled, controverted, turned in onto yourself. You know, in that moment, that you no longer are the one who attends, but she. There is a reversal between the lover and the beloved. The lover becomes the beloved, and the beloved is now the lover who turns out to be indifferent. Their youth and vivacity affords them a certain discriminatory quality to their gaze\u2014they see through you now. It does not matter who you are\u2014you are seen fully. If you are a complete loser, you are seen for who you are. Yet, if you are the well-to-do putting off an aura, that too is controverted. The feminine gaze subverts the symbolic order of interpersonal relationships\u2014the rules of old are out, since the women, in their unreason, have seen through it. Indeed, the subversion of the very project of the Enlightenment, whose seeds are in fact within the Enlightenment itself, culminates in this feminine gaze\u2014it is unreason born of reason that subverts reason itself as such.

For one, we are experiencing a revolution which is similar to the inventions of written languages and the printing press with the outgrowth of this distributed network we call the internet. This is going to change how we view the world on a metaphysical level. For instance, I personally don&#039;t even see myself as an individual in a Cartesian sense. There is no stable subjectivity, which is fully distinct from the world around it. To put it in more schizo terms, its like I am a temporary grounding point where millions of minute electrical signals compose flows that are redirected through this point in every which way. Identity for me consists of something entirely different than identity for previous generations. It&#039;s more amorphous, and detached. You could say that this is just my personal mental illness or something, but there&#039;s also been an explosion in mental health issues the past few decades among the entire population - and especially the younger you get. This notion of, &quot;oh, it&#039;s just a phase, every generation complains about the next generation!&quot; is reddit tier melodrama that is analogous to putting your head in the sand. No, you can quite clearly see that there is nothing normal about my generation. Even if society would like to think it is business as usual, it just isn&#039;t true. There was no end of history. The prior generations have this weird conservatism where they genuinely believe in this clap trap. Peak oil alone should demonstrate to you the poverty of this facile conservatism, where you just explain away intergenerational differences.

Zoomers are pretty much taught to write things in rigid coherence to structure on the level of the essay taken as a whole, but with practically no attention paid to sentence structure itself. I was told as a child that you should never use a particular conjuction at the beginning of a sentence more than once throughout any given paragraph. I was taught as a child to follow an outline that goes something like this: introductory paragraph: hook --&gt; introduction/contextualization --&gt; thesis; Body paragraph 1, 2, and possibly 3: Hook --&gt; contextualization --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Counterargument paragraph: Hook --&gt; statement of antithesis --&gt; statement of refutation of antithesis --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Conclusion: hook --&gt; restatement of thesis --&gt; summary of evidence --&gt; closing statement/call to action. I realized early on how systematic it was, and played into it. And lo and behold, I had the highest scores in the reading and writing sections of the ACT out of everyone in my grade. And this is despite the fact that my writing was not anything particularly impressive. Not that I blame English teachers alone, this is a problem endemic to the entire education system in America. Teachers don&#039;t have any incentive to actually teach kids. I remember in 4th grade I had a rather queer way of holding my pencil - between my middle and ring finger at the second knuckle of my fingers - which made it more difficult for me to write cursive. Naturally, my teacher simply gave up and just passed me along. He&#039;s now a principal. The kids don&#039;t make it easy anyhow. I know how it is.

Its in a man&#039;s nature to crave sex more than women due to our differing physiologies, and its why the overcoming of obsessive sexual desire is a virtue thats commonly observed in many different religious/moral traditions. Its the biggest flaw of a man.<br><br><br>Id say amoral men who dont care about that are just as bad as the overly cunning women because they have no sense of justice.

This is already pretty relative because women, while being weaker than men, are also stronger than many animals and men are also weaker than some other animals. Compared to the top predators and and the largest herbivores, we are quite weak and that was even more true during the ice age let&#039;s say, those animals absolutely dwarfed us.

The slightest glimpse in the mirror can thus fill a normie with self-disgust, and especially disgust for those partaking in the circlejerk, and make them repudiate the circlejerk. Maintaining the circlejerk therefore requires coercion, because the delusion only works if everybody maintains it. Breakaways need to be crushed and realigned with the circlejerk immediately, including a Winston Smith style admission that they were wrong and there was never anything beyond the circlejerk. Everybody is thus on some level aware that they could be the next one to lose synchronization and be crushed, so they paradoxically both desire to become the ultimate crushers to camouflage and protect themselves, and to repudiate the circle and escape. This instability raises their potential of losing their synchronization, which in turn raises their anxiety, and their desire to crush rather than be crushed. Over time, circlejerking normies develop highly complex and efficient forms of ritual humiliation by upping the ante each time, as each normie vents his anxiety about being destroyed on the scapegoat of the hour, then begins the cycle again by fearing it will happen to him next. <br><br>This anxiety builds up into a huge electric potential in the circlejerk, like a game of duck duck goose where no one has control over who gets picked, but everyone can feel the next pick is coming.

All conceptual and symbolic novelty available to normies is therefore paradoxically drawn from the rare successful breakaways or anomalous and feral never-jerkers, who go off and form blessedly isolated individual communities not predicated on acceptability or popularity, but on self-cultivation and individuation, typically in moderately gregarious yet agonal structures which are thus capable of generating novelty, whether rhizomatic or teleological, anarchic or hierarchic. When a normie circlejerk comes into contact with one of these structures, it assimilates it to the only form of experience it knows, the form of social acceptability with popularity as its maximum and non-being as its minimum. The otherness of the foreign structure is experienced as the highest possible intensity of non-being, and thus as ultimately embodying whatever scapegoat archetype is applied. All members of the circle discharge their potential energy into the scapegoated non-normie structure even more eagerly than usual. If the non-normie structure has a means of escape, this lashing out of normie energy may scar it, but it will simply send it careening off in another direction, where it will be safe until it encounters another normie jerk circle. However, if the non-normie structure is trapped in some way, it will be attacked continuously, and eventually broken down and absorbed into the normie structure. Often even in a glancing collision, a few members of the non-normie structure will also be shaved off, absorbed and enslaved by the normie structure, bringing bits of novelty with them. <br><br>To understand the &quot;incel&quot; archetype one has to understand its dual origin. In the first place, it originated in a loose, rhizomatic network of non-normie structures (of various kinds), as a polysemic term or &quot;family resemblance.&quot; In this context it was simultaneously a way for unhappy men to designate what they took to be an aspect or cause of their unhappiness, and a way for these and other unhappy men who understood the term&#039;s simple unironic use to self-deprecate and commiserate, both ironically and unironically depending on the subcontext, about having or being perceived to have traits typically associated with the unironic simple use of the term. As is typical in these sorts of communities not predicated on social acceptability and routine ritual humiliation, all sorts of emergent complexity occurred and the term was something that could only be &quot;lived&quot; by integrating into the communities that used it in their various overlapping and self-referential ways. Epistemologically speaking &quot;incel&quot; is thus a symbol and not a concept, at least in its original living context.", "time": 1672044398, "resto": 21429945}, {"no": 21435065, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:47:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435063</a><br>In the second place, repeated collisions between this rhizomatic non-normie network and normie circlejerks caused a gradual absorption of many non-normie concepts and symbols. By necessity these had to be reduced and remade in the image of the normie. For the most part these appropriations were superficial, as most normie appropriations are, that is, they are only more things to say and do because one&#039;s neighbor in the circlejerk is doing them, to prevent desynchronization and ritual humiliation. An example of this is when a reddit or twitter user claims to be familiar with 4chan, but seems to perceive familiarity with 4chan as saying things like &quot;I LOVE DANK MEMES&quot; in real life. But the incel symbol corresponded enough to the normie&#039;s dipolar understanding of possible being (popular / nonexistent as the two extrema) that a hybridization occurred, or rather a kind of taxidermy, as the playful polysemy of the symbol was gutted of everything living, and stuffed with the normie dipolar conception, to act as yet another scapegoat archetype. <br><br>Much of the external variety of the symbol was maintained, and to all appearances one could not distinguish between a normie&#039;s and a non-normie&#039;s use of it in passing. For example, both superficially seem to be designating &quot;virgin,&quot; &quot;loser,&quot; &quot;weirdo,&quot; &quot;weirdo who deserves his suffering,&quot; etc., by the term incel. But the concept was now dead and immobile, a still image of life where life once was. No new variety could emerge from it, barring future collisions with and assimilations of non-normie structures bearing more developed versions of the incel symbol. And any acute observer would notice this in the &quot;flatness&quot; of the normie use of the term, which, thanks to the normie regression toward the mean in all things, gets flatter and flatter, collapses more and more into older scapegoat archetypes (virgin, loser, weirdo) and ultimately reveals the naked condition of possibility underlying it (socially unacceptable, unpopular, non-entity, dead, glad it&#039;s not me) to the properly trained eye.", "time": 1672044459, "resto": 21429945}, {"no": 21435070, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:53:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435057</a><br><a href=\"#p21435061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435061</a><br><a href=\"#p21435063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435063</a><br><a href=\"#p21435065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435065</a><br>I won&#039;t pretend to understand this skitzo rant but all the energy you&#039;ve put into it could have been used to chat up some girl and have sex with her.", "time": 1672044803, "resto": 21429945}, {"no": 21435071, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)03:55:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435070</a>", "filename": "jdv", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 336, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 65, "tim": 1672044950304619, "time": 1672044950, "md5": "4m5tbATd/+kpwZZK20tcRw==", "fsize": 23917, "resto": 21429945}, {"no": 21435081, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)04:00:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21430862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21430862</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He simply makes statements, literally just his opinion without any attempt at proving his position.</span><br>This is every philosopher.<br><br><a href=\"#p21434354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21434354</a><br>It&#039;s quite simply ad hominem.

Reverence was taken from nature when religious and political institutions set out on a campaign to burn the texts of, and persecute, those that loved nature. This initiated an era in which systems of thought that repress and suppress our nature, as opposed to integrating it, dominated the world. Platonism, like Jungian thought, promoted the integration of unconscious contents into consciousness by means of the study of philosophy and a loving education of the soul. For a long time, both philosophy and beauty were taken away from the people. Philosophy contributes to the above while beauty unites the soul and gives it wings. Popular traditions in recent times promote a suppressive or repressive relationship with the unconscious personality by teaching people that desires and erotic beauty are bad, but Socrates taught people to love their unconscious personalities as a beloved and to use erotic beauty to help train and empower the soul. According to the Platonists, nature exists in the soul in the area that is identified with Venus, the goddess of erotic love. Our nature in the soul participated in the idea of nature in the world. By loving erotic beauty, it is possible to bring nature back to a place of reverence in society. Our sexuality has been repressed by millennia of repression, but I have tried to find a way to reduce suffering in the world, bring nature back to a place of reverence in society, help our psychological relationships with sexuality recover after millennia of abuse, and help to reduce the continued inequality between women and men by providing an opportunity to increase the income and wealth levels of women around the world.", "time": 1672022404, "resto": 21434132}, {"no": 21434154, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)21:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Personally, I think that the solution to the world\u2019s suffering is in the study of philosophy.

To convert the energy into higher forms, sometimes it is good not to appreciate erotic art while practicing. There is an incubation period of a month during which a person purifies the energy, drawing energy up from below and down from above, storing it in the center or circulating it in the soul. The energy that is generated while appreciating erotic art flames up and burns up, but the energy that is produced while contemplating ideas can more easily be used if a person wants to grow an embryo over the course of a month. Sometimes I used to get the energy started with erotic art and the turn it off to circulate energy for a while. After practicing with it for a while, I now enjoy beauty while practicing and continue to try to innovate and find a way to improve the system. The tower in the Red Book provides the initial framework for the system and it can be used as an image of the whole system as well. The whole system is in the index of the Red Book and is called the Systema Munditotius. From my understanding of it, it is possible that there isn\u2019t a coming Christ or Antichrist that is a person. Christ and Antichrist are psychological counterparts that constitute the wholeness of the self. This system provides a way to become Christ and the Antichrist to some extent to allow for the individuation process to take place in the soul. It sounds airy and mystical, but if you are able to begin circulating energy, you will understand that this is a real process and the evidence of its reality is undeniable when you begin to grow energy in the soul, so I\u2019m not going to try to convince anyone of its reality because you will feel it when you feel it.

The system of the Red Book allows all people to be their own Christ, to generate energy by means of internal alchemy, and to experience the soul in a way that is radically different from way that we experienced the soul in the past. The return of the light of nature involves a return of the light of philosophy. People will, as I did, learn about the reality of the soul by practicing internal alchemy, as the promotion of erotic exercises does not require forceful advertisement, but I think people will truly desire to study philosophy when they experience that seemingly divine capacity of the soul, to generate and circulate energy. The study of philosophy teaches a person about the structure of the soul and about the qualities of the parts. Philosophy can teach a person how to use this energy and by using the energy, a person will desire to study philosophy more than they had in the past.

It is the &quot;exit from the cave.&quot; If we limit ourselves to the conception of the dialectic as a method, and not as a movement of reality, the dialectic cannot be descending. Plato indeed, I do not claim to know &quot;the secret of the gods&quot;; it does not claim to know where the supreme Idea, the idea of the Good, comes from; nowhere does it affirm that this idea has been created to the others, nor that the eternal ideas have produced the sensible world. Therefore, his dialectic is in no way intended to become &quot;descending&quot;. Platonic dialectic consists in being a positive dialectic, which ends in a consoling, healthy result, in a kind of beatitude that the contemplation of eternal ideas makes possible. It must be observed that not all ascending dialectics have this character; descendant dialectics, on the other hand, always possess it. Let us point out, among the ascending dialectics that are negative, that is to say, that do not lead, at least directly, to a consoling, healthy, harmonious and conciliatory solution, that of Dionysius the Areopagite, an Alexandrian from the fifth century (pages 65-72); that of the negative theology of the Middle Ages, which was content to deny all positive propositions relative to God and affirm &quot;learned ignorance&quot;; and, finally, that of Pascal, that of the second Fichte (pp. 83-100) and that of Kierkegaard.

It is an ideal type of governing notion, and as such, it cannot be realised perfectly.<br><br>Faced with the brutal reality of paradigmatic cases like Stalin\u2019s USSR and Nazi Germany, philosophers, political theorists and social scientists have felt not just intellectually motivated but morally compelled to explain the causes and implications of totalitarianism. This has been in part an attempt to explain the socio-political phenomenon in itself, as well to develop an intellectual tool in the arsenal of democracy.<br><br>Diverse philosophical perspectives have been employed. They share the important common denominator of an appeal to the value of human life, critical thought, and a pluralistic society. Many of the key figures among the anti-totalitarian thinkers discussed here were European Jewish refugees who escaped totalitarian systems.

How can you complement one another and raise your kids with certain values if you don&#039;t have similar mindsets? Plus, I believe the types of relationships that last are the ones where the man and woman have commonalities that go deeper than just the romantic/sexual aspect to the point of being a genuine team. Even if there are differences in mindset (which there will be), the similarities will allow one to see the other side of things. It&#039;s hard to fake that sort of oneness of purpose and of flesh which your average marriage doesn&#039;t have outside of birthing and raising kids, which is why so many people get divorced or end up not loving each other after the kids leave. I&#039;ve seen couples just not talk to each other or have ANYTHING in common and I don&#039;t understand how some people tolerate that. That just seems like a miserable existence. If you share a house and a life with someone, it only makes sense to share a lot in common mentally and spiritually with the other your spouse, especially if you have kids. Kids deserve to be born into a healthy household where their birth and rearing only enhances the libe the parents dote upon them. I think society should rethink how we treat romance and love.

You are melting into mush and it&#039;s an irreversible process if you go too far. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; How to I brainwash myself into enjoying work more </span><br>This is the key to your mistake. You are falling into a version of the hedonic paradox, where you are trying to consciously will your current subjective state of mind into/onto another subjective state (pleasure/fun) while staying completely subjectively conscious, i.e. not melding with the objective at all. That&#039;s not how any human activity works. We are supposed to lose ourselves in things, look up Csiksantmihayli&#039;s &quot;flow&quot; concept. <br><br>You do need to do a little bit of alchemy and self-steering, obviously, like you need to be in a job you basically don&#039;t despise and doing tasks you basically enjoy, ideally. But the part of the problem you are missing is &quot;hard&quot; obstacles, objective tasks that simply need doing, regardless of your subjective assenting to them or finding them fun. You will find out IN HINDSIGHT that you found it fun or got really engaged with something objective, after you are in it or done with it. You can&#039;t will yourself to enjoy work as if it&#039;s play, that&#039;s tautologically meaningless, work and play are antitheses. You need to fall or lapse into the kind of &quot;flow&quot; that turns work into play, and this can only be done when the subjective mind is not autistically, autarkically awake and active, sitting on grandma&#039;s couch and reducing the whole world to playthings for itself.<br><br>The opposite extreme is also bad obviously, living entirely to work and seeing any attempt to abstract from your work and ask &quot;do I really enjoy this?&quot; as a weakness, Protestant ethic type shit. But you are in no danger of that extreme, you are in danger of the &quot;gifted underachiever&quot; basement dweller syndrome extreme, where 15 years go by in a flash and you are just a 45 year old anime watching loser on the dole. <br><br>Find objective things to do NOW. Also start treating yourself like an addict. What do we do with addicts? We treat them like objects, not subjects. You don&#039;t sit there for ten hours convincing an addict not to touch the drugs on the table. You take the drugs off the table and lock the door. Start imposing hard restrictions on yourself. This is a very common problem of terminally online &quot;underachievers,&quot; they only ever see themselves as an abstract subject abstractly subjectively regarding themselves, from the comfort of the basement. They never experience the fun of obstacles, of looking back in hindsight at obstacles overcome. They never grow and see themselves in concreto, they remain a seed forever, with infinite virtual possibilities but no actuality.", "time": 1671831513, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21424918, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)16:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424902</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeff</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opposite of hep; unhip, uncool or opposed to hipness.</span><br><br>rude", "time": 1671831695, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21425031, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)17:07:59", "name": "the xi jinping of weed smoking", "com": "I&#039;ve been building a tower for years and it will collapse someday.

I looked in an amateur astronomy book and discovered that this was the Cassiopeia open star cluster. I also read that people use it as a vision test, and that people with good vision can resolve individual stars. I realized that I was near-sighted, informed my father, and saw an optometrist, who gave me glasses. All of a sudden my world popped out in super-HD. I looked up at the night sky and saw a field of brilliant, glistening diamonds. I read the book further, and began to learn more about the universe, and the constellations. I asked for a small telescope for Christmas, and got one. I began to pour through amateur astronomy books and magazines, observing every change I could get, my curiosity endlessly inspired. I constructed a larger 10&quot; Dobsonian telescope, which revealed more of the universe&#039;s grandeur. One night when I was staring at the night sky everything I had learned and experienced came together in a gestalt. The galaxy was no longer &quot;there,&quot; but here, all around, the galaxy popped out in three dimensions and I had the perception of being on a sphere in space. This experience was so moving that it brought me to tears. When I was 16 I took classes in amateur astronomy at the local community college, and did so well that I got student of the year award.<br><br>Meanwhile I was completely failing in school, and had to make up work during the summers. The teachers were horrible, and my peers were completely caught up in hedonistic pursuits and monkey-ass social status games. I had found the REAL shit, and nobody else seemed to care or be interested in anything similar (I lived in a backwards conservative county that was a cultural wasteland of mini-malls and churches.) I grew ever more alienated from the dumb-ass world around me.<br><br>Eventually I had to take a high-school equivalency test, passed, and began to attend the community college full-time. My first semester I took a philosophy course with the most outstanding teacher I ever have had: Johnny Terry. This man lived to teach and inspire curiosity. He was flamingly gay in every sense of the word. His animation and passion was infectious, he argued the philosophical position in question so well that it was impossible to tell what he actually believed. This man was infected by the REAL shit! He expanded my narrow interest in astronomy to a general love of knowledge and creative experience. I became absorbed and fascinated by my other classes, I did lots of outside reading in the subjects I studied, I experimented with electronic music and art. It was a personal Renaissance.

So I said fuck it, used some of my modest trust-fund money from a sewage disaster settlement when I was younger, and went on a 1000-mile solo bicycle tour up the coast of California. This was epic self-initiation into adulthood; I was living the REAL shit! When this was over, I went to live with my father, and began to re-attend classes.<br><br>Except no, oh no.

It no longer produces anything of value. No meaningful discourse or discussion can occur there. Board culture has stagnated and in many ways de-evolved. It has become exactly the kind of vapid, retarded, schizophrenic wankery that the site once derided. Internet culture and more specifically chan culture is a reflection of the people using the site and society in general at the time. It&#039;s just a mirror. It reflects whatever you show it back at you. Early 4chan was a synthesis of an extremely specific set of factors at a specific point in time that will probably never coalesce again. A shitty economy, a general malaise of apathy among the youth, anime and gamer culture being obscure and ostracized, &quot;The internet&quot; having a barrier to entry, how fucked up and unmoderated the early internet was etc. Chances were, if you used the internet back then you had seen some shit. But anyway, people like to congregate with other people that have the same interests as they do. Where do you hang out if you&#039;re some loser living in a shit town with few or no friends and you spend your time playing Warcraft 3 custom games and watching Ego Proxy or whatever? you find the other social outcasts online because people in real life who have the same hobbies as you don&#039;t exist. The point being that there is an extremely specific kind of person who would waste the best years of their life on an anime website where there&#039;s a 9 out of 10 chance on any given day that you&#039;re going to see a picture of someone cutting their own dick off. These people congregate together and a baseline of culture forms from their mutual interests, experiences and attitudes. The culture evolves over time as knowledge about the site spreads through word of mouth, or people discover the site after raids or fox news specials or whatever. Site culture gradually shifts as the demographics of the user base change. At the same time popular culture shifts as more people of all ages gain access to the internet, media corporations begin to target a wider demographic of casual consumers rather than a niche of hardcore fans. Subcultures are exploited by corporations and integrated into popular culture. Someone emails their friend a funny cat picture not realising where it came from, or that the person who made it probably also jacks off to lolicon tentacle rape doujuns.

Upvotes, retweets, reacts, shares etc. On 4chan the success of a thread is measured by the number of replies it receives. Because of the ephemeral nature of imageboards, users do not have any way to accumulate a representation of authority or post quality. Inversely there&#039;s very little repurcussion for being banned because there&#039;s no account to lose. These dynamics incentivize the poster to create a thread/post that will generate as many replies as possible. In theory, this will produce good content. Interesting posts will attract replies while retarded faggotory will attract sages, moderators or nothing at all. People will of course game this system for one reason or another. Clickbait is prevalent on YouTube because people can make money from it. Posting pictures of your cat on fifteen different subreddits to farm karma works because Reddit rewards banal, kitsch, inoffensive content. Posting bait to 4chan works because the user base is fucking retarded. People who get their kicks by pretending to be fools will soon find themselves surrounded by fools who think they are in good company. 4chan had a reputation for being le sekrit hacker club, so they naturally attracted every edgy 14 year old who could figure out how to download LoIC. Once external raids and harassment campaigns were cracked down on by the mods the user base seemed to turn inwards and begin eating itself. This came to a head in the post election years as more and more boards were saturated with low quality content.

Anons went from sincerely enjoying things, to ironically liking things and then pure hatred. Except not, it became the default to be a contrarian asshole except when you were only pretending, and actually everyone else was retarded for not seeing that you were fucking with them the whole time. It&#039;s faster to call everyone a cuck onions drinker and move on than it is trying to decipher the 9000 layers of meta comedy and half winking irony that everything was covered in.

This has accelerated the drop in post quality to the point where bot posts are indistinguishable from human posters. At which point, why even bother posting at all. There was a time that anons were comrades in misery. You didn&#039;t end up on 4chan because you were successful or had your life together. You were more than likely an outsider, a loser, fucked up in one way or another. Unmotivated. Devoid of purpose or meaning - flotsam of the modern world - just drifting. But that thread, that shared understanding, connected you to other anons in a way that it didn&#039;t with normal people. There was shit like The Well-Cultured Anonymous, an earnest effort by anons to help other anons unfuck themselves. Anons encouraged other anons to find purpose and meaning in their lives. Years ago I tried to give anons help and advice the same way that other anons had helped me. I had hoped that they would, in turn, carry it forward and help the next generation of &quot;weird kids&quot; to better themselves. I no longer feel this way. The anger that anons feel doesn&#039;t dissipate or drive them. Rather it feels like it&#039;s compounding. Their rage is directed back in on itself and becomes magnified. They no longer seem to want to escape from their misery, or even try. The ones that do are crucified as &quot;normies&quot; or &quot;chads&quot;. Now they are like crabs in a bucket. If one tries to escape the others drag him back down. Assuming that the original wave of 4chan posters were somewhere between 15 to 25 years old then most would be somewhere in their late 30s if not 40s by now. By the same metric most anons from the &quot;golden age&quot; of 4chan (00s up to the early 10s) would now be in their late 20s. I wonder what became of them all. I wonder how many anons never made it. That one kid with the rainbow face mask who ate a shotgun in front of a blue tarpaulin. Lowtax went out the same way. Or the anon who set himself on fire in his dorm. Zyzz died of a heart attack. All the an hero threads, some of them had to have gone through with it, or were lost to drugs or alcohol or their own demons somewhere along the way. Inversely how many made it and did something with their lives? How many bought a home? got married or had children? Mandalore, SSeth, ExaminedLifeOfGaming/Hoplopfheil and shoe0nhead are confirmed former channers, as are ContraPoints and Shaun. Those are all the ones off the top of my head, but there are definitely others. Moot keeps a low profile these days and seems to be doing well.

The world they&#039;re going to inherit from us is severely more fucked up than the one our parents left us. Typing all of this shit out makes me feel like an old man yelling at a cloud. I&#039;m definitely looking at this with rose tinted glasses. There was a lot of stupid bullshit, even back then. I don&#039;t regret the time that i wasted hanging out here. The site should die, it has long since lost any of its relevancy or usefulness. I would rather see it die than languish and as a shadow of its former self.

Sadness should have no place on the birthday of life. The fear of death has been swallowed up; life brings us joy with the promise of eternal happiness. <br>No one is shut out from this joy; all share the same reason for rejoicing. Our Lord, victor over sin and death, finding no man free from sin, came to free us all. Let the saint rejoice as he sees the palm of victory at hand. Let the sinner be glad as he receives the offer of forgiveness. Let the pagan take courage as he is summoned to life. <br>In the fullness of time, chosen in the unfathomable depths of God\u2019s wisdom, the Son of God took for himself our common humanity in order to reconcile it with its creator. He came to overthrow the devil, the origin of death, in that very nature by which he had overthrown mankind. <br>And so at the birth of our Lord the angels sing in joy: Glory to God in the highest, and they proclaim peace to men of good will as they see the heavenly Jerusalem being built from all the nations of the world. When the angels on high are so exultant at this marvellous work of God\u2019s goodness, what joy should it not bring to the lowly hearts of men? <br>Beloved, let us give thanks to God the Father, through his Son, in the Holy Spirit, because in his great love for us he took pity on us, and when we were dead in our sins he brought us to life with Christ, so that in him we might be a new creation. Let us throw off our old nature and all its ways and, as we have come to birth in Christ, let us renounce the works of the flesh. <br>Christian, remember your dignity, and now that you share in God\u2019s own nature, do not return by sin to your former base condition. Bear in mind who is your head and of whose body you are a member. Do not forget that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and brought into the light of God\u2019s kingdom. <br>Through the sacrament of baptism you have become a temple of the Holy Spirit.

Many people speak of it. I think another term is the Eureka principle. This led to finally understand &#039;the leap of faith&#039; in a deeper way, as I grew to understand that understanding is not discursive and cannot be tiptoed to, but is leapt into, from a place of ignorance to a place of knowing. Put differently: the mind that asks the question cannot solve the question. The mind that answers the question is an entirely different mind. This led in all sorts of strange and wonderful directions for me. <br>I also found it interesting to understand how understanding is blocked to so many people, and of course to myself. I literally cannot see the solution to my problem from my current vantage point. It requires a shift in what I am in order to understand (and this shift requires experience. The intent is set and then we go on our way navigating life in a way that gathers the experience necessary for the shift to the answer/solution. This also led me to understand the difference between intellectual knowing and &#039;knowing&#039;. That in turn led me to understand the deep significance of &#039;feeling&#039; in understanding). This process is largely unconscious, and follows intent. Lives follow intent.<br>Intention itself is another area that opened to me, though it is related to this process I mentioned of insight. With insight you set a conscious intent and the solution is worked on unconsciously. The thing is that there are also unconscious intents, and intents from outside of ourselves that we take on.

But with faith in God comes a certain kind of trust that He is able to find the most perfectly just solution. So that, if God makes a judgement, then whatever God&#039;s decision is must by necessity be the best and maximally just outcome - and better than anything that we could think of. This comes by recognizing that we are limited but God our Creator is infinitely just. Furthermore, it&#039;s possible to trust God to the extent that, once we see the judgement made, it will make much more sense at that time, as opposed to our limited understanding in this present life where there are a lot of things that we are not aware of. As one easy example, we don&#039;t know what anyone else is thinking, but God does. So, by the time that the judgement is made and the lost are sent to the lake of fire, we may very well be convinced of the truth that said outcome really is the best. The Bible teaches us that there will be a day of judgement where all things that are hidden will be revealed, and so I can see a future where once we learn some of these things, we won&#039;t be bothered by the decisions that God makes as to who is saved and who is cast into the lake of fire. It may be revealed to us why His decisions are just in the end. Here are a couple of Bible verses on the matter.<br><br>&quot;Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.&quot;<br>(Job 34:12)<br><br>&quot;Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br>14For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.&quot;<br>(Ecclesiastes 12:13-14) - the end of the book of Ecclesiastes<br><br>&quot;But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.<br>37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.&quot;<br>(Matthew 12:36-37)<br><br>&quot;Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.&quot;<br>(Matthew 10:26)<br><br>&quot;And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br>13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<br>14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

With God being all powerful, all loving, and all merciful, it just seems strange to cast souls into Hell for all eternity, whether Hell be eternal torture or eternal nonexistence. For an evil person to enter heaven, perhaps their wickedness would be burned away to leave only their kernel of good, in a kind of revelation of all of their misdeeds and what would have truly awaited them if they loved.

I think of state apparatuses bending the will of the people for some kind of utilitarian &quot;good&quot;. Or ideological radicals causing mayhem for the sake of a utopian vision that could not possibly come to pass. When we lose sight of Heaven we pride ourselves into thinking we can perfect our fallen state, and lead ourselves to a hell on earth in the name of some good. When we set our sights only on Heaven we can commit the most basest of cruelties because we believe it is all for the ultimate and only real prize of the afterlife, which feels like following the law and not the spirit of the law.<br>An ideal that could not be enforced by any state apparatus, only the individual in unison with others, would be to set our sights to Heaven by committing ourselves to Christian, brotherly love here on earth.

They pulled her from the slab and dragged her across the stone floor of the vault and down a corridor to where daylight fell against the wall of the sink. In this leaning bole of light, standing there among the shifting motes, they called for a rope. When it descended they made it fast to the rope about the corpse and called aloft again.

The first of these is the doctrine of dukkha: there is suffering. The Three Marks of Existence provide a deeper understanding of what is meant by dukkha. These three characteristics of existence are accepted by all schools of Buddhism.<br><br>The first mark is anicca, or Impermanence. All things in reality change and that change is constant. There is no permanent state because all things are dependent on other constantly changing things. This is also known as conditioned existence because all things are conditioned by what they are dependent upon. Even our mental states are constantly changing from one moment to the next. It is important to accept this concept so we can adjust to the reality of life and ease the anxiousness we feel in response to changing circumstances.<br><br>The second mark is anatta, or Insubstantiality. A person is not a distinct identity that is fixed. Each person exists as a process of changing aspects of being that are called skandhas. When these skandhas are put together they give the sense of an individual. However, this individual is insubstantial because the skandhas are impermanent, interdependent and constantly changing. The five skandhas are rupa, the physical material of the universe; vendana, sensations that come from interaction with the rupa; sanna, the perception of matter and thought through sensations; sankhara, deliberate mental formation of a response to that perception; and vinnana, the state of mind resulting from a pattern of mental formations, or consciousness. Each skandha is dependent on the other, and none can exist if even one is removed. This changing process we identify as a person can continue in rebirth, as a plant continues the process of the plant from which it originates.<br><br>The third mark of existence is dukkha, or Suffering. This mark can be understood in three ways. Suffering itself is understood in our direct experience of pain or uneasiness, but this is not our entire experience of life in general. We also experience dukkha in frustration when pleasant experiences end, and we long for more. The third means of understanding dukkha is the experience of not being completely satisfied when expectations are unfulfilled. This results in dissatisfaction or a feeling that life is meaningless.", "time": 1671958682, "resto": 21430042}, {"no": 21431530, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21430042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21430042</a><br>yknow what, idk why people bother philosophers beyond the greeks, rest of philosophers sounds so fucking outdated, retarded and insane.

Thus Luther&#039;s reformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of the spirit were still uncertain, lacking in vigor, and immature. Science could not yet rear her head. Indeed the whole Renaissance appears but as an early spring smothered in snow. But even in the present century Schopenhauer&#039;s metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yet powerful enough: for the whole mediaeval Christian world-standpoint (Weltbetrachtung) and conception of man (Mensch-Empfindung)[15] once again, notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all Christian dogma, celebrated a resurrection in Schopenhauer&#039;s doctrine. There is much science in his teaching although the science does not dominate, but, instead of it, the old, trite &quot;metaphysical necessity.&quot; It is one of the greatest and most priceless advantages of \u201cSchopenhauer&#039;s teaching that by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old human and cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us so easily.

The prose Mount of Olives and Solitary Devotions (1652) show his authenticity and depth of convictions.

But I&#039;ll try to break down some of it:<br>&quot;Ostrogoths gaggin fishygods&quot; for example is &quot;Ostrogoths gegen [&quot;against&quot; in German] Visigoths&quot; with fish puns. &quot;Br\u00e9kkek K\u00e9kkek K\u00e9kkek K\u00e9kkek! K\u00f3ax K\u00f3ax K\u00f3ax! Ualu Ualu Ualu! Quaouauh!&quot; is the chorus of Aristophanes&#039; frogs, with &quot;ualu&quot; put in, another cry derived from the Irish for lamentation. The next sentences onomatopoeically describe a fight. You have a list of weapons (&quot;migraines&quot; - fire grenades, &quot;verduns&quot; - long narrow swords, &quot;partisans&quot;, &quot;catapults&quot;, &quot;cannonballs&quot;) often involved in their own puns. &quot;Whoyteboyce&quot; sounds like white boys, an Irish agrarian association responsible for several violent uprisings, while &quot;Hoodie Head&quot; sounds like Howth Head, a leitmotif that features prominently, sometimes as HCE&#039;s head, for example. This onomatopeia essentially continues with various puns until the final lines which describes how the battle is split against Protestants (&quot;Bid me to live&quot; - words from a Protestant poem by Herrick) and Catholics (&quot;ego te absolvo&quot; from Catholic mass).<br>But you really don&#039;t need too much detail to understand what&#039;s going on here. I think the biggest stumbling block to many new readers of the Wake is the idea that there are secret meanings to everything in front of you, that Joyce can&#039;t just be saying what he is saying. Sometimes there are genuine riddles in the text, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s his primary mode of writing.

Certainly any intelligent reader can read and understand it, if he returns to the text again and again. He is setting out on an adventure with words. &#039;Work in Progress&#039; can satisfy more readers than any other book because it gives them the opportunity to use their own ideas in the reading. Some readers will be interested in the exploration of words, the play of technique, the philological experiment in each poetic unit. Each word has the charm of a living thing and each living thing is plastic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;Emotion has dictated the course and detail of my book, and in emotional writing one arrives at the unpredictable which can be of more value, since its sources are deeper, than the products of the intellectual method....In writing one must create an endlessly changing surface, dictated by the mood and curent impulse in contrast to the fixed mood of the classical style. That is &#039;Work in Progress&#039;. The important thing is not what we write, but how we write, and in my opinion the modern writer must be an adventurer above all, willing to take every risk, and be prepared to founder in his effort if need be. in other words we must write dangerously: everything is inclined to flux and change nowadays and modern literature, to be valid, must express that flux....A book, in my opinion, should not be planned out beforehand, but as one writes it will form itself, subject, as I say, to the constant emotional promptings of one&#039;s personality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, it doesn&#039;t have a title yet. The few fragments which I have published have been enough to convince many critics that I have finally lost my mind, which by the way they have been predicting faithfully for many years. And perhaps it is madness to grind up words in order to extract their substance, or to graft them one onto another, to create crossbreeds and unknown variants, to open up unsuspected possibilities for these words, to marry sounds which were not usually joined together before, although they were meant for one another, to allow water to speak like water, birds to chirp in the words of birds, to liberate all sounds of rustling, breaking, arguing, shouting, cracking, whistling, creaking, gurgling - from their servile, contemptible role and to attach them to the feelers of expressions which grope for definitions of the undefined.

One of the main plot points was, that some people who were drafted to be pilots and fly dangerous missions were only able to get out of the mission by being declared insane, but if they tried to get themselves declared insane they would be evaluated as sane for wanting to get out of the dangerous missions, so they would be forced to fly either way. Here&#039;s a quote of the relevant portion:<br><br>&quot;There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one&#039;s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn&#039;t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn&#039;t have to, but if he didn&#039;t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.&quot;", "filename": "153290820702", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 441, "h": 650, "tn_w": 84, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672019414909248, "time": 1672019414, "md5": "wqrST80GbqVW3HCM7nvvnA==", "fsize": 54167, "resto": 21432351}, {"no": 21434084, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)21:17:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432351</a>", "filename": "261444", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 308, "h": 475, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672021058837578, "time": 1672021058, "md5": "UJH1z+K3gZqzEVcPR8k66Q==", "fsize": 32556, "resto": 21432351}, {"no": 21434121, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)21:31:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "love yes minister. must have watched it in full eight times, without hyperbole. humourous novels aren&#039;t really my bag. so rarely do i laugh aloud at a work. in any case, i do have a few recommendations, one, the bostonians, which is certainly not *funny*, but one could stretch it as an *amusing* novel consisting of early new england political trends. next, would be far older works, the political essays of men like Swift in particular, I would suggest, the constellation of humourous writers and their relentless attacks on each other provides a wit-filled parallel to something like Yes, Minister. The rest I have would be to merely point you towards a group or genre where you might find what you&#039;re looking for. Definitely the &quot;beats&quot;. That was as political a movement as I can imagine, and figures like burroughs and ginsburg are easy selections for outlandish or hilarious visions of politics.
