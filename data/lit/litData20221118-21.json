That is, if they see it done, they can do it. Humans, however, use this part of the brain for language processing. This allows for us to use language (if I tell you something, you can repeat it flawlessly, just like an ape could do something if it sees me do something), but it means that we aren&#039;t all that good at just seeing something.

I need to find places where I can find women into the math, science and tech (and just plain nerdy shit) stuff I&#039;m into so I can actually meet people with some semblance of similarity to me and specifically a woman like that. I feel like the best relationships are born out of deep friendships based on shared interests and values and modern dating (and dating really since the 50s) has watered that down. That&#039;s why society is so atomized and people marry spouses they love for their body but not their soul then 30 years later wonder why they feel so alone around this person. It&#039;s not rocket science, but I do think it&#039;s better to wait for a woman that is attractive in not only body, but also in mind and spirit, than to rush into marriage with a woman I just want to plow and then hate afterwards. I also need to make some time to pray the Rosary at least once a day: that helps me push through this wave of misery.

Humanism was form of what has subsequently become contemporary secularism; and, owing to its desire to reduce everything to the measure of man as an end in himself, modern civilization has sunk stage by stage until it has reached the level of the lowest elements in man and aims at little more than satisfying the needs inherent in the material side of his nature, an aim that is in any case quite illusory since it constantly creates more artificial needs than it can satisfy.<br><br>Join our Gu\u00e9non and Esotericism server:<br>https://discord.gg/qvKxXpwv", "filename": "51-n5CxgZSL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 946, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668796148127961, "time": 1668796148, "md5": "nuvC5PZyl1DvHrbeIyhyJQ==", "fsize": 55168, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "a-word-that-rose-to-honor-at-the-time-of-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21273644, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)16:07:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21273133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273133</a><br>Pbuh", "time": 1668805620, "resto": 21273133}, {"no": 21273664, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)16:10:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21273133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273133</a><br>Read the Chuckgavad Sneeda", "time": 1668805820, "resto": 21273133}, {"no": 21274924, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)21:10:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1668823800, "resto": 21273133}], "last_modified": 1668823800}, {"no": 21272749, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)11:46:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "does the fact he never read Kant refute him?", "filename": "witt4 (1)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 880, "h": 714, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 202, "tim": 1668790008195608, "time": 1668790008, "md5": "wGXSW6pjc9AHcbOU6Ffbng==", "fsize": 58068, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-the-fact-he-never-read-kant-refute-him", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 31, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 26, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 21274039, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:36:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21272756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21272756</a><br>Fpbp", "time": 1668811010, "resto": 21272749}, {"no": 21274073, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)17:47:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21273044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273044</a><br>Shut the fuck up.", "time": 1668811645, "resto": 21272749}, {"no": 21274820, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:40:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21273483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He\u2019s aryan</span><br>No he isn&#039;t<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;per Hitler himself </span><br>Who cares<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and doesn\u2019t really look Jewish.</span><br>Based blind retard", "time": 1668822021, "resto": 21272749}, {"no": 21274873, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:56:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21273561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21273561</a><br>Based", "time": 1668823015, "resto": 21272749}, {"no": 21274919, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)21:08:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21272749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21272749</a><br>le autistic retard (both)", "time": 1668823730, "resto": 21272749}], "last_modified": 1668823730}, {"no": 21274902, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)21:03:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This is unreadable.

why you should choose any one thing over another. The Christian worldview provides a kind of beginning, which is less of a single path than a superstructure that orders other paths into a workable hierarchy. You can take a leap of faith and fixate on one path to spontaneously create meaning which is the Kierkegaardian route. Or you can go the Nietzschean route and make your own path without religious faith, but then you have to accept with Dionysian pessimism the inherent tragedy of life. People generally are not strong enough to cope with the intense suffering that any path requries without some kind of narrative. The Christian narrative is a pragmatic choice because its success is not dependent on the fulfilment of material conditions, so it gives continual meaning despite the randomness and contingency of the material world.", "time": 1668819038, "resto": 21274514}, {"no": 21274851, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:51:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274514</a><br>Stupid frogposter.", "time": 1668822668, "resto": 21274514}, {"no": 21274867, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:55:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274569</a><br><a href=\"#p21274571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274571</a><br><a href=\"#p21274609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274609</a><br><a href=\"#p21274851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274851</a><br><br>prostrate", "time": 1668822923, "resto": 21274514}], "last_modified": 1668822923}, {"no": 21267487, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)05:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/sffg/ - Science Fiction and Fantasy General", "com": "Last Battalion Edition<br><br>Previous Thread:<a href=\"/lit/thread/21259539#p21259539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21259539</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Recommended reading charts (Look here before asking for vague recs)</span><br>https://mega.nz/folder/kj5hWI6J#0cy<wbr>w0-ZdvZKOJW3fPI6RfQ/folder/guIyhAzS<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Archive</span><br>https://warosu.org/lit/?task=search<wbr>2&amp;search_subject=sffg<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goodreads</span><br>https://www.goodreads.com/group/sho<wbr>w/1029811-sffg", "filename": "The Last Battalion", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668679323593400, "time": 1668679323, "md5": "ls1w3bV9OTj3bBB1k85xIw==", "fsize": 460838, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sffg-science-fiction-and-fantasy-general", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 290, "images": 59, "omitted_posts": 285, "omitted_images": 58, "last_replies": [{"no": 21274780, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:26:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274776</a><br>Rude.", "time": 1668821179, "resto": 21267487}, {"no": 21274791, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274553</a>", "filename": "BRNGCHRM1991", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 382, "h": 640, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668821393415444, "time": 1668821393, "md5": "ipJmzfw5SXHkQABUj1ig4A==", "fsize": 101828, "resto": 21267487}, {"no": 21274793, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:30:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274724</a><br>I was afraid of that being the case, but I&#039;m sure God Emperor will scratch that itch to read about losing or perhaps transcending humanity.", "time": 1668821416, "resto": 21267487}, {"no": 21274827, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)20:43:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21274553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21274553</a><br>&quot;Understand&quot; by Ted Chiang (the guy who did the novella the film Arrival was based on).

I downloaded WakingUp app, i did it every day until free period ended. Then i turned into non-guided meditation, but because i never read books about it, my method was similiar to WakingUp one and inspired by anon posts too - i breathe in and out with closed eyes, sometimes i count breaths but then i try to stop counting, and turn to &quot;passive observer&quot; of breaths - keeping concentration on breath, yet letting it flow automatically, without controlling it. Success of my method is various, sometimes i can do 10 or 15 minutes no problem, but often when i do 20minutes i get restless, my mind wanders and it starts to become uncomfortable. Anyway my method is probably most similiar to thing commonly called as &quot;mindfullness&quot; method - pleb shit.<br>Recently i read few chapters of pic related (McMindfullness) where guy writes &quot;mindfullness&quot; trend is created by bloodthirsty capitalists to help wagies cope. I thought this guy has a point. For example today i listened to guided mindfullness meditation on DailyYoga app, and not only it was strikingly similiar to WakingUp one it also had mantra like &quot;next time you will be in stressfull situation you will be calm and collected&quot;. Not only i felt dejavu (like i heard the same exact mantra before) but it sounds like clear cope for me - like stress is inevitable part of capitalism and your only choice is to &quot;deal with it&quot;. I also use &quot;yoga nidra&quot; guided meditation videos to help me sleep. I thought its pretty helpful for that but i also felt this vague feeling of sadness toward end of this recording. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mM<wbr>5Oks8yZc<br>She says something like &quot;imagine you are at the beautiful lake and you watch this big setting sun and you feel warm and calmness, and air is just like after the thunder, fresh and joyful&quot; and i had this image of office drones in their 4 walls who never see things like that, and they need to be hushed and told bedtime stories like children or else they risk getting nervous breakdown.

Silver age: Southern spirituality: priest caste as leaders, submissive spirituality, orientation to soil, Christianity, Cult of Isis, Aphroditian cult<br>3. Bronze age: degenerated forms of N.light and S.light fighting for dominance. Rise of materialism, rise of merchant caste, late Euro monarchies<br>4.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1668817245, "resto": 21272768}], "last_modified": 1668817245}, {"no": 21273770, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)16:32:12", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/lit/ Classical Philosophy reading guide - 1) The Presocratics", "com": "Let me know what you think.

Currently on chapter 18 where they&#039;ve finally returned to Britain after the stint in St. Helens. A few points I wanted to touch on; <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you guys think about Rebekah&#039;s apparition? </span><br>I feel like a lot of the more absurd points in this book could be hand-waved away as the Revd. making shit up to entretain his family, especially if you want to take a more &#039;historical&#039; point of view and try to decipher what Pynchon made up entirely from what could have reasonably happened on a more meta level, but I think discussing it thematically or taking it at face-value can be fun as well. Do you think this was a symptom of Mason&#039;s deteriorating mental health as a result of the Winds or a sign that Maskelyne was right about the Island&#039;s nature? Or better yet; do you see this as a positive thing for Mason or not? On one hand we have a lot of satanic imagery in these sections, while Mason gets more and more paranoid about the origin of his visions, describing how her tone of voice changed pitch and took on a &#039;beastly aspect&#039;, but on the other he was also clearly still enamored with her, and &#039;brought&#039; her apparition back to England with him (By the way, do you think this was her voice guiding him by the end of the chapter before he meets the Ear?) And speaking of which; <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Ear section and the meeting with the pretender</span><br>One of the most interesting scenes I think, from the odd entrance that Mason can not find after exiting, to him describing the experience of talking to a being that &#039;could only hear, never speak&#039; as &#039;confessing to a desert&#039; and finding himself being able to talk about his innermost thoughts. What did you take away from this if anything? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maskelyne</span><br>I think that barring our protagonists he definitely is the most intriguing figure of the book so far, especially being such a distinguished figure IRL. What did you take from his supposed meetings with Dieter? I might be ignorant of some historical fact being mentioned here, or maybe it is all fiction, but do you think this is a figure of Maskelyne&#039;s past, a legitimate apparition similar to Rebekah, or some sort of signal coming from his guilt of using his brother-in-law&#039;s influence to gain favors and step-up in life (even if he is doing it for a positive cause?) Personally, I&#039;m leaning to the latter. <br>To conclude this post, I think these last five-or-so chapters after the transit of venus have been my favorite part of the book so far, and that the moment where Dixon tells Mason to tell him about Rebekah was the most personally touching moment of the entire novel. I definitely understand where some Anons are coming from when they call it comfy, plus the entire telling-a-story-in-a-storm aspect of it.

For instance, Most freshmen aren&#039;t even ready for concepts like symbolism and juxtaposition til the end of the year; you start them off on simple stuff like direct and indirect characterization, and being able to summarize what&#039;s happening in a text, and build from there. If you want them to learn something, you have to be willing to take it slow. It took me three years to figure this out and I&#039;m still not perfect at it.

Freshmen year should be informative/narrative writing mostly, starting explanatory (analysis) really in second semester, Sophomore year is informative/explanatory, starting argument second semester, junior year is mostly explanatory/argument, moving into rhetorical analysis and more complex writing forms in the second semester, and senior year should just culminate everything.<br>Take a look at your place&#039;s standards for education; my school uses these, but my college classes are bound to college standards.

And it is, after all, the addition of pasta that creates, by analogy with cereal, a soup, right?<br>- Right.<br>- So spaghetti with sauce is a soup? Since adding cereal to warm milk makes soup, so does adding pasta to soup!
