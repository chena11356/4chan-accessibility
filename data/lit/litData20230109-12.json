Everyone thinks that they could write a novel, direct a movie, or design a video game if only they had the technical skill or resources. That doesn&#039;t mean they can actually do it. I think a lot of people who actually do art know that, once you try putting your ideas into practice, you realise that you&#039;re not actually as creative as you thought you were. Having an idea in your head is not the same thing as being able to actualize it.<br><br>This is, ultimately, my problem with AI art - the idea that there are thousands of people who have great ideas but are somehow unable to learn the technical side of things. The fact that art takes effort to make is a good thing because it filters out the people who aren&#039;t committed enough. If you&#039;re so confident in your own vision then you should be able to go through the effort of learning how to actualise it. If AI art ever becomes anything more than a novelty, I think all it&#039;s going to achieve is making art oversaturated and disposable.

There was decades of oral storytelling before any of them were written down, so although many things in them are likely accurate, there&#039;s also undoubtedly many things in them which are not accurate; produced by the simple process which any myth transforms through word of mouth.

Like in Genesis the act of divine speech bringing about creation is a clear idea in Judaism which is quite distinct from the concept of Logos borrowed from Greek philosophy. And the mentions of holy spirit (ruach ha-kodesh) never imply the actions of a seperate person within the godhead. I see the Holy Spirit trinitarian doctrine as a post-hoc invention to balance out and make the simultaneous absolute divinity of Jesus and God the Father make more sense (such as being able to point back to that verse in Genesis). It seems to me like the reason these interpretations never appeared in Jewish history among the people writing the texts and their intended audience, is because it&#039;s just not substantiable.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why would the apostles preach ... if all they received for if was persecution and hardship? </span><br>We don&#039;t actually know what the Apostles preaches specifically, and considering the things we do know about early Christianity&#039;s spread and its many preachers, they likely all preached different interpretations. That&#039;s why we get James&#039; sect in the Jerusalem Temple contrasting with Pauline Roman Christianity, the many Gnostic offshoots, and long-lasting uncompromisable theological differences in (ex.)

However, it&#039;s more accurate to say that English has 4 aspects (as stated) and 4 times, past, present, future, subjunctive, with the subjunctive being &quot;could, might, may, should&quot; and IN SOME USES &quot;will&quot;. <br><br><br>Full usage<br>https://www.englishclub.com/grammar<wbr>/verb-tenses.htm:<br><br><a href=\"#p21498804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498804</a><br><a href=\"#p21498835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498835</a><br>&quot;Do/does, did, done&quot; is one of the few English verbs that inflects for aspect; &quot;He did it&quot; implies completion. &quot;He had done it&quot; and &quot;he did it&quot; are grammatically different but semantically the same. &quot;He had did&quot; is incorrect because the past perfect is &quot;had&quot; plus the PAST PARTICIPLE, which is identical to the simple past in weak verbs (&quot;walk, walked, walked&quot; vs &quot;sing, sang, sung&quot;).", "time": 1673214715, "resto": 21492913}, {"no": 21498896, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)16:57:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498811</a><br>It&#039;s kind of just a warning that a lot of resources can have bad Irish or tap out at a certain level of Irish that doesn&#039;t reflect either its commonly spoken forms, or things that are useful outside high school literature exams under a kind of prussian education system.<br>The Irish language channels on radio and TV are better resources because they&#039;re designed for and by people who are native level speakers.

Most Irish people are at the basic FOB level where banking or reading the news or ordering something medium rare would be difficult for them, so you&#039;ll be functionally better than them with a few months of study, but to get better than them you have to drown out a lot of noise, kind of like you&#039;d probably get better at English as a second language if didn&#039;t try to learn it off other immigrants solely who also spoke it poorly and with a bias towards your native tongue. <br>One of the important parts is don&#039;t necessarily trust that official standard Irish is good.

And this in a non condescending way: not only affirming that the Hinayana is a Mahayana without realizing it, but that that both Hinayana and Mahayana pursue the same goal without realizing it (only the Buddha knows what the ultimate goal really is). In a perennialist framework however one can easily see the parallel: the other \u201cvehicles\u201d are the other traditions beside Buddhism, and Buddhism itself is but another vehicle that leads to the same transcendent goal, which nove of the traditions fully quite get, despite them being authentic and fully leading there \u2014 it\u2019s just the nature of transcendence, that it can never be fully expressed in finite and contingent forms.", "time": 1673144783, "resto": 21493512}, {"no": 21495535, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)21:41:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why didnt he just become an orthobro. was he really that seduced by eastern satanism", "filename": "orthodoxy", "ext": ".png", "w": 647, "h": 656, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673145694547628, "time": 1673145694, "md5": "yBsp9xFgEqp8kUUtQ8HD/w==", "fsize": 815017, "resto": 21493512}, {"no": 21495542, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)21:42:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21495483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to regret that Guenon took so long to admit that Buddhism was traditional,</span><br>Buddhism is by its nature difficult to penetrate from the outside because of the way it styles itself, which explains this fact quite clearly.

Unironically, this is what Christ Himself believed as well. \u201cThe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d<br>John 10:10. \u201cNow the Lord is..Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\u201d 2 Corinthians 3:17. \u201cFor I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.\u201d Galatians 2:19 . <br><br>The joy Nietzche was searching for was a life of freedom, vitality, and creativity. I have found this life in the objective morality of Christ. It is not, as Nietzche supposed, a life lacking vitality, but a supernatural vitality that embraces both Heaven and Earth. Embrace Christ as Savior, anon, and you will have joy, not only in this life, but also in the next.", "filename": "BC3CC1AC-E286-46E1-A2F8-AF3084DED35E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1724, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673250064517307, "time": 1673250064, "md5": "wr1fXu/L3SLo3lAMbBrKTA==", "fsize": 1706021, "resto": 21500255}, {"no": 21500541, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:41:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500490</a><br>Do you not know anti-matter is a real thing, anon?", "time": 1673250112, "resto": 21500255}, {"no": 21500564, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:50:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500537</a><br>Lowest iq post in the thread, redundant and actually narcissistic.

That&#039;s why i said the issue with Qutb isn&#039;t form, but content. The reason he&#039;s not authentic is that he&#039;s actually as much relying on the herd as the same liberal westerners he critiques, and Russell exemplifies that well.

Maybe it helps to say that liberalism pretends to be individualist, but ultimately tends to be very anti-individualist.

But Qutb&#039;s ressentiment would be pernicious, even if Qutb dropped the Islam and became a particularist.

You are, in the classical sense, projecting this onto me. I am not asserting as cosmically correct my own definition. You seem to have missed the nuance, but when I said that we were discussing our theories, I intentionally implied an openness to dissent. To an extent, I also implied humility, but this humility ends where one&#039;s definition of love promotes unhealthy views towards life. I don&#039;t profess any ideology, presuppositions, nor adherence (or even recognition of) the &#039;ismist suckdick extravaganza which characterizes 21st century discourse in all arenas. <br><br>If I have fanaticism, it is in opposition to people whose philosophies are necessarily exclusionary of others \u2014 which define themselves in opposition. If I have fanaticism, it is in the idea that the worldview in which you are so invested is not some kind of supra-real reality as is always depressively implied in these discussions. The fact that it makes you feel bad does not necessarily imply that it is more real. A set of ideas that justify your feelings of hopelessness, resignation, despair is not intrinsically correct to the exclusion of all other ideals just because you find it sufficiently justifies that feeling. Answer me honestly: what came first, the feelings that spurred on the development of these ideas of yours, or the ideas? My money is on the feelings, regardless of what you will or won&#039;t say. <br><br>My purpose here is not to replace these ideas you&#039;ve obviously spent so long developing, research, correlating. It&#039;s too instill in anyone reading this exchange who might otherwise be convinced by the dour and superficially-rigorous tone in which your ideas are related that there is wiggle-room. Your ideas are one set among many. If we recognize that logic cannot create reality \u2014 only describe it \u2014 then it becomes obvious that an argument&#039;s truth value is completely independent of its correlation with reality. You could make the world&#039;s most rigorous argument for the idea that heat is actually cold and it will only change the fact that now it&#039;s cold that burns you. The actual, underlying mechanisms are independent of whatever you may layer on top of it. <br><br>So, no, I&#039;m not saying your idea of love is wrong and that mine is right.

Sex is what makes babies after all and you can&#039;t really have sex without passion. I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s.more to a relationship than pure passion and it&#039;s the active decision to sacrifice one&#039;s freedom to their spouse and to their children (assuming they have any) that makes a relationship true. I can have passionate sex with hookers or arthoes or have passion for a cute girl I see. That doesn&#039;t make it love at all. It&#039;s just lust in the first two cases and a crush in the latter. The difference between love and lust is the addition of devotion and sacrificing one&#039;s own good for the other and the direct promise that the union will be fertile (assuming no biological sterility). You can talk abou &quot;passion&quot; this, &quot;passion&quot; that, but a man that has swx with 20 women, a man that has a crush on a gravure model and a man that is about to make love to his wife all have passion for a woman. But only the husband is truly in love in some sense. Also, these associatoons are non non-existent. They exist in a great deal of philosophical literature and also a good deal of love stories like that of Heloise and Peter Abelard, the parents of the Gracchi brothers, Saint Augustine and his common-law wife that bore Adeodatus, etc. If you are decently read or at least looked around on this subject for awhile it is nkt hard to find. Aristotle, whike he writes more about friendship, talks about the same in the Nichomachaen Ethics and Gaius Musonius Rufus has an entire tract on marriage and what I said basically comports to that. Saint Paul also talks about marriage and again, his idea of marriage is basicallt what I am talking about. Just because most people don&#039;t put effort to actually do this in practice doesn&#039;t mean that this isn&#039;t how marriage is supposed to work: it&#039;s funadamentally an active sacrifice of oneself for the spiritual, mental and physical (which includes sexual passion) of your spouse for the propagation of spirtual, mental and physical (children or at the very least openess to children) fruits.<br><br>I think you reading way too much into my texts.

It is because wherever there is philosophy, the Greeks have already considered it. Everything from the Egoism of Stirner:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOCRATES: A simple thing enough; just what is commonly said, that a man should be temperate and master of himself, and ruler of his own pleasures and passions.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CALLICLES: What innocence! you mean those fools,\u2013the temperate?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOCRATES: Certainly:\u2013any one may know that to be my meaning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CALLICLES: Quite so, Socrates; and they are really fools, for how can a man be happy who is the servant of anything? On the contrary, I plainly assert, that he who would truly live ought to allow his desires to wax to the uttermost, and not to chastise them; but when they have grown to their greatest he should have courage and intelligence to minister to them and to satisfy all his longings. And this I affirm to be natural justice and nobility. To this however the many cannot attain; and they blame the strong man because they are ashamed of their own weakness, which they desire to conceal, and hence they say that intemperance is base. As I have remarked already, they enslave the nobler natures, and being unable to satisfy their pleasures, they praise temperance and justice out of their own cowardice. For if a man had been originally the son of a king, or had a nature capable of acquiring an empire or a tyranny or sovereignty, what could be more truly base or evil than temperance\u2013to a man like him, I say, who might freely be enjoying every good, and has no one to stand in his way, and yet has admitted custom and reason and the opinion of other men to be lords over him?\u2013must not he be in a miserable plight whom the reputation of justice and temperance hinders from giving more to his friends than to his enemies, even though he be a ruler in his city? Nay, Socrates, for you profess to be a votary of the truth, and the truth is this:\u2013that luxury and intemperance and licence, if they be provided with means, are virtue and happiness\u2013all the rest is a mere bauble, agreements contrary to nature, foolish talk of men, nothing worth.</span><br>To the relativism and subjectivism of Protagoras, of whom we have only a tiny fraction of the actual texts:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOCRATES: Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of Protagoras, who has another way of expressing it. Man, he says, is the measure of all things, of the existence of things that are, and of the non-existence of things that are not:\u2013You have read him?</span><br>All the way down to Anaxagoras and his mirrors of Hume. The fact is that the Greeks still haven&#039;t been topped by any culture in philosophical output- and that&#039;s without access to the overwhelming percentage of lost texts.

The Greeks are the branch that formed the entirety of western philosophy, and it&#039;s my unproven opinion that the last 2000 years of Western philosophy has been the gradual loss of philosophical wisdom.

Some guy whose 12% remaining flesh is plugged into a flying death robot can kill a hundred Bios if he finds them--but he can&#039;t do shit if there&#039;s no electricity to recharge his battery, no replacement parts on hand, and the Swedish-produced immunosuppressants he relies on are at the bottom of the ocean because some guys in a speedboat suicide bombed the tanker transporting them across the Atlantic.<br><br>So things turn very asymmetrical, with the remaining Cogs desperately trying to cobble together enough of a functional supply system to avoid being wiped out, and the Bios systematically destroying everything that would make it possible. The story followed a joint-consciousness that is dispassionately (at first) trying to work out how this can be fixed, and slowly realizing that the Bios had argued that the entire transhumanist cause was inherently suicidal specifically because it relied on technology which in turn relied on a fragile ecosystem of production and industry and resources that was inherently unsustainable--and that once you go Cog you can&#039;t go back. This entire event wasn&#039;t so much a war as an illustration that they were right.<br><br>Near the end Pyrrhus (the Gestalt Consciousness) decides that though the Bios were idiots, they had actually intuited correctly that society was not and may not ever be ready for this, and self-destructs to spare itself the Hell-Program tortures that the renegades always used on captives.<br><br>And then I lost the fucking draft.

The style seems to *superficially* ornate, as well as repetitive, for this at the moment.

Over-reliance of the sort of statements I pointed out, e.g., &quot;I find myself in darkness!&quot; is not very evocative since it&#039;s a cliche.

Elam is skeptical at first, but as he learns more about the ancient prophecy that foretells his destiny, he begins to understand the weight of his responsibilities.<br>As Elam trains for battle, the Inklings launch a surprise attack on the human kingdom. Elam and his fellow warriors are sent to defend their people, and in the heat of battle, Elam discovers that he has powers beyond his wildest dreams.<br>With the help of Sol and the ancient relics of Solaria, Elam leads the humans to victory over the Inklings. But the war is far from over, and Elam knows that he must continue to fight to protect his people and fulfill his destiny as the guardian of Solaria.<br>As Elam and his fellow warriors engage the Inklings in battle, things seem to be going well at first. But the Inklings are a formidable enemy, and they soon turn the tide of the battle. Elam is gravely injured and forced to retreat, leaving his fellow warriors to fight on without him.<br>As he limps away, badly wounded and alone, Elam begins to have doubts about the Solarian religion and its teachings. He had always believed that the gods had chosen him to be the guardian of humanity, but now he wonders if it was all just a lie.<br>As he reflects on his life and the countless battles he has fought, Elam realizes that the war with the Inklings has been going on for as long as anyone can remember, and that it is likely to continue for all eternity. The humans and the Inklings are locked in a cycle of violence and hatred, doomed to fight each other until the end of time.<br>Elam dies knowing that he has failed in his duty as the guardian of Solaria, and that the Solarian religion is nothing more than a tool used to control the masses and keep them fighting.

Kant categorises each type of logical thought into what they are, basically inventing a ruleset for valid logical thinking, and then with his new ruleset goes on to stake out the limits of rational thought itself. Interestingly he denies all off St. Aquinas proofs of God through reason as not compatible with his ruleset of logic, and thus not transcendal and not true. This marks a final separation of faith and reason, as God becomes unprovable or undisprovable through reason and purely a matter of faith.

The deeper message here is non-identification with the body and mind. &quot;The one who knows and understands the activity of the gunas [the threefold interplay of the material substrate] is not deluded about the actions of the body and mind&quot; (paraphrased from the B.G.). But the Self, Atman, is not the agent of any of this interplay, it is without a second, and therefore does not act upon anything, because there is nothing apart from it to act upon. Therefore the Self/Atman is completely without action, no one is killed by anyone, the Self does not kill. But this is the absolute height of the teaching of the B.G. On a level that is more meaningful to human beings, in this case Arjuna, there is still a choice of what to do, but the right action is indeed pre-determined by the Dharma, the Law of Manu established at the beginning of Creation (the individual is not responsible to himself, which would not make sense, but responsible to the greater order established by Manu). You would have noticed that Krishna gives more than a single reason for Arjuna to act according to his caste, and that the first I mentioned (the highest teaching) is given last as a way to eliminate Arjuna&#039;s fundamental dissatisfaction with the need to take life in general, even after he accepts the necessity of his Dharma. The &quot;lesser reasons&quot; are partly that it is preordained by the cosmic order (rita/dharma) and therefore intrinsically constitutes a force for good in the world, another is that death is not really the end, another is that as long as you act well, you will be rewarded whether you live or die. Moral agency is still presumed to be relevant in the case of Arjuna because he clearly has the choice of acting in accordance with his Dharma, or not doing so, the &quot;higher teaching&quot; is that this choice is fundamentally illusory, even though it is still necessary.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against 2000 years of western ideas about subjectivity</span><br>You would mean approximately 500 years. &quot;Subjectivity&quot; is basically made up by modern philosophers, it&#039;s not found anywhere in influential thinkers like Aristotle.

Second, explicit mention of caste was removed, yet the gunas remain. As you probably know, caste was originally an implementation of guna balances. To invoke the idea of caste without further specificity implies you reference its most recent historical implementation of &quot;birthright&quot; delineation. Krishna did indeed outline a caste system, but to protest Easwaran&#039;s omission thereof without mentioning the original capacity by which Krishna outlined them is uneducated at best \u2014 and disingenuous at worst.

Attendance figures are down by double-digit percentages across the board, around a third of eligible young men are serving missions, and a third of those are coming home early. Couple that with the ease with which anyone can access information that the church would rather bury, like the &#039;secret&#039; handbooks for bishops, recordings of &#039;sacred&#039; ceremonies, finance figures for Ensign Peak Holdings, et cetera, and I&#039;d wager that the church will fall into irrelevance in a few short decades, if not sooner. <br>I have complicated feelings about the impending Mormon Apocalypse. Personally, I feel disgusted with the church and somewhat dirtied by my having been brought up in it. I had no concept of the metaphysics or philosophy underlying Christianity until I moved out, because I was brought up to believe that the early Church was corrupted by &quot;Greek pagan thought&quot; during the great apostasy, blindly accepted crypto-Gnostic and blatantly Masonic rituals and worldviews despite knowing exactly where they were cribbed from because I thought such things were examples of the beginning of the &quot;restoration,&quot; and came up with elaborate copes for why evidence of a Jewish-descended civilization across the Americas did not exist. As a Trinitarian Christian now, I feel like I received a safari tour through every heresy ever devised.<br>I&#039;m also angered by the thought that my family bought into this ridiculous system, both figuratively and literally, for generations, and so did the families of hundreds of wonderful people I met while I was a believing member. On a similar scale as Scientology, the LDS church uses its tithing funds to purchase large investment properties and generate wealth, which it dispenses to its top-level executives in the form of compensation, condominiums, paid trips, and so on, while remaining completely opaque about where its money is going and refusing to provide aid to members in need unless they meet certain conditions and exhaust all other options. Furthermore, for decades members were discouraged from holding savings that they could give as tithes instead - my own parents have as much saved from 30 years of professional white-collar work as I do from 4 years in the military. <br>At the same time, I know that the collapse of the system will shunt the remaining untouched Mormon youth into the maw of the secular-liberal amoral world order. I left because I wanted to know the truth about God more than I wanted to remain in the comfortable Mormon community, but most who leave do so out of anger at the lies they&#039;ve been fed and so resolve to never enter another organized religion again. It&#039;s hard to blame them, and I expect that as membership rates and participation rates erode almost all who remain will do so as well. In the end only a few will be left - the general authorities, the hedge fund mangers, and a few true believers, alone among the ruins of their cult.", "time": 1673032278, "resto": 21485603}, {"no": 21488595, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)14:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate my sister.

I do not believe this whore has any real memorable experiences, however i am seething with envy, nonetheless at the fact that she lives pampered in comfort with no true worries and my life...now that i think about I t, is similar again.

This includes ensuring that your most intimate areas are clean and well-maintained. I know, I know - you&#039;re thinking, &quot;Jordan, I already shower regularly, what&#039;s the big deal about washing my genitalia?&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But let me tell you, the act of thoroughly cleansing your male anatomy is not just about personal hygiene. It&#039;s about self-respect, discipline, and, ultimately, success and personal fulfilment.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First and foremost, washing your genitals sends a message to yourself and to others that you value yourself and your health. A man who takes care of his body is a man who is confident, self-assured, and capable. This confidence will radiate outwards, attracting success and opportunity in all areas of your life.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But it&#039;s not just about impressing others. Proper genital hygiene can also improve your sexual health and relationships. No one wants to be intimate with a partner who is unclean or has an unpleasant smell. Showing respect for your partner&#039;s body by taking care of your own sends a powerful message and can lead to deeper intimacy and connection.</span><br><br>And let&#039;s not forget the importance of discipline. Washing your genitalia may seem like a small and insignificant task, but it is a daily practice that requires discipline and commitment. This discipline will spill over into other areas of your life, helping you to become more organized, focused, and productive.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a clinical psychologist, one of the things I learned is that many of our deepest beliefs and values are rooted in ancient stories and myths. And when it comes to the importance of genital hygiene, the Bible offers a powerful analogy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the book of Leviticus, it is written that a man who has an emission of semen must wash his entire body with water, and he will be unclean until evening. This may seem like an arbitrary rule, but it serves as a reminder that the most intimate and sacred parts of our bodies deserve care and attention.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just as the Israelites were called to be a holy people, set apart and consecrated to God, so too are we called to be holy in all aspects of our lives - including the care of our bodies. When we neglect to wash our genitalia, we are neglecting a sacred aspect of ourselves and failing to live up to our full potential as men.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So the next time you step into the shower, don&#039;t just give your armpits and chest a cursory rinse. Take the time to give your male anatomy the attention it deserves. It may seem like a small act, but it is a powerful step towards living a life of integrity, self-respect, and personal fulfilment.

And when it comes to the importance of genital hygiene, we can look to the natural world for guidance.<br><br>You see, in the animal kingdom, there are certain behaviours that are essential for survival and reproduction. Take lobsters, for example. When a male lobster wants to attract a female, he must first engage in a ritual of self-cleansing. He washes his genital area, displaying to the female that he is a strong and capable mate.<br><br>Now, I know what you&#039;re thinking - what do bloody lobsters have to do with human males? But bear with me. Just like the male lobster, a man who takes care of his body, who shows respect for himself and his health, is a man who exudes confidence and self-assurance. This confidence is contagious, drawing success and opportunity to him like a magnet.<br><br>But the benefits of genital hygiene extend far beyond just external appearances. It is also crucial for maintaining sexual health and improving relationships. No one wants to be intimate with a partner who is unclean or emits an unpleasant odor. Showing respect for your partner&#039;s body by taking care of your own sends a powerful message and can lead to deeper intimacy and connection.<br><br>So, my fellow men, I implore you: do not neglect this essential aspect of self-care. Take a page from the lobster&#039;s book and engage in a daily ritual of self-cleansing. It may seem like a small task, but it is one that will pay dividends in all areas of your life.

Do not rush through it, as thorough cleansing is of the utmost importance. Begin by gathering all necessary tools, such as a washcloth, soap, and towel.<br><br>Next, find a comfortable and private location to perform this ritual. Your bathroom or shower is an ideal choice.<br><br>Now, it is time to begin the cleansing process. Begin by gently cupping your genitals in your hand, taking care not to apply too much pressure. Apply a small amount of soap to your washcloth and gently scrub your genitals, making sure to get every nook and cranny. Pay particular attention to the folds of skin, as these areas are prone to build-up and bacteria.<br><br>Once you have thoroughly scrubbed your genitals, rinse the soap off with warm water. Be sure to rinse thoroughly, as any leftover soap can cause irritation and discomfort.<br><br>After rinsing, pat your genitals dry with a clean towel. And voila! Your male anatomy is now clean and well-maintained.<br><br>But this process is not just about physical cleanliness. It is also a matter of self-respect and discipline. As Nietzsche wrote, &quot;He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.&quot; When we take care of ourselves, we are better equipped to face the challenges of the world and to live a fulfilling and meaningful life.<br><br>And as the Bible teaches us, we are called to be a holy people, set apart and consecrated to God. This includes taking care of our bodies and treating them with the respect and attention they deserve.<br><br>So, my fellow men, I urge you to make this daily ritual of genital hygiene a priority. Not only will it improve your physical health, but it will also enhance your sense of self-respect and discipline.

But this book really killed it for me. I was spoiled in advance that our MC gets married with a character introduced early on despite the no romantic interaction between them. <br>So, based on what we were told about high cultivation beasts, I was expecting it to be the White Tigress named Azrea, companion he is with since book 1 who we know will only be able to assume a human form once she reaches higher cultivation. The first time we see her in human form is in this book, great. She confesses she loves him, great. Our MC pulls a japcuck move &#039;I love you like a father&#039;, decides his love interest is a female we got introduced halfway into the series and who barely appeared, and they were never close, closer to enemies and who he never cared about beyond thinking she is hot, which is nothing unique in this story. Awful, but whatever, she is implied to be a reincarnation of a girl he met way before and died before he could love, since the world works that way. This is implied in this book, not before.<br>But then the author decides to character assassinate the MC, Azrea, and the MC&#039;s &#039;true love&#039;. All to move plot forward in the same direction it was going for over 10 books, and he changed in this very book. What the fuck.<br>Christ almighty, I can get over OTP being ruined even if it&#039;s the only romantic line we could have based on all context, and that makes sense in the setting. I can get over the author being horny for demon girls when he decied to write this bullshit. But to ruin the whole setup of plot,our MC&#039;s character, and to a lesser extent Azrea&#039;s character, all in order to prolong what he is draging over 10 books is amazing. If someone told me he was paid big money or held at gunpoint to write it like that I would believe it.<br>Now I know I am being a faggot to stop reading a book over romantic pairing of all things, when that isn&#039;t even the main focus of the book, but it brings into view all the dissatisfaction I had with the series that I could easily ignore due to enjoyment. The nonstop action and mundane happening that occur back to back that makes it impossible to finish the series without a hundred books, which is countered by timeskips of immense scale that depict events that sound much more interesting than events what we get in hundred pages chunks, introductions of multiple power systems that make power levels all over the place, MC being forced into constant deadly situations he shouldn&#039;t be in, which he can only overcome with deus ex machina powerups, bits and pieces of deepest lore that bog down the story due to taking at least 50% of the word count outside of battles and could be told in much better ways.<br>Overall, worth a read if you like cultivation stories, especially if you wanted a western story with eastern influence.<br>Thanks for reading my blog, this is a cry for help.", "filename": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673154896777019, "time": 1673154896, "md5": "QiBDdd8u8itIDyiaeA+DQw==", "fsize": 46686, "resto": 21494509}, {"no": 21495934, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)00:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21494775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21494775</a><br>This desu.

This is going to be long. I&#039;ve generally found his books enjoyable for what they are, but the final book of the new trilogy was bad enough that I&#039;m hesitant to touch whatever he writes next.<br><br>Pacing and variety were shit compared to previous books. For an entire 2/3 of the book, 2 PoV characters are in an extremely predictable\u2014if inoffensive\u2014North storyline (and Isern is p annoying and one-note for the amount of &#039;screentime&#039; she gets). But 5 of them are all in the same location and all experiencing roughly the same things. Abercrombie wanted his Reign Of Terror post-revolutionary chaos and serial regime change, but he beat that horse past the point of death and it became a repetitive slog for me.<br><br>Some PoVs were a waste of time. Broad in particular ended up not amounting to much, everything in his story which actually mattered throughout the trilogy could have been shown in someone else&#039;s PoV chapter, or in one of the &quot;The Little People&quot; chapters where we have shorter PoVs from a bunch of non-main characters in succession. Doesn&#039;t help that he comes across as &quot;Bloody Nine but less interesting&quot;. His distinguishing feature is that he has a family, but they barely ever factor into his chapters in book 3.<br><br>Arguably the best character from the previous two books, Orso, also felt wasted. Book 1 he experiences character development reassessing his values and priorities. Book 2 by coming into his own as a leader. Then in Book 3 he doesn&#039;t really develop much at all, he&#039;s just a guy who sits around and things happen to. Boring, frustrating. At least he got a good death scene, going out with dignity and making his enemy seethe (vs. Jezal breaking and becoming a miserable servant of Bayaz). However the way he ends up on that hangman&#039;s scaffold is pretty retarded, and relies on incredibly stupid stuff I&#039;ll bitch about further down.<br><br>When the revolution happens, suddenly the world feels too small. Only Adua seems to exist. It makes sense that Angland doesn&#039;t interfere because their armies got absolutely shattered, but the other provinces just sorta ignore it. Even more criminally, other nations seem to just ignore it. There&#039;s a token excuse for why, but it&#039;s very unconvincing to me. No fucking way Monza for instance wouldn&#039;t make a play for Westport while the Union is tearing itself apart, let alone the guy who&#039;s been uniting the Old Empire. Feels like the rest of the world\u2014aside from the North\u2014is just on hold to allow the plot to happen.

A shapeshifting superhuman henchman who could have done any number of things that were much more effective during the revolution. This is a guy who managed to set up and shut down an entire peasant uprising before, and now he feels almost entirely impotent and incapable of covert maneuvers. That or he doesn&#039;t give a shit about the Union and has abandoned it as a project, but that makes no sense given his earlier characterization. It&#039;d be a big enough change that I&#039;d at least want some kind of reason established for it. Instead he just fucks around in the North. It feels arbitrary and robs the victory over Bayaz of real satisfaction, since it means he either doesn&#039;t care or was just turned into a lazy retard so other people could get a win. If Bayaz is going to be beaten, I want it to be the formidable one we saw in First Law trilogy, not some loser with the same name.<br><br>Inquisition seems way too completely loyal to Glokta and Pike and their &quot;fuck wizards&quot; cause. I don&#039;t care how smart they&#039;ve been about recruitment, we saw in the first trilogy that Practicals are just normal people with the same loyalties and vices as any other. That not even one Practical betrayed Glokta and turned him in to the revolutionaries or anyone else strains credulity for me. But fuck it, maybe it was just Pike and the ten or so that we see who were aware, and it turns out they were all really loyal dudes. It still seems questionable that in the post-revolutionary jockeying for power nobody ever set their sights on Pike.<br><br>But the big one, holy shit the big one: Leo is a total mess, and he&#039;s arguably the most important PoV character of the book. Two books worth of being portrayed as an arrogant impulsive retard, albeit one who wants to be one of the &quot;good guys&quot;, then he gets injured. Like a switch flips he then transforms into the love child of Glokta and Calder, some kind of political operator. It&#039;s some comic book Daredevil &quot;injury=superpowers&quot; bullshit. I don&#039;t have an issue with him losing his morals and becoming a bitter asshole, he was always an asshole and it makes the point that it&#039;s easy to be a good dude when everything was handed to you on a silver platter. I do have a problem with him suddenly gaining a dozen or two IQ points as if by magic. I definitely have a problem with him backstabbing Orso figuratively and the leader of the Loyalist army literally in public, and the entire Loyalist army which has already been willingly fighting a seemingly-hopeless war for months just uh... surrendering or disappearing? Not immediately devolving into restarted civil war or at least massive losses for the Anglander army. Armies appearing and disappearing with little justification as the plot demands, just plain bad writing.<br><br>Gonna take another post.", "time": 1673198293, "resto": 21494509}, {"no": 21497873, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)12:19:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21495873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495873</a><br><a href=\"#p21497861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497861</a><br><a href=\"#p21497869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497869</a><br>Then the new leader of the North bends over backwards to make peace with him, when the only reason there&#039;s enough of an Anglander army to occupy and defend Adua is that they&#039;ve stripped Angland of p much every able-bodied man.

He can&#039;t afford to fight her, but the story and characters all act like he could. The story contorts itself by all means necessary to make things work way too smoothly so that Leo could become emperor Palpatine.<br><br>But then his wife outmaneuvers him politically and leaves him near powerless, and suddenly he transforms into what he should have been right after the injury: An impotently seething bitter wreck, like Glokta without the cleverness and self-awareness. That&#039;s how the character in the first two books would have ended up (because becoming a cripple doesn&#039;t make you Glokta) and it&#039;s where he does end up, but only after all the ridiculous bullshit I mentioned which absolutely makes no sense. He spends 90% of the book as a plot device, characterization driven solely by whatever Joe needs to happen in the plot. Only once the plot is complete and it&#039;s time for wrap-up does he behave in a way which makes sense given prior characterization and have the world respond in a way which also makes sense.<br><br>Trilogy ends with a tease for future shit, which after this merits a &quot;fuck off&quot; rather than a &quot;wowie, how exciting!&quot; from me.

WoC imo was all about the decay of who you are in the face of group think and with Broad you&#039;re very aware of the rage lying underneath everything from the first two books and he stands as an actual character with a face and personality who represents the commoners rather than just having someone like him in one of the one off chapters. <br>My thoughts on the themes comes back to why I found the use of Orso very impressive throughout the book, he goes from someone with power who didn&#039;t want it to someone with power making change with it to being brought down to a level lesser than even what the commoners were while maintaining the clarity he acquired as King. He turns into an almost completely passive prescence within the story and the world except as a figure of hatred or reverence-like his father. His death being the only thing he had any say in (that he faced it with dignity that is) after everything else was robbed I thought was a fitting end to his character. <br>For Bayaz I agree that his actions seem very strange but with them in mind on top of the setup at the end of the series I find it slightly hard to pass judgement until we learn more about what his machinations could be, I admit this is another area my memory is hazy on but him allowing the Union to hit the state it does doesn&#039;t necessarily signal a lack of care on his part and could be simply a part of his ultimate keikaku. that&#039;s not an excuse for him being stupid in AoM but I do think it&#039;s relevant. i have similar feelings on the practicals being extremely loyal based off of Glokta&#039;s super selective process or whatever. <br>I&#039;m clearly putting a lot of faith in Joe to deliver on some of the holes presented but with the exception of Leo&#039;s character-where I&#039;m with you 100%-I think that it&#039;s a solid conclusion to things, just wish it was more conclusive like the first trilogy was.", "time": 1673218940, "resto": 21494509}, {"no": 21499111, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)18:05:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499068</a><br>It&#039;s a pretty straightforward post which requires no information the people being replied to wouldn&#039;t have, anon.

First, about the Holocaust. [Rep.] Manny Celler was voted in in 1923\u2026he was Jewish, from Manhattan. He was warning about the Holocaust, and everybody was ignoring him. In 1947, he was head of the Judiciary Committee, and he was able to get jurisdiction [over immigration] changed from the Labor Committee. He had control over immigration reform. There was a huge attitude change. Exodus had been published. Israel was popular. The other thing was the civil rights movement. Black soldiers were coming back, and there were Jim Crow laws. Those movements drove the 1965 law. Philip Hart, called the conscience of the Senate, was passionate about civil rights. ... They decided to do away with preferences for work skills, and have preferences for family reunification.

They even had an apartment by Prospect Park\u2014the kind of bright, airy space that evinced enough good taste and stalwart respectability that the idea of showing adoption agencies where they lived had been one of the lesser obstacles to motherhood.<br>But now, three years later, as Reese\u2019s odometer clicked up into her midthirties, she began to think about what she called the Sex and the City Problem.", "time": 1673231245, "resto": 21499586}, {"no": 21499733, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:30:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Only Iris, she of the gorgeous blond hair and the party habit, who frequently disappeared into two- or three-day meth-fueled sex benders, really understood why Reese kept digging in deeper with Stanley. \u201cI want to drive men crazy,\u201d Iris said in her customary arch manner. \u201cI want men to suffer. I want a man to love me so much he murders me. I want to die because I\u2019m loved too much for him to tolerate my existence.\u201d<br>Reese didn\u2019t want to die. Compared to Iris, Reese felt like she was only playing at this sort of psychodrama\u2014Fisher Price: My First Abusive Man. Whereas Iris only had time for abusive men. Iris had a doll\u2019s eyes and a practiced Marilyn Monroe giggle. She\u2019d been an English major at Brown before she had transitioned, but refused to read any books afterward, and instead presented vacant ambitions in which she could remain an object: get discovered and be a movie star, become a Lana Del Rey song personified. In the post-meth lows, she spoke in other images, laced with serotonin-depleted terror and an almost prideful insistence on describing her own actions in the passive voice: being pimped; having my pussy pledged; spending days in addled semi-captivity among faceless men who made me addicted, who owned me, who fucked me limp, whose lives depend on my body.", "time": 1673231446, "resto": 21499586}, {"no": 21499734, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:31:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499733</a><br>The dreamy way that Iris talked about what should have been horror made Reese jealous. Before Stanley, Reese\u2019s own sex games only flirted with possession, and alone with her Hitachi, images from Iris\u2019s stories kept making cameos in her fantasies. Hands on her throat. Slaps to her face. Fight leaving her body. To Iris, though, Reese said little, other than \u201cwhoa.\u201d Once, Reese asked Iris if she needed help, to get away from those men. In response, Iris grimaced and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d And for once, Reese, the transsexual who hadn\u2019t gone to college, much less Brown, was embarrassed by her sensibilities, as she clutched her pearls, primly imagining the sensationalism of an SVU episode featuring sex trafficking instead of whatever Iris actually got, emotionally or otherwise, from the men with whom she disappeared. It was the same tone of uninformed concern that older cis people used with Reese when they discovered she was a transsexual: Oh dear, your life must really not be okay. The response always surprised them: I chose this. I want it. It makes me feel right. Whatever Iris was getting, Iris got it because she found in it something she wanted and Iris had shared it with Reese, because she had sensed that lurking in an unspoken place Reese craved something kindred. The least Reese could do was to be honest, to not pretend like she didn\u2019t understand the chaos that separated what can be wanted and what can be said.<br>Consider for a moment Reese\u2019s own damage: She met Stanley on a fetish site with the word \u201ctranny\u201d in its name. During that period of her life, Reese only ever dated on fetish sites. She disdained the trans girls who disdained tranny chasers. It\u2019s stupid to rule out every single man who has come to the understanding that he desires your body. It\u2019s a mark of prudish inexperience to think that being fetishized and objectified isn\u2019t the hottest thing going in the bedroom.<br>Reese\u2019s dating practice prescribed that the only chasers you had to avoid were the crypto-trans women, the ones who want to be women but are too closeted to handle it, and so they live their fantasies through you. You can feel it when you\u2019re with a crypto-trans. A crypto-trans has to evacuate you, your personhood, to use you, to fantasize that he is you getting fucked even as he fucks you. You\u2019re just a body for him to live through vicariously. It\u2019s the most alienating thing in the world. It\u2019s like being psychically worn. Like you\u2019re a glove.

It was the first time she had been present as the woman she so obviously had been all along, a woman who required no effort to be present, and who connected directly with Reese.<br>So often when she had sex, she allocated the majority of her mental capacity to managing her own impression of herself as she fucked, with a secondary concern being her partner\u2019s impression of her. This allocation left little mental energy for actually desiring her partner, much less vocalizing or displaying that desire. Which, she knew, did not make her a good lover.

Their job was to provide lots of masculine contrast to her girliness, a task they set about diligently, because most of them were straight-identified, married, and therefore invested in getting to enjoy her body while avoiding any thought that allowed them to ponder why the thing that made their cocks hard was a hard cock on a girl.

She pictured Delia pinching her nipples, and reached around and pinched Delia\u2019s tiny breasts. And then, without warning, Amy was coming. Not in the room with Delia, but in another similar room, where Delia was spanking her, where she was Delia\u2019s little slut, where Delia had her captive, where she was Delia\u2019s good girl, forever and ever.<br>And then again, she was back in Delia\u2019s actual room.

But pathology felt more and more apt the more sex she had. It took her a while to understand the cyclical loneliness of disappearing in dissociation during sex. That people have sex for a shared joy that keeps an existential loneliness at bay, so when she disappeared inside of herself, her more experienced partners sensed that absence and her disappearance hurt them. Since she dreaded hurting those she most wanted to connect with, she grew to dread and avoid sex with specifically those most-liked people.

For Guenon it is Advaita. For Evola it is Magic of which Alchemy and Yoga are examples par excellence. For Eliade it is shamanism. The lattermost was most accomplished scholar and rose to prominence. We must however question the politics of his move to place shamanism first. Is it most correct? Or most politically correct? Are shamans roots of all religions? Are modern so-called capitalist oppressed civilization avoidant shamanic indigineous cultures today really how all of primitive man lived? Eiade himself says drug use is degenerate shamanism lol. Many scholars nowadays also argue for schismogenetic religious experience and schismogenetic prehistoric culture. Polyphony. Plurality. Multivalence. I like pure Gnosticism and Hermeticism and Neoplatonism however myself... altho I do like Evola&#039;s Yogic and Alchemical approach for applying such philosophies even if I don&#039;t follow his methods exactly.<br><a href=\"#p21497323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497323</a><br>This is a good question and would require many books to answer but maybe check out Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, it is one of the classic books in the field of esoteric stuxies generally which lead to the modern scholarly interest in the so-called Hermetic Underground. In short, it is very complicated and the answer is yes and no and changed with time and place. Catholics have sacraments. And mystics. Masons are initiatic too. Kept alive certain stuff. Enemies tho. But latter led to GD and Thelema and stuff now. Whole mess of masonry illuminati and rosicrucians mixing. But also gnosticism. Christian theosophy. Not to be confused with theosophical society. Tho same milieu as Crowley Evola Guenon etc. Neoplatonism and Hermeticism crosspollinated. Both integral to western proto sciences like alchemy and astrology and magic. Catholic church is ambivalent. Delicate game of avoiding heresy. Science also considers heresy.

If the physician cannot infuse vitality into decaying parts, he cannot effect a cure, but must wait until Nature accomplishes the task; but he who can guide the power of life can guide and command Nature.\u201d</span><br><br>\u2014 Franz Hartmann,The Life of Paracelsus<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First there should be the invocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart, and a conscience which should be free from all ambition, hypocrisy and vice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, boldness, pride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and similar iniquities which should all be rooted out of the heart\u2014that when a man appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of his body, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be changed into a pure temple of God cleansed of all that defiles.\u201c</span><br><br>\u2014 Basil Valentine<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The more pure thou art in heart and mind, by so much quicker shall you perceive those high secrets we teach, and which are entirely hid from the discernment of the vicious and depraved\u2026</span><br>\u2014Francis Barrett, The Magus", "filename": "Henryk Waniek, Upon the Sky (1989)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 655, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1673231206909579, "time": 1673231206, "md5": "Mr96kNcaasS8ZvYmxIIOFQ==", "fsize": 217553, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21499859, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498558</a><br>It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit.<br>If I as a materialist were an alchemist I&#039;d never truly succeed", "time": 1673234098, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500558, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499859</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit</span><br>But what precisely does this mean?<br>If I were to become an alchemist, what would I truly be trying to do, without any mystical language to obscure it?<br>I&#039;m not a materialist by any means but I have no love for excessive obscurantism.", "time": 1673250518, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500751, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)03:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br>same<br>it seems like everyone who is into alchemy today only talks and reads about it and looks at pretty colorful pictures<br>there&#039;s no real practice anymore, no longer a tradition. just gnostic smugness that they know stuff about it", "time": 1673254106, "resto": 21496697}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21494777, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:13:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any similar books?", "filename": "1672592136882636", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 267, "h": 400, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673133224473050, "time": 1673133224, "md5": "lyldAkpepRYkXw4rUIy8aw==", "fsize": 111506, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "any-similar-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 52, "images": 11, "unique_ips": 33}, {"no": 21494782, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:14:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21494777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21494777</a><br>Basically anything by brandom", "time": 1673133271, "resto": 21494777}, {"no": 21494819, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:25:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "try using google with these search parameters<br>site: en.wikipedia.org &quot;antisemitism&quot;+&quot;author&quot;", "time": 1673133936, "resto": 21494777}, {"no": 21494825, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)18:26:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21494819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21494819</a><br>Why is it &quot;antisemetism&quot;

What is unique in Tolkien (and this also separates the novel from the drama) is his creation of a world and the greater formal emphasis on this.

A useful thing to keep in mind would be this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;197. Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people are expressing themselves unclearly because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and power for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people NEED power. Modern man as a collective entity \u2014 that is, the industrial system \u2014 has immense power over nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS OP INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. Generally speaking, the vast power of \u201cmodern man\u201d over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. To the extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) The individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. His PERSONAL power over nature is slight.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect himself from heat cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible compared to the COLLECTIVE power of industrial society.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS.</span><br>Large organizations are those that have a significant amount of control over the industrial infrastructure of society. I imagine that in the future the industrial system will become so efficient at enforcing its laws that people with be biologically incapable of disobedience, or this will be a normal day:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drones flying overhead spot WAGIE#0199201 growing illegal substance ID:TOMATO#23 (Natural, Carbon inefficient)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HELLO WAGE#0199201 300USD HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM YOUR KTID PASS.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PLEASE REMOVE ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE OR A UNIT WILL BE DISPATCHED TO YOUR LOCATION</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OUR SYSTEMS HAVE DETECTED YOUR COVID-IMPLANT IS OT OF DATE.

For example, one can think of 4chan. According to the Central limit Theorem, any sufficiently complex variable can be modeled with a normal distribution. So the propensity to use 4chan, which is obviously a complex variable involving upbringing, sex, etc., can be described with such a graph. If we can assume that actually using 4chan involves a sort of high-pass filter, so that one must have a certain propensity for 4chan to even consider using it, then there&#039;s a set of shared characteristics whose aggregate describes the average 4chan user. Of course, it&#039;s not one particular trait, but some combination of anti-sociality, racism, intelligence, and misogyny which creates the average 4chan poster. To expand the site then requires one of two things. Either you force every anti-social loser to post here, or you lower this filter. Since the first option is so unlikely as to be impossible, any expansion of the userbase requires lowering the criteria for posting here. This means that, as the site grow, the average poster has experiences that are further and further from the average chudcel.<br>In the extreme case, one could imagine a site whose userbase includes the whole planet; that site&#039;s culture would thus be indistinguishable from modern irl culture. <br>To summarize, as the userbase increases the culture of a site approximates normalfaggot culture.", "time": 1673049764, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490118, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish I didn\u2019t live.", "time": 1673053738, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490152, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489919</a>", "filename": "1672418363788950", "ext": ".png", "w": 1360, "h": 1358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673054223973699, "time": 1673054223, "md5": "X8XbIcBi47fMvFOhTMYNtQ==", "fsize": 44050, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490178, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486955</a><br>Finally got prescribed a PSA test.

I&#039;ll tell you a story. One time I was on a meth and benzo bender with an acquaintance and his new Canadian girlfriend, we spent a week in my bungalow just doing all sorts of drugs, meth, mdma, heroin, exotic benzos, acid. We would stay up for a couple days ranting nonsense at each other on meth, and then sleep in a pile on my floor nodding out zombied on benzos. When he was out of the room she just went for my cock, trying to suck it I assume. I thought a second then just put her to bed, she was too fucked up so it wouldn&#039;t be right (I didn&#039;t care as much about betraying my acquaintance). Thing is, a heatwave struck while we were doing this, 40 degrees celsius for days in my hotbox of a bungalow. We all just stripped down to our underwear, so pretty much the entire week this beautiful 20yo Canadian hippy with huge tits just went topless with knickers. But it was so hot and we were so fixated on drugs it had a very &#039;non-sexual&#039; quality even though I was shamelessly just zoning out staring at her tits. Her boyfriend had warned me beforehand, &#039;yeah she always goes topless&#039;, I don&#039;t care I said.<br><br>Another story? my friend broke up with his gf and had to come and stay with me and my gf for a couple of weeks, sleeping on out couch. So y gf&#039;s morning routine would be to wake up, then go feed the cats. So she would just be wearing her knickers and a singlet, bends over that way to feed the cats, which was apparently right in my friends face every day. He complains that she&#039;s bending over in her knickers in front of his face with her pussy and ass, so we kick him out for being rude. Another friend comes to stay. Less rude. Hot day. She inadvertently wears an extremely translucent white top that she hadn&#039;t worn before. Her tits are obviously completely visible but my friend is polite and cool and we just have a fun day. We decide to fill up some plastic mini-pool thing.

She was being very flirty with a handsome friend of ours, we invited him to come smoke a joint with us in the grimy pub toilet block. We crammed into the small room and she immediately sat down to pee (I&#039;ll just say once more this is very, very unusual, she was usually conservative and shy). She pulled her dress right up, her black stocking and black lace knickers down in front of us and sat down nonchalantly. My friend went red, embarrassed and turned around, apologizing profusely. We laughed and said it was fine. When she was done, she slowly pulled up her stockings and knickers, obviously flashing us her pussy but pretending she wasn&#039;t. We started smoking weed and chatting and we were joking about seeing her pee, she suddenly said &#039;hey do I have a nice ass&#039;, stood up, pulled her skirt up and bent over. I was awestruck (she is not like this, really), she was being casual like, &#039;yeah do I just have a nice ass, no big deal&#039;. Black lace knickers, stockings, bent over the toilet. It was a jokey environment and me and my friend just complemented her ass and groped it lightly. My friend took me aside again and apologized, thinking my gf was crazed and he was doing something wrong, I reassured him it was fine, not knowing myself what was going on. The one thing I was picking up: She was doing this angrily, not to please me. like: &#039;this is what u want?&#039;, drunken lady anger. Next, the tits. &quot;Do I have nice boobs&quot;, she said. We said yeah you have great boobs. &quot;Do you want to feel them&quot;, she said to my friend. He apologizes again and I say shut up dude go ahead. He just gropes her tits over her top for a while, same jokey atmosphere, just a couple dudes feeling a nice girls chest. We compliment and such. I become overwhelmed and just pull her bra down, exposing her pearl white tits and pink nipples. My friend touches her nipples and she covers herself embarrassed, we just go back to chilling, smoking weed.<br><br>Here&#039;s a couple of things that also happened tho: 1: I was going in and out of the room to get drinks the whole time. My friend later confessed, highly ashamed, that she was groping his cock every time I left the room, I never brought it up with her. 2: she had sheer black knickers that night. So when we were sitting around for hours, she had her legs spread and bare pussy visible a lot of the time, If he cared to look. 3. She &#039;showed her tattoo&#039; to another male friend. Thigh tattoo &quot;oh yeah I have a tattoo of that&#039;. Pulls up her skirt right cos the tattoo is on her thigh, completely sheer knickers, has her pussy in the face of my friend who politely nods.

When you ask that question, that\u2019s not the question you are asking. I just managed to cadge your address. First I got the name of some corporation, but I didn\u2019t like that. Then I was given the address of your apartment without the number, and eventually the number as well. Now I was satisfied, and of course didn\u2019t write, for I considered the address as something in itself; besides, I was afraid the address might be wrong, for who was Immanuel Kirch? And nothing is sadder than sending a letter to a doubtful address; that\u2019s no letter, it\u2019s more like a sigh. Then, when I discovered that there is an Immanuel Church in your street, all was well again for a while. But in addition to your address I would have liked to have some indication of the compass point, since a Berlin address always has it. I for my part would like to have placed you in the North, although I believe this is a poor district.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But apart from this worry over addresses (in Prague it is not even known whether you live at No. 20 or 30), how much did my wretched letter have to suffer before it was written! Now that the door between us is beginning to move, or at least we are both holding the handle, surely I can, in fact I even must, say it. Oh, the moods I get into, Fr\u00e4ulein Bauer! A hail of nervousness pours down upon me continuously. What I want one minute I don\u2019t want the next. When I have reached the top of the stairs, I still don\u2019t know the state I shall be in when I enter the apartment.</span><br><br>Etc<br><br>Next letter<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But why haven\u2019t you written to me?\u2014It is possible, and from the manner of that letter even probable, that there was something foolish in it that may have disconcerted you, but it is not possible that the good intention behind my every word could have escaped you.\u2014Could a letter have gone astray? But mine was mailed with too great an eagerness for it to have missed its aim, while yours was too eagerly awaited. And do letters really get lost except in the mind of one waiting for them and unable to find another explanation?\u2014Could my letter possibly have been kept from you because of the frowned-upon trip to Palestine? But can this really happen within a family, and to you of all people? And according to my calculations the letter should have arrived on Sunday morning.\u2014So there remains only the sad possibility that you are ill. But this I do not believe. Surely, you are healthy and cheerful.\u2014But then my reason fails me, and I write this letter not so much in the hope of a reply as to discharge a duty toward myself.</span>", "filename": "A9620FE4-929E-4FD6-8450-8DBC5BD92CD9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1029, "h": 1372, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1673206136508675, "time": 1673206136, "md5": "+/cNeb9t47n7fEi55GcoBA==", "fsize": 299001, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "kafkas-letters", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 21498391, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)14:31:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498388</a><br>I don&#039;t remember when /lit/ was ever good", "time": 1673206260, "resto": 21498388}, {"no": 21498393, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)14:32:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "dude simping hard fr fr", "time": 1673206339, "resto": 21498388}, {"no": 21498417, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)14:41:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498393</a><br>He described her in his diary as nice and confident though confused and uninterested in his writing", "time": 1673206860, "resto": 21498388}, {"no": 21499018, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)17:30:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498391</a><br>How are Kafka\u2019s letters not worth /lit/?", "time": 1673217039, "resto": 21498388}, {"no": 21500156, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:58:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ugh, this sounds way too much like things I&#039;ve written.", "time": 1673240300, "resto": 21498388}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21500118, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:47:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Which is the best Taleb book?

Can you elaborate on this?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, first I\u2019ll tell you that when I was quite young I myself was affected by this German jargon. I thought that philosophy wasn\u2019t supposed to be accessible to others, that the circle was closed, and that at all costs one had to employ this scholarly, laborious, complicated terminology. It was only little by little that I understood the impostor side of philosophical language. And I should say that the writer who helped me tremendously in this discovery is Val\u00e9ry. Because Val\u00e9ry, who wasn\u2019t a philosopher but who had a bearing on philosophy all the same, wrote a very pure language, he had a horror of philosophical language. That jargon gives you a sense of superiority over everybody. And philosophical pride is the worst that exists, it\u2019s very contagious. At any rate, the German influence in France was disastrous on that whole level, I find. The French can\u2019t say things simply anymore.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what are the causes?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don\u2019t know. Obviously Sartre, by the enormous influence he had, contributed to generating this mode. And then, it\u2019s the influence of Heidegger, which was very big in France. For example, he\u2019s speaking about death, he employs so complicated a language, to say very simple things, and I well understand how one could be tempted by that style. But the danger of philosophical style is that one loses complete contact with reality. Philosophical language leads to megalomania. One creates an artificial world where one is God. I was very proud being young and very pleased to know this jargon. But my stay in France totally cured me of that. I\u2019m not a philosopher by profession, I\u2019m not a philosopher at all, but my path was the reverse of Sartre\u2019s.

The Logic and Blunden&#039;s introduction was helpful too. But that&#039;s a super dense reading list that is about a whole ton of other stuff. I would just start with the original End of History article.<br><br>Fukuyama&#039;s two volume opus on state development is fantastic, not just for his own theories, but because it very abley sums up 2000 years of theorizing about what makes some states strong and prosperous. It&#039;s a great work but you come away from the second volume wondering if there is something to political decay he is missing. It&#039;s a very political science take, not thinking so much in terms of a grand pattern.<br><br>But can we see a pattern in Argentina&#039;s being one of the very wealthiest countries in the world in the late-1800s, on par with the US, and then its considerable decay? I&#039;d argue the faliure of their liberal system to sublated nationalism and socialism shows the answer. In that case those forces triumphed over liberalism, rather than merging with it and resolving the tension.<br><br>Clashes are either resolved in a synthesis or simply continue on. Jihad vs McWorld and The Clash of Civilizations both have major flaws but kernels of truth too.<br><br>BTW, I do think Fukuyama&#039;s diagnosis of the Last Man problem is spot on. Men in the West today fear becoming bovine consumers more than anything. The whole MRA, pick up artist, manosphere movement, and the chest thumping of various Boog enthusiasts is wonderfully predicted in The End of History. I think Fukuyama under appreciated the threat from the left with disatisfaction over inequality (median US real wages for the bottom 40% would absolutely tank, making people less well off in the decade following his book), but he was right that Last Man Syndrome would come to dominate the right.<br><br>In a way, this is cyclical. You can sew huge parallels between the hunger for war, the idealization of it as some great adventure, the fascination of people with a far off war (Ukraine and Syria), etc. with the influential clique that yearned for a war before 1914. It is similar pressures, the erosion of status, etc. that lead men to chase after wars in spite of the fact that every generation forced to actually fight them ends up overwhelmingly regretting them. There is something ominous in pictures of armed rallies today, in that the median age is probably 55, and obesity rates are probably 70+%.
