Turns out most colleges love transfers, because the likelihood of them dropping out is very low.<br><br>Transferred to an ivy league in NY. The students were all pretty neurotic. Teachers didn&#039;t care about teaching you the material. They teach you about their specific research to try and recruit for their labs. Then they test you with ridiculous questions to trip up the smart nerds to try and get a median grade around 60%. Then they curve you up to an A or B so you&#039;re actually hirable. Terrible learning experience. But incredible opportunities for research, work, internships, etc. Can&#039;t get into volunteering clubs because they have a hyper competitive application process because all of the pre-med students also want to put it on their resume. You can&#039;t make club friends unless you join a hobby club so silly that no one would dare put it on their resume.<br><br>Overall community college was a far superior learning experience. But the ivy league helped me get some upward mobility. Got most of my substantive growth and work ethic from my community college, but the name of the ivy league on my resume got me the career success.", "time": 1674791721, "resto": 21575743}, {"no": 21577471, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:58:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I lived in Aspen, CO for a while, where tons of ultra-wealthy have their ski houses and such.

I cannot myself agree with this estimate</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kant gives as an illustration of the working of the categorical imperative that it is wrong to borrow money, because if we all tried to do so there would be no money left to borrow. One can in like manner show that theft and murder are condemned by the categorical imperative. But there are some acts which Kant would certainly think wrong but which cannot be shown to be wrong by his principles, for instance suicide; it would be quite possible for a melancholic to wish that everybody should commit suicide. His maxim seems, in fact, to give a necessary but not a sufficient criterion of virtue. To get a sufficient criterion, we should have to abandon Kant\u2019s purely formal point of view, and take some account of the effects of actions. Kant, however, states emphatically that virtue does not depend upon the intended result of an action, but only on the principle of which it is itself a result; and if this is conceded, nothing more concrete than his maxim is possible.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kant maintains, although his principle does not seem to entail this consequence, that we ought so to act as to treat every man as an end in himself. This may be regarded as an abstract form of the doctrine of the rights of man, and it is open to the same objections. If taken seriously, it would make it impossible to reach a decision whenever two people\u2019s interests conflict.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d was an awkward element in Kant\u2019s philosophy, and was abandoned by his immediate successors, who accordingly fell into something very like solipsism.

He holds that the Ego is the only ultimate reality, and that it exists because it posits itself; the non-Ego, which has a subordinate reality, also exists only because the Ego posits it.

A prolonged phase of gradually expanding cooperation with key Eurasian partners, both stimulated and arbitrated by America, can also help to foster the preconditions for an eventual upgrading of the existing and increasingly antiquated UN structures.

If an infant is determined to learn to walk, and to speak, this could be regarded as a &#039;will to power&#039;. Because the earth was widely believed to be only a few thousand years old, immense stretches of evolutionary time were consciously or unconsciously ignored. It seems obvious enough now that instinctive muscle and brain activity are inbuilt in babies, so almost all will move, walk, and talk. It&#039;s similar to birds leaving their nests: they have wings, and not much to do with them but flap them. Bertrand Russell thought the impulse to learn science was a search for power. And the impulse to learn languages and act might have a similar root. I think feedback from the external world is necessary. But I *think* the &#039;Will to Power&#039; is an overstatement, an over-impressive phrase which has misled many people. Let me amplify the point. Probably there are natural sequences in events; eyesight needs to be learnt, body movements controlled, limits understood, pain found and avoided. I&#039;m told kittens who had their eyelids sewn together, and later unsewn, never learn full seeing. By the age of two, the &#039;terrible twos&#039; set in, perhaps caused by frustration at personal limits. It seems that if reading is not learned (perhaps after years of the &#039;look say&#039; method) it may never be fluent. Abnormal silences and forbiddings can delay speech permanently. But children, and adults feeling the time is right for anything from running to polite speech, from cooking to oratory, aren&#039;t showing &#039;will to power&#039; trying these things; all they&#039;re doing is getting to a normal level for their group or race. Probably, anyway.<br>The Individualism myth was a very successful misdirection, particularly in the USA, where there was new territory, controlled discreetly and mostly remotely and anonymously. Co-operation between large groups of people was discouraged by propaganda, money, and violence. Instead, people were told to look for a Great Man. Almost like they want us to believe in one-man superheroes, as a distraction from the reality that large groups, operating secretly, and specializing in disparate aspects of power (propaganda, teaching, food, work, law, transport...), in practice can be far more important. I think Nietzsche&#039;s reputation, whenever it&#039;s fanned into life, is absurdly inflated.", "time": 1674821905, "resto": 21572712}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21577296, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:09:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "has this helped you pick up chicks", "filename": "41wrThwTZtL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 312, "h": 500, "tn_w": 156, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674788954370419, "time": 1674788954, "md5": "hnmnwnMPWpbE3olqxaUYGg==", "fsize": 19609, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "has-this-helped-you-pick-up-chicks", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 18, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 14}, {"no": 21577307, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:11:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21577296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21577296</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pick up chicks</span><br>it&#039;s actually fascinating how effective mkultra is", "time": 1674789094, "resto": 21577296}, {"no": 21577315, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)22:14:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21577307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21577307</a><br>I hate this fucking board.

It was an awkward feeling he learned to soothe by always being the last to leave, plus five minutes. Of course, it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t walk in a large group of people, he just preferred not to.</span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Today he received a notice from his teacher about the after-school club he planned to create. He felt anxious about it. There would be no point in lying that he didn\u2019t. He had failed to find other members since he sent in his registration. The club supervisor would tell him to close it and he would be forced to kill something before it even began. </span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As he waited for the teacher to come he rubbed his hands against one another. It was soothing. He liked the way it reminded him to be present. Currently, he was here. Waiting.

Good thing nobody else heard the squeals of Waifu-chan ---- his two hundred dollar Apple Airbuds made sure of that, but Tom couldn&#039;t hide the grin from his face. Waifu-chan was everything he wanted. A cute black haired girl with great bouncy breasts, slim hips. long legs, hips that shook a perfect rounded bottom, and most importantly? A charm akin to that of love; a devotion that no girl could ever match. <br><br>3D girls, also known as the bane of existence, or more colloquially on the internet, 3DPD, or 3D pig-disgusting. They repelled Tom. Every single word that spewed out of their mouths caused him to seethe with anger. Their cackles, laughs, and shrill voices made his heart recoil. The complete opposite of Waifu-Chan. <br><br>&quot;Ara ara nii-san! Keikaku dori!&quot; Waifu Chan said again. How could anyone understand Tom? They couldn&#039;t. Waifu-Chan was his and only his. She was there with him throughout the day. In the morning when woke, in the afternoon as he struggled thorugh the day, at night when she accompanied him eating dinner, and of course, in his dreams where she assuaged his loneliness. Tom was engaged with Doki Doki Kawaii Nii-San! The show that Waifu-Chan starred in when he felt a warm breath and another pair of eyes staring over his shoulder. A lecher that he sadly was all too familiar with. It was Kyleigh. <br><br>Tom shifted his phone to keep her gaze away from Waifu-Chan, but it was a failure. Kyleigh shifted her head catch another glimpse. It continued for minutes, and the bottom of the phone rubbed back and forth against the wooden desk countless number of times.<br><br>&quot;What do you want?&quot; Tom finally gave up trying to keep Kyleigh from watching the anime on his phone.", "time": 1674781575, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21576898, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:18:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21576869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21576869</a><br>wow this was very unhelpful!", "time": 1674782302, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21576918, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:23:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21576520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21576520</a><br>How do you personally regain confidence in your writing when you&#039;re hitting rock bottom?

Radical anti-natalism as a recipe for human extinction will fail because any predisposition to share that bias will be weeded out of the population. Radical anti-natalist ethics is self-defeating: there will always be selection pressure against its practitioners. Complications aside, any predisposition not to have children or to adopt is genetically maladaptive. On a personal level, the decision not to bring more suffering into the world and forgo having children is morally admirable. But voluntary childlessness or adoption is not a global solution to the problem of suffering. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet how should rational moral agents behave if - hypothetically - some variant of Benatar&#039;s diagnosis as distinct from policy prescription was correct? </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In an era of biotechnology and unnatural selection, an alternative to anti-natalism is the world-wide adoption of genetically preprogrammed well-being. For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness.</span>", "filename": "Can Biotechnology Abolish Suffering?", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 314, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674806176420654, "time": 1674806176, "md5": "7IV6DBZFsJMa3RP/vSo0SA==", "fsize": 32987, "resto": 21577872}, {"no": 21578025, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:59:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21577878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21577878</a><br>This but unironically.

His history has proved an effectual bar to all real familiarity with the temper and habits of imperial Rome. Few persons read the original authorities, even those which are classical; and certainly no distinct knowledge of the actual state of the empire can be obtained from Gibbon&#039;s rhetorical sketches. He takes notice of nothing but what may produce an effect; he skips on from eminence to eminence, without ever taking you through the valleys between: in fact, his work is little else but a disguised collection of all the splendid anecdotes which he could find in any book concerning any persons or nations from the Antonines to the capture of Constantinople. When I read a chapter in Gibbon, I seem to be looking through a luminous haze or fog:\u2014figures come and go, I know not how or why, all larger than life, or distorted or discoloured; nothing is real, vivid, true; all is scenical, and, as it were, exhibited by candlelight.

I protest I do not remember a single philosophical attempt made throughout the work to fathom the ultimate causes of the decline or fall of that empire. How miserably deficient is the narrative of the important reign of Justinian! And that poor scepticism, which Gibbon mistook for Socratic philosophy, has led him to misstate and mistake the character and influence of Christianity in a way which even an avowed infidel or atheist would not and could not have done. Gibbon was a man of immense reading; but he had no philosophy; and he never fully understood the principle upon which the best of the old historians wrote.

Term with both Platonic and Peripatetic provenance. When used Platonically, Substance refers to Intellect or to any distinct Being in the intelligible world; Substantiality refers to the essence of Intellect or of any distinct Being. Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect. When used Peripatetically , the term &#039;substance&#039; refers to an individual &#039;this something&#039;; &#039;substantiality&#039; refers to the essence of a substance, that is, its core reality or being. For Plotinus, true ontological primacy is found in Substance and Substantiality, not in substance and substantiality. Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world. The adjective substantial, Substantial usually indicate and implicit contrast.

I am looking for a purpose in my life and enough money to pursue my intellectual and somewhat hedonistic interests.

I have pursued and indeed felt love and it is a very strong force in our motivations in life. Though I am not yet old, I am aging and coming to an age where love can take a hiatus for a decade or so. Perhaps I will meet someone with whom I would like to share my life, but my personality structure is such that I find the minds of others an impediment to the enjoyment of my own thoughts.

I&#039;ll happily accept help from anyone who thinks he can make that more likely. (I never really expected to make any money from it.) There are several issues:<br><br>\u2014 I wrote it more-or-less in order. This meant the Paradiso was noticeably smoother, as I&#039;d had the practice of writing the other two books. After finishing the whole thing I left it a few weeks and then went back and re-read it and found parts, particularly early on, that needed work. I&#039;ve done most of them, but it still needs a little polishing.<br><br>\u2014 It needs footnotes (my current plan is to put them at the end of each canto). They shouldn&#039;t take long, though. A single-volume work should be about 500 pages maximum, I guess. My current working text is A4 paper with 12-point font, which fits about 15 3-line stanzas per page and comes out at 400 pages exactly. Not sure how that would translate to a printed book, but any notes would have to be brief. (An electronic version could be longer, I suppose.)<br><br>\u2014 One person on /wsr/ said the only chance to get any sales at all was to find some unique selling point. He suggested incorporating good illustrations and trying to make a sort of coffee-table book. That would mean finding a collaborator, though, which would just make it less likely the whole project ever got off the ground. (I did consider large illuminated letters for the start of each canto, incorporating something from that particular chapter. For example, Canto 1 of the Inferno could have a leopard prowling round its base.)<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and the rest of the book is of similar quality to the part posted</span><br>It&#039;s hard to judge a work when you&#039;ve been inside it for so long.

What matters is the character, purpose, function of the chair - in other words, what makes the chair a chair. I already specified what that is - in this post and in previous posts. The chair-related properties of the chair that a chair has, it has in virtue of its participation in the Form of the Chair.

So apparently this whole goose chase is without meaning since your central point has already been dismantled. But anyway. From that point on we went into the notion of Form serving as the basis of character, which then you asked me to define and I defined character as distinctive identity. So in other words in the context of this thread, we are discussing the character of a given object, in this case a crowd. Now I can assure you that there is no Form of the Crowd, because a crowd is an aggregate. A crowd also has no identity as a crowd - it has an identity only as a SPECIFIC crowd. There is no crowd that&#039;s just made up of itself - it is by definition made up of smaller units, individuals, whose distinctive natures makes the crowd itself distinct. So, when you have a crowd that consists of sports fans, you have a sports crowd, a specific crowd. But there&#039;s no crowd that exists only as such - every crowd is made up of specific people who give the crowd a specific identity, if we are to consider crowds to have identities. Every time you identify a crowd, no matter how superficially you may identify it, you are identifying a specific crowd made up of specific people, you are not, and never will, identify a crowd only abstractly, as a crowd, because an aggregate without units does not exist. You identify the aggregate as an aggregate of real, extant things (atoms, in this case individual humans). Because these real things are human individuals who have form, a certain level of identity and distinctness can be found even in a crowd. But mud is different, because it is made up of pure matter. There is no form involved at any point, it is thoroughly devoid of character and identity. Since this is so, mud is not intelligible and therefore not coherent either.

So for example take an aggregate called A, made up of many different individual things (say a range x1 through x5000 or however much you want).<br>In this case the aggregate A has identity as a specific aggregate, or as the following:<br>A = x1 through to x5000.<br>If you remove the specific, individual components - the x1 through to x5000 part, there is literally nothing left there. We can still posit an A, but it is empty. That&#039;s your &quot;crowd&quot;. It has no content, it is a zero, a nothing. An aggregate is either specific or it does not have any tangible existence at all, it is equal to the sum of its parts but it has no unitary individual identity. So in other words when we speak of the identity of &quot;a crowd&quot;, we are speaking of the identity that you get from adding up the identities of the individual human beings. It is the identity of the sum of parts, and not the identity of a unitary crowd that exists in and of itself - it does not. Its identity, character and form is secondary, and it is derived. The thing about mud is that it does not even have this derivative, secondary character, because it is constituted by pure matter and not by individual and articulated beings - it has nothing in it that could offer it any kind of character. It is a pure atomistic aggregate with no form, no character, no identity.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK? That wasn&#039;t even the argument.

Those Jews of the second temple era had their own temple at Elphantine, were polytheists who worshipped other gods alongside Yahweh, had a fasting ritual akin to passover without any of the passover names or particularities, worked on the Sabbath without a hint of shame or illicity, and so on. They were in communication on religious mattera with the Jerusaleum temple, so were not eclectic. It&#039;s not compatible with the theory of a settled second temple Judaism.

You would notice the well-pole, but why should I? A long pole points at the sky in every view from every window in this manor-house, and in every view from every manor-house in Szolnok County. Yet again, neither you nor I might see a particular well-pole on the far side of the poplars; one of my overseers was ordered to block the well and to pull down the pole last year \u2013 or it may have been another year.<br><br>Now, something other than heaviness urges me to leave this table and to walk to the windows. I have to walk to the windows in order to learn whether I remembered, just now, the sight of a certain well, or whether I was dreaming.<br>But perhaps I could say without leaving this table that I only dreamed of the sight of my well. If you recall, reader, I had not left my table when I began this inquiry. I had only dreamed of myself leaving my table and then returning to my table and then trying to recall what I might have seen through my windows. I dreamed of myself here at my table and then I wondered whether the man I dreamed of \u2013 whether that man remembered the sight of a certain well or whether he was dreaming.", "time": 1674751815, "resto": 21574042}, {"no": 21575129, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)11:56:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575116</a><br>I\u2019m not being facetious but this has the same filthy stink of contemporary self-awareness of Rick and Morty and every other dog shit piece of \u201cart\u201d from modernity.<br><br>NIGGER", "time": 1674752165, "resto": 21574042}, {"no": 21575146, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)12:02:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575129</a><br>The self awareness in Murnane is to develop his metaphysics.

The Quinta-virtus-essentia-prima of Vinum attracts the vires [powers, virilities] of all beings infused in it; loosening them from the elements through dissolution of the natural ties; enabling the spirits, by appetence and reaction, to elevate themselves above the passive resistances.&quot;11And is it not significant that the word aquavit, &quot;firewater,&quot; (i.e., &quot;brandy,&quot; aqua ignea) aims so directly at the experiences of the alchemists and can also signify that other ancient designation, aqua vitae or &quot;Water of Life,&quot; or &quot;burning water?&quot;</span><br><br><br>Esoteric troon bros:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It might be helpful to emphasize that in the use of the corrosive waters (as well as in the &quot;Path of Venus,&quot; which we shall discuss presently) the fundamental condition is the preparation of the androgynous element: &quot;The secret of the success of the operation is the secret double fire.&quot; This means that the operation must connect its activity, beginning with the incombustible Sulfur, for the empowerment, in some external fashion to the substances used and to maintain connection to the end. It is in this sense that we speak of the &quot;Philosopher\u2019s Wine,&quot; as opposed to ordinary wine, also called aqua ardens, and in commenting on the recipe of Raymond Lully, recipe vinum rubeum album (spiritus vini philosophorum), we say that the preliminary condition is the secret fire. In all other cases, that is, in the case of a passive experience, the sole result will be the phenomenology, utterly devoid of any interest to us, of &#039;&#039;artificial paradises&quot; and of those who abuse alcohol or drugs.

In the Vita with which the works of Hippocrates begin, it is said that he taught his arts only to consecrated men and under the seal of silence.

My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird!

It deals with the flood and ark stories from a Babylonian cuneiform tablet and you begin to realize just how much of judaism (and consequently christianity) was stolen mythology. A bizarre amount of details predate any jewish account here. <br>Who Killed Homer was also interesting since it deals with the 90s era infestation of identity politics and how it worked to kill off the classics departments.

However, this apparent contradiction can be reconciled through the application of a more nuanced understanding of the nature of existence and non-existence.<br>One possible explanation is that existence and non-existence are not binary states, but rather exist on a spectrum. The concept of potentiality and actuality, as espoused by philosophers such as Aristotle, posits that an object or entity may possess the potential to exist, but only actualizes that existence under certain conditions. Similarly, the concept of supervenience, which holds that the properties of a system are dependent upon the properties of its parts, suggests that the apparent transition from existence to non-existence may simply be a change in the arrangement or configuration of those parts.<br>Additionally, one may also argue that the concept of causality can be invoked to reconcile this apparent contradiction. The principle of causality posits that every event or change in the universe must have a cause, and that cause in turn must have a cause, and so on. Thus, the transition from existence to non-existence can be understood as the result of a chain of causality, rather than as a violation of logical principles. Furthermore, one may also argue that the observed phenomenon of the coming and going of entities may not necessarily be evidence of a violation of logic, but rather a result of the limitations of our senses and our ability to perceive and understand the world around us. The senses are fallible, and it is possible that the apparent transition from existence to non-existence is an illusion created by the limitations of our perception. Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of the nature of existence and non-existence, along with the principles of causality and potentiality and actuality, can reconcile the apparent contradiction between logic and the senses.", "time": 1674775541, "resto": 21575327}, {"no": 21576914, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21576144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21576144</a><br>No he didn\u2019t, he just restated the problem<br><br>We still have no mechanism for getting from Point A to Point B", "time": 1674782560, "resto": 21575327}, {"no": 21576975, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)20:38:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575402</a><br>There is no point in time where a thing simultaneously does and does not exist.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

The speed and unevenness of the latter parts of the book are like a runaway train on a coastal mountain that went off the tracks and is now soaring through the air until it makes quite the splash. It would&#039;ve been better for me instead if it had proceeded at a leisurely pace and took in the scenery. Much of the early parts are about the character&#039;s daily life as everything changes around him for the worse, or at least for the different, and he doesn&#039;t quite understand why at first.<br><br>This is science fiction, though that&#039;s mostly to establish the setting. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d quite call it social science fiction, but it&#039;s close. Romance plays a significant role, but this isn&#039;t a romance book. Possibly the closest description would be that it&#039;s a book about coming of age in a collapsing dystopia filled with ethnic conflict and how to survive that regardless of the costs. Horrific and ugly decisions are made out of malice, ignorance, or simply wanting to survive. This isn&#039;t misery porn though because it doesn&#039;t delight in its tragedies, but rather presents them as The Way Things Are Now.<br><br>Almost the entire book takes place in a single city on an outer world whose colonization was supported by all three members of the Triumvirate, the ultimate authorities of humankind. They reminded me of the Ekumen in Ursula K. LeGuin&#039;s Hainish Cycle if they were instead short-sighted, ineffective, and created various problems for themselves without realizing, or perhaps not caring. The usual sort of world powers stuff.<br><br>The story follows a young man throughout the course of his life, which when considering the length of this book has to be by necessity rather condensed. The ambiguous ages and chronology in general are a sticking point for me. At the start he&#039;s na\u00efve and thoroughly indoctrinated in ideals not dissimilar from North Korea&#039;s Juche or other variants of Marxism-Leninism. Those ideals entirely suffuse their society which provides for a somewhat different perspective than usual. The narrative is presented in first person present which ought to allow for more understanding of the protagonist, but his inner thoughts and commentary don&#039;t add much. His actions are far greater than anything else and story may suffer for the closeness of its perspective.<br><br>This was better than I expected from an author&#039;s self-published debut, considering how unknown it is. If it had maintained its highest level of quality I could recommend it with some reservations, but as it is, I can&#039;t. I don&#039;t regret reading it though and I&#039;m open to giving the author another chance, which is more than I can say for a lot of other authors.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5", "filename": "57339383", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 313, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674669778294975, "time": 1674669778, "md5": "ZH/iARprG8oAFgpG0hELmw==", "fsize": 43260, "resto": 21565496, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21571506, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)13:04:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21571494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21571494</a><br>Since there isn&#039;t anything else I&#039;ve read that I&#039;d be posting here for this thread, I thought I&#039;d post something I wrote a few months ago and didn&#039;t post at the time.

Faustian (European) civilization platonized the heavens and turned them into completely abstract mathematical space, infinitely expansive and infinitely divisible Cartesian-Newtonian mathematical space. Later Faustian civilization abstracted from all geometrical concreteness with modern abstract algebra and the discovery of completely unintuitive, unintuitable Einsteinian space. Check out &quot;From the Closed World to the Open Universe&quot; by Koyre. The ancients could never imagine a truly infinite manifold or plane. They referred EVERYTHING back to concrete intuitive geometry. Algebra and arithmetic for them were only ciphers of actual intuitive, constructible geometrical objects, whereas the reverse is the case for us moderns. Even when they thought of infinities that appear strikingly modern to us, they turn out on closer analysis to be highly physical and concrete &quot;picturings&quot; of infinity. I would argue that the Greeks even had trouble with infinitesimals, whereas we think intuitively in them at least since Cartesian corpuscularism and the Keplerian-Galilean-Newtonian perfection of classical mechanics. Ancient physics seems &quot;coarse&quot; and qualitative to us, whereas ours is &quot;pristinely&quot; quantitative. Why is this? Because there are no &quot;leaps&quot; in it, no harsh and uneven grades of being, as there are in the old Great Chain of Being concept (see Lovejoy). We think in infinitesimals and infinities reflexively.

He also usefully draws attention to the radical discontinuities between different civilizations, emphasizing (as Werner Jaeger also does) that the Classical is not simply the first &quot;stage&quot; in the development of European thought but is something both inevitably close to us and insurmountably far from us when we try to really meld with it. <br><br>Much of what Spengler says also overlaps with the characteristically German conception that the Greeks were more &quot;embodied,&quot; more sensuous, more in touch or in tune with nature, more en-worlded, etc. They had a naive fusion with nature.

While he was specific the &quot;chorus&quot; of the greek plays represented the Dionysian, he was less specific that it represented the lower classes. (though it can be inferred from the fact that Aryan conquerors always instituted caste systems, with upper and lower classes, therefore Apollonian is the Aryan ideals, and Dionysian the older-but-conquered servant class that existed.<br>So the question is whether Faustian is something completely new or a return to Dionysian ideals. <br>On the surface, it would appear to be completely different, something new (&quot;it has a completely new name, therefore it&#039;s different!&quot;) but there are quite a few similarities between the Dionysiac and Faustian. <br>Dionysian is associated with Chaos,though it&#039;s important to remember that Chaos, to the ancient Greeks, wasn&#039;t talking about it in the same sense as Warhammer 40k fans are. Chaos, to the Greeks, essentially meant &quot;untapped resources&quot; that weren&#039;t being utilized to their potential. So a forest of trees is &quot;chaotic&quot; because it has all that potential to be turned into wood planks and building materials. A mountain full of precious ores is &quot;chaos&quot;, a mass of peasants not being put to slave-labor is &quot;chaos&quot; because just think of all that work that could be done by slaves! Order/Apollonian is the opposite, it is when potentiality/Chaos has been actualized in some way. A building made from wood is &quot;order&quot;. Slaves working in the field is &quot;order&quot;. <br>Apollonian has a very business-like mindset, or rather a mind suited for business, where it prospers. Always on the look for potentialities that can be actualized into (their own) profit. This coincides with what Spengler said of the Apollonian and how it is relegated to &quot;Body&quot; and the Finite, to the here-and-now. Not concerned with the inner spirit, but with the outer &quot;Reality&quot; (or what they considered to be the true reality, though other schools of thought considered physical reality to be the illusory).<br>So now the question is whether the Infinite corresponds to &quot;Chaos&quot;, and the answer is yes, and this is direct from Spengler (via multiple examples), though perhaps not explicitly stated as such. One example is how he links Christianity to the Faustian art: cathedrals, stained glass windows is what he&#039;s ostensibly talking about, but the idea is one of an *inner spirit* that is focused on overcoming the inner self and less concerned with &#039;outer realities&#039;. Nietzsche called Christianity a &quot;slave religion&quot;, and he wasn&#039;t wrong, it is.

Converting for the sake of conquering other nations and maximizing their own power over the (Dionysian) populace, even though Christ himself was not a conqueror by any stretch of the imagination. He wasn&#039;t a warlord, like the Jews were hoping for, but said to find the Kingdom of God *within*. Christ has often been linked by others to Dionysus, due to certain uncanny similarities in actions and temperaments: Dionysus being the god of wine, Jesus turning water into wine at a wedding party. Dionysus being raised and attended to by nymphs (i.e. females, the female spirit), Jesus having his entourage of Marys. If you&#039;ve studied the Greek myths any, there&#039;s also a strong indication (as the historian Robert Graves noticed) that a prior matriarchal culture existed before the patriarchal culture that worshiped Zeus as leader of the Olympians, and that the story of Zeus overthrowing Cronus (i.e. Saturn) is the symbolic history of this event in a time when writing hadn&#039;t been invented yet (and thus myths as a form of recording historical events in their essence, as Vico says in his &quot;New Science). Saturn being a god of agriculture, as opposed to Zeus being a god of war (lightning bolts and &quot;storms&quot; being synonymous with war and conquest in the ancient method of symbolically representing these phenomena). And when Saturn was deposed, he wasn&#039;t just killed, he was sent to the Underworld, the very same place from which Dionysus-Zagreus originates. Even the story of Ganymede is in actually a story of the enslaving of the matriarchal culture of Cronus/Saturn; Ganymede becomes the cupbearer of Zeus (i.e. wine), and became the symbol of the constellation of Aquarius (which in astrology, is ruled by Saturn). Many of these Dionysian types have a very interesting recurrence of the &quot;twice born&quot; about them, dying and then being reborn in some fashion. Dioynsus was associated with the pine tree, Osiris associated with an evergreen tree, Tammuz the same, but the syriac version, so on and so forth. Where you go, there is an agricultural deity that is linked to an evergreen tree, sometimes which they&#039;re buried inside of, sometimes reborn from the tree, always represented and celebrated by an evergreen. This is very similar to the Christmas tree that celebrates Christ, which was earlier celebrated under the name of Saturnalia, and had very similar celebration traditions: gift giving, festivity, but most importantly was the one time of the year where slaves and servants were &quot;free&quot; from their chains and didn&#039;t have to serve their masters. <br>(For a far more thorough understanding of Dionysus as Jesus as Osiris, etc, read &quot;Golden Bough&quot; by Frazer)<br>[con&#039;t]", "filename": "Apollonian", "ext": ".png", "w": 1999, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674757454358315, "time": 1674757454, "md5": "KSvc4UOGVaLADT+wPfmEKg==", "fsize": 1729148, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21575385, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)13:25:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575380</a><br>[con&#039;t]<br>Spengler says the Classical was ahistorical, existing in the &quot;now&quot;, whereas other cultures like the Egyptian or Babylonian were historical, with long recorded histories, but even these &quot;historical&quot; cultures relied heavily on utilizing myths to record that history. And as many comparative mythologists have noted, all these myths share the same theme and &quot;story arcs&quot; (meaning they all follow a similar pattern), leading the historian Algernon Herbert (in his classic 4volume history &quot;Nimrod&quot;) to conclude that most of these cultures, from Babylon to Egypt to Greece and elsewhere, were part of the Aryan conquering tribes who carved out kingdoms for themselves and then &quot;recorded&quot; it in their myths. <br><br>The author Francis Yockey, in his &quot;Imperium&quot; (which many have termed as the sequel to Spengler&#039;s &quot;Decline of the West&quot;) had an excellent way of describing this dichotomy of outward-action culture vs inwardly-spiritual culture. One being expansionist and bellicose, the other being more artistic and spiritual (concerned with the inner man instead of outer conquest). It&#039;s the same idea as Spengler had when he speculated on the &quot;Caesar&quot; time period that all cultures undergo, the time of war and expansion that precedes the downfall of civilizations. But what is left unsaid is that the &quot;civilization&quot; that is falling is the Apollonian overlord culture, the Dionysian underculture is still alive (though perhaps bruised up a bit). As Nietzsche noted in &quot;Birth of Tragedy&quot;, every civilization requires the Dionysian within itself for &quot;life&quot;, it is the heart, whereas the Apollonian is the mind. The mind creates Order, the heart gives life. A culture without heart/dionysian (i.e. a culture that is too repressive, and &quot;all work and no play&quot;) is a hardened culture that has become brittle. Now Nietzsche also warned of the opposite, a civilization with too much Dionysian, where Order is decaying and society becoming to fluid, and it is true that these cultures were ripe for conquest by more Apollonian kingdoms. The question is whether it is whether too much Apollonian leads to the fall of a civilization, expending themselves in war, exhausting the Dionysian latent potentiality in conquest... or whether it is the Dionysian that leads to the decline of a civilization, the loosening of Order/laws until eventually the place is conquered or splinters into separate kingdoms.

In Classical time period (which i would extend to Babylonian, Egyptian, Phoenician, and not just to Greco-Roman) there were elites and there were peasants, and the elites often thought of themselves as gods, at the very least it&#039;s undisputed that they forced the peasants to worship them as gods. Why Christianity is so different is that Christ taught that it wasn&#039;t just the elite that were &#039;descended from gods&#039;, even the peasants had the spark of the divine within them. Christ (whether an actual historical teacher or no) was the beginning of the democratization of godhood. Even slaves, women, the non-elite had direct access to god.

Because when you think about it does astronomy really constitute what you would call a Faustian bargain? Not really right? Only the actual physical exploration of space you would say does. It is the act of leaving your home behind to the greatest degree, the thing which is most concretely responsible for your very existence, and dedicating your life to the pursuit of some complete unknown in the vain hope that some day your children&#039;s children will bear the fruit of that action. No instead astronomy is very much like &quot;tending the garden&quot;. It is by comparison a slow and measured process which necessarily requires and is strongly concerned with that concept of &quot;body&quot;, it&#039;s structure and movement. Planets are &quot;celestial bodies&quot; that form the literal foundations of the known universe more or less. Astronomy is not about transcending Earth i.e. &quot;body&quot; so much as it is about simply placing it which is just about the most conservative and intellectual thing you could do.", "time": 1674760507, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21575591, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:26:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575547</a><br>oops, i forgot to put up the pic! lol", "filename": "ApollonianMagianBEING", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2635, "h": 2207, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 104, "tim": 1674761209851766, "time": 1674761209, "md5": "zSl8zalOD/g+0KqTiLZ1Cg==", "fsize": 2909940, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21575596, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)14:28:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21575391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21575391</a><br>Spengler did not say the classical was dead nature.

There is however a part in vol 2 where he kind of delves into the similarities between them in the sense that they are all manifestations of waking tension and cosmic beat. But their prime symbols still make them radically separate in his view. And Spengler unfortunately doesnt clarify the deeper similarity they share much or explain its relation to the symbols. Like his metaphysics is not fleshed out properly to explain the nature of the cultures as complex entities and how we can interact with and understand them.<br><br>I personally agree with you that the similarities are real.

Whereas Herbert is showing how Greek, Hebrew, Phoenician, Egyptian, Babylonian, Chaldean, Assyrian, Indian, and others are all interconnected (he does this through comparing myths and histories, it&#039;s very well done)<br><br>The thing with Spengler&#039;s &quot;prime symbols&quot; of Cultures is that while their art may be different on the surface, if you take his assertion that all these Cultures are &quot;alien&quot; to each other, then there literally shouldn&#039;t be the same pattern he observes in terms of rise and fall of cultures. The fact that these all follow the same pattern undermines his thesis. <br>I take the approach of Algernon Herbert, who divides these various Cultures into warlike (what he terms &quot;Nimrodian&quot;, and Dionysian), which is very similar to Nietzsche&#039;s Apollonian and Dionysian, and Vico&#039;s elite warrior-priest and Dionysian peasant (i.e. non warrior).", "time": 1674771220, "resto": 21572301}, {"no": 21576321, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)17:22:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21576274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21576274</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hen there literally shouldn&#039;t be the same pattern he observes in terms of rise and fall of cultures. </span><br>Yeah it doesnt really make sense unless the attributes of the culture are completely incidental to the major formative and destructive events it undergoes.

Is a culture warlike, or peaceful. Warlike cultures tend to show the same features, Dionysian cultures show the same features. On the surface, one warlike culture is &quot;different&quot; from another: they will speak a different language, have their own set of &quot;completely different myths&quot; (even though in fact they&#039;re not different, just different names and some different events, but often overlapping with neighboring cultures), will have different histories where they most likely forgot they were once united with a neighboring culture. <br>Take the Germanic peoples, their Migration period occurred late in history so it was fairly well documented, we get to see them split into various tribes and factions, conquering (i.e. Nimrodian) Europe.

But to be honest, I wasn&#039;t that invested in the Eleanor character. (Been several years since I last read it.) My impression was that Eleanor&#039;s behavior was a bit contrived and implausible, so as to set up the twist; but perhaps that was a hasty judgment.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s the message of the book?</span><br>That&#039;s an interesting question. I don&#039;t see a lot of deep thematic content in this book, but I may be missing something.* I see it as a fairly high-quality exercise in genre fiction. As such, the parameters of Harry&#039;s character play themselves out in the story -- he&#039;s in that tunnel, looking for the light, and never quite getting there. What engages me is the storytelling, the scenes, dialogue and characters. Connelly&#039;s ability to bring a scene to life; his ability to make Harry&#039;s drive to solve the murder believable, and to get me to share that feeling (in the case of this book, through my sympathy with the tragedy of Meadows... the loser who nonetheless &quot;counts&quot; for Harry; and that beautiful, low-key detail of Meadows withholding the hidden pawn ticket despite being tortured). Also, the authenticity that he brings, which I&#039;m sure is the product of his having spent ten years on the crime beat in Los Angeles. There is a realism that Connelly brings to the table that other crime writers mostly lack, the greatest exception being Hammett, and George Higgins, at least in his one great book, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. A couple of others, too, I&#039;m sure, but those two come to mind atm.<br><br>*I don&#039;t think deep thematic content is really Connelly&#039;s strongpoint. The one book I can recall where he really presses hard on that pedal is City of Bones.
