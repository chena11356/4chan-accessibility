An authentic spirit leads to an authentic tradition (The Church Fathers, Theravada), an inauthentic spirit leads to an inauthentic tradition (Mahayana intellectualism, Protestant rationalism and sola scriptura).

Fundamentally, if the Buddha laid down two versions while saying that sect split is a terrible thing, then he is not the person I believed him to be and my conviction is misplaced.<br>The thing that bothers me is that since a main part of the teaching preserves fully in those later traditions, specifically the aides to awakening, there is enough authentic material in the later traditions to fully follow the path, so there should be arahants. Why didn&#039;t they, after directly experiencing and all that, go forth and cut out the material that is grossly inauthentic? <br>Maybe it&#039;s an issue of the later writing being &quot;part of the dhamma&quot; but not, perhaps, the Buddha&#039;s. There are a few dodgy texts in the oldest canon as well and the criteria for adding them is that they are fitting with the teaching.<br>But what you say means that accepting the Mahayana and later texts throws doubt in the Buddha&#039;s character and that is completely out of tune with the teaching as I understand them.<br>Don&#039;t know, the fact the flowery language is such an obvious tell bothers me - how come in a tradition all about speaking the truth and self-seeking those obvious tells remained?", "time": 1676461917, "resto": 21652856}, {"no": 21661583, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:57:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21660990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21660990</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mahayanists say explicitly that the teaching of the suttas are lies and that the buddha only taught the real teaching only in secret and only to the mahayanists.</span><br>This is an extension of the original problem I just mentioned\u2014the sutta pitaka has sermons and directives on the same issues presented differently to different audiences\u2014and sometimes these audiences are, even in the suttas, made up of gods in various heavens. So Mahayana is going to do the same thing, with the caveat that the new teachings were necessarily given to an even more specific audience so they aren&#039;t new per se but just new to you, but because, as I am sure you know, it is a competiting alternative of more newly written works, the authors are going to also attribute co-authorship or total authorship to some bodhisattva, such as Maitreya, who would have thus heard this sutra in heaven. Now to modern ears that probably sounds stupid but the same could be said of suttas where the Buddha is debating Brahm\u0101 in heaven in the nikayas\u2014did THAT happen or is this a case of something written to compete religiously with the brahminical faith that was stronger and older in India than Buddhism was? Again, I would still say we ought to look to what we find most effective rather than what is oldest and not limit ourselves to certain materials over others without having considered them\u2014which is something Mahayana self-advises against due to the competitive nature of the environment that produced these texts, but we are outside that environment to a great extent and can and should approach the materials, again, in the way most useful to us.<br><a href=\"#p21661017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661017</a><br>It&#039;s a compressed and hostile criticism of Mahayanist esoterical revelation to say the above explanation means &quot;Buddha was lying&quot; but what can you do some people think replicating Asian sectarianisms is the point of studying Buddhism", "time": 1676462222, "resto": 21652856}, {"no": 21661593, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:01:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661528</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can write your own sutra today and claim it to be the ultimate teaching (this time is for real, guys!).</span><br>And that&#039;s a good thing.

I&#039;m living in another city, away from all of my previous friends and I&#039;m building new social circles there. It took some time (about 5 months) but I&#039;m seeing some fruition so I came to leave an update there. I have 3 distinct friend circles in my new city, which are made of about 4 people each. One of those circles is never gonna cross the others, including my old city friend circles as my personality is radically different with them. I&#039;m also keeping that social circle private because I&#039;m flirting with a woman I don&#039;t want anyone to meet inside as I&#039;m fucking tired of women destroying my buddies groups. <br><br>The end goal is to have different lives I can swap whenever I get bored and, if I can manage to, different women I can meet and spend time with. I will stay celibate to make sure peace is respected in those friend groups. My next move is to solidify my current social circles as much as I can then unlock another flirt. It&#039;s funny to write but the hardest part in all of this is to make sure no one in a given isolated social circles is aware of other social circles and keep the secret to my grave.

As for the disease, it&#039;s not going to result in a guaranteed death after a certain amount of time, but it does mean that I will slowly lose function in my organs and my cognitive ability will decline dramatically. I am also going deaf and blind at this moment. Not sure how far these will go, but it&#039;s gotten pretty bad.

I am grateful to all the people that showed me kindness. I am grateful to God that things were not worse than they were. I lived my life horribly and squandered everything that I had been given. I did things that were beyond retarded, and the parties involved showed me mercy.<br>My political beliefs were held with conviction. I do not recant them even now. I don&#039;t hate anyone, and I do feel guilty that, despite as much as I care about many black folks, jews and such, the factual reality prevents me from dying at peace with the political situation. I do not hate anyone, even those that have wronged me.<br>As for the system, despite the fact that the system itself is evil, I do not hate the people that partake in it. I also don&#039;t hate the system because it had wronged me: I have been afforded many undeserved privileges over my lifetime. I hate the system because it is evil, and it enables evil, and it does evil.<br>I will not be killing myself on a specific day, but I will be getting a DNR order shortly. I plan to, after that, escape and let myself die naturally. I may commit suicide, or I may not. I am done with the suicide games, the attempt, hospitalization, lying, release, attempt, repeat. I want to let go. I can&#039;t keep going even though I am open to it because, to use the popular idiom, the walls are closing in on me.

A strongly opinionated person is precisely someone who knows the least on a given subject. It is a compensation. To me, these opinionated people are not to be trusted. How little any of us actually knows about the world. How far it is that what any of us REALLY have is an objective, dispassionate, yet somehow fervent opinion of the world. There is always a personal motivation. An opinion, especially a political one, is always a form of vengeance, of putting a certain group of people &quot;in their place&quot;, as a correction for some deeply held grievance. This is why the opinionated person must always force his view on others: the raison d&#039;etre of the opinion is to change the perception of reality or of himself in the eyes of others, not to evaluate. A man who is opinionated but silent is redundant.<br><br>I&#039;m reminded of being at a bar with a young man who was hell-bent on turning the conversation toward the fact that all women are whores. He clearly had no methodology for his conclusions, but he was only expressing whatever in that moment made him feel vindicated in his scorn for women. He would have loudly agreed with any comment made about women in that moment so long as it was negative. Clearly, if he could convince himself and others that all women are indeed whores, then he is innocent of his own failures that led him to that sad position.<br><br>The opinionated person is always confessing something about himself. Narcissists are very telling in this regard. The narcissist is someone who is always ill-at-ease, and whom seeks to compensate his feelings of inadequacy by aggressively asserting some form of trashing others. In this way, all harshly negative opinions are narcissistic because they seek selfish ends: to level the playing field and reassert a dominant or &quot;knowing&quot; position which conveniently always privileges the person speaking.", "time": 1676344714, "resto": 21654236}, {"no": 21656005, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)22:24:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655989</a><br>You seem quite opinionated about this.

I would worry less about some of the things the other anon mentioned, like your scholarly contribution, since scholarship is mostly dead and terrible now. I mean, care about that stuff if you want, but know what the stakes are before you wade in. Definitely don&#039;t expect grad school to be some life of the mind shit. Maybe it will be for you, maybe you have one of the few remaining fields where people are still cool and things are small enough that it isn&#039;t 70% taken over by racial grievance studies. But maybe not. That&#039;s where you have to do your due diligence and figure it out.<br><br>Once you know what you want and what the odds of getting it are, you can decide. For example if you know you could get a free ride at Princeton and have literally 6 years to finish a book project you intended to finish anyway, and scraping to meet the other statistical anomaly autistic people you want to be friends with, and you don&#039;t mind then being a 30+ year old English PhD applying for $60k/yr jobs at libraries, and you don&#039;t mind that most of your peers on the way there are likely to be very rich very &quot;gay acting&quot; people and hypersocial office women or that all of them will be studying colonialism and transgender Shakespeare, then maybe it&#039;s good for you.

One thing I recommend contemplating is that when you&#039;re 35, if you&#039;re a decent honest person anyway, nothing really matters anymore except having money to live and a lifestyle you identify with. At 21 it&#039;s easy to think having a PhD is objectively important or objectively meaningful but just like how you don&#039;t think of your SATs after you graduate your BA, you probably won&#039;t think of your PhD once you&#039;re just some guy with a PhD. But there is another kind of person who really really identifies with having a PhD. You can find them on Twitter, telling you and everyone that they have a PhD.

A billionaire cryptocurrency exchange owner has died and now everyone is scrambling to best position themselves before a complete collapse of several cryptocurrencies. Those involved will do whatever it takes to remain profitable. The wealthier they are, the more badly they behave. In a world where people don&#039;t die when they&#039;re killed, murder comes easy, and torture is routine. If you&#039;re looking for a relatively short and simple noir-like story with a neat gimmick that takes place in Chicagoland of Current Year, then you could do worse than this.<br><br>This book brings in contemporary events and their effects, such as the pandemic, and pop culture. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s me, but when I see brands used like how they are here I can&#039;t help but wonder if they were intended to be casual mentions or native advertising. If it&#039;s the latter, it doesn&#039;t detract from my experience other than being distracting in that it makes me pause to consider advertising in books in general. I don&#039;t mind pop culture if it&#039;s contextually appropriate, which it is here. <br><br>I continue to think that the premise of the series, that 99.9% of the time people respawn when they&#039;re killed could be used in so many more ways than it is. I keep hoping that the next installment will do something more with it, and I keep being disappointed. As it is, this is a mediocre series with a gimmick that doesn&#039;t fulfill its potential in almost any way. It&#039;s annoying because Scalzi has better explored speculative ideas in his other near future works. For those who aren&#039;t hung up on this idea like I am, it&#039;s probably a better read.<br><br>I&#039;ve tried both listening to and reading a few audiobook originals now. My current belief is that they are more suited to be listened to rather than read because of how they were written. It&#039;s somewhat like how podcast scripts are meant to be listened to rather than read, as reading them would almost surely be a lesser experience. It can be done, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be what was intended. The audiobook is already out, so you&#039;re interested in this, I recommend getting that rather than waiting for a physical copy, but maybe you want both for whatever reason. That&#039;s something people do apparently.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5<br><br>I received this advance reading/review copy (ARC) from Subterranean Press through NetGalley.

Both Yogacara and Madhyamaka are going to agree that dharmas in the sense of entities are without an intrinsic identity, but again the debate becomes how to present that emptiness\u2014is it just the quieting of all possible assertions of this or that, or some sort of purified mind that lacks all those assertions.

He takes notice of nothing but what may produce an effect; he skips on from eminence to eminence, without ever taking you through the valleys between: in fact, his work is little else but a disguised collection of all the splendid anecdotes which he could find in any book concerning any persons or nations from the Antonines to the capture of Constantinople. When I read a chapter in Gibbon, I seem to be looking through a luminous haze or fog:\u2014figures come and go, I know not how or why, all larger than life, or distorted or discoloured; nothing is real, vivid, true; all is scenical, and, as it were, exhibited by candlelight. And then to call it a History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire!</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Was there ever a greater misnomer? I protest I do not remember a single philosophical attempt made throughout the work to fathom the ultimate causes of the decline or fall of that empire. How miserably deficient is the narrative of the important reign of Justinian! And that poor scepticism, which Gibbon mistook for Socratic philosophy, has led him to misstate and mistake the character and influence of Christianity in a way which even an avowed infidel or atheist would not and could not have done. Gibbon was a man of immense reading; but he had no philosophy; and he never fully understood the principle upon which the best of the old historians wrote. He attempted to imitate their artificial construction of the whole work\u2014their dramatic ordonnance of the parts\u2014without seeing that their histories were intended more as documents illustrative of the truths of political philosophy than as mere chronicles of events.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The true key to the declension of the Roman empire\u2014which is not to be found in all Gibbon&#039;s immense work\u2014may be stated in two words:\u2014the imperial character overlaying, and finally destroying, the national character. Rome under Trajan was an empire without a nation.</span>", "time": 1676462104, "resto": 21658559}, {"no": 21661675, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)07:30:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661581</a><br>good description", "time": 1676464200, "resto": 21658559}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21658171, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)12:46:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why do Christians seem to misunderstand him at every turn?

Ultimately, the deficiency lies with Nietzsche, because he is unable to extend his critique beyond a sociological one targeting the particular Protestant type of the Christian religion prevalent in the Germany of his day whose decaying effects he was witnessing and wanted to strike out against to a critique of Christ as he is presented in the gospels.

Hence what we Nietzsche trying to tell us is that Christianity has become increasingly unbelievable (for Europeans) and in order to evaluate going forward, for those who are leaving this system behind, it is necessary to investigate everything this system has touched in order to make a break from the nihilism and enfeebled morality baked into it.

You seem confused here, making reference to &quot;non-hagiographic&quot; interpretations and the &quot;same belief system&quot; as though we were discussing Thomism or some metaphysical debacle as opposed to events rooted in space and time. Without indulging in vain psychological speculations- which abound in The Antichrist- it is obvious that the figure of Christ existing was unbelievable for Nietzsche precisely because it was so drastically opposed to his core assumptions about the world, as evidenced by his attempt at some alternative reading of the gospels based purely on a highly contentious psychological model. Why should I take anything he says about resentiment and a retrospective malignant misreading by Jesus&#039;s disciples seriously when this is derived solely from the aforementioned personal bias and the cultural assumption of his time that the Christian story had absolutely no basis in reality? Understanding this cultural assumption of its dubious historicity probably helps us make sense of the inclusion of the interpretation of Jesus as a figure free from resentiment in The Antichrist: precisely because Nietzsche considered the idea of Jesus being remotely like the gospels said so unlikely (I think in On the Origins of Early Christianity by Friedrich Engels, the author just takes it for granted that the gospels were a Roman invention in around 300AD) he saw no problem with what is ultimately a poetic interpretation of Jesus in line with what can quite broadly be termed his philosophical project. Basically, what I&#039;m trying to say is, Nietzsche&#039;s critique of Christ fails because it acts on the basis that the Jesus of Christianity simply could not have been real; it engages with him as though he is a metaphysical principle to be disputed as opposed to a historical fact existing within time. Engaging in a philosophical critique of the consequences of a spiritually dead and neutered Christianity is fine, but Nietzsche cannot make any claim to doing anything beyond that, especially since most of his dislike of Christianity seems to stem from a philosophical misunderstanding of it as a form of Gnosticism / Platonism largely informed by the type of Protestantism he was brought with. He simply does not understand early Christian or even medieval theology well enough if at all to be able to claim that it suffers from the problems he diagnoses the whole religious tradition with, and his genealogical critique again relies on a denial of the reality of Christ and his love, focusing instead on his church and the way it uses the talk of peace to obscure its violent ends. But, as a writer like G K Chesterton correctly asserts, the problem is that Christianity has not yet been tried; the church is vindicated by virtue of the violence of the world, not vice versa.", "time": 1676411917, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660284, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:04:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br>Cause his fucking mustache keeps muffling his words.", "time": 1676430270, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660294, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659122</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche&#039;s critique of Christ fails because it acts on the basis that the Jesus of Christianity simply could not have been real</span><br>Ok so as per usual Christians think Nietzsche is wrong because he isn&#039;t Christian.", "time": 1676430376, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660329, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:17:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659122</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the problem is that Christianity has not yet been tried</span><br>almost missed this\u2014you guys really are the mothers of bolshevism aren&#039;t you?", "time": 1676431026, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660371, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;generalist</span><br>You didn&#039;t understand him either, midwit.", "time": 1676431602, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660904, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br>Maybe because Nietzsche was an atheist?

As some ideas come fully formed while others take weeks of writing and editing. For example the Living Room poem was entirely rewritten three times over as i was struggling with getting the most out of the Burns Stanza, with the Word document spanning something over 100 pages \u2014 though most of it is just copy pasting with minor alternations. Other poems i&#039;ve written in a day.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) do you write from life or from your imagination?</span><br>Both. Whoever I like the quotidian, diary format where, even if not exactly accurate, the poems stand as impressions of the various goings on around me. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) do you make up stanzas or copy them from elsewhere?</span><br>Again, both. I have however copied a lot of stanzas from the likes of Hardy and Auden. I also read a lot of the Minor, and more experimental, 20&#039;th century poets. Looking at bad or even incomplete or abandoned poems can give you a sense what it is the author did wrong. Hardy is excellent for that, as he wrote a lot and not all of it successful. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) do you have any training, such as private schooling ?</span><br>Sorry, thats more then im willing to reveal at the moment. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 5) what poets do you recommend for an aspiring poet?</span><br><br>I can absolutely throw some names at you, but keep in mind this is something you need to discover for yourself.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual life, all that is foreign to that order.

He didn&#039;t know enough about what he was talking about. To cut a long story short, he became a Christian when he realised one night his situation could not get any worse if he just prayed to Jesus. He was already a prisoner.

This is also how I make songs to myself when I am walking probably to the annoyance of my roommate. I greatly enjoy making clicking noises inside my mouth when I am walking or standing idly. I am a white person descended from catholics, Protestants and atheists who happen to be non-believers. My mother would say I am borderline agnostic. I used to think like that but I\u2019ve accepted the truth and wisdom of my fellow polytheists and generally, of all people who aren\u2019t evil. My home computer is sickly. It is an x86, which means it has no capability for really doing anything other than changing a few kilobytes of data in memory, and even it can make clicking sounds when it runs. As a result of this random clicking, my fingers do strange things, and the Windows 7 startup chime made it very difficult to develop a standard non-clicking idle tone for myself, but set off a bit of a social revolution in my house and drove most of my roommate\u2019s snarky friends away. What used to go off is instead replaced by this cheerful little Celtic jig in click tones, which is about as far away from a traditional \u201cwind up\u201d chime as a twenty-four-year-old can get. To our polytheistic ancestors, a click was the sound of fire as it lit up to consume an oak log or a timber (or dried animal flesh, like the sheepskin cloaks of The Age of Legends). Their computers are just as impotent as ours. I have never once burned a log or a tree in my life, although I have played spectator to that old ritual many a time. My computer, too, will always be just as impotent as its ancestors rituals were, re: summoning non-virtual forms of success or happiness. But I will carry on the old tradition of clicking and clacking to myself, in the middle of the night when I am walking to keep me awake. That clicking seems to be a way of holding on to all that is good about humanity.", "time": 1676456385, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661483, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:58:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655399</a><br>They have the least sexual dimorphism among races", "time": 1676458697, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661511, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:17:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;races</span><br>reactionnary pseudoscience", "time": 1676459844, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661527, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:26:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661511</a><br>Yeah that&#039;s why you can&#039;t do a bone marrow transplant outside your race.", "time": 1676460397, "resto": 21653280}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21658906, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:04:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Lolita", "com": "what do people like about the book Lolita?<br>I have not heard much about it but what I have heard about made it seem like a pedophile&#039;s wet dream in the form of a book.", "filename": "1955-FR-Olympia-Press-Paris", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 371, "h": 594, "tn_w": 156, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1676408662411191, "time": 1676408662, "md5": "OtjKB8quXEvQ8Eq0ek/rxA==", "fsize": 47167, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lolita", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 37, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 31}, {"no": 21658922, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:07:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658906</a><br>Humbert was a ephebofile, not a pedophile", "time": 1676408867, "resto": 21658906}, {"no": 21659006, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:33:02", "name": "ann", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658922</a><br>*ephebophile<br><br>Goes online, and starts talking shit.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I want to fuck little kids who are 13-16</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STOP CALLING ME A PEDO</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PEDOS LIKE PEOPLE 12 AND YOUNGER</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; IM A HEBEPHILE</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I HATE PEDOS KILL THEM ALL!</span>", "time": 1676410382, "resto": 21658906}, {"no": 21659117, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:57:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658906</a><br>the prose is at least pretty good and if you study the french you&#039;ll find some neat puns", "time": 1676411832, "resto": 21658906}, {"no": 21659253, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)17:32:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658906</a><br>The prose and humor.

Like if you read Dostoyevsky&#039;s Poor Folk Nabokov seems exactly like Rataziaev. Dostoyevsky wrote Poor Folk as a Roussean reaction to Pushkin&#039;s Station Master. Dostoyevsky wrote a social realist novel where the poor guy is poor because he only cares about one heartwarming idealistic object instead of talent or art for the community.

So they loved these very dependent, submissive women and hated them because it was like having a dumb puppy as a lover. Women don&#039;t want a puppy to love them, they want something bigger, something like a grown up, big dog, a big snarling dog, even if it&#039;s a wounded one or a sad one, that power, that masculine potential needs to be there. A woman can&#039;t give that, and that&#039;s why lesbians always hate each other. One couple in particular I&#039;ve spent some time with amazed me at how fucking sadistic one acted upon the other. It was a dynamic I&#039;ve never seen anywhere else. Not even normal women are that sadistic toward men, I swear to God. Women are cruel to men, but because they know men can take it, they don&#039;t feel that joy. They&#039;re just naturally cruel.

It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

I will die a virgin. My death will be a death that would have been considered sad if it had occurred perhaps fifteen years before. There will be grief, but all the agonies that my progenitors might pass into (and they are the only people in this entire world who even know of my existence) will be underpinned by this indomitable truth: it is a mercy that he is gone. The quantity of my existence stands only as a component for perpetuating the tortuous quality of the cheap jest that constitutes its vapid manifestation. My virginity has become the gorgon against which all my faculties rise only to be turned to stone; but this is no silent stone, this is not the stone of Plotinus that stands as the antithesis of the Intellectual Principle--for while yet stone I still feel the mind&#039;s unscrupulous lacerations and all that grieves the very fibers of its being. The spirit is dimmed each time a girl passes before the mechanism of sight that some pitiless god has glued to my body. Even the ugly, unshaven, modernity enthralled women with clowns&#039; hair and bodies desecrated with tattoos which map out upon fastfood fed bodies the vapid cliches that coagulate to form their mind, even these paralyze the life in me. Masturbation has become merely the corpse of a habit that no longer instills pleasure, no longer even succeeds in distracting, but is only the dull libidinal twitch of a mind faced with the irrepressible impossibility of its reality, while lacking the courage to galvanize itself towards rectification. In the end I do not seek repentance. The decimated husk of my ego drifts towards the only gray shore its virginity-shackled mind can still vaguely form, still vaguely know as whisper or faint wriggling worm in an unclear wound--worm&#039;s whisper out of a wound that clears: Death. Here is the Telos to which the entirety of my Dasein has been speeding. Here I shall sink at last, unrequited, into the tentacles of Annihilation&#039;s amnesia. My humiliation slowly becomes seething hatred for all who embody that element of the opposite sex, and my soul&#039;s relentless cry for something beyond suicide slowly twists itself into ever more feverish fetishes that the internet can happily supply an outlet for. At last, the inconsequential blip that referenced Myself whenever it imagined &#039;I Am&#039; shall find, not rest, but an end to the sequence of caustic images that only ever taunted it into further depths of Hell&#039;s sardonic pitch. No prostitute can relieve me of my virginity, for it has become a magnificently metaphysical lesion that I lack the medicine or Savior&#039;s name to remove and, like that man at the pool of Bethesda, take up my carpet and walk into the world again.", "time": 1676418312, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21659627, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:11:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Please post the one about anon bullying a store clerk about Finnegan&#039;s Wake", "time": 1676419889, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21659987, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)20:36:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659138</a><br><a href=\"#p21658911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658911</a><br>I remember those", "time": 1676424986, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21660317, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:14:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659409</a><br>I still think he could have played it off cool with the girl<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Well i found another book to rave myself in&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yeah?

One might imagine that working in a library entails having a quiet, spacious office in which to organize the library&#039;s inner layout, making sure books are ordered and delivered on a timely basis, overseeing new technology being implemented and so forth. I am 40 years old. For thirteen years now I have stood and sat at the front desk of a large urban library whose most loyal denizens are the homeless and the clinically insane. Schizophrenics are drawn here like moths to a flame. Alcoholics come here to snooze and disrupt. Niggers crowd the aisles and spread their toxic subhuman behaviour. I thought I would be advising enthusiastic kids what to read next, or helping elderly peasants become introduced to the world of literature in order to enjoy their final years thanks to the offerings of high culture. Instead I stand silently and alone as my miserable colleagues discuss their boring husbands or browse facebook or holidays websites to look out for the cheapest package deals. I am forced to replace urine-stained seat cushions. Forced to &quot;kindly&quot; &quot;usher&quot; out the bums who vomit on themselves and the constantly wide-eyed middle-aged women who start to scream and talk gibberish at a rapid pace if I approach them and tell them we are closing up. What a pathetic life I lead. I imagined I would be like Larkin, like Borges, like the kind of refined, reserved kind of man whose job allows him an air of mystique and glum erudition. Instead I am no better than a janitor who has found himself at the till of a supermarket. In 2008 I had a brief sexual affair with a student girl who spent a month here as part of her training to become a librarian. We screwed in the storage room several times a day. It was purely physical on her part but deeply emotional on mine. Eventually she realized she didn&#039;t want this kind of job and admitted she felt sorry for me and thought fucking me would make me less depressed and her less experienced. She is now working for a marketing company and is earning more than me despite being a member of a different generation. Please kill me. Please. Please.

Religiosity and spiritual beliefs still are common, but more and more they exist outside the confines of any traditional communal setting. It&#039;s something an individual chooses, and so religion becomes only another product in the marketplace. Or something you choose to identify with.<br>The reason you will never see relevant prophets today is that organized religion has little cultural relevance in developed nations. In liberal nations the state is envisioned as denuded of religion, it is the simple representation of the people. The liberal-democratic state, confines religion to the private sphere. In the public sphere there can only be rational individuals engaged in advancing and negotiating their material interests. And the business of the state is simply its own business, that of maintaining and expanding its power. <br> Even in a nation with a sizable percentage of religious people, religion still remains disconnected from the fabric of cultural and political life. Any attempt for these religions to evolve or adapt themselves to mass culture comes across as ingenuine, since that mass culture exists outside of it.<br>Under a broad definition of religion, as others in this thread have pointed out, many different modern political leaders could be seen as prophets of a kind. And many modern ideologies like Liberalism or Marxism, that are ostensibly non-religious, could be religious in so far as they offer people a cohesive narrative to understand the world.<br>Looking at modern prophets many are political figures. MLK for instance incorporated his Christian ideals into his political activism, but at the same time these religious ideals become incorporated into liberalism, in the sense that he framed his own activism in terms of natural rights and social contract theory. A religious political figure must justify his ideas in terms that can appeal to people beyond his own religious background, if he aims to appeal to a wide audience. The basic problem is that modernity and modern technology enables the proliferation of new ideas, and interactions with people of different ideological backgrounds in a way that wasn&#039;t possible for the average person in a Christian Medieval Society. In a modern context of pluralism a religious figure can only maintain ideological purity at the cost of cultural relevance.<br>With a figure like Hitler we see an attempt to make the modern nation-state itself mythological.", "time": 1676443305, "resto": 21660088}, {"no": 21660992, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:43:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21660088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21660088</a><br>It is simple: there aren&#039;t any thinkers who believe in gods.", "time": 1676443429, "resto": 21660088}, {"no": 21660996, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21660670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21660670</a><br>If you don&#039;t fear death you&#039;re either braindead or an immortal.", "time": 1676443455, "resto": 21660088}, {"no": 21661028, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:55:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21660996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21660996</a><br>I&#039;m immortal.", "time": 1676444158, "resto": 21660088}, {"no": 21661055, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)02:08:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661028</a><br>t.

It&#039;s kind of hard to pin point but they seem to be addressing wide audiences, and they take the social sensationalist narratives of history as real. You could maybe accuse Weininger of being just as dramatic but I actually think his similarities to Jung and Freud are the worst parts of his work, and even there he&#039;s more restrained. Everything special about Weininger is his connecting epilepsy to criminality, he says all world historical criminals suffered from epilepsy. This is so much more important, personal and real than &#039;archetypes&#039; or Freud&#039;s reduction of the mind. Weininger breaks every thing up into a binary but he doesn&#039;t have the arrogance to call it &#039;order and chaos&#039;, he&#039;s more aware, more self-cannibalizing, because that&#039;s real morality in contrast to a type of self love focused on fixing community. Weininger is trying to find a redemptive reason for everything as it exists not trying to fix it himself, or &#039;wake people up&#039;. Weininger is the prophet of self hatred but he&#039;s not a pessimist, he&#039;s just trying to be as honest as possible, and not trying to help people or &#039;heal culture&#039;. To me he&#039;s only addressing one specific type of individual in his work, one specific type of mind, not a &#039;world community of people&#039;. For Weininger only one soul really exists, and all other souls are formed from vanity. Weininger&#039;s binary is walking and stumbling, speaking and stuttering, standing and sleeping, flailing and quickening. Don&#039;t you see how much more personal this is? Weininger does a lot of art and literature criticism but everything in his work is focused on little speckled kernels of truth and everything else is absolute blindness that we can&#039;t really make judgements on without superhuman levels of work, interest, and authority that is really beyond human ability. To Weininger, the mother is the voice of a type of false self hatred that Peterson advocates &#039;try harder, do more, be better&#039;- the father is the voice of a type of real self love that Dostoyevsky and Wagner advocates &#039;stop trying, stop fattening yourself up for your butchers (Sarcotheus, Typhurgus, Aplestus, Philocreus, Miastor), stop appetizing yourself externally, feed on internal death and never die. Obviously this is misrepresenting his work in a bunch of different ways when he&#039;s stumbling and addressing a community, but at the kernel of his work it would not be a misrepresentation if everyone in the community was this specific individual that he&#039;s really addressing.", "time": 1676419899, "resto": 21650508}, {"no": 21659681, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)19:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659629</a><br>Jung and Freud, Paglia and Peterson believe the na\u00efve and self satisfying theory that we are here to eat food and survive no matter the cost, to &#039;make things&#039; and establish ultimate value by &#039;fighting against the chaos of nature&#039;.

For a moment everything remained quiet. &quot;They&#039;re not going to answer,&quot; Gregor said to himself, captivated by some senseless hope. But then, of course, the maid went to the door as usual with her firm stride and opened up. Gregor only had to hear the visitor&#039;s first word of greeting to know who it was--the office manager himself. Why was only Gregor condemned to work for a firm where at the slightest omission they immediately suspected the worst? Were all employees louts without exception, wasn&#039;t there a single loyal, dedicated worker among them who, when he had not fully utilized a few hours of the morning for the firm, was driven half-mad by pangs of conscience and was actually unable to get out of bed? Really, wouldn&#039;t it have been enough to send one of the apprentices to find out--if this prying were absolutely necessary--did the manager himself have to come, and did the whole innocent family have to be shown in this way that the investigation of this suspicious affair could be entrusted only to the intellect of the manager? And more as a result of the excitement produced in Gregor by these thoughts than as a result of any real decision, he swung himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thump, but it was not a real crash. The fall was broken a little by the carpet, and Gregor&#039;s back was more elastic than he had thought, which explained the not very noticeable muffled sound. Only he had not held his head carefully enough and hit it; he turned it and rubbed it on the carpet in anger and pain.</span><br>WEEEEE YIPEEE!!!!! HORRAYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Life has been about transition and I find that the approaching of 40 is a very common transition phase for a lot of men where there&#039;s a final death of boyish ways. It&#039;s like a final washing of whatever immature traits that one had left and also where one starts to more firmly take root and embrace maturity as they progress in age. They don&#039;t call 40 &quot;over the hill&quot; for nothing. So, don&#039;t fret if you&#039;ve done nothing so far that you judge to be of significance. Keep hustling and working hard. I can&#039;t stress how important it is to become disciplined in your work ethic. Just find something productive to do and do it.

So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.<br><br>Even the gospel was more than one gospel. The reading for the last Sunday after Pentecost began with the abomination of desolation and with a warning to the reader. For three quarters of its length, the gospel for that last Sunday of the year continued to warn. Near the end came the clouds and the four winds, and then the last pause before the ultimate turmoil. And in that last pause, startlingly under the terrible sky, the fig-tree appeared, with its leaves coming forth.<br><br>More clearly than anything I read or heard in my childhood, that last pause near the end of the last gospel of the year told me that every thing would always be more than one thing. The last pause told me that every thing would always contain another thing, which would contain still another thing or which would seem, absurdly at first sight, to contain the thing that had seemed to contain it.<br><br>Five years after I had heard the last gospel of the ecclesiastical year in the parish church of Saint Mark, Fawkner, I listened for the first time in my life to a piece of what I called classical music. Near the end of that music I heard a pause. The solemn themes of the music paused for a moment. Just before the clouds had drifted over all the sky and just before the four winds whistled and the last struggle began, I heard the pause of the summer that seemed nigh.<br><br>I have heard that pause many times since in pieces of music. I have heard the pause while I read the next-to-last page in many a book. The larger, the solemn themes are about to go into battle for the last time. By now, of course, the solemn themes are not themes but men and women, and when they pause for the last time they look over their shoulders. <br><br>They look back towards some district where they lived as children or where they once fell in love. Perhaps they see the green lawn or even the branch with green leaves that they saw in their native district. For a moment a simple theme is the only theme heard; the greenness appears in place of the greyness.<br><br>For an absurd moment within that moment, the listener or the reader dares to suppose that this after all is the last theme; this and not the other is the end; the green has outlasted the grey; the grey has been covered over at last by the green.<br><br>But this is only a moment within a moment.

Like the aforementioned individuals, Klages was against industrialization and modernity.<br><br>Klages warned about the dangers of Abrahamic/Mazdan eschatology, which views the world as inherently flawed and in need of improvement. This idea of progress, born from Abrahamic/Mazdan Messianism and eschatology, is at the root of much of the world&#039;s ills. According to Klages, nothing positive has come from the concept of progress. He devoted a significant amount of time to investigating this topic.<br><br>Klages also criticized logocentrism, which prioritizes fixed and discrete categorization and segmentation. Logocentrism coupled with the march of progress can be referred to as an expression of &quot;Geist&quot; (spirit). Geist is in opposition to &quot;Seele&quot; (soul), which is vitalistic and already pure and perfect, similar to the concept of one&#039;s Original Nature in Ch&#039;an. The spirit is parasitic to the soul and mechanizes &amp; destroys it. This is why, despite all the &quot;progressive rhetoric&quot; such as calls for more scientific growth, diversity, inclusivity, and so on, we see more destruction of ethnic diversity, biodiversity, and so on. For instance, a progressive liberal may claim to support ethnic diversity, but their progressive rhetoric, rooted in Geist, ultimately leads to the destruction of diversity through immigration policies.

Forest and spring, boulder and grotto were for them filled with sacred life; from the summits of their lofty mountains blew the storm-winds of the gods (it was not from lack of a &quot;feeling for nature&quot; that one did not climb their peaks!), and tempest and hailstones threatened or clashed furiously in the play of battle.

I might have Jewish blood somewhere in my DNA, maybe like, I dunno 1% or 5%, but I doubt it. In any case, I am not Jewish. Now when I read the Bible, I like Jesus quite a bit, but even what he says is like, 90% about Jews and Israel and the God of Jews and Israel. In fact a lot of the NT is callbacks to the OT, and the OT is pretty much dedicated to the Jews and Israel, and the customs of Jews and the laws of the Jews of Israel. And when I read the words in red, most of the time they&#039;re talking smack against Jews, because they&#039;re very bad at upholding the customs and moral tenets of Jews. Today I was reading the Bible again and I was reading that bit where Jesus says, here, God is like a king who invites all his chosen clique people to a wedding, and they think little of it, and don&#039;t go, so he exterminates them and then says to his servants, just call all the bums and losers in the streets and have them come to my wedding. And then one of them doesn&#039;t have a dress and the king kills him. Maybe he didn&#039;t have the money? Maybe he wasn&#039;t a Jew so he didn&#039;t know? In any case... Is Jesus inviting me to the Kingdom of Heaven simply because the Jews were such garbage at being good Jews? Like, this is really what it&#039;s like, isn&#039;t it? Am I supposed to feel flattered? Can you imagine dating someone and this person keeps saying that she&#039;s chosen you because her ex was such a gigantic piece of shit, and she can&#039;t stop talking about her ex? This is how it feels, honestly.<br>And then I think, I&#039;m still some European dude who&#039;s at least remotely Jewish-adjacent. Can you imagine reading the Bible, which is all about Israel and Jews, but you&#039;re some kind of... I dunno Samoan islander, a Maori warrior or an Inuit dude. Imagine being an Inuit who&#039;s given a Bible and he reads all the stuff that Jesus says, he looks up from his literal printing of the words of God and all he can think is &quot;what&#039;s a camel?&quot; he&#039;s never seen a camel. I&#039;m pretty sure that not even regular bears are mentioned in the Bible, let alone polar bears, or seals.<br>Now when you read Buddhist suttas - by all means, I don&#039;t believe in reincarnation so I&#039;m not a Buddhist either - they&#039;re very understandable. Back to the Maori dude, he can DEFINITELY understand what the Buddha says because simply because any human knows what it feels to be strongly attached to something, like a woman or glory or riches, and being in pain because you want more, or because you&#039;ve lost it.

I just read the parable of the wedding feast you referred to, and I agree, it is pretty shit and not very clear at all.<br><br>My sensibilities, whenever I read the bible, tends to interpret God as consciousness, as an experience of pure awareness that everyone has access to. When I read that parable you refer to, I imagine it being about the pure awareness inviting us to wake up and see that we are not the thoughts/guests, but we are the king that holds the feast. Then some bum shows up but he does so without respect, no wedding clothes, so he gets fucked off and yeeted from the event. The ending of this parable sounds cruel and capricious, and honestly, seems to me to be a dogshit way of getting across any meaning. My interpretation of why the poorly dressed guest was yeeted is that he was not reverent and did not approach the event with the awareness of where he was.<br><br>Again, to be clear, when I read the bible I interpret God as pure awareness. In this parable the poorly dressed guest is the awareness becoming aware that it is aware, but in a way that is not sufficiently aware. We all experience this in our lives, often. When we see a beautiful thing, a piece of art, natural beauty, and we experience awe, our minds go silent and peaceful. That is us turning up to the wedding feast. In those cases though, we are poorly dressed, because we believe the feeling we experience is derived from what we see, the painting, landscape etc. instead of realising the feeling is from the still place inside of us that gives rise to all knowing. Because we did not see where we truly were in that moment, we are yeeted the fuck out until we visit another painting, or another mountain, only to mistake yet again what gives rise to that occasion. <br><br>This is my take on your Jewish rambling problem, which I acknowledge is a rambling of its own.

Yes the Buddha did sometimes make references to Brahman and other Hindu elements, but these were nowhere central to the teachings. Whenever he made a point, he put it in very broad, context-agnostic terms. How is the Bible not capable of that? It really seems to be aimed at Jews. And again, I&#039;m still historical-geographically close to this culture and I still need to look up the Jewish customs. Ah, yes, very interesting, the Jews did this in Israel at the time.<br>What frustrates me even more than not understanding the Bible is that there are all these amazing men whom I love and respect so much who were devout Christians, and I cannot fathom how these intelligent and sensible people that so effortlessly reach me with their work could be connected so intensely with a text that I find indecipherable.", "time": 1676422899, "resto": 21657154}, {"no": 21659918, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)20:18:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659856</a><br>I acknowledge that my interpretation is uncommon. I personally find Jesus and the bible makes more sense when interpreted in the light of meditative traditions such as Buddhism. For example, &quot;judge not lest ye be judged&quot; makes no sense, in my opinion, unless you have experienced the meditative still awareness that is non-duality, as this teaching, and much of the Beatitudes imo, are all about the dangers of dual thinking, of polarities, and how one can only be truly good, natural, and at peace, when one lives in that state of pure acceptance where everything simply &#039;is&#039; (I am that I am).<br><br>I, personally, take what I want from the bible. That is not to say that I just make shit up, but it seems to me that most things in mainstream Christianity just make no sense according to their own exegesis. Only when I interpreted the bible in the terms of inner awareness and the true goodness and non-dual focus at our centre did it ever make any sense. <br><br>For me, this is just the way of all forms: they corrupt. What you hold on to, you kill, because everything flows. All structures, organisations, religions, politics, will decay because they try to make some solid in an overflowing world, like the Tower of Babel, or like how Cain was a farmer vs good and honest Abel who wandered the hills freely with his sheep. So fuck Christianity and all they say about Christ imo. That wasn&#039;t even that man&#039;s name. They tried to make solid some of his teachings, and made him a legend, a God himself, to point people who had no capacity for self-awareness into at least behaving in a way similar to an aware person, even if they could not feel why they did it. Jesus for me was a weird Jewish Buddha whose words were torn up by time, empires, and religions. <br><br>I mean, be real. How the hell can you understood judge not lest ye be judged outside of that inner experience of stillness that is non-dual reality? Blessed are the poor, the meek, the peacemakers? Thy rod and thy staff comfort me? Thy lay me down beside still waters? Vanity, vanity, all is vanity . . . to me Jesus and the bible as a whole makes no sense outside of inner experience.

That&#039;s why when he sees that kid and his poor family coming out of church, and singing the comin&#039; thro the rye song, he feels happiness. That&#039;s also why he wants to be a &quot;catcher&quot; in a rye farm where kids play and might fall into an abyss (The abyss would be aduthood). He wants to go back to his childhood and have his brother Allie along him again. Finally, at the end of the book, he spends some time with her younger sister, and he learns that nothing is lost yet, he can still be happy, thanks to his sister he can beat the trauma of his childhood.</s> <br>That said, I&#039;m very bad at interpreting or analyzing books, and I read a spanish translation, so I might be very wrong there.

It is a story about the end of the world in which the world ends.&quot; In other words, Clute&#039;s answer to my question is nothing, there&#039;s nothing at the end of the road. Such a statement &quot;in which the world ends&quot; strikes me as too categorical for The Road or for McCarthy&#039;s work as a whole, of which The Road, presaged over and again from The Orchard Keeper onward, is both a logical continuation and a kind of termination. I believe, with Edwin T. Arnold, that McCarthy&#039;s work is grounded in moral choice. Clute&#039;s statement &quot;you remove the Christ figure and you are left with virtually nothing&quot; leaves little room for choice, but I think the novel, in its own contradictory way, does. How then do we go about examining the relative evidence for and against God in The Road? We look directly at the text, at what McCarthy intentionally did or did not write. What and where is the textual evidence working against God, what and where is the evidence working for God? And how do they stack up? In the novel&#039;s second fragment we can begin to accumulate the evidence against God. There is a simple description of the setting as &quot;Barren, silent, godless&quot; (4). A few pages later a single snowflake sifts down: &quot;He caught it in his hand and watched it expire there like the last host of Christendom&quot; (16). It&#039;s the boy who catches the snowflake but the narrator&#039;s simile is hardly of the boy&#039;s imagining. Sometimes McCarthy reverses the religious reference for negative effect as in this un-writing of Genesis by the man: &quot;The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. [. . .] The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality&quot; (88-9).

Their conversation treats survival, death and God, but it raises more questions than it answers. Ely, whether it&#039;s real or some perverse nom de guerre, is the only person in the novel endowed with any sort of proper name. Why? What - beyond urging the critics to hustle - is the significance of the name? Some of the criticism takes Ely to allude to Elijah, a connection I fail to see except on the most superficial level - the wise old biblical prophet, other than caricature or intentional reversal, he is not; even less is he Melville&#039;s Elijah from Chapter 19 of Moby Dick - and I don&#039;t understand any link beyond some weird possible version of Elijah&#039;s sharing of the Passover meal, a flimsy tie, for what it&#039;s worth, seen also by Phillip A. Snyder (81) in the context of hospitality. <br><br>Why not Ely itself?

What if it&#039;s God-made or a catastrophic accident? McCarthy remarked somewhat facetiously in an interview in the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I don&#039;t have an opinion. At the Santa Fe Institute I&#039;m with scientists of all disciplines, and some of them in geology said it looked like a meteor to them,&quot; as if they were privy to information beyond his ken. &quot;But it could be anything - volcanic activity or it could be a nuclear war. It&#039;s not really important&quot; (Jurgensen). The only critic I have read so far who wants to keep the question open is Jay Ellis, who does not decide between &quot;nuclear winter, or the calamitous climate change sped up by a comet strike&quot; (28). The interview, even given McCarthy&#039;s well known propensity for hermetic or enigmatic pronouncements, only strengthens the possibility that the catastrophe was not necessarily man-made.<br><br>If we accept McCarthy&#039;s ingenuousness or ingeniousness, we also have to accept the somewhat outrageous notion that the only proper name in the novel (other than Rock City, of which Ely could be a reiteration, in which case Ely would be the rock of the un-church) coincides, at least in the popular mind, with a great physical disaster, which did to the dinosaurs what the current disaster in the novel is doing to man. And then we must ask if it&#039;s also coincidental that this character Ely, the only one with a name, is the one to tell us: &quot;There is no God,&quot; an utterly un-Elijah-like judgment that he promptly reiterates: &quot;There is no God and we are his prophets&quot; (170) - And why does he look like<br> &quot;a starved and threadbare buddha&quot; (168) and talk like the prophet Mohammed? That sort of multi-religious palimpsest is clearly contrived, but to what end? Is McCarthy deriding &quot;diversity&quot;? Are we meant to believe Ely? Maybe he&#039;s just crazy, or maybe he&#039;s right and crazy, or maybe he&#039;s trying to tell us in his own crazy Nietzschean way that God is so utterly removed from us as to be dead, an idea Jay Ellis flirts with when he writes of: &quot;[. . .] the larger philosophy we keep<br> determining in these novels - including McCarthy&#039;s sense of god as a kind of absent parent no longer able, or willing, to do anything&quot; (35), a sense that echoes tangentially Leo Daugherty&#039;s Gnostic reading of Blood Meridian. The disaster may not be caused by man, but the episode with Ely can only reinforce any case against any God other than a totally absent one, no matter how eccentric or contrived Ely himself may be.", "time": 1676109653, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643891, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643876</a><br>Another of those prose poems occurs in a kind of flashback or memory: &quot;Out on the roads the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond&quot; (181). The passage sounds like certain descriptions from Suttree and something like the first chapter of Ecclesiastes. The key word, for my purposes, is &quot;unremarked,&quot; which seems to indicate a nonexistent or uncaring God. The passage echoes one from early in the novel: &quot;The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air&quot; (11). These passages point convincingly to nothingness and doubtless are among the major reasons the novel has been labeled nihilistic or godless. There is also a brief fragment that would seem to deny any after life: &quot;Do you think your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledgerbook? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground&quot; (196). This denial seems to issue straight from the man as does a subsequent passage of the same type: &quot;I think maybe they are watching, he said. They are watching for a thing that even death cannot undo and if they do not see it they will turn away from us and they will not come back&quot; (210). Who are &quot;they,&quot; we are forced to ask, ghosts, angels, archons, aeons, gods? There is no answer and all that is clear is the quandary itself, yet the very nature of the question, at once rhetorical and pointed, seems to signal some Eliot-like turning, however bleakly. Is it some spark - &quot;the thing that even death cannot<br> undo&quot; - that they must see in order not to turn away? <br><br>The textual case for God, or more specifically a Christlike figure in<br> the boy, difficult to imagine without some a priori God, however aloof, comprises more evidence than the negative case, and more convincingly. We can understand much of the material by stringing it together, almost without explication, beginning with this passage, which is the first we hear of the boy: &quot;He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke&quot; (5). Shortly after they emerge from the mountains, the father, having left their camp, observes: &quot;When he rose and turned to go back the tarp was lit from within where the boy had wakened. Sited there in the darkness the frail blue shape of it looked like the pitch of some last venture at the edge of the world. Something all but unaccountable. And so it was&quot; (48). Except for being unaccountable, this phenomenon - whatever it describes - is wholly unremarked in the narrative or in the criticism, but it foreshadows much of what follows. That foreshadowing, while easily slipping by unnoticed here, cannot be anything other than explicit and intentional.", "time": 1676110251, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643898, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643891</a><br>Some twenty pages later, as the father washes the roadrat&#039;s gore from his son&#039;s hair, comes the first direct inkling of the boy&#039;s role: &quot;All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you&#039;ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them&quot; (74). Messiah, of course, means anointed one and while this passage does not proclaim a messiah, it does plant a seed of implication, especially when on the next page we read that the man &quot;sat beside him and stroked his pale and tangled hair. Golden chalice, good to house a god&quot; (75). Someone - the father, the narrator, the reader, the critic - is making suggestions we cannot simply ignore. Then the boy himself begins to make pronouncements. First he says that nothing bad will happen to them, &quot;Because we&#039;re carrying the<br> fire&quot; (83), when there is no fire and they&#039;re about to sleep in a car with only suit coats piled on for warmth. This figurative fire will become a central motif for the boy&#039;s sacred nature, which the man will continue to assert, as when he asks Ely: &quot;What if I said he&#039;s a god?&quot; (172), a role<br> the boy will eventually take for himself. When the boy answers the man, saying that he is the one &quot;who has to worry about everything,&quot; saying, &quot;Yes I am. . .I am the one&quot; (259), he is echoing Jesus in a number of instances - I am the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6); I am the door of the sheep (John 10:7); I am the light of the world (John 8:12); I am the alpha and the omega (Revelation 1:8), to mention a few of the most obvious. Suffice it to say the proclamation &quot;I am&quot; is among the strongest phrases in the Old and New Testaments, the latter inevitably an echo of God&#039;s pronouncement to Moses: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). Not only does the boy offer to take responsibility, he offers to do so in unmistakably religious language, with none of the equivocation or contradiction so evident in Ely&#039;s negative discourse. The boy, born after the disaster, has been raised, we must assume, without church or scripture, and his scriptural echoes must therefore issue forth from narrative design or divine inspiration. There cannot be - not in a Cormac McCarthy novel -inadvertent echoes or unintentional allusions.", "time": 1676110497, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643914, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>Later the boy asks: &quot;Is it real? The fire?&quot; and the man answers: &quot;It&#039;s inside you. It was always there. I can see it&quot; (278-9). Is that the figurative fire of civilization? I think it means - textually, in this novel - less something vaguely Promethean than the literal belief in or presence of God or at the very least some entrapped divine spark of the Gnostics. My reading stems not from any innate desire to interpret the text that way. Rather it seems the weightier of two intentionally conflicting possible readings or discourses, set out as though the narrator himself were engaged in some mono-dialogical debate meant to be attended and adjudged by the reader. Alongside the fire motif runs a light motif - when there is in this darkest of worlds no source of light - that only reinforces the sacred nature of the boy: &quot;There was light all about him&quot; and &quot;when he moved the light moved with him&quot; (277). The man is compelled to comment: &quot;There is no prophet in the earth&#039;s long chronicle who&#039;s not honored here today&quot; (277), an inference, by the father at least, that the boy incarnates some second coming. Finally, there are two poignant words that I believe strengthen the textual case for God. The first is salitter: word used rather exclusively by Jacob Boehme (or commentary on him, as by Hegel), the Lutheran mystic clearly familiar to McCarthy, to judge nowhere beyond the two citations, one used as epigraph and the other reversed as subtitle, for Blood Meridian. Salitter - there could be a dissertation on this usage eventually, as well as a study on the meaning of fire and light as God and Christ in Jacob Boehm and Cormac McCarthy - means divine essence, the stuff of God (not unlike the Tao or Brahman, or in quantum physics the matrix of Max Planck): &quot;He walked out into the road and stood. The silence. The salitter drying from the earth&quot; (261). John Clute properly underlines the vital importance of this sole word, acknowledging God&#039;s presence but believing that &quot;the Christ figure must somehow be seen - be felt - to transcend the drying of the divine out of the earth.&quot; I agree, at least to the point that Clute has put his finger in the wound. The central question would seem to be precisely that: Does the Christ-like figure of the boy transcend - or reverse or compensate for - such an absence or withdrawal? It is reasonable to argue, as Clute does, that the answer is no. But what are we to make of this passage, giving us the second poignant word, just before the father dies: . .he [the man] would raise his weeping eyes and see him [the boy] standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle&quot; (273)?", "time": 1676111035, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643920, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:25:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>I got 1 paragraph through this wall of complete shite and couldn&#039;t go on. <br>TLDR please and thx desu.", "time": 1676111150, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643928, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643914</a><br>Tabernacle: In general terms, a place of worship.

But regardless, why tabernacle, why the singularly most ecumenical term imaginable to express the essence of God? And what if the man is seeing into the future, or what if the boy does indeed glow? What if McCarthy is not making a reasonable or cogent argument?<br><br>The last thing the father says is: &quot;Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again&quot; (281). The father dies, the boy stays with him the emblematic three days and then as if on cue or as if preordained or as if popped from a machine, Parka-man &quot;hove into view&quot; (281). The critics who say that Parka-man is a deus ex machina are right, and that is precisely the point. His woman, who welcomes the boy, doesn&#039;t talk to him of civilization, she talks to him about God and tells him that &quot;the breath of God was his breath&quot; (286). If McCarthy didn&#039;t want us to read it the way I just have, why did he write it that way? Why say goodness will find the boy and have goodness find the boy? Why drag out a deliberate and undisguised deus ex machina - no one could seriously argue that McCarthy was unaware of the fact - if what you want to do is deny any sort of deus? And it&#039;s not just goodness that finds the boy but a new and this time caring mother, the mother that does not exist for that long list of road warriors we started with, the mother absent or defective in all those novels, every single one of them, including most especially this one, and not just goodness but warm caring affectionate understanding maternal goodness - quite the opposite of the mother who abandons the boy - the only such maternal goodness, all one short paragraph of it, in virtually all of McCarthy&#039;s work. If the message is meant to be nothing more than the withdrawal of whatever Gnostic substance there is out there, why have as the subject of the last paragraph of the plotted novel a mother who is not only all of the foregoing, but also a mother who understands how to explain the unexplainable without attempting to force any belief on the boy? What&#039;s at the end of The Road? What textually, with no need to adduce scientific opinion from the ironically named Santa Fe Institute? Stabat mater, not yet dolorosa. And that mother who is there, standing there, not yet grieving, means that the pistol-packing, fire-carrying boy, the light-bearing boy, the golden chalice and glowing tabernacle of an anointed boy who honors all the prophets and whom goodness has found is who and what we have.

It is distinct in tone and voice and time and perspective from the novel, raising more questions than answers, and serves as its undesignated epilogue.<br><br>Is the narrator addressing the reader directly when he says: &quot;Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand&quot;? Or is that second-person pronoun directed at the narrator himself, like a rhetorical question? Or is there an intentional conflation of narrator and reader and even ghosts? The man who remembered the trout in the early mountain section of the novel is dead. Yet you, the reader, cannot help associating the trout here with those remembered trout. They are as iconic as Hemingway&#039;s trout, or more so, both early in the novel and intensely so now in this echoing epilogic vision of them, shared in the foreground between the complicit narrator and the willing reader and in the background with Hemingway and the dead father.<br><br>Native brook trout (technically a char, salvelinus fontinalis) are as perfect a species as exists in nature, yet they are delicate and susceptible to the effects of any kind of pollution. McCarthy uses them to stand for all the particular natural miracles that have been destroyed by whatever cataclysm has occurred: &quot;Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.&quot; These miracle trout of becoming are at once real (the light wavy markings on the brook trout&#039;s dorsal area are called vermiculations) and intricately evolved, and they return us to once - what is now, from the current point of view of this narrator-after-the-fact, in illo tempore - to our as yet undestroyed world where the brookies still wimple and swim, while not releasing us from the recorded destruction in the novel: &quot;Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again.&quot; We are returned, briefly and ever so hypothetically, to the irreversibly fragile pristine mountain setting - a thing which could not be put back - of the sacred trout for the ultimate, possibly guilt-laden, possibly not, nostalgic and mystical pronouncement: &quot;In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery&quot; (286-87).", "time": 1676111991, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643952, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643946</a><br>In the deep mountain hollows and coves where the trout once lived, emblematic of the entire natural world, all of nature was older than man and all of it, everything, hummed with the essence of life.

A table is not a table because it has one flat plane and 3-4 legs as support, but it&#039;s daily day to day interaction with Dasein gives it its being. This knowledge is integrated automatically as background information and is not a conscious process. This is how objects take their being. Now, Heidegger also believed that poetic language can reveal aspects of Dasein that are usually hidden because it renders beings/objects in a different light for Dasein (I am using it as a noun but it isn&#039;t). Language is intrinsically tied with Dasein. Naming is the second step for Dasein to cognize objects as individual beings.<br><br>It is in the 2nd one that I see resemblance to Blood Meridian. The middle of the novel (nearly 200 pages) are almost exclusively landscape descriptions and natural imagery. But McCarthy&#039;s use of Similes and figurative language constantly casts &#039;known&#039; objects (usually features of geology with specific names) in almost alien, sometimes transcendent light. They become highly suggestive. This is possibly how language imbues symbols onto objects and is the basis of symbolism. But symbols in Blood meridian are unresolved. Images can imply any interpretation from any school of thought, even contradictory ones to the meaning of these scenes. This is what makes the task of interpreting the novel definitively, impossible. McCarthy&#039;s imagery is very vivid but also very associative and it seems to not observe a singular narrative line along which he might have wished to string his descriptions.<br>I would say that this may have been a function of poetic language than anything deliberate on McCarthy&#039;s part but for this one excerpt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their figures now quick with clarity and now fugitive in the strangeness of that same light. Like things whose very portent renders them ambiguous. Like things so charged with meaning that their forms are dimmed.</span><br>McCarthy clearly knows what his use of language is doing to the world/story he is describing. It is even acknowledged within the book by the narrator. The image of Judge and the fool travelling through the desert becomes suggestive, metaphorical such that readers will pay greater attention to the suggested symbols (King lear and his fool for one) than the literal objects themselves (the 7 foot albino judge and the shit-eating drooling fool). And in typical McCarthy fashion the suggested metaphor doesn&#039;t slot into any of the many interpretations of the novel.", "time": 1676224548, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21649589, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:58:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21649583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21649583</a><br>McCarthy&#039;s purpose here seems to show how language functions on the most fundamental level because finally all words are &quot;metaphors&quot; for their referrents.

But it is oblique, or should I say so obvious that most people never get it.<br><br>Additionally, I think Holden may also be a cheeky homage to Heidegger. He is also a master of language, a philosopher and speaks in the same convoluted but self aware way that Heidegger does in Being and Time. Both seem to be aware that some people will just label them sophists for the use of their kind of language. But what they are saying cannot be expressed in anyway else.

But McCarthy might hold up better to rational/logic analysis because he seems to acknowledge the unreality of transcendence. <br><br>One thing I wished to add was that this figurative language, the suggestion in it, the suspense as you call it, might be McCarthy&#039;s way of implying presence of gnosis.

Language. All the great philosophers with great insights into the nature of being/world came to their final understanding when they finally had the words to express those insights. The permutation of words can deliver &quot;gnosis&quot;, if there is one to deliver. That&#039;s what Blood meridian seems to be trying, but mediated through the desert and the glanton gang and the Judge. It sounds ridiculous but the title is an homage to Jacob Boehme, who also has one epigraph at the beginning of the book, and Boehme started writing visionary books about art, creativity, philosophy etc. after witnessing the sun reflected off a pewter dish. The absurdity of the book&#039;s meditation is also an homage to the absurdity of Boehme&#039;s artistic inspiration.

It&#039;s like seeing an incredibly beautiful girl and suddenly all other girls pale in comparison. I think this painful feeling is multiplied 10 fold in the book, Mizoguchi sees the one thing he thinks is the most beautiful thing in existence (the temple) and all of a sudden he turns into a small ugly bug in comparison. Beauty&#039;s terrible it&#039;s always above you. Nothing&#039;s beautiful without you degrading yourself in someway. You degrade yourself to appreciate a beautiful sunset, or a starry night sky, otherwise they would just be plain images. And when you&#039;re beautiful yourself, it&#039;s always fleeting.

I am not personally convinced they are there yet. <br>St. Francis de Sales described a long, steep ladder to Jesus and a shorter, easier one that reaches Mary, then proceeds onward to Jesus. This metaphor can also apply to a good church. Church isn\u2019t necessary to establish a relationship with Christ but it can be sufficient. The sacraments are a very big part of that and they are where apostolic succession really matters. <br>I go to an Orthodox church because I take my kids there. My personal practice is very rooted in the Rosary, the Psalms and the Sacred Heart. It\u2019s taken me to some pretty good places. The Jesus Prayer is much better known in Orthodox circles but there is still an Orthodox variant of the Rosary fwiw. I read both Roman and Orthodox writers and have gotten plenty out of each. <br>If you are serious about church and serious about finding the true/best church, my two cents is examine your motives, get good with Christ, pray to the Spirit for discernment, then go and see. I could recommend books (ask again if this nonanswer doesn\u2019t satisfy) but they won\u2019t capture what your local clergy and congregation are actually like.

He challenges us not to think of the real, but to think from the One, its how or its according to. Philosophy cannot access an outside view on itself without incorporating that point into its conceptual horizons (hence metaphysics). If everything is philosophically interpretable, then the world is the specular object for philosophy, which in turn makes philosophy the world-thought. Philosophy can never lead us to the real because the real is inherently non-philosophisable, and exists beyond the decisional matrix of philosophy. But to think from the One is to be indifferent (and anterior) to Decision in all its forms, which includes necessity and contingency. There is no need to refute one or the other because, when thinking from the One, the other is determined in the last instance by the One.

This lack, noted by Hegel and his successors, concerns the ontological and transcendental underpinnings of Kant&#039;s concepts of experience; the pure, transcendental, a priori nature of his categories. As Kant does not draw these from experience, Dewey criticizes him as producing a rift between the existentially real world and the perceiving knower. Dewey feels that Kant, in searching for a solution as to how to bring the two realms together, strikes upon the idea of a transcendental self. This self brings itself to bear upon sense-material through the categories of understanding. These categories are pure, a priori logical rules for the ordering of sensory material (intuitions). An experience is created when the two realms are conjoined. The ideal realm of the categories is parasitic upon the real realm of sensory material. And this poses a dilemma. For the categories to function in the construction of an experience, they must have prima facie an object at their disposal, and an idea of what the object should be that does not itself participate in the construction of the experience. They must, in short, have an idea of the object that is predetermined in its form. This, suggests Dewey, drives Kant to the conclusion that there must be a noumenal object that is not experienced, that serves as an ideal object for the construction of all possible objects in experience.&quot;<br><br>J.S.
