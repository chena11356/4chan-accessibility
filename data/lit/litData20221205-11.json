We got acquainted during a common hobby and a year later or so we were basically engaged. Several more families arose from same hobby circle, so far nobody is divorced or outwardly unhappy.<br>But before that I had a short dating streak so hilariously bad I considered to go full monk mode and renounce thots. These were all times I sought out women by their looks and distance because I was horny like a goat, and those women were be very low value yet treated me even worse.<br>Take away: do not pursue women as mates on purpose, find some live or just semi-online hobby circles agreeable to your interests, engage in collective activities for the sake of activities. Eventually some fitting woman will latch onto you and you will be happy of the occasion.<br>I think a growing lack of safe public spaces makes such natural unions rare, plus social media cancer can turn vulnerable women into sluts. Somehow we are to find groups or places that are not psy ops promises nor a marketing ploy. Something vaguely church-affiliated is low risk. <br>I treat the Church more like a beneficial corporation than some universal body of Christ one must dead-set join and practice weekly communion and five plus daily prayers - you aren&#039;t a bishop wannabe, just checking if your local parish has some pilgrimage tourism or book reading clubs etc.<br>You can just be a &quot;cultural christian&quot; and participate in local activities without being a master in theology. Christian-aligned people are simply more predictable with their denouncing slutdom and greed, thus you like to stay close and keep your business with predictable people. No need to become a Jesuit and receive daily instructions from the College of Cardinals.<br><br>Another way is to consider moving into a small town if you can get a decent real life job there.

A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, including the poetry of William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native South West England.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, he gained fame as the author of novels such as Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d&#039;Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy&#039;s poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H.

In order to understand it, one must first get a grasp of Mishima&#039;s psyche.<br><br>The most central and foundational part of his life, from which everything else flowed, was that he was a giant attention-whoring faggot queen.<br><br>This is not to be confused with his homosexuality; his homosexuality is incidental rather than constitutive, but nonetheless derived from the fact that he was a giant attention-whoring faggot queen, namely via the fact that women are not capable of the boundless adoration and worship that men are, necessitating that Mishima become a homosexual to satisfy his giant attention-whoring faggot queen impulses by being adored and worshipped by those most capable of it, i.e. men.<br><br>The same fundamental explanation goes for his books, with all their boring bourgeois pseudo-transgression, expertly tip-toeing the exact line between a harmless eccentricity vis-a-vis social norms, attracting large crowds on account of its peculiarity and shocking nature to pearl-clutching normies, but never once crossing the line into real transgression, something that would alienate the normie crowds whose adoration his narcissism fed from. Oh wow, the character killed a cat and seems indifferent, very transgressive, such symbol.<br><br>However, this not being enough to satisfy his giant attention-whoring faggot queen impulses, he established the perfect situation for himself with his poorly attempted coup: either he would succeed and be the primus motor of a return to imperial Japan, or he would fail and spectacularly kill himself. Both options would secure him a place in the history books, satisfying his giant attention-whoring faggot queen impulses. It could not fail, or so Mishima thought.<br><br>In a pure show of ironic force crafted by the hand of God himself, his feeble 5&#039;1 body was not capable of producing enough volume in his voice, in the speech to instigate the coup, for the soldiers below the balcony to hear him - it cannot be stressed enough what a fundamental and metaphysical failure this was for the faggot queen who craved nothing but attention. One can only speculate, but it is possible that this alone was enough for his seppuku to be motivated by more than attention-whoring, that he felt, for once, actual shame. Even further getting blown the fuck out by God, his backup plan, that would honorably remove him from this world in a faggy-aesthetic way, failed - his secondary, who was to decapitate him after he had disemboweled himself, was too weak to do so, and tried three times to separate head from body, failing each time.<br><br>In short: he did it to satisfy his narcissist, faggot queen urges; what he attained instead was becoming a joke so sophisticated and perfect that it must have come about by divine intervention.<br><br>Never post on /lit/ again.", "time": 1670250202, "resto": 21343601}, {"no": 21345178, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:30:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21343876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21343876</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cpissbaby\u201d</span><br><a href=\"#p21343905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21343905</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cterminally online\u201d</span><br><a href=\"#p21345158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21345158</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cfaggot queen\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;total meltdown</span>", "filename": "61572D5D-E43F-4A0C-BD08-37E545FA5E6D", "ext": ".png", "w": 1111, "h": 851, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 95, "tim": 1670250629915839, "time": 1670250629, "md5": "5E3soJtInPO45ZDmCilk3Q==", "fsize": 122134, "resto": 21343601}, {"no": 21345190, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:34:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21343876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21343876</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;responds by throwing a tantrum</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calls anyone else a pissbaby</span><br><br>Incel moment.", "time": 1670250872, "resto": 21343601}, {"no": 21345191, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)09:34:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21345178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21345178</a><br>My words now live inside your mind.

According to their judgment the predicates: &quot;grudge&quot; and &quot;envy&quot; fit only the nature of the evil Eris, and for this reason they do not hesitate to designate these verses as spurious or thrown by chance into this place. For that judgment however a system of ethics other than the Hellenic must have inspired these scholars unawares; for in these verses to the good Eris Aristotle finds no offence. And not only Aristotle but the whole Greek antiquity thinks of spite and envy otherwise than we do and agrees with Hesiod, who first designates as an evil one that Eris who leads men against one another to a hostile war of extermination, and secondly praises another Eris as the good one, who as jealousy, spite, envy, incites men to activity but not to the action of war to the knife but the action of competition. The Greek is envious and conceives of this quality not as a blemish, but as the effect of a beneficent deity. What a gulf of ethical judgment between us and him? Because he is envious he also feels, with every superfluity of honour, riches, splendour and fortune, the envious eye of a god resting on himself, and he fears this envy; in this case the latter reminds him of the transitoriness of every human lot; he dreads his very happiness and, sacrificing the best of it, he bows before the divine envy. This conception does not perhaps estrange him from his gods; their significance on the contrary is expressed by the thought that with them man in whose soul jealousy is enkindled against every other living being, is never allowed to venture into competition. In the fight of Thamyris with the Muses, of Marsyas with Apollo, in the heart-moving fate of Niobe appears the horrible opposition of the two powers, who must never fight with one another, man and god.</span>", "time": 1670248133, "resto": 21340617}, {"no": 21345080, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:50:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21345075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21345075</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The greater and more sublime however a Greek is, the brighter in him appears the ambitious flame, devouring everybody who runs with him on the same track. Aristotle once made a list of such competitions on a large scale; among them is the most striking instance how even a dead person can still incite a living one to consuming jealousy; thus for example Aristotle designates the relation between the Kolophonian Xenophanes and Homer. We do not understand this attack on the national hero of poetry in all its strength, if we do not imagine, as later on also with Plato, the root of this attack to be the ardent desire to step into the place of the overthrown poet and to inherit his fame. Every great Hellene hands on the torch of the competition; at every great virtue a new light is kindled. If the young Themistocles could not sleep at the thought of the laurels of Miltiades so his early awakened bent released itself only in the long emulation with Aristides in that uniquely noteworthy, purely instinctive genius of his political activity, which Thucydides describes. How characteristic are both question and answer, when a notable opponent of Pericles is asked, whether he or Pericles was the better wrestler in the city, and he gives the answer: &quot;Even if I throw him down he denies that he has fallen, attains his purpose and convinces those who saw him fall.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If one wants to see that sentiment unashamed in its naive expressions, the sentiment as to the necessity of competition lest the state&#039;s welfare be threatened, one should think of the original meaning of ostracism, as for example the Ephesians pronounced it at the banishment of Hermodor. &quot;Among us nobody shall be the best; if however someone is the best, then let him be so elsewhere and among others&quot; [Heraklitus]. Why should not someone be the best? Because with that the competition would fail, and the eternal life-basis of the Hellenic state would be endangered. Later on ostracism receives quite another position with regard to competition; it is applied, when the danger becomes obvious that one of the great competing politicians and party-leaders feels himself urged on in the heat of the conflict towards harmful and destructive measures and dubious coups d&#039;\u00e9tat. The original sense of this peculiar institution however is not that of a safety-valve but that of a stimulant. The all-excelling individual was to be removed in order that the competition of forces might re-awaken, a thought which is hostile to the &quot;exclusiveness&quot; of genius in the modern sense but which assumes that in the natural order of things there are always several geniuses which incite one another to action, as much also as they hold one another within the bounds of moderation. That is the kernel of the Hellenic competition-conception: it abominates autocracy, and fears its dangers; it desires as a preventive against the genius--a second genius.</span>", "time": 1670248206, "resto": 21340617}, {"no": 21345085, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)08:53:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21345080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21345080</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every natural gift must develop itself by competition. Thus the Hellenic national pedagogy demands, whereas modern educators fear nothing as much as the unchaining of the so-called ambition. Here one fears selfishness as the &quot;evil in itself&quot;--with the exception of the Jesuits, who agree with the Ancients and who, possibly, for that reason, are the most efficient educators of our time. They seem to believe that selfishness, i.e., the individual element is only the most powerful agens but that it obtains its character as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; essentially from the aims towards which it strives. To the Ancients however the aim of the agonistic education was the welfare of the whole, of the civic society. Every Athenian, for instance, was to cultivate his ego in competition, so far that it should be of the highest service to Athens and should do the least harm. It was not unmeasured and immeasurable as modern ambition generally is; the youth thought of the welfare of his native town when he vied with others in running, throwing or singing; it was her glory that he wanted to increase with his own; it was to his town&#039;s gods that he dedicated the wreaths which the umpires as a mark of honour set upon his head. Every Greek from childhood felt within himself the burning wish to be in the competition of the towns as an instrument for the welfare of his own town; in this his selfishness was kindled into flame, by this his selfishness was bridled and restricted. Therefore the individuals in antiquity were freer, because their aims were nearer and more tangible. Modern man, on the contrary, is everywhere hampered by infinity, like the fleet-footed Achilles in the allegory of the Eleate Zeno: infinity impedes him, he does not even overtake the tortoise.</span><br><br>tl;dr: the Greeks were a hyper-competitive people.

Let&#039;s share all the books we read this year. What where the highlights, the lows, the interesting and the weird? <br><br>Highlights. I absolutely adored Bel Ami. I had only read a handful of short stories and essays by him before this but I am now fully on board the Maupassant train. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman is probably the funniest book I have ever read. Not only did I laugh loudly very often but even when I was silent I was always incredibly amused. Barthes is maybe the best writer of essays I&#039;ve ever read. The charm, insight, and virtuosic prose is next to none. It&#039;s also delightful to read him describe things that you have no interest in to see how he imbues them with real power, such as competitive cycling and professional (I.E. fake) wrestling. <br>Don Quixote is an obvious one. Enjoyed every page and enjoyed it greatly. Plutarch&#039;s Lives is not something I think I will ever reread from cover to cover ever again but I can see myself reread individual biographies very often. Anytime I ever encounter a figure from this book in another piece of media I can see myself coming back here to read its chapter. <br><br>Interesting. Etruscan Places takes me to almost the end of Lawrence&#039;s travel writings. I think I prefer his travel writings to anything else he wrote. It&#039;s effectively an essay but there are characters and small scale events. It&#039;s lean, straight to the point, and compelling in its ideas while also being engaging. Rabelais&#039; biography by France really is a love letter. The author is deeply in love with the man, his writings, and the whole project of humanism, and this enthusiasm is wrapped up in lovely picturesque descriptions of renaissance France and Italy. Beautiful Boys/Outlaw Bodies is a history and analysis of the men who specialise in playing women&#039;s roles in Kabuki theatre. It&#039;s so weird it almost makes me feel like I&#039;m reading in some heavy world-building chapters in a sci-fi novel. <br><br>Disappointments. Orlando. I really wanted to like this novel. I love Woolf but it&#039;s obvious (and true) that this novel was something she wrote very quickly between more serious novels as I way to unwind. Enticing at first but wears out its welcome around a 1/4 way through and it is a very short novel. Due to a lapse in memory I thought that Raymond Carver and Raymond Chandler were the same person. I started The Big Sleep thinking of Carver whom I have some fondness for. Unfortunately I was wrong and Chandler&#039;s The Big Sleep is maybe the worst book I have any memory of having ever read in my life bar things from my childhood.

I am sure that there must be monks who have reached the highest goal, however, although they probably don&#039;t talk about their experience.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;faith does not preclude direct experience of God. In fact I would argue that true faith requires at least some direct experience of God, however faint or pale.</span><br>Then that&#039;s not faith. Although no one says that you MUST have faith if you have knowledge - it is just assumed by default that most people have no knowledge of God. I relate to what you are saying because I myself never could have faith, though I did want to believe in something - then, after my studies in esotericism, I arrived at certain knowledge, and now I feel the existence of God as a fact. Though living in a divine way is a separate and much more difficult problem than that.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I get that Western Christianity particularly in Evola&#039;s time had sort of strayed from direct experience. But it&#039;s all there in the Christian tradition, particularly Eastern Christianity (which even the Catholic Church has always acknowledged as wholly valid)</span><br>Evola actually acknowledged the merits of the ascetic monastic orders - the real tragedy is everyone else. The vast majority of Christians everywhere are basically unconscious atheists. Not that non-Christians are any better, but still. In Christianity the particularly saddening thing is that the religion is now being used for other degenerative purposes instead of being a pillar of tradition.<br>I am not sure what your point is in bringing up the definition of esotericism as I do not see how it is relevant to our argument. I am generally in agreement that esotericism refers not to something deliberately hidden, but simply to that which is difficult to obtain - Evola would also agree, and he believed that self-initiation was also possible, though almost impossibly unlikely.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rather, isn&#039;t faith simply transcendent truth at the level of finite knowledge?</span><br>I suppose? I don&#039;t really concern myself with faith anymore. My impression would be that faith is a practical tool for linking up people who lack knowledge with knowledge. As the Hindu sages say - if you do not believe the spiritual masters, then attain spiritual mastery and see for yourself if it is like they say it is. As for everyone else, they are forced to believe. Beliefs solves the practical problem of the arduous nature of asceticism on both individual and collective level.", "time": 1670242610, "resto": 21336641}, {"no": 21344910, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21344775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21344775</a><br>On what can it be blamed on?", "time": 1670243481, "resto": 21336641}, {"no": 21344916, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)07:33:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21344835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21344835</a><br>I kinda think there is no real esoteric, initiatic tradition.

How the fuck did it win the Man Booker Prize? Other than the details about the Our Gang films, everything in this novel was just one cliche after another. This novel says nothing about race relations that hadn&#039;t already been said in 2014-era Slate or on a black comedy special. The boy&#039;s father&#039;s psychological experiments are just reenactments of the Milgram experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the Kitty Genovese incident, and every other sensational case study that has penetrated American pop culture. The author describes in great detail particular racist cartoons that most people who would be interested in reading a novel like this probably already know about. The author interpolates rap lyrics into the story and expects the reader to clap like a seal for noticing. The main character, a middle class, subtextually homosexual black male with academic parents who fancies himself a street wise hoodlum, feels the need to genuflect to feminism and acknowledge that other races are oppressed too, giving his rage at white supremacy a sickening corporate sheen. I was not at all shocked, as I think I was supposed to be, by our hero having a slave who called him massa or by his project to resegreate buses and schools; maybe that&#039;s my problem for being to jaded, but it really is hard to describe how banal this novel is.

Still, I find it a bit of an oversimplification, and I think the role of the artist could be, on the historical level, be understood as a wave that moves closer or further away from the &quot;common craftsman&quot;, depending on the era and the artform in question. E.g. it certainly was the closest in the middle ages in all arts.<br>Already Plato/Socrates recognised some sort of &quot;unnatural&quot; quality of the poets (thinking of certain passages in Apology, more extensively shown in Ion), their value coming not from them as rational workers but as vessels of something else (gods, muses).<br>The eminent French classicist critic Boileau considered that a great poet needs both rational, technical skill/craftsmanship, as well as some special talent, granted to the poet by the stars/fate. Without that fateful element, there&#039;s no great poetry.<br>So I think these are already the building blocks of the (post-)romantic artist; romanticism simply put together the different concepts and terms, put them into a new whole, or amplified them beyond previously imaginable measures. E.g. the romanticist may be obsessed with originality, such as <a href=\"/lit/thread/21343376#p21343376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21343376</a>, but even Vergil was criticised for his unoriginality in his lifetime.<br>Just to correct Coemgenus: there was no strong distinction between poets and dramatists, both were considered to be simply poets (poetry = literary *creation*) or authors, so e.g. on the first pages of the First Folio Ben Jonson writes a poem &quot;To the memory of my beloued, / The AVTHOR / MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE&quot;, and Hugh Holland than writes a poem &quot;Vpon the Lines and Life of the Famour Scenicke Poet, Master WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE&quot;. I also think, the novelists appeared when the new, at the very least proto-romanticist paradigm, was already arising (XVIII c.), so they would probably be included among the other literary artists, though lower in rank at first.", "time": 1670208688, "resto": 21343284}, {"no": 21343841, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)22:40:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21343284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21343284</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OH<wbr>8wtTdJT4", "time": 1670211648, "resto": 21343284}], "last_modified": 1670211648}]}]
