Straight to ass and she had three orgasms. I was prolonging my time plumbing her depths, her in the prone position with one leg bent askew, when she said I\u2019d better cum soon. I told her I could spend all night like this and was doing nice long and slow strokes, going almost all the way out and plunging back in, when she lifted her foot so it was against my ass and pulled me forward so I was going balls deep and harder. I took the cue and absolutely pummelled her turdcutter, fast and balls deep without regard, just stretching her o-ring and punching her colon. I normally treat her ass with sensuous care because while she likes anal it is obviously an asymmetrical act of pleasure so I make sure to be respectful and gentle. But this time I threw both prudent caution and sphincter elasticity to the wind and went at her like a pornstar, going as deep as I could with fast, hard dominating lunges.<br><br>It ended as these things usually do with my creamy coup de grace consisting of shooting thick ropes deep inside her ass. Now usually the sensation of cum in her ass leaves her running instantly to the bathroom, much to my chagrin as I would like her to cumfart on my still rigid member and balls (she refuses). But this time, immediately after depositing in her repository, I just kept with nice long and gently but firm stokes with my weight against her and her sucking two fingers on my left hand. She said she had to go to the bathroom and I said to wait and, ladies and gentlemen, I finally came two times consecutively in her turdcutter. A momentous occasion for me. No cumfart but given my refractory period I didn\u2019t care, I lay with heaving chest while I heard the most exquisitely liquid fart coming from the adjoined bathroom and her exclaim \u201coh my god\u201d which preceded another sloppy squeal. I lay there, panting and smiling with lube-covered genitalia, thinking that life was pretty good so long as you took the time to reflect and inventory the good parts.<br><br>I slept in and woke up to my sweet girlfriend passing me a coffee.

Suddenly, like a chestnut falling out of a burr, he was shed naked and glistening on to a soft, fecund earth, leaving behind him the hard rind of worldly knowledge and experience. He heard it in the huckster\u2019s cries, the noise of carts, the calling of children. And it was all like the hard, shed rind, discarded.

This law, they tell us, was made by an excellent king who had more regard to the riches of his country than to his own wealth, and therefore provided against the heaping up of so much treasure as might impoverish the people.

He also thought that it was a good provision for that free circulation of money so necessary for the course of commerce and exchange.

Rand has a lot of opponents but the most vocal are the east coast elites stuck in their own liberal orthodoxy that hasn&#039;t changed since &#039;68. Anything that challenges that orthodoxy will always be the source of endless rage by those types. On the subject of Nietzsche, polarization of his philosophy is more of an internet phenomenon than an academic one. Academic types have fierce debates on how to interpret his work of course but they all acknowledge his influence on the general discourse. The arguments stem from each individual&#039;s personal upbringings. It is a completely different case for the internet. Internet forums have a propensity for contrarianism of the highest order so Nietzsche&#039;s critics will just downright reject his work entirely. This leads Nietzsche&#039;s defenders to take the entire opposite course of action. Essentially a battle of idiots debating concepts they do not understand. This leads to widespread polarization when there shouldn&#039;t be as much.", "time": 1671437003, "resto": 21401627}, {"no": 21403295, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:04:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21401627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21401627</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Easy to read</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Really makes you think.epub</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Usually among the first serious books a young adult reads</span><br>They just imprint on them is all.

You&#039;re not really a &quot;revolutionary&quot; type.

The only thing that would make a &quot;lemming&quot; fight is if they believe that what they have will be taken from them; for example, when black people riot in the streets because the media uses agitprop to make them feel as if they could be killed at any moment by police officers.

any incoming information to see if it originated from a woman in any way, and then I immediately shut myself off and refuse to consider it if it did originate from a woman. At first I did this just as a joke but it started improving my life so much I started doing it more. You can add in secondary layer of exception-granting for special cases, like the woman is a statistical anomaly or Emily Dickinson or something, or you are in a brief functional situation like exchanging information with a bank employee and just need to be pleasant.

Take the Poet Laureate seat, for example. Every single one is a solid poet, some better than others, but even so, just one glance at the list and it is clear the politics of race play a role. However, on the flip side of that, the politics of race have excluded even more than they&#039;ve included. I do believe the pendulum has swung too far to the other side at this point, but at the time Morrison was coming to fame, it was predominantly on the basis of two things - her skill and her very open feelings on race as a window into the pain of a Black woman for White people. At least, that&#039;s how I see her. Shortly after, you may or may not remember, but Hollywood had a strong desire to pay tribute to the plight of Native Americans which went on for about a decade (the 90s). I don&#039;t have anything wrong with that. I think there&#039;s a lot we can all gain, on everyside, from examining the difficulties of one another&#039;s lives. My problem is that the recent trend is one of unjust vengeance, rather than brotherhood, or at least countrymen. On that note, I own Morrison&#039;s, &quot;Beloved,&quot; but haven&#039;t gotten into it yet, though I&#039;ve tried to start it before. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean much. I tried to watch Jacques Tati&#039;s, &quot;Playtime,&quot; three times before I actually got into it, and now I regard it as a masterpiece of modern cinema - the Book of Leviticus and of Numbers are other good examples of my initially unappreciated gems. I did want to mention, however, I once read an excerpt from a book of hers on here - Song of Solomon, I think. I found it exceptionally racist and distateful. I would never approve of something like that - no matter the race of the author. I&#039;m not okay with racism against anyone. <br><br>In case it isn&#039;t clear, my answer is: I think she&#039;s a talented writer whose race and time certainly played a role - as it does for most authors. I&#039;ve heard it said, &quot;An author is necessarily of his time,&quot; and the 1980s, the period I believe she came to fame during, were the first time in American history a generation of Black children were reaching adulthood in true freedom, and the gold line of dawn began to show. You may notice Black sung patriotic ballads were hailed in those years... Anyway, I haven&#039;t read enough of her to judge, because it hasn&#039;t yet resonated with me, despite her talent as a writer. <br><br>What do you think of her?", "time": 1671451002, "resto": 21403616}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21370500, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)10:27:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In what works does Evola rail against Christianity?

Tomberg expresses the power of God&#039;s love as a symbol that can reconcile the paradox of dualism better than a &quot;pointless&quot; maya/samsara can, in the chapter of Meditations on the Tarot on the High Priestess.<br><br><a href=\"#p21372062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21372062</a><br>Yeah Guenon was surprisingly optimistic about &quot;the East,&quot; in a very general sense, still having intact traditions.

Most middle class people in developing nations want nothing more than to move to the West or bring its conditions to their home country, so they can have electric tea kettles and anime pocket pussies and their own &quot;India&#039;s Got Talent&quot; show, and most upper class people have been turned into cancer cells who enslave their own people just so they can be nouveau riche by Western standards, and send their pathetic third world zoomer children to Oxford or Harvard to get a meaningless degree for prestige. <br><br>There are esoteric theories that Central and South America are tainted by some kind of fucked up ley lines, which may explain why the countries of those regions have never been able to fend off demonic influences and establish healthy societies (although some like Peron may have been trying). I think the big test cases are Japan and India. Japan is going to be full scale assaulted soon, and India is a wildcard, maybe this will be an Indian century if they can hold onto their shit (no pun intended) and become the new metaphysical bulwark against whatever techno-slave armies start pouring out of the Gates of Alexander soon.<br><br>https://www.bitchute.com/video/MqxS<wbr>o4RGkXQh/<br><br><a href=\"#p21373235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373235</a><br>I hadn&#039;t read it before so just read it, I think it&#039;s very typical of the Traditionalist view of Christianity while also being even-handed. But because it&#039;s typical of the Traditionalist view, it&#039;s very exclusivist in measuring everything against jnana, and in Evola&#039;s case, against the tantric &quot;active&quot; path. Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Essentially, Traditionalism&#039;s critique of Christianity is very similar to the Theravada critique of Mahayana Buddhism&#039;s soteriological and eschatological elements. <br><br>But these criticisms potentially force Traditionalism itself into a passive and quietistic position, which it is supposedly criticizing Christianity for. If there is no collective mystery or collective quest for redemption or struggle against Satan, if religions can&#039;t have an eschatological, soteriological, world historical character, because the only real truth lies in the universal metaphysical truth attained through individual initiation, then why bother fighting the occult war at all? In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

Guenon and Evola both emphasize that there is nothing &quot;moral&quot; in what they are doing, and that the vulgar sentimental and moral religion of everyday faithful is merely exoteric, basically its only value is containing dumbed down versions of symbols that keep ordinary people anchored in their Traditional-Platonic republics, while maintaining pathways of symbolic ascent for talented individuals to pursue to their eventual initiation. But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions. Similarly Traditionalism doesn&#039;t want to taint itself with mere samsaric, dogmatic, sentimental, tribal superstitions.

Ironically it ends up &quot;confusing the planes&quot; itself, by assuming that the only thing between man and the Absolute is this metaphysical hierarchy of symbols, and that there are no other beings with plans for us, that the cosmos is a cyclically autorenewing stage on which a few Guenons and Evolas periodically become immortal (for what? where do they go? if it&#039;s just to a purified paradisiacal state, isn&#039;t that what they criticize Christianity for promising?). Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active. From this perspective, Evola and Guenon would be doing exactly what they criticize New Agers for doing: stripping people of their everyday protections and throwing them into trans-personal psychic experiences in which they will simply be subject to whatever forces are nearby. <br><br>In rejecting all claims to revelation as contingent and samsaric, Traditionalism also misses out on the possibility of a symbolic interpretation of &quot;dispensationalist&quot; revelation, in which history is not merely samsaric and cyclical, and attaining enlightenment is not merely optional and always potentially open to amoral initiates, and the occult war is not merely a particularly bad patch in the most recent kali yuga in an infinite cycle of them, but instead, history is not cylical, there is a fixed goal here, there are win and lose conditions, enlightenment is not just &quot;available&quot; to initiates but is a responsibility and a duty, and thus enabling others to be enlightened is also a duty, etc.", "time": 1670832087, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of them<br>start with the mystery of the grail", "time": 1670832095, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373699, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21370825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21370825</a><br>Evola was influenced by the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich so it&#039;s not like he disregarded all protestantism.", "time": 1670832118, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373700, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373697</a><br>And therefore, the mythic-eschatological content of a religion like Christianity, with its publically available emphasis on resisting Satan and imitating Christ in daily life, is not just an incidental exoteric form of symbols that are only really relevant to autistic initiates, there is actually a purpose to the &quot;opening&quot; of the mysteries, which, yes, vulgarized them from a certain perspective, but perhaps only because this was analogous to sprinkling thousands of seeds, formerly been contained in neatly condensed form in individual pots, over a huge field of soil and manure, so that at first they seem merely &quot;lost,&quot; but in time they grow and become many thousands of fruit-bearing, seed-bearing trees themselves? <br><br>If all of history can be interpreted symbolically in this way, then we can begin to ask questions that the Traditionalists are afraid to ask: What does it MEAN, using symbolic interpretation and sympathetic intuition, that Christ figures appeared and managed to embed moral messages and fundamentally change history, turning pagan Europe into a moral and even sentimental Christian Europe - which Evola can only view as an aberration, from his Traditionalist perspective?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

But personality and freedom are symbolically analogous to history: apparent contingency that can contain or reflect symbolic truth. Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence.

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function. To unite with God means more than to honour him in your heart - it means to become one with him, literally, and consequently also transcend everything, as he does. That&#039;s henosis. If you don&#039;t reach that level, you are still dealing with manifestation rather than with the source, the essence.", "time": 1671013978, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21382633, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382153</a><br>I can see why that apply to Abrahamic religions, but i dont get why Evola (and Guenon too) then do not offer the same criticism to Islam, which also relies on faith, a fallen view of man, and the inadequacy of man without God.", "time": 1671028721, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21383195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382633</a><br>It&#039;s because Islam has institutionalised Sufism which knows much higher metaphysical heights than exoteric Islam.

They spend more attention and time on Islam than on anything else, and almost all the major figures heavily specialise in Islam and constantly promote it or support Islamic groups. The ones that are not pro-Muslim are just vaguely perennialist, which would be fine if the rest weren&#039;t so heavily pro-Muslim.

As one sort of example there is a greater emphasis on monastic renunciation in Advaita compared to other types of Hinduism (just like in original Buddhism this was a big emphasis), but even in the other Hindu schools where ascetic renunciation is not required or isn&#039;t seen as the main spiritual path (like in Advaita) it&#039;s still typically seen as a respected thing that a minority of adherents of that school engages in regardless.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Does the idea of the illusory world form part of both doctrines?</span><br>It&#039;s not clear in what way Buddha meant to say the world is illusory or possibly that our perception/view of it is, some Buddhist schools interpret him as saying so but others disagree.

According to Shankara, objects exist conventionally in a mind-independent way and he says there is no rational grounds for denying that they are mind-independent. Shankara only accepts the dream-analogy to the extent that it can be used to undermine belief that the waking world is itself the actual true reality (instead of Brahman being reality) but he does *not* accept it as a valid basis for rejecting the independence of exterior objects from the mind and he instead calls this irrational. <br><br>&quot;Consequently, Sankara\u2019s attempt is not to show that Vasnbnndhu is wrong in rejecting proof of externality, for Sankara himself accepts that rejection. To say that Sankara\u2019s argument does not prove that externality exists would be to miss the point His attempt, rather, is to show that Vasubandhu is wrong to reject the assumption of externality in any account of experience. So, the argument is over whether a coherent account of experience can be given while rejecting the externality of objects\u2018 i.e., without referring to objects as extrinsic to cognition.

Sometimes, a particular lineage of teaching Advaita will teach a certain mantra to recite or meditation to perform that will a supplementary practice that one can do when not studying Advaita texts, but this differs by lineage and it&#039;s never taught to be what produces liberation itself (which happens via knowledge and not an act) but it is only supplementary. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apart from the liberaion through gnosis what sort of practices form part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition?</span><br>They will do things like hatha yoga or worship deities.

But, again, on its face. It makes much more sense, and waves away many of the dilemmas of Buddhism and questions commonly posed to Buddhists which are difficult to answer except with logical contortions and strange logic (\u201cWhat reincarnates if there is no self?\u201d \u201cWho is there to be enlightened, to experience nirvana or samsara?\u201d).<br><br>Mahayana Buddhism even had to take a detour away from strict anatta (no-self) teachings with the \u201cBuddha-nature\u201d, the tath\u0101gatagarbha (embryo (garbha) of the tath\u0101gata (lit. \u201cthus-gone\u201d, or the Buddha)). Historically, the phrase dharmakaya (body of truth, the unmanifested immaterial substratum of the Buddha out of which Buddhas arise and to which they return) has also conventionally been used as a \u201chigher self\u201d or \u201csource of enlightenment\u201d to understand, return to, and abide in.", "time": 1671208268, "resto": 21385199}, {"no": 21392032, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)11:39:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21392013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21392013</a><br>Anon, it must be true if it doesn&#039;t make sense.

The whole point in his criticism of Yogachara is that in Shankara&#039;s view there is no rational and consistent way to give a coherent account of experience and how it comes about while denying that objects are extra-mental and that the Yogachara enterprise is flawed for this reason, among others.

Most Hindus don&#039;t believe that buddha is an incarnation of a godhead, not sure where that anon got that particular view from. The farthest that I&#039;ve seen hindu doctrine go to say that buddha was an incarnation of some deity is that he was an incarnation of the deity Budha, which is the planetary deity of Mercury, this is usually based on some vedic astrology arguments but I&#039;m not too familiar with vedic astrology.<br>2. Ancient brahminical vedism and hinduism are not the same thing and hinduism arguably isn&#039;t even one religion but multiple ones under one label, the idea of a &quot;hinduism&quot; didn&#039;t exist pre-colonial india.<br>3. The vedas do contain the ideas of rebirth, karma, meditation.<br>4. Upanishads cover a wide variety of ideas, and some upanishads reject more things from the vedas than buddhism does.<br>5. Concentration/absorption style practice as found in the yoga sutras may seem similar to buddhist practice of focus on breath, but is actually very different in practice. In the pali canon it is largely implied that collectedness of mind is very important for attaining jhanas, in the yoga sutras pure concentration is utilised instead. The samadhi and jhana states slightly differ as well, you can find adept meditators who have described how they differ online like Delson Armstrong. In other words, the meditation practices described in the pali canon are not pure concentration practices, even if commentaries like the visudhimaga interpreted them to be so. Vimalaramsi (a buddhist teacher) talks very in-depth on this subject.<br>6. The buddha did develop rebirth and meditation further but the development of these ideas was already underway in the early upanishads. Buddha also talks about in the pali canon about how he learnt meditation from several teachers iirc, which would seem to imply that meditation was a widespread practice already at the time of the buddha.<br>7.

It doesn\u2019t say that Buddha\u2019s teachings are good but it implies they are a false trick. Many Hindus apparently hear or read that Buddha is considered an incarnation of Vishnu, but very few are actually aware of the details of how this is described and what this entails and how it implies that Buddha\u2019s teachings are actually still bad and something to be cast aside. It also says that Vishnu appeared as the founder of Jainism as part of the same trick of fooling demons.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In order to defeat the demons ( daityas ) who had succeeded in obtaining great powers through religious austerities, Visnu came down to earth disguised as an ascetic and began teaching doctrines contrary to the Vedas.

Then, moving on to another group, he changed his outfit and, appearing as the Buddha, taught that animal sacrifices are immoral and so forth.

Second, it completely discredits the actual content of the doctrines of these two sects, by suggesting that the teachings of Buddhism and Jainism are intentionally false and nonsensical.

He&#039;s not serious.&quot; Me, I can put two aphorisms that are contradictory right next to each other. Aphorisms are also momentary truths. They&#039;re not decrees.

It consists, while knowing the hopelessness of life, in making use meanwhile of the advantages one has, disregarding the dragon and the mice, and licking the honey in the best way, especially if there is much of it within reach. Solomon expresses this way out thus: \u201cThen I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: and that this should accompany him in his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

Their circumstances furnish them with more of welfare than of hardship, and their moral dullness makes it possible for them to forget that the advantage of their position is accidental, and that not everyone can have a thousand wives and palaces like Solomon, that for everyone who has a thousand wives there are a thousand without a wife, and that for each palace there are a thousand people who have to build it in the sweat of their brows; and that the accident that has today made me a Solomon may tomorrow make me a Solomon\u2019s slave. The dullness of these people\u2019s imagination enables them to forget the things that gave Buddha no peace\u2014the inevitability of sickness, old age, and death, which today or tomorrow will destroy all these pleasures.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So think and feel the majority of people of our day and our manner of life. The fact that some of these people declare the dullness of their thoughts and imaginations to be a philosophy, which they call Positive, does not remove them, in my opinion, from the ranks of those who, to avoid seeing the question, lick the honey. I could not imitate these people; not having their dullness of imagination I could not artificially produce it in myself.

Escaping from the beast he gets into a dry well, but sees at the bottom of the well a dragon that has opened its jaws to swallow him. And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by the dragon, seizes s twig growing in a crack in the well and clings to it. His hands are growing weaker and he feels he will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that awaits him above or below, but still he clings on. Then he sees that two mice, a black one and a white one, go regularly round and round the stem of the twig to which he is clinging and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will snap and he will fall into the dragon&#039;s jaws. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while still hanging he looks around, sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the twig, reaches them with his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to lick the honey which formerly consoled me, but the honey no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung. I saw the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tasted sweet. I only saw the unescapable dragon and mice, and I could not tear my gaze from them. and this is not a fable but the real unanswerable truth intelligible to all. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me. No matter how often I may be told, &quot;You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,&quot; I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false. The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing -- art as I called it -- were no longer sweet to me. &quot;Family&quot;... said I to myself. But my family -- wife and children -- are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death.</span><br><br>Leo Tolstoy, A Confession", "time": 1671446779, "resto": 21401624}, {"no": 21403653, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)05:54:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403614</a><br>Oh oops, didn&#039;t mean for this post to be as a response to <a href=\"#p21403096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403096</a><br><a href=\"#p21403625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403625</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not everyone can have a thousand wives and palaces like Solomon</span><br>That&#039;s a good thing.

During this &quot;immediate aftermath&quot; period, even the black SNL actor/comedian Tracey Jordan exhorted authority figures to &quot;shake &#039;em down&quot;, referring to muslims in general. By which he meant not that they should be mistreated, but that they should be profiled and watched with respect to the specific sort of terrorism that they are wont to wage. (The later San Bernadino shooting, IIRC, also comes to mind). Jordan made this comment with some understanding of racism himself, and he was in the city at the time, so his feelings are sensible. It&#039;s true that there are many racial forms of terrorism, and the arab/muslim one was foremost in people&#039;s minds at the time.<br><br>In short, it was very culturally safe to be bigoted against muslims during the early 2000s, and with good reason.<br><br>For Hitchens, as for myself (a lifelong atheist, I was 17 years old at the time of the attacks so I have clear formative memory during the transition to adulthood, the event did much to shape and cement my worldview), 9/11 was a major cultural event which showcased the very worst of religion. Muslims fly planes into a building (yes, that is what actually took place) in part because they are aggrieved over occupation of their lands, but above all because, together with their generally lower intelligence, they are benighted and socialized into a backward and violent traditional culture which entails A FALSE PROPHET AND A FALSE GOD. In response to this, a christian blames the events on gays and feminism. You can make a fair argument that these groups are responsible for social decline, but Falwell&#039;s invocation within hours of the thing was still a disgusting display, mostly because it was irrelevant to why it had actually happened, because it assumed &quot;god&#039;s punishment&quot;. Third, a bunch of Scientologists cynically used the event to be little goody-two-shoes and volunteer as clean-up helpers while wearing identifying &quot;we are Scientologists&quot; vests. While having awareness of the Great Leap Forward and the Stalinist purges as atrocities waged by atheists (the religion in this case however was not atheism as such, but communism), 9/11 remains more convenient for myself as a formative display of the worst of religion. And let&#039;s not forget the jews, but given Hitchens&#039; stances, I don&#039;t know exactly how I want to go about assigning blame to them, apart from the general things like occupation of Israel and influence in American foreign policy.

It also saw the likes of Nicholas of Orseme and the Oxford Calculators who then inspired Gallileo to go against the heavy overreliance of Aristotle in Scholasticism 3 centuries later. Science is closely related to Scholasticism, but it is of a different mutated branch which had a healthy reliance on the teachings of Aristotle but in the realm of the natural world. Frankly, it succeded where a lot of theology failed: being succinct and not overrationalizing phenomena. Who cares whether demons were male/female or how many angels can fit on a pin of a nail? Unlike ethical questions related to theology or the broader nature of God in theology, these are just retarded inquiries whose answers don&#039;t affect how we should act in this life at all.

And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by the dragon, seizes s twig growing in a crack in the well and clings to it. His hands are growing weaker and he feels he will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that awaits him above or below, but still he clings on. Then he sees that two mice, a black one and a white one, go regularly round and round the stem of the twig to which he is clinging and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will snap and he will fall into the dragon&#039;s jaws. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while still hanging he looks around, sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the twig, reaches them with his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to lick the honey which formerly consoled me, but the honey no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung. I saw the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tasted sweet. I only saw the unescapable dragon and mice, and I could not tear my gaze from them. and this is not a fable but the real unanswerable truth intelligible to all. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me. No matter how often I may be told, &quot;You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,&quot; I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false. The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing -- art as I called it -- were no longer sweet to me. &quot;Family&quot;... said I to myself. But my family -- wife and children -- are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death.</span><br><br>Leo Tolstoy, A Confession", "time": 1671447135, "resto": 21403636}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21403187, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)02:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What is the most impenetrable book in any language?

Platonic ideals were in practice a matter of discourse rather than real claims. You see this especially in the later dialogues, as Socrates is pushed to develop his responses far beyond the scope of Republic where the philosophy of Plato in Laws is almost unrecognizable from Republic, yet it is still not meant to be a finished or definitive product.

The people you are describing are less a reality and more of a neoliberal fantasy. The world is run not by these people but by the vast boards of mega-corporations who concern themselves not with geopolitical strategy but, again, with MAKING MONEY. Just like your daddy, who is a grown up baby, not only detached from social responsibility but also any tangible form of meaningful relation to the world.<br><br>&quot;In the economy of free-trade capitalism, dominated by imperatives of production, wealth alone confers power and honour. Master of the means of production and of labour power, it controls the development of productive forces and consumer goods and thus its owners have the pick of the myriad fruits of an infinite progress. However, as this capitalism transforms itself into its contrary, state-planned economy, the prestige of the capitalist playing the market with his millions fades away and with it the caricature of the pot-bellied, cigar-puffing merchant of human flesh. Today we have managers, who derive their power from their talent for organization; and already computers are doing them out of a job. Managers, of course, do get their monthly paychecks but do they do anything worthwhile with them? Can they enjoy making their salary signify the wealth of possible choices before them: building a Xanadou, keeping a harem, cultivating flower-children? When all possibilities of consumption are already organized, how can wealth preserve its representable value? Under the dictatorship of consumer goods, money melts away like a snowball in hell. Its significance passes to objects with more representational value, more tangible objects better adapted to the spectacle of the welfare state&quot;", "time": 1671364317, "resto": 21391668}, {"no": 21399996, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:11:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21391668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21391668</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;honest thoughts?</span><br>There is no such thing as an honest thought.

What&#039;s the point of watching a serious anime or reading a manga like Berserk or Kingdom when they&#039;re honestly not that great? They&#039;re certainly good at what they do so long as you judge them only against other, similar series in their medium, but the moment you take a step back and compare them to something outside that medium, their flaws stand out much more, and they begin to just become so tiresome to trudge through knowing you could&#039;ve enjoying yourself much more if you had picked up a good novel instead. This is why it&#039;s important to focus on what each medium does best, and for anime that isn&#039;t Dark Fantasy, that isn&#039;t Mystery, and it&#039;s definitely not Historical Fiction. It&#039;s Slice of Life and Iyashikei; Ecchi, Moe, and Comedy. Let literature be what you read when you want a riveting story, when you want to learn and sometimes even come back with some very wise, immediately applicable life advice. Let anime and manga be where you go to relax, looking for comfort in the benign.

The second is a changeable and \u2018realistic\u2019 truth, which is forged case by case, often in apparent contrast with the first truth, and characterized by eventual compromises with the ideas of the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 world\u2026.

In Aristotle there are the material, the efficient, the formal, and the final cause. Every thing that exists or has come into existence has all four. The material is the substrate or components from which the thing is assembled. The efficient cause is the actual physical action in the world, taking place in time, that sets it in motion. This can be interpreted a bit loosely: If you roll clay into a ball, then the initial unformed clay is the material cause, but you yourself (specifically, your actions in time and space in relation to the clay) are the efficient cause of its coming to take the form you want. <br><br>But this is still an insufficient account of the how and why of the clay coming to be a ball. To explain that, we need to know WHAT form was &quot;impressed upon&quot; the material BY the efficient cause (the agent, you, who decided to make something come into being where previously there was something else). That&#039;s the formal cause. There are two kinds of formal causes. First, subjective ones, in the case of human actions like making clay into a ball or a unicorn or whatever else. In these cases, the form is simply a subjective mental image that the agent applies to the clay until it is formed. Second, objective ones, as natural objects or natural &quot;kinds&quot; are said to have their own concept as their form (in Aristotelian or Platonic realism). Thus there is no Aristotelian universal of &quot;a barn&quot; but there is a really existing concept of any natural form of being, as evidenced by the fact that is capable of imposing stable forms on matter. The most obvious example being the different species of animals. <br><br>But we still need to know WHY the agent chose to do this at all. That&#039;s the final cause, final in the sense of the &quot;end&quot; that was sought in acting. The final cause is the &quot;for the sake of which&quot; that underlies the whole coming-to-be of the thing. In the subjective case, this is the agent&#039;s overriding intent: &quot;I want to make a ball BECAUSE ...&quot; In the objective case, it is the natural &quot;tendency toward perfection,&quot; what will later be called the nisus formativus (formative force) or Lebenskraft (life-power) underlying the organism&#039;s coming-to-be-what-it-is, imposing-and-maintaining-one&#039;s-own-<wbr>form.", "time": 1671411077, "resto": 21401555}, {"no": 21402160, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)19:52:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21402152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21402152</a><br>In the Aristotelian system, these causes are all necessary to explain anything:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is it made from?

(efficient cause) </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does this happen at all? Why are the forces doing what they do?</span><br>The formal cause is analogous to a Platonic idea, but the final cause is necessary to explain WHY the ideas interact with unformed matter at all. If there is no explanation of this, then we could envision a world in which there are &quot;virtual&quot; immortal forms, and unformed matter, but the two don&#039;t interact. There needs to be something driving the process of accommodation between form and matter. <br><br>In the subjective case, this something is the intention of the actor, as we mentioned. You made the clay ball BECAUSE someone asked you to, you sell them, etc. The virtual form, the indifferent matter, and the necessary movements of the sculpting hands all came together BECAUSE an invisible, overriding purpose &quot;held&quot; or &quot;bound&quot; them all together until the process was complete. <br><br>In the objective case, we obviously can&#039;t appeal to an individual actor shaping everything. But we can do something interesting. Go back to the subjective case and ask why any individual agent ever does anything. Boil down every reason a subjective agent might have for making or doing anything, and all will have one thing in common: They all are for the sake of some GOOD. No action is indifferent. There is always a &quot;better&quot; being sought. It is better to have a clay ball, because it&#039;s better to sell a clay ball, because it&#039;s better to have money, because it&#039;s better to have the things money can buy, because it&#039;s better to live well and feel pleasure.", "time": 1671411151, "resto": 21401555}, {"no": 21402163, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)19:53:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21402160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21402160</a><br>Plato and Aristotle extrapolate this to the objective case and see &quot;betterness,&quot; &quot;goodness,&quot; value, as ontologically real features of reality. The &quot;why&quot; of &quot;why does anything strive &#039;up and away from&#039; its most entropicically neutral state, why do things continuously put in &#039;effort&#039; and organize this &#039;effort&#039; on recalcitrant matter, to become virtual forms? Why does the world strive for form?&quot; is answered by saying that it&#039;s for basically the same reason as in the subjective case: the world ITSELF is makes and re-makes itself continuously, continuously approximates &quot;strives&quot; for form and perfection of form, in all its individual parts and as a whole, &quot;for the sake of&quot; the better, the Good. It is simply more Good, more perfect, to have form, than not to have form, thus it is an in-built tendency of all matter to strive for form. This explains how the indifferent, eternal, but in themselves virtual ideas or universals, and the indifferent, recalcitrant &quot;dead&quot; matter continuously come together to make the differentiated, formalized, gradated world we see around us, instead of just a soup of gray matter or base particles. <br><br>Everything seeks its own perfection, any &quot;grade&quot; of being is always striving and aiming upward because more and higher form is always &quot;better.&quot; Matter strives to be incorporated into organisms, and each successive grade or &quot;soul&quot; of organic life (plant, animal, rational) strives to reach its own perfection in the higher grade. The highest grade of being is only possible in man, who is constantly called toward his own perfect formalization via the perfect actualization of his full potential, which is in contemplation, the activity of his rational soul. Contemplation (theoria) is the highest activity possible in the cosmos, literally divine because it&#039;s all God does, and thus humans at their highest peak (as philosophers) can participate in the divine activity, which will then sublate their lower functions (their merely stochastic material parts, their merely appetitive plant soul, their merely libidinal animal soul) and create (for brief moments of pure bliss or ataraxia) a state of almost divine perfection in man, as he contemplates &quot;the whole&quot; of things by bringing his contemplation to perfect transparent adequacy to it. But if the parts of the whole cosmos are mediately good (all striving to be better), then the Whole must be the Good in its most coherent and harmonious aspect, so pure contemplation is also an effectively immanent mystical vision of the Good, including oneself as part of this whole.", "time": 1671411221, "resto": 21401555}, {"no": 21402169, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)19:54:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21402163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21402163</a><br>In Aristotle&#039;s system, the ultimate perfection that everything seeks, even contemplation itself, is a modification of Plato&#039;s Good, the &quot;Good itself,&quot; which is God, which is the peak of the cosmic hierarchy, the so-called &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot; (A.O. Lovejoy). This being is necessary because if the whole system is &quot;striving FOR,&quot; striving TOWARD something, that &quot;something&quot; must exist. But because direct action of any kind, efficient causation, is inferior to contemplation and realization of the Good, this highest being logically cannot involve any efficient causation at all, nor can it involve matter, because the essence of matter is &quot;lacking in form&quot; i.e. lacking in perfection - matter exists solely to continuously strive toward form, and striving is &quot;for the better.&quot; So logically speaking the highest Being cannot either act, because then it would lack something (it would be doing something &quot;for the better,&quot; meaning it is not already the best), and it cannot involve any matter, because materiality is by definition a state or grade of imperfection.<br><br>The solution then is that God is contemplation itself. But contemplation is &quot;of&quot; something. So God is contemplation contemplating itself: though thinking itself. This is the Platonic Good or One elevated to the final cause of the whole universe. You strive and work to make a clay ball, because you want to feel pleasure (because pleasure is good); the universe continuously strives to &quot;make&quot; its constituent components because they also strive &quot;toward&quot; the ultimate good, which is the state of pure contemplation. <br><br>Thus God is both immanent to the world - i.e., God is not a transcendent creator who is fundamentally distinct from the world&#039;s visible categories (since man can also, at his absolute peak of potential, participate in contemplation, which is the essence of God) - and transcendent to the world, insofar as God does not act upon any existing thing in any way directly (through efficient causation or through any materiality).

Any other social media site is filled with whiny faggots who need you to soften your language like you&#039;re talking to a testy woman, and file a brief with the court 6 months in advance before saying something mildly unusual. You can almost feel normies jamming on the brakes any time you say something unexpected, even if it&#039;s benign.

Makes for the best jokes and banter. /lit/ probably has the same spirit as a gentleman&#039;s club back in the day, the only thing it lacks is a bit more substance because every individual poster, on average, is a disaffected young male who doesn&#039;t read much.

More plainly, contemporary right-wingers are people who were taught one thing by their parents (that was probably very much in vogue when they were taught it) and then came of age into a world where those values are long out of style. Because they are not prepared to abandon those values they pick the party (which is only one of two) that most closely resemble what their values are and ride or die with it. <br><br>Because patriotism and American exceptionalism are some of those holdout traditional values this makes for an easy fit despite the fact that the Republican Party, on closer inspection, is in reality a disgusting amalgam that, while paying lip service to the traditionalist crowd, in reality does not substantially support their interests or their values at all. We can characterize the pre-Trump Republican party as primarily being made up of poor/middle class traditionalists on one side and ultra-wealthy businessmen on the other. Due to the fact that the libertarian-leaning lingo of the businessmen uses the same keywords that the poorer party-members have learned to revere (freedom, personal choice, personal responsibility, free markets, low taxes, low government involvement etc) the treachery of the business class is hidden, and they are able to pursue interests that are very much at odds with the poorer classes while making only a few concessions that are useless anyway (gun control, abortion, Christianity). <br><br>So to answer the OP, the reason right wing books are cringe is because the Republican platform is incomprehensible and not consistent. There isn&#039;t a driving force behind it except to lower labor costs. It&#039;s a catch-all for the people that get fucked over by Progressivism. <br><br>Also important to note this is why people like Trump get elected, and why the base is so receptive to ideologies that speak to them from a more philosophically-grounded place (Populism, Carl Schmitt&#039;s existentialism).<br><br><a href=\"#p21397964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397964</a><br>Destiny is a clown.", "time": 1671346246, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399385, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:59:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397583</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1671346776, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399541, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:29:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398212</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;largely reinforced with the fact that no self-respecting intellectual wants to be associated with the embarrassment that is modern right-wing politics</span><br>This is a bit misleading.

This means that a lot of RW figures come from different walks of life and as such their takes aren&#039;t going to be as refined as they could&#039;ve been, and coupled with the thing that I&#039;ll go over below makes it an embarrassing shitshow.<br>Then the main problem is that RW politics is deliberately setup to work out an electable position and grift the shit out of it. You&#039;re the reasonable guy who doesn&#039;t encourage leftist excesses, you deserve the vote. The problem is that this spineless position means that their base can say fuck it I&#039;m voting for the guy that&#039;s further right, you&#039;re just leftists with more inertia anyway and that&#039;s something they don&#039;t want. As such when you look at political landscape in countries like Germany, Poland, the UK and the US you notice that the right wing parties are trying their hardest to make anyone to the right from them unelectable and they do it via means of public scrutiny and defamation. This means that they will actively attack people to the right from them and won&#039;t offer them support when they need it(good example of that is the cancellation of Samuel Francis by National Review crew). Leftist political formations on the other hand cultivate their radicals(they&#039;ll only get rid of the real stinkers like open and unapologetic pedophile advocates), they won&#039;t give them everything they want for political reasons, but they will setup what amounts to patronage networks to give them the ability to be subversive and &quot;generate ideals&quot;, obviously something made much simpler by the fact that the academia is captive so at this point every taxpayer pays for leftists to give patronage to their radicals in public universities, but even without it they would always do it.<br>To put it simpler - leftists don&#039;t engage in witch hunts against &quot;communists&quot;, but rightists engage in hunts against &quot;fascists&quot;(obviously both words are rendered meaningless because both communism and fascism are as dead as absolute monarchy based on divine right is, you can bring them back but it&#039;ll be just LARP)", "time": 1671352156, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399547, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studies show </span><br><br>Studies show the opposite is true actually.", "time": 1671352392, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399568, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399547</a><br>Depends on year and how do you distinguish between the two.

Let&#039;s be honest, we need to address the fundamental questions of political subjectivity and capitalism, before we do anything. If there is a fundamental divide between the right and the left, it is over the question of political subjectivity. The right will succeed - and really, has already succeeded - insofar as it takes a disintegrative and materialist approach to political subjectivity (i.e if it moves beyond things like racialized politics and insipid populism, to a sort of extreme darwinism). The right is in the unique position to identify with the entire ecology, rather than a particular political subject. The left, frankly speaking, cannot do this. It is intrinsically caught up in certain subjectivities, and that&#039;s why it will lose. The right should identify with capital itself, against all else. How does the left plan to account for things like labour&#039;s substitution driving the creation and proliferation of AI? UBI? Fat chance of that. AI alone makes questions about environmental and demographic collapse manifoldly more complex. It is a fantastic example of the sort of boundary expansion which is absolutely traumatic to the left and right alike. The left basically operates under the basic assumption that capitalism will eat itself, and will be dialectically overcome by some revolutionary subject. But what if capitalism outlasts humanity itself?

It\u2019s the driving intellectual force behind the nation\u2019s constitutional belief in legal equality. Educated citizens base their commitment to American ideals on it. This commitment shows up in our theories of democracy, in which each citizen has an equal vote, and our justice system, in which all humans are supposedly equal under the law. <br><br>But there\u2019s a problem: human equality isn\u2019t self-evident at all. <br><br>John Locke, whose intellectual ink is tattooed all over the Declaration of Independence, knew this. His theory of natural rights is based on the idea that God owns us as property. Human equality is self-evident only if you assume, as Locke did, that God has given us the natural rights that modern Americans take for granted. The original Constitution says that our \u201cunalienable rights\u201d are a result not of secular rationalism, but rather an omnipotent God who endows us with those rights. To that end, the pillars of American law rest as much on the Bible as on the writings of Enlightenment thinkers.

While they might not realize it, nine times out of ten, they\u2019ve unconsciously inherited a belief in human rights and are unaware of the foundational ideas which underpin that belief.

Human rights exist in their modern form because the Bible says that every person is made in the image of God\u2014imago dei. In turn, each person is granted unalienable rights, and those rights can\u2019t be taken away. But the contract breaks down if human beings aren\u2019t special. If humans are in the same category of every other animal, there is no intellectual scaffolding to uphold either human rights or the legal equality of man. Appealing to human rights just because we say so is as baseless as appealing to astrology or the will of Zeus. Even if a group of people can agree on how to treat people in the moment, consensus can change at any moment. Today\u2019s virtues can become tomorrow\u2019s vices. Like a sand castle, the tenets of morality can be destroyed by the tide of public opinion. <br><br>Without the word of God, all we have are opinions. Morality and justice are downgraded from indisputable truths to mere preferences and shared fictions. Both of those can change on a whim. In a world of one person\u2019s word against another, the most powerful person will control the moral landscape. This problem is one of the central themes of Dostoyevsky\u2019s writing: in an 1878 letter, he asked why he should live righteously in a world without a god. Assuming that there is no afterlife and that the police wouldn\u2019t catch him after a wrongdoing, he asks: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I cut another man\u2019s throat, rob, and steal?\u201d <br><br>Today, our answer boils down to human rights. To Dostoevsky\u2019s point, without the hand of God to shape human morality, many people will conclude that the benefits of a righteous life aren\u2019t worth the costs. In theory, we could base our belief in human rights on rationality and the mutual agreement that some actions are better than others. Maybe one day, people will worship the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights charter like they worship the Bible today. Doing so would take us away from the woo-woo of religion and towards the rigor of secular reason, where we can logically discern the differences between good and evil.

If so, religion is, indeed, the opiate of the masses.<br><br>The problem is that you can\u2019t just pick certain ideas from the buffet if you want to be intellectually honest. <br><br>Intellectual Honesty<br><br>The atheist scholar Christopher Hitchens was once interviewed by a unitarian minister who called herself a \u201cLiberal Christian.\u201d Though she identifies as a Christian, she doesn\u2019t believe Jesus died for her sins. Instead, she reads the scripture metaphorically. Hitchens, who was one of Christianity\u2019s fiercest critics, responded by saying: \u201cI would say that if you don\u2019t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you\u2019re really not in any meaningful sense a Christian.\u201d<br><br>Echoing Hitchens\u2019 point, Christianity is unique among religions because it has a self-destruct mechanism. The book of I Corinthians says that the truth of Christianity hinges upon the resurrection\u2019s historical reality \u2014 meaning that the story of Christ dying on the cross and coming back to life must be literally true. So if you discover that Christ was not raised, you should stop being Christian. End of story. Specifically, the text says: \u201cIf Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile\u2026 Those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.\u201d", "time": 1671381028, "resto": 21400581}, {"no": 21400610, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:31:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Others say that Christ was a brilliant teacher, but not the son of God. Appealing as that argument sounds, C.S. Lewis critiqued this perspective half a century ago. He argued that you can\u2019t accept him as a great moral teacher without also accepting his claim to be God. Since Jesus\u2019 claims were so outlandish, he couldn\u2019t have been just a great moral teacher. You must take a stand. Christ was either the Son of God or a madman. Lewis writes: \u201cYou can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.\u201d<br><br>Though I find myself doing it all the time, thinking of religion metaphorically instead of literally is problematic. Christianity, and therefore the moral underpinnings of the West, is long-term stable to the extent that enough people believe in all that Christ claimed to be and the literal truth of his story. Ultimately, a religious affiliation built upon metaphors instead of hard truths is a worldview that\u2019ll crumble under the weight of scrutiny. <br><br>The Many Buckets of Faith<br><br>I have a confession to make: I\u2019ve spent my entire life in this metaphorical camp. Growing up, I attended a Jewish school where I took 40 minutes of both Hebrew and Biblical studies every day. But as early as elementary school, I thought I was above religious thinking. I \u201cknew\u201d that Moses didn\u2019t actually part the Red Sea and didn\u2019t ascend Mount Sinai to have an actual conversation with God. All that sounded as counterfeit as the tooth fairy. Even as I sang the Torah portion during my Bar Mitzvah to a crowd of a couple hundred friends and family members, I rejected the teachings I was chanting. Only after college did I discover that the ideas I passionately rejected, particularly the Old Testament and the Ten Commandments, were the bedrock of my moral philosophy. <br><br>Not just mine, all my friends too \u2014 and we didn\u2019t even know it. In retrospect, that\u2019s why we strive to treat disabled people with dignity and it\u2019s why sentences like this one from a government official inspire head-nodding agreement: \u201cA city is measured by how it treats the least of its brothers and sisters. That\u2019s what we all believe, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve grown up believing, and it\u2019s who we are.\u201d We agree with these ideas because Christianity is the invisible frame around modern thought. These moral conclusions are shaped by the Beatitudes where Christ instructs us to bless the poor, the meek, and the persecuted. Until Christ, those blessings were reserved for the rich and powerful.", "time": 1671381098, "resto": 21400581}, {"no": 21400613, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:32:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I call people in this group \u201cReligious Atheists.\u201d <br><br>As a member of this tribe, I don\u2019t have a problem with the conclusions. I have a problem with the ignorance caused by the blind dismissal of religion, and the way they mock the assumptions that underpin their worldview. This group of Religious Atheists is the fastest-growing religious group in America. In 2000, almost 70% of Americans considered themselves to be a member of a church, synagogue, or mosque. In just two decades, that number has fallen to below 50%. It\u2019s a group of people who want Christianity without Christ. They want community without communion, the kingdom without the king, and like Thomas Jefferson, morals without miracles.<br><br>Again\u2014I\u2019m a member of this group. My worldview rests on two contradictory axioms: I don\u2019t believe in the resurrection of Christ, but I passionately believe in human rights. I\u2019m pulled towards agnosticism because I don\u2019t have enough evidence to be a believer. Deep down, I\u2019ve chosen to remain an agnostic because the existence of God is beyond my comprehension. Asking me about God\u2019s presence is like asking an ant what I should order at In-N-Out Burger. The sentence doesn\u2019t compute. Further, the idea that the son of God was born of a virgin, traveled through contemporary Israel performing miracles, died on a cross, and came back to life seems as bizarre to me today as it did to the Romans two millennia ago. And yet, the intellectual history of Western civilization orbits around this story. <br><br>But because of my commitment to human rights, I\u2019m implicitly committed to Christian ideas\u2014or at the very least, a moral philosophy that\u2019s propped up by the Bible. And it\u2019s not just me. American law and culture are thoroughly Christian too. Though I\u2019m closer to an atheist than a believer, I shiver at the nihilistic conclusions of a world without God. One where morality follows intellectual fashion and leaders rule by the cold calculus of Excel spreadsheets.

The self evident truths are true, and the God that gave us these things in the first place is still active. (The fact that anything exists establishes that assertion.) Satanists can resist and fight, do all kinds of gymnastics, try to hide from the truth, try to hide the truth from others, and even kill us for being the message-bearers of the truth, but it is just going to be ultimately pointless because of what they are going against. It leads to a more spectacular fall for them if they decide not to repent.

J. P. Taylor, the eminent British historian, and hardly a Nazi sympathizer, writes:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Fascism, it was claimed, represented the last aggressive stage of capitalism in decline, and its momentum could be sustained only by war. There was an element of truth in this, but not much. The full employment which Nazi Germany was the first European country to possess, depended in large part on the production of armaments; but it could have been provided equally well (and was to some extent) by other forms of public works from roads to great buildings. The Nazi secret was not armament production; it was freedom from the then orthodox principles of economics . . . the argument for war did not work even if the Nazi system had relied on armaments production alone. Nazi Germany was not choking in a flood of arms. On the contrary, the German Generals insists unanimously in 1939 that they were not equipped for war and that many years must pass before \u201crearmament in depth\u201d had been completed.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Answering predictions of ruin by orthodox economists throughout the world, Hitler explained that Germany had not withdrawn from world trade but had bypassed the international financial system by means of barter, stating:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If certain countries combat the German system this is done in the first instance because through the German method of trading their tricks of international currency and Bourse speculations have been abolished in favor of honest business transactions. . . . We are buyers of good foodstuff and raw materials and suppliers of equally good commodities!&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More recently a professional economist, Henry C K Liu[18], who can hardly be suspected of Hitlerism, analyzed the methods by which Germany emerged from the Depression:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, at a time when its economy was in total collapse, with ruinous war-reparation obligations and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit. Yet through an independent monetary policy of sovereign credit and a full-employment public-works program, the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany, stripped of overseas colonies it could exploit, into the strongest economy in Europe within four years, even before armament spending began. In fact, German economic recovery preceded and later enabled German rearmament, in contrast to the US economy, where constitutional roadblocks placed by the US Supreme Court on the New Deal delayed economic recovery until US entry to World War II put the US market economy on a war footing. While this observation is not an endorsement for Nazi philosophy, the effectiveness of German economic policy in this period, some of which had been started during the last phase of the Weimar Republic, is undeniable.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1653939673591", "ext": ".png", "w": 956, "h": 1804, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671244709359835, "time": 1671244709, "md5": "5pi4TTPLY09rsfNpvdN+Ww==", "fsize": 680731, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394370, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>That analogy is stupid and doesn\u2019t fully work.", "time": 1671244914, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394377, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394281</a><br>Most Greek philosophers were what we today would call fascist", "time": 1671245112, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394381, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21390680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21390680</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5&#039;1&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark complexion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bavarian (embarrassment)</span><br>Shall I continue?", "time": 1671245243, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394384, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refusal to give a clear condemnation and breakaway from Nazism after WW2, seems to have been a matter of principle and intrinsic distaste to what he, in his own way, saw as the rise of \u201cglobohomo\u201d, and the West essentially trying to claim it was significantly moral superior to Germany, even with its own firebombing of Dresden, the detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the like.</span><br><br>True, and there\u2019s also no end to apologising, as the recent history of Germany has shown", "time": 1671245289, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394392, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:49:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>I don&#039;t care about persecuting Jews, Gulf Arabs, or blacks.

They had boosted their personnel from approximately 100,000 regulars (fully equipped) up to approx. 13 million regulars through WW2. This force was spearheaded by relatively small but fully operational armored divisions, which for the most part had their basic combat effectiveness close to 100%, because they had the necessary tanks, equipped with newly produced radio gear, already produced by German industry. What was required by the infantry and motorized divisions was transports, let alone armored transports, in a huge quantity given the relative size of the infantry compared to the mechanized. This was a quantity which could not be supported even when the entire German economy was fully deployed, which is why the majority of the German &quot;motorized&quot; divisions (IIRC the figure was between 70-80% in 1941) were using horses and horse-drawn guns pulling them through Russia. The armored spearheads were highly effective and German soldiers already had small arms, the problem was producing such a large quantity for such a large force in such a small time (ultimately 1933 - 1939, but more realistically it was 1936 - 1939), which is what the generals were referring to. They were always scared that the armor would outpace the infantry and cause severe catastrophes due to encirclement (which didn&#039;t happen at the start of the war due to the disorganization of France, Britain and Russia, as well as the skill of German spearheads and special operations units).

Women remain manifestly physically depdendent on men, on several levels. I would say that this dependence has been made more diffuse than the individual male provider, and is farmed out to both the state and private business, instead of the husband. Most truck drivers, maintenance personnel, cops etc are still men. Automation may change things more. This change may transcend the specific traditional gender relations, as the large majority of both women and men become superfluous not only to production, but also to consumption (robots make everything, the rich drive the bulk of consumption).<br><br>The exact moment of the sexual revolution suggests feminism and the pill. I think the OP is going for something in this general area but I&#039;m still thinking about it. Does he mean that since women can control when and how they get pregnant, they have greater autonomy?

There were gods, demons, curses, possession, magic, interdimensional traveling, and other stuff, but it&#039;s not what the novel is about. There&#039;s a lot about how the Pallesand Archipelago is conquering and oppressing everyone in their quest to establish what they believe to be utopian socialism. It didn&#039;t explicitly say that, but it was heavily implied. The name may or may not have been a reference to Solzhenitsyn&#039;s Gulag Archipelago, and/or the British Isles and Empire, especially as depicted in Orwell&#039;s 1984. They&#039;re all about controlling every aspect of behavior to come closer to their arbitrary ideal of perfection.<br><br>The novel had an unusual narrative structure where the viewpoint moved from one character to another from chapter to chapter. Some characters only had a single chapter and others had several. It began by establishing the primary viewpoints which were often included in the other viewpoints. A minor character in one viewpoint became the viewpoint in the next chapter and so on. I wanted to call this a mosaic novel but the paths of the characters are too overlapping for that to seem accurate. A few chapters were explicitly called mosaic because the narrator is the viewpoint in them, which was odd because there wasn&#039;t a frame story. The author simply described what happened as an omniscient narrator. The chapters open with similar narration.<br><br>The narrative was also different in its neutrality, as it&#039;s more an exploration of ongoing events through the lives of the characters rather than being about the characters themselves. So, in a way, the city could be considered a character, which is something I&#039;ve seen in several books published in 2022. The downside was that because of the constantly changing perspective the characters were underdeveloped. I also disliked them. They&#039;re almost all stock characters with nothing to particularly distinguish them. The most egregious to me were the overeager and blindly idealistic college students eager to be martyrs for the revolution.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what this novel was meant to be about. To be entirely reductive, it&#039;s about the consequences following the theft of a magical item that leads to the death of one of the most important government officials. Everyone then wanted wanted to know who had the magical item and where it was. There were also various factions that worked towards revolution, but each had their own methods and incompatible end goals. I wouldn&#039;t be so concerned about what it meant if it weren&#039;t that it seemed like it was constantly trying to say something meaningful. Maybe that was intended or I read too much into it, but it left me unsatisfied.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5", "filename": "60147395", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 2458, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671222050267490, "time": 1671222050, "md5": "L781DbQI3JGvikqfbEIK0w==", "fsize": 1074791, "resto": 21391224, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21392891, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21392882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21392882</a><br>I&#039;ve now read a book that was published in each month of 2022 in the month that it was published.

It was more of a side quest than the previous books and probably could have been reworked into a solo novel with minimal changes, it does tie into the story nicely at the end and I had a great time with it. This book felt different. It felt like it was written for little children- and children only . There were many caps, too much emphasis, and Peril is an extremely childish character who largely acts like she was born yesterday and is a hair-trigger away from mass murder multiple times. Tui absolutely nailed Peril as a point of view. Every word mirrored Peril\u2019s possessive, childish, bloodthirsty and and altogether very unstable personality. Some of it was over-exaggerated, but it is very clear that Peril is a completely different dragon than others, with her unique one tracked mind because she has been killing since she was a dragonet (baby dragon), when someone is hostile or irritable to her, she hopes that they attack her so she can freely murder them.<br><br>Peril to other dragons is a weird, crazy sociopathic dragon who can kill effortlessly and that&#039;s exactly how I felt when I first read Escaping Peril. across the story I realized that she changed. From the beginning she always obsessed over Clay, Scarlet and her Killing potential, but near the end, she thought less about aproval and more as a normal-ish sane pov, completing her arc. Peril is hilarious. Honestly, the author&#039;s writing style ensures that all her books are humorous, She has no filter, and says whatever she&#039;s thinking regardless of how awkward that makes other dragons feel. Which leads to some pretty damn funny conversations.<br><br>The plot moves at a fast clip and lot happens in this story both to Peril and dragon society as a whole desu, You wouldn&#039;t expect it from the more personalized stakes involved here but there were actually a large number of twists happened throughout. The third act involves a lot of twists, which frankly, I should have seen coming after the magic seen in the last book. <br><br>4.8/5: The best thing in the series since darkstalker&#039;s standalone book.", "filename": "iu[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 734, "h": 304, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 51, "tim": 1671250257967225, "time": 1671250257, "md5": "h6EIyfZKkbWnokZ8Xm4Amw==", "fsize": 38597, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394633, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:18:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394385</a><br>It&#039;s that still around? .org was in pretty sad shape last time I looked.", "time": 1671250702, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394694, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394614</a><br>your &quot;&quot;&quot;reviews&quot;&quot;&quot; are shit<br>fuck off", "time": 1671252256, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394854, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:03:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Judging Eye was like a breath of fresh air. <s>Hardly any Kellhus.

Golden Son and Dark Age are some of the most riveting, edge of your seat fiction I&#039;ve read, and it sustains it for the entire book each time.

This goes away significantly in Golden Son and on, as he fleshes out the world and culture way more, and you realize the color scheme is just a way to get to classical Greece/Rome worshiping genetically engineered, honor obsessed super humans fighting for control of the solar system.<br><br>The third book isn&#039;t quite as good as the second because the end comes in a bit of a rush, and there is a somewhat hackneyed part near the end that you&#039;ll know when you see it, but book five is potentially even better than Golden Son and holds it for all 800 pages.<br><br>Great series.
