I can say without any exaggeration that there hasn&#039;t been a single day that passed by in that decade where I didn&#039;t daydream about being a real musician while air guitaring/drumming/tooting. Big dreams that shall remain untranslated forever. Nevermind the fact that I&#039;m still NEETing at this age, it&#039;s the thought that I made almost zero efforts to even get a finger of the proverbial dream&#039;s body out of the ghostly dimension. I just remained content with dreaming it all away. And the fact is that music is extremely ruthless when it comes to age. It&#039;s not about your capacity to retain and learn, but about how much time you&#039;re really going to have to learn. How many free hours do you have left in your life. It takes a lot of time to get barely decent at playing, let alone getting decent at songwriting.

I chose to be a coward, because it was easy. I was allowed to coast and get through things the easy way in life, and I remained in that childish mindset ever since. I had the option to say &quot;maybe later&quot; on almost every single occasion, and it is solely my fault that I didn&#039;t pierce this cozy periwinkle blue veil to truly see what there is to be found in life. I succumbed to self centered habits ; self flagellations with bouts of figurative autofellatio, the latter having no basis on interaction with reality and relying on fearful delusions instead. And because I became predisposed to these terrible choices and decisions, I don&#039;t know how to break out of it all and contribute to the world, or even just make a step towards these checking my delusional ambitions.

How could it be otherwise after a relatively pampered life? Guilt takes over all of my spirit whenever I encounter somebody who truly had it rough in life, who was given nothing by fate itself. I am in no position to speak about deserving compassion, because I&#039;ve seen more of it as a kid than some may find in their entire lifetime, and I squandered it all away to be this joke I am today.

I mean he is a vile conglomeration of meat oozing with juices. I hate this worthless sniveling rat bastard sack of shit. Somehow I got scammed into the dorm room situation and have to live in the same room as him. This is actually my second roommate this semester, because I thought that there couldn&#039;t be anyone worse than the first one. Perhaps I am lucky. Perhaps God loves me. This third-world mutt cunt sleeps all fucking day and keeps me up at night. Initially, I let it slide, and I would try to stay out of the room all day, but not having access to my own room during the day really fucking pissed me off. Recently I&#039;ve just started opening the curtains and being as loud as possible so I wake him up. I know he won&#039;t get out of bed, but it feels good to piss him off. The vampire fuckwit also has a tendency to lie in bed and watch tiktok all night with the volume up. My solution is to blast some annoying shit as loud as possible and act like I don&#039;t know what the problem is when he tells me to turn it down. Wear fucking headphones cunt. He&#039;s also messy as fuck, and he&#039;s gay. He has forgotten to flush the toilet four times, and pisses on the god damned seat. He also gets hair fucking everywhere. And, worst of all, he smells like shit and makes the room smell like shit. Due to his faggotry and brown skin, he&#039;s also the loudest mf on earth and I want to murder him when he speaks. My number one pet-peeve, though, is his constant fucking scratching. The itchy motherfucker doesn&#039;t fucking stop and it sounds like sandpaper. Stop fucking scratching yourself you nasty fucking cunt. Recently, he&#039;s developed a cough. This is, of course, loud as fucking shit too. He kept me awake for three fucking nights before I told him to fucking cover his mouth and muffle his goddamned cough. Nasty fuck. Still going. I leave the country in about a week. I&#039;m going to throw his headphones that he doesn&#039;t use out the goddamned window. I&#039;m going to piss all over the shit he has strewn all over the bathroom. I&#039;m going to leave pube trimmings on his toothbrush.

The key is to stay focused and motivated, and to set aside regular time each day to work on your book. You might also find it helpful to break your writing goals down into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of focusing on the overall goal of reaching 55,000 words, you could aim to write 1,000 words per day. This can make the process feel less daunting and can help you make steady progress towards completing your book.<br><br>It&#039;s also important to remember that everyone works at their own pace, and what might seem fast to you might be perfectly normal for someone else.

If you&#039;re feeling stuck or struggling to find the motivation to keep going, you might find it helpful to talk to other writers or to seek out support from a writing group or coach.

That civilization feminizes is a phenomenon that has been noted often through the ages, though its precise mechanisms have not yet been described, and we&#039;ll be doing this shortly. Until then, however, it&#039;s worth answering the question of how the Greeks and the Romans were able to prevail over and subdue the barbarians that surrounded them, if the latter were superior masculine specimens? For the most part, the same way the West subdues contemporary barbarians: with superior weapons, training, strategy and tactics. Mano-a-mano, and without weapons, in a bare-knuckle fight to the death, the barbarians, by and large, would always triumph, with perhaps few exceptions, when facing elite civilized units like Spartans or special forces commandos whose superior training includes unarmed combat. But such combat is only of much relevance in movies, and becomes increasingly irrelevant as the power of civilization advances, so in a large scale accounting its influence is negligible (the West doesn&#039;t need special forces to beat the Araboids, we can flatten them at any time with conventional weapons and merely use commandos to avoid excessive collateral damage, purely for PR reasons). The bottom line is that the individual Roman soldier was a weakling compared to the invididual barbarian, but a legion commanded by Caesar was a formidable opponent that the barbarians could never hope to beat with any degree of consistency. And yet... the Greeks and the Romans were eventually overrun by the barbarians... and the Dark Ages followed. Despite their superior military power... in the end they were beaten, because the barbarian hordes just kept coming. Today we like to think that classical civilization won, because we are its descendants, so if we exist, it makes sense to assume that our ancestors won, but it&#039;s not that simple. Militarily, our ancestors (by which I mean mine, because I am Greek and you&#039;re likely neither Greek nor Italian) lost, fair and square, but culturally, over several centuries, we won, because the northern barbarians (by which I mean most of your ancestors, dear reader) ended up adopting our culture.", "time": 1670986746, "resto": 21380876}, {"no": 21380931, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21380926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21380926</a><br>(956 cont.)<br>So how did the Greeks and the Romans beat the barbarians in the end? <br> They civilized them, in a strange type of victory in which both sides won, leaving behind no losers. So cultural victory seems to be a panacea\u2014exactly what our dear liberals have been preaching ever since the Enlightenment. But, once more, things are not that simple because, for this scheme to work, you need barbarian populations that are capable of civilization! That&#039;s why the French and the Germans bear no ill will towards the Greeks and the Romans\u2014indeed, to this day, they idolize them\u2014because they were capable of becoming civilized, and even of raising this civilization to previously unseen heights. So of course there&#039;s no reason for resentment there. But ask the American Indians how they feel about American, and generally Western culture. Ask the indigenous South American populations. Ask the Australian Aboriginals or the Maoris in New Zealand. Ask the Araboids running amok in Europe and spitting on everything in sight today. Ask the black South Africans who hate us so much that they are destroying their very own country as I write this, because we built it for them and they can&#039;t stand it. Most of Asia is a clusterfuck in this respect, and even in East Asia\u2014the most culturally fertile region of the world outside the West\u2014the people to this day have a love-hate relationship with Western culture. <br> So as you can see, cultural warfare is far more complex than the military type, and its literature is vastly less developed, despite this type of warfare being far more important in the long run.

Upon the realm of aesthetics and philosophic Criticism it may be demonstrated, almost palpably, that it was predestined for the German spirit to seize and assimilate the Foreign, the primarily remote from it, in utmost purity and objectivity of intuition (in h\u00f6chster objektiver Reinheit der Anschauung). One may aver, without exaggeration, that the Antique would have stayed unknown, in its now universal world-significance, had the German spirit not recognised and expounded it. The Italian made as much of the Antique his own, as he could copy and remodel; the Frenchman borrowed from this remodelling, in his turn, whatever caressed his national sense for elegance of Form: the German was the first to apprehend its purely-human originality, to seize therein a meaning quite aloof from usefulness, but therefore of the only use for rendering the Purely-human. Through its inmost understanding of the Antique, the German spirit arrived at the capability of restoring the Purely-human itself to its pristine freedom; not employing the antique form to display a certain given &#039;stuff,&#039; but moulding the necessary new form itself through an employment of the antique conception of the world.

Its final meaning is the sand blown through the eye-holes of human skulls.\u201d Through his analysis of history, he has concluded that our species is engaged in a constant process of armament, with the eventual end goal of wiping itself out through war. History, for him, is nothing more than a slaughterhouse . . . \u201cthe place of a skull and charnel house of a mad, incurably bloodthirsty slaughtering, flaying and whetting, of an irresistible urge to destroy to the last.\u201d Although inspired by the already extreme philosophy of Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder, Horstmann ends up with an even more explicit solution regarding the problem of human existence. In his book The Beast he actually goes so far as to suggest the use of nuclear weapons in order to bring forth the extinction of the human race.

With an engineer-like or scientist\u2019s mind, Aristotle quickly saw the patterns in the data, grouping everything by commonalities, properties, and overall structure. Using unsentimental rationality, Aristotle also applied these principles to humans, classifying them by temperament, gender, race, and various other properties with a level-headed shrewdness that caused his observations to be read and celebrated throughout the ages. As for happiness, Aristotle believed that it is best attained by doing what comes naturally to us and doing it well; in other words, to fulfill one\u2019s purpose and become a paragon of human excellence.<br><br>Kant: A great scientist and a great philosopher, Kant aimed to fuse the writings of Newton with the philosophy of his day. For Kant, the human mind contains the faculties that appear to us to be woven into the physical universe (such as quantity, causality, totality existence, etc.). These faculties interact with reality as it exists in itself, creating a synthesis that appears to us as \u201cobjectively true\u201d while being, in fact, only true according to the synthesis between the rational categories of the human mind and the raw \u201cstuff\u201d of reality which is unknowable to us in its unsynthesized form. Kant was also a notable thinker in the domain of ethics, where he developed the rules-based approach to ethics and summed up his teaching in the categorical imperative: An action can only be ethical if it can be followed as a general principle by all members of society, in all similar situations.<br><br>Epicurus: Epicurus advised his followers to live simple lives. For example, their food and drink consisted mainly of bread and water, with cheese as a rare indulgence. Having been much misunderstood by posterity, Epicurus actually counseled that intense pleasures were to be avoided because they were often followed by pain \u2013 either from overindulgence or from losing access to the pleasures again. Likewise, Epicurus held that stronger and more uncommon pleasures would, at the same time, make common and less potent pleasures less pleasant, thereby robbing the man who indulges in the rarefied pleasures of the opportunity to enjoy a simple, quiet life.<br>1/2", "filename": "philosopher-personality", "ext": ".png", "w": 1009, "h": 975, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1670919741844825, "time": 1670919741, "md5": "oC3PSuLgpVYcJ9e+etCpNw==", "fsize": 603681, "resto": 21376604}, {"no": 21377815, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)03:23:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Nietzsche: Nietzsche was a German philosopher and a cultural critic. Regarding his biography, he expressed contempt and disgust for the behavior of most and mocked them incessantly. Nietzsche believed that all philosophy is autobiographical and that our so-called \u201cprinciples\u201d are really influenced by our self-interest and our physical and sensory experiences. Furthermore, he advised that we should not live an overly cautious, orderly life, risking nothing, since the outcomes that may result from taking chances may lead to personal growth. Additionally, Nietzsche argued that objective truth is impossible\u2014there can only be perspectives and interpretations driven by a person&#039;s interests and experiences. For Nietzsche, it was important for each individual to find meaning in his or her own life and to live in accordance with that meaning.<br><br>Hume: Hume was skeptical of most beliefs \u2013 be they religious or derived from pure rationality without experimental data to back them up. Consequently, friction with the settled orthodoxies of his time was a constant theme in his life. Like the other empiricists that preceded him, Hume believed that the contents of the mind came only from experience. Hume is known for the is-ought divide, also called Hume\u2019s Fork: The proposition that it is not possible to derive an \u201cis\u201d from an \u201cought\u201d (e.g., we cannot go from the moral proposition that everyone ought to be equally smart to the factual proposition that everyone is equally smart). Hume also proposed tremendous challenges to concepts like causation and induction \u2013 challenges that some consider have never been solved to this day.<br><br>Diogenes: Diogenes chose to become homeless and settled in a big earthenware storage jar on the sidewalk. He stayed in his street-dwelling, where he shocked the Athenian citizenry through seemingly mad and crass behaviors, backed up by insults and occasional wise sayings. One could say that Diogenes was history\u2019s first punk, a true provocateur who cared little for his own well-being or physical safety, mocking both the highborn Plato and the mighty conqueror and king Alexander in a remorseless display of how conceited they looked when viewed through the lens of his jarring, no-holds-barred philosophy and view of life. Diogenes furthermore disapproved of conventional religion and believed social customs are human inventions and that adhering to them leads to hypocrisy.<br><br>2/2", "time": 1670919821, "resto": 21376604}, {"no": 21377819, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)03:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Plato: Plato proposed that the only true knowledge involves rational thought, which is ultimately sublimated into intuitive and mystical knowledge of the good. According to Plato, at the end of this journey lies an enlightenment experience, where the soul grasps the metaphysical source of the universe all at once, dispelling all ignorance and attaining immortal wisdom. Since the soul is immortal and has been born many times over before its present life, it has already seen many things, both in this world and in the worlds beyond this one.

Fate is a nice tool to contextualize values and human agency, since Achilles knowledge of his death in the war means he has to decide what matters to him. It contextualizes his rage over the death of Patroclus, his choice to return to the war and face death for personal vengeance against Hector.

I&#039;m glad some people here know the Greeks. Particularly, I don&#039;t think many modern people seem to read the Odyssey and really question what is going on with Telemachus and Penelope. It might just be the archaic way it is all written, but it seems like people glaze over at that. The suitors both don&#039;t need Penelope and do need her to take possession of Ithaca. Penelope isn&#039;t the &quot;heir&quot; of Ithaca per se, Odysseus inherited the throne through his father and Penelope is just his wife, but Telemachus is not the one in charge of the household either because he doesn&#039;t seek to claim it, he believes his father lives. It is just de facto the case that Penelope is the one who represents the household of Odysseus and the closest position to the power over Ithaca, so the suitors compete with each other for Ithaca by competing over Penelope. She just finds herself in the position of being the means to claim some legitimacy over Ithaca. <br><br>But also as you said, while I think Telemachus doesn&#039;t want to claim power over Ithaca because on some level this could be seen as a betrayal of his father, or a challenge to him (the situation could get sticky if Odysseus returns), he also simply doesn&#039;t feel secure enough to do so. There are tons of adult men in Odysseus&#039; house who have many friends and kinsmen who would fight on their side, and Telemachus doesn&#039;t feel capable of opposing them. This is the flip side to him potentially feeling conflicted about claiming the household for himself, what if the suitors simply try to kill him and take Ithaca? Suppose his father returns, he would find that his incapable son lost everything. So ultimately Penelope and Telemachus are of the same understanding that the best thing to do is stall for time and try to find Odysseus.", "time": 1670958853, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379470, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:15:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "being gay used to be cool now its just female fantasies where one guy is essentially a woman that preteen chicks scared of penetration self insert into so that they dont have to think of vaginas getting fucked<br>women ruined being gay", "time": 1670958935, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379498, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:24:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379346</a><br>I only saw the movie once when it first came out and tried hard to forget it afterwards.

They don&#039;t always, it isn&#039;t some necessary condition of patriarchy, but it happens in multiple cultures throughout history and doesn&#039;t seem like a coincidence. Consider how the companionship of women can become devalued by their general status as tools for powerful men to trade between each other. Women are still arousing, but even in this capacity they can easily be equated to slave women and prostitutes who are just objectified for their qualities of being arousing.<br><br>So the female sex in general becomes partially sub-human, they&#039;re just the inferiors of men. The test of companionship for women becomes their loyalty to you, but their loyalty is expected of them and isn&#039;t exactly valuable as something given to you. Greeks in Homer still showed strong signs of being a gift giving culture, since the aristocracy proudly gave, received and displayed gifts as signs of respect and alliance. In the Iliad there were even cases where somebody would recognize somebody else as a friend because their fathers had exchanged gifts. Gift giving is done between, roughly speaking, people who are equals, and it displays how you are valued by others when they freely give you gifts. <br><br>The loyalty of a wife in a culture as patriarchal as the Homeric Greeks was not a gift given by the wife, she owes loyalty as a member of the patriarch&#039;s household. But the loyalty and devotion of a man can really inspire pride, because men can be equals in honor. So the relationship between men can take on a deeper value. That isn&#039;t to then say that love between men and women in the way we understand it as a kind of companionship of &quot;equals&quot; was unheard of, but it was usually very ambiguously presented as something like intense lust. But male companionship wasn&#039;t as sullied by the quality of women as sexual objects that brought houses together in alliance. So it is easy to see how it can paradoxically (for us) appear as &quot;masculine&quot; to have semi-sexual companionship with men, because it is like an equal is giving themselves to you freely. But there are still tensions around dominance and who is giving to who, so you also get the common element of the older man and the younger man who is often something like an &quot;apprentice&quot; to the older man (see the gay samurai too).", "time": 1670960134, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379629, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379498</a><br>The prophecy of glory for Achilles is not in the Iliad.

The large red dragon knelt in front of the prince, knowing what was desired. Securly mounted, the two took flight across the kingdom of Pillarme. They flew past the forests and into the mountains, finally landing near a large secluded lake surrounded by the snowy peaks that guarded it. It was their spot, a spot no one else knew, except one other; a girl of ashen hair and hazel eyes.

His writings are a crutch for people who can&#039;t think for themselves but are intelligent enough to feel the need to place their faith in some monolithic intellectual body of work that has been sufficiently praised by the authoritative clergy of their time (academics). Even the responses in this thread illustrate my point. The best the Marxists here can say in response to criticism is &quot;just read it better&quot; like some bible-thumping American southerner. The thinking is identical. Just as religious people see the Universe as proof of God&#039;s existence, Marxists see the very existence of classes as proof that Marx was right.

Business profit is gross sales - (cost of labor + cost of materials and equipment). As tech increases corps have to keep investing in equipment/machinery to compete with rival corps. This increases supply which lowers the price. This means that all things being equal profit will get smaller and smaller over time. Eventually, this will cause a crisis called a depression or recession where investments start going bust on mass. Marx predicts that all else being equal these crises will become more frequent and drastic.

Business profit is gross sales - (cost of labor + cost of materials and equipment). As tech increases corps have to keep investing in equipment/machinery to compete with rival corps. This increases supply which lowers the price. This means that all things being equal profit will get smaller and smaller over time. Eventually, this will cause a crisis called a depression or recession where investments start going bust on mass. Marx predicts that all else being equal these crises will become more frequent and drastic. Okishio showed that if you can somehow keep coming up with a constantly increasing worker base then you can have stable capitalism.

I simply cannot believe that you, with all your knowledge and taste, are not made to squirm by such things as the dialogues between the \u201cpositive\u201d characters in Faulkner (and especially those absolutely ghastly italics).

The Faulkner, again, has a texture of emotion infused into every string, whilst Nabokov keeps a sort of academic distance.

Faulkner gives us his direct approach, this happens, this means this to the man, this sounds this way, and when he does try to insert detail, it strikes a sort of false tone, the &quot;that precarious and meretricious&quot;, if one could pin his style down in his own words, he&#039;s done it here.

More than that, they are unconcerned with the fortunes of their village, the safety of their streets, the fate of their church and its vestry. They think that such things have nothing to do with them, that they belong to a powerful stranger called \u201cthe government.\u201d They enjoy these goods as tenants, without a sense of ownership, and never give a thought to how they might be improved. They are so divorced from their own interests that even when their own security and that of their children is finally compromised, they do not seek to avert the danger themselves but cross their arms and wait for the nation as a whole to come to their aid. Yet as utterly as they sacrifice their own free will, they are no fonder of obedience than anyone else. They submit, it is true, to the whims of a clerk, but no sooner is force removed than they are glad to defy the law as a defeated enemy.

Everything else is incredibly deadline intensive, and the clients want work done yesterday. <br><br>Also, the biggest problem with the practice of law is the billable hour. Firms might set you a target that says you need 1800 billable hours a year. You might think &#039;woo, nice, that&#039;s the same as the average hours worked by US employees, and lawyers get paid a lot so it&#039;s fine.&#039; It&#039;s not fine. Just because you have been at work for an hour does not mean that&#039;s a billable hour. It&#039;s entirely common to be at work for 8 hours but only bill 5, in which case you either BILL for 11 (work for 14+) the next day to catch catch up, or more commonly work on the weekend to make up those extra unbilled hours. <br><br>Also, 1800 hours is not a common target for big firms. Firms that pay a decent wage relative to hours worked demand 2100+ billable hours a year. Which factoring in commute and all this shit means you have been &#039;at work&#039; for 3000+.

There&#039;s about a dozen dissenting opinions where Thomas and Scalia cite each other about how the majority is constantly exceeding its authority, which are funny to read, particularly Scalia&#039;s.<br><br>Thomas actually does think proportionality exists, but is only relevant in capital cases, or (maybe) fines/bail/whippings. Also worth noting that his upper bound for what would be proportionate is something like executing a seven year old for stealing 50 dollars worth of merchandise. Maybe adjusted for inflation if he were feeling particularly generous. The gist of the argument as I understand it is that (a) the framers never used any language to indicate proportionality in sentencing, (b) the 8th Amendment was meant to protect against torture and little else, and (c) prison sentences were never really covered under the 8th Amendment since they didn&#039;t exist in 1790; only of relevance is executions, whippings, public shaming, etc. Honestly I might be somewhat incorrect here, but yes, it&#039;s exactly as insane as it sounds.<br><br>Honestly it&#039;s a mediocre argument in my opinion, since the actual text of the 8th Amendment implies proportionality in fines and bail (&quot;excessive&quot; implies proportionality), other historically relevant documents like the English Bill of Rights contain explicit proportionality guarantees, and when dealing with how cruel any punishment is the idea of proportionality is implicit.<br><br>Thomas goes over the argument in his dissent in Graham v. Florida. You can ignore everything about how unusual the punishment is (number of states, etc.) since he doesn&#039;t think the analysis the majority is using should exist at all, unless you find that debate interesting in its own right.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/f<wbr>ederal/us/560/48/</span>", "time": 1670740213, "resto": 21364471}, {"no": 21369935, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:38:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m a software engineer.

But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the Radical right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other group, and frequently does so. I know of the operation of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.</span>", "time": 1670622961, "resto": 21363533}, {"no": 21363767, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)17:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21363533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21363533</a><br>Once upon a time just a hundred years ago a lot of highly educated English pederasts thought that the Anglo-Saxon race was superior to everyone else and had a mission to civilize the world and uplift lower races.

In the poem, the narrator describes choosing the less-traveled path at a fork in the road, which has made all the difference in their life. In your text, you appear to be making a similar analogy, but instead of a fork in the road, you are talking about a split in your urine stream. By referencing the Frost poem, you seem to be implying that even a seemingly small and insignificant choice, such as which path to take in a wood or which stream of urine to follow, can have a profound impact on a person&#039;s life. In the case of your text, you seem to be saying that you took the road less traveled by posting on 4chan, and that this choice has made all the difference. This is similar to the message of the Frost poem, which is that the choices we make in life can shape our destiny. In addition to this overall message, you also seem to be using humor and absurdity to make your point. By talking about a split in your urine stream and comparing it to a fork in the road, you are intentionally exaggerating the importance of the choice you made.

Instead, he argues, these types of places have simply become liminal spaces constructed in order to fulfill the needs of consumers. The physical location itself has superseded the symbolic attachments we have to traditional places. Instead, these non-places serve as simple transitional spaces from one act of consumption to the next, utterly devoid of any meaning beyond their own purpose.

It&#039;s kind of dense, definitely not the must interesting read at times, but he lays out a pretty convincing argument. <br><br>Colonial American&#039;s enjoyed living and consooming in a trans-Atlantic world full of new consumer goods. 18th-century Britain was laying the foundation for the Industrial Revolution, especially in the hinterlands where individual households produced what Breen calls the &quot;baubles&quot; of Britain. These shiny trinkets filled genteel and middle class colonists&#039; homes. <br>As the American independence movement began, the levies on consumer goods increased. This caused the vast majority of Americans-- even those who didn&#039;t give a shit about the high minded Enlightenment ideals-- to seethe to unprecedented levels. Once their consooooming was interrupted, more colonists participated in revolutionary politics in greater numbers and with a newfound fervor. Aditionally, Breen argues much of the early networks of communication (committees of correspondence) and demonstrates centered around protests against taxes that negatively impacted consumers the most (must... consoom.... MUH TEA... need... LE PLAYING CARDS). <br>Boycotts and similar protests allowed all colonists to participate in the revolution. Women especially found a sense of patriotisms in their shopping choices. Women often controlled most of the household budget, and their correspondence helped further strengthen ties throughout the colonies.<br><br>The story is nothing new: no taxation without representation (retarded argument btw). Breen&#039;s contribution was that it was precisely the consooming American public that formed the basis for revolutionary change.<br>As he argues:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the colonists&#039; shared experience as consumers provided them with cultural resources needed to develop a bold new form of political protest. In this unprecedented context, private decisions were interpreted as political acts; consumer choices communicated personal loyalties. Goods became the foundation of trust, for one&#039;s willingness to sacrifice the pleasures of the market provided as remarkably visible and effective test of allegiance. </span><br><br>I think it&#039;s an important work if you want to study the development of American consumer behavior and the politics of consumption.

I don&#039;t think it even helps, personally, at least not once you let go of your independence of thought, subsume your individualism and start seeing literally anyone as &quot;more expert&quot; than you are. Good writing is, in my opinion, a function primarily of good taste and dedicated practice. The things you like about literature should be deep and enduring love for inexpressible infinitesimals you (and maybe only you) find exhilarating. The things you dislike about literature should be deep and burning hatreds. Above all, you should trust your ability to (eventually) grasp that for which you reach.

Andre Gide said his writing was something like, to paraphrase, the pursuit of his soul, or the growth of his soul. That&#039;s good too. With writing seriously I&#039;ve found that I could never write before due to faults in my own character, or views, or mindset, or state of mind.

And now I&#039;ve mastered sitting and typing I find myself blocked with how to return to revise a story, or edit it, and actually make it whole and complete (or as much as can be). And of course with just returning at will to write something, because most days I feel completely thrown about by outside forces that I have to follow or simply waste the day and go limp.

Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active.

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way. The presupposition of autistic initiation and meaningless cyclical samsara should be dropped, and the &quot;merely accidental&quot; elements of traditions (that is, that don&#039;t accord with autistic initiation and meaningless cyclicality) should be reinterpreted in this light.", "time": 1670832148, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373703, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373700</a><br>Much of the Traditionalist understanding of history doesn&#039;t stand up to scrutiny.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

But personality and freedom are symbolically analogous to history: apparent contingency that can contain or reflect symbolic truth. Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence. But if the nature of all being is that of essence, which is pure in itself but which struggles to manifest clearly in becoming, then why shouldn&#039;t becoming itself (and its subordinate aspects: personality, freedom, history) have its own essence and meaning? Why not interpret ALL temporal contingency, all becoming qua &quot;mere negation of, or derivation or divagation from, atemporal being,&quot; as itself the symbolic emanation of an essence that combines and explains both being and becoming, instead of merely LEAVING becoming as an empty/negative category as almost all nondualist metaphysicians, including Traditionalists, do?

I haven&#039;t figured out any of the story, characters, themes, or message yet, but my worldbuilding and magic system have been coming along for a while (I have a full three pages in Word).<br><br>In my world, your magic meter is based on how much urine is in your bladder. The power of magic comes from urine, so the more you can retain in your body the more magic you can perform and the more powerful the magic is. This means that characters need to train their bladders to hold more and more urine, and before a big fight they drink lots of water to stock up on magic meter. The balance to this is that the more powerful a magic user you are, the more urgently you need to finish a battle and use your magic, because you really need to pee. Most battles involve characters dancing around and holding in their pee excruciatingly.<br><br>I&#039;m hoping this can really grip readers and be a relatable system for magic use that gives tangible stakes. I&#039;ve spent a long time on this, so I think people will really like it. I&#039;ve got a sample below to show it:<br><br>Yorindu had to pee really bad, and that was good because his magic comes from pee. The more pee he could hold in, the greater his sorcery would grow. He was practicing his magic by sitting in one place and squirming. In the land of Per&#039;du&#039;mahyo&#039;wank&#039;do the only way to do magic was not peeing. An empty bladder was a death sentence. Today his piss magic was overflowing and his kidneys were at a dangerous risk, his bladder was almost bursting. He was ready for battle with the dark lord, who had the biggest bladder in the land. It would be an almost impossible battle, as his bladder could hold only 3 cups of urine, which for a human was quite a lot, but the dark lord&#039;s bladder could hold over 20 cups of urine! His magic level was far higher, but the power of friendship could perhaps unite the urine of he and his friends.<br><br>What do you think?", "time": 1670673706, "resto": 21364715}, {"no": 21366170, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:04:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366166</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think?</span><br>What&#039;s there to think?

Technically, Xie-Kai wasn&#039;t even supposed to be in the resting area -- it wasn&#039;t her life that could have been lost. Xie-Kai paused and awaited a response as if her words were still on their way to Zai-Chen&#039;s head &quot;Maybe...&quot; she thought, &quot;If I move these bandages, he&#039;ll hear me...&quot; She reached out to move them, but her arm lost motivation part of the way through; the hand simply rested on Zai-Chen&#039;s white-wrapped Face.<br>Xie-Kai began crying. She did so as quietly as she could, to keep this illegal encounter away from anyone else. Her plan, which she wanted to run by its other participant, funneled into her mind\u2019s eye again: \u201cGather some medicines, bandages, a map of the area, Zai-Chen, and leave.\u201d Atake and Shujin could pick up the slack - they loved that sort of thing. <br>Everything she needed, sans the map, was literally right beside her. She\u2019d use one arm for her brother and the other for the medicines and map. Probably. There were still things to work out. As a test, Xie-Kai tried lifting her still unconscious brother out of his bed. She had never attempted such a feat: his weight was uneven, and he was rolling out of her care like he wanted to remain in the bed, in their cursed lives. <br>&quot;I could be hurting him even more.&quot; And, this was true. She only saw what Atake had done to him. Only Zai-Chen could feel it. She allowed him to leave her fingers and return to rest. From here, all Xie-Kai did was imagine other possibilities - other &quot;presents&quot; where Zai-Chan had won, or Atake fought another warrior, or where none of her siblings had to fight at all. One where... she had been strong enough to fight Atake instead. Her anger got the better of her peace in the end.<br>The next morning, like all of the others, she and Shujin awaited an instructor at Tsung-cho, as did the other battered children of similar age.

If that is a style you&#039;re going for, it needs to be more apparent to the reader or you have to have literary clout to justify it. Things like this are really hard to get right, to be honest, and most of these &quot;stylistic choices&quot; end up feeling really tacky.<br><br>You have good and interesting ideas, but they are not yet properly expressed in prose. You really have to try and capture the essence of a thing and the feeling evoked in your writing, and connect those to your ideas. The things you want to say, in most cases, should not be said plainly in the text; but shown through situations, descriptions, the hero&#039;s actions. The imagery must be strong. In your excerpt there are multiple ideas all battling for attention. You start from the machines. Then, it&#039;s the filth. His childhood, briefly. Archeological excavations. But you fail to give any of these the proper focus and productively expand on them. For example, the libidinality driving consumption and producing waste, in which the mechanic is interested, could&#039;ve easily been shown through more &quot;visual&quot; means. You don&#039;t have to explicitly state: &quot;The Rat Man was fond of studying his waste.&quot; Instead, he should be rifling through the trash, I don&#039;t know, tipping over the trash bucket, scattering everything all over the floor, and getting gum stuck to the carpet; or maybe neatly pulling each piece of trash out of the bucket and arranging and organizing it in some very specific way, into a &quot;chart or constellation.&quot; But all this while you describe everything in the most vivid way possible. Then, a cold and sudden technical, philosophical description. The narrator changes from being very physical and real to being very abstract and distant (but, &quot;paradoxically,&quot; thus also close). This contrast would better place the reader into the mind of the hero. It also keeps the reader&#039;s attention, since it introduces variety. And you already sorta do that to the end of your piece: &quot;It was flows of desire...&quot; or &quot;historical changes in consumption, culture, economic and religious activity.&quot; But, once again, there&#039;s not enough of it. And, in this case, it&#039;s still that same narrator from earlier, and it&#039;s not all that much more distant. You&#039;re still telling me, the reader, about the hero doing something and explaining the reasoning behind the hero&#039;s actions: &quot;he would play geologist.&quot;", "time": 1670898161, "resto": 21364715}, {"no": 21376914, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)21:31:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21376739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21376739</a><br>I always wonder if publishers purposely hold onto book rights until the author&#039;s dead so they can keep the lions share of it.

For if it is true that the Enlightenment had succeeded in differentiating mind and nature, the noosphere and the biosphere, it had also tended to forget the transcendental and unifying Ground of both, and thus it tended to dissociate mind and nature (the great potential pathology of reason). This dissociation of mind and nature, Ego and Eco, with mind \u201cmirroring\u201d nature in scientific inquiry (the reflection paradigm) was, of course, well under way; but reflection had, Schelling pointed out, introduced a rift or cleavage between nature as external object and the reflecting self as subject (which also, he said, made humans objects to themselves\u2014the retroflected monological gaze). When reflection is made an end it itself, it becomes \u201ca spiritual malady.\u201d<br><br>Schelling realized that the dissociation could \u201cnot be overcome by a return to the immediacy of feeling, to the childhood, as it were, of the human race.\u201d There was no going back to Eco-nature, and Schelling knew it.<br><br>Rather, he maintained, we have to go forward beyond reason in order to discover that mind and nature are both simply different movements of one absolute Spirit, a Spirit that manifests itself in its own successive stages of unfoldment and enfoldment. As Hegel would soon put it, Spirit is not One apart from Many, but the very process of the One expressing itself in successive unfoldings in and through the Many-it is infinite activity expressing itself in and as the finite process of development itself (or evolution).<br><br>The Absolute is thus both the Alpha and the Omega of development. Schelling:\u201cI posit God as both the first and the last, as the Alpha and the Omega, as the unevolved, Deus implicitus, and the fully evolved, Deus explicitus\u201d-in other words, both Source and Summit-and present throughout the entire ascending or developmental process as telos (Eros), as the self-organizing and self-transcending drive of the whole process. And, as Schelling put it, it is this \u201corganizing principle which makes the world a system...a self-organizing totality.\u201d<br><br>Whatever else we might say, the world does hang together, and evolution does have a direction: Eros as Spirit-in-action. Thus, both Schelling and Hegel would maintain that evolution is not simply the drive toward Spirit; it is the drive of Spirit toward Spirit, manifested in a series of increasing wholes and integrations (holons) that express increasing degrees of Spirit\u2019s own self-realization or self-actualization. Eros is fully present at each and every stage of the process, as the very process itself. As Fichte had put it, Being is one \u201cendlessly self-developing life which always advances toward a higher self-realization in a never-ending stream of time.\u201d Or Hegel: the Absolute is \u201cthe process of its own becoming; it becomes concrete or actual only by its development.\u201d", "time": 1670974657, "resto": 21380246}, {"no": 21380336, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)18:53:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.schellingzone.com/chapt<wbr>er-3.html", "time": 1670975615, "resto": 21380246}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21380295, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)18:40:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this author actually decent? why are his books always brought up but it seems so few people have actually read them?", "filename": "48509259", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 212, "h": 320, "tn_w": 165, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670974808781124, "time": 1670974808, "md5": "w7aO8QlD+s1BzHEYhYtHCg==", "fsize": 82495, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-this-author-actually-decent-why-are-his-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 21380299, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)18:41:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21380295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21380295</a><br>Because he spams his schlock here", "time": 1670974867, "resto": 21380295}, {"no": 21380323, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)18:50:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read one of the stories from his book.

As when David had killed Goliath the giant, came glad tidings unto the jewes, that their fearful and cruel enemy was slain, and they delivered out of all danger: for gladness whereof, they sung, danced, and were joyful. In like manner is the Evangelion of God (which we call Gospel; and the New Testament) joyful tidings; and as some say, a good hearing published by the apostles throughout all the world, of Christ the right David how that he hath fought with sin, with death, and the devil, and overcome them. Whereby all men that were in bondage to sin, wounded to death, overcome of the devil, are with out their own merits or deservings, loosed, justified, restored to life, and saved, brought to liberty, and reconciled unto the favour of God, and set at one with him again: which tidings as many as believe, laud praise and thank God; are glad, sing and dance for joy. This evangelion or gospell (that is to say, such joyful tidings) is called the new testament. Because that as a man when he shall die appointeth his goods to be dealt and distributed after his death among them which he nameth to be his heirs. Even so Christ before his death commanded and appointed that such evangelion, gospell, or tidings should be declared through out all the world, and there with to give unto all that believe all his goods, that is to say, his life, where with he swallowed and devoured up death: his righteousness, where with he banished sin: his salvation, where with he overcame eternal damnation. Now can the wretched man (that is wrapped in sin, and is in danger to death and hell) hear no more joyous a thing, then such glad and comfortable tidings, of Christ. So that he cannot but be glad and laugh from the low bottom of his heart, if he believe that the tidings are true. To strength such faith with all, God promised this his evangelion in the old testament by the prophets (as Paul sayth in the first chapter unto the romans). How that he was chosen out to preach God&#039;s evangelion, which he before had promised by the prophets in the holy scriptures that treat of his son which was born of the seed of David.", "filename": "BibleKJV", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 320, "h": 240, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670855626028429, "time": 1670855626, "md5": "XSOQKn9PFeNylScqVuSKVw==", "fsize": 14454, "resto": 21371428}, {"no": 21374818, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)10:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21371428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21371428</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why</span><br>because its a cheap value added feature. <br>If you&#039;re serious about Bibble Study, get the current edition from cepher.org.

Different versions of Catholicism operate under different vague definitions, not to mention other groups. Would the gnostic writings be considered apocryphal? I would say if a writing isn&#039;t inspired scriptures then it should all be considered as such. What relationship these apocryphal books have to Scripture differs among the different sects. Many groups want to accord a lesser status to &quot;apocrypha,&quot; while still elevating them as being something above normal writings. In particular though, the church draws a hard line between what is inspired, however, being the word of God, as compared to everything else \u2013 this is based on what is said of Scripture being &quot;God-breathed&quot; in 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and being incorruptible and spoken by the prophets and apostles according to 1 Peter 1:23-25 and 2 Peter 1:20-21, among other distinctions. Those who tend not to take these distinctions spoken of in Scripture seriously, or who de-emphasize them, and are more likely to attribute scripture as a whole as being manmade, and are therefore more likely to have a more multi-layered view, with apocrypha occupying a rung below the core of the Bible but above most other things in their view, since really the Bible as a whole is all just manmade to them and in their view, anyway.<br><br>So, having said all that, there are different apocrypha that were included with various early Bibles during the printing press era, because these were writings that were referenced by others, so it was thought practical to include them. However, it was not indispensable. This is why in the KJV these writings are set apart from the rest of the Bible and marked as &quot;apocrypha.&quot; According to the dictionary definition, these are &quot;things [...] whose authenticity, as inspired writings, is not admitted, and which are therefore not considered a part of the sacred canon of the scripture.&quot; Like the other apparatuses included with the Bibles, such as the genealogies and maps, these were not always included in every edition.<br><br>One apocryphal book included in some Bibles of this era was the &quot;Prayer of Manasses,&quot; a translation for which was included in the Matthew Bible and the 1560 Geneva Bible, but it is not part of the apocryphal additions of Roman Catholicism in particular; while at the same time, other apocryphal books are. Overall, these books are not seen as inspired any more than the extra maps and calendars included by various Bible publishers.

It&#039;s based on a somewhat different Hebrew text that didn&#039;t come from the Masoretes, primarily one that was published by Daniel Bomberg in 1525 in Venice, namely the 2nd edition Bomberg text. This version of the Old Testament differs from the MT which is what modern translations such as the NKJV use. For instance in 1 Kings 20:38 and 41, the KJV and its Hebrew source text says &quot;ashes,&quot; while the MT and most modern translations will say &quot;bandage.&quot; Also in Zephaniah 3:15, the Hebrew (and the KJV) says, &quot;see evil,&quot; but the Ben Asher Masoretic Text (and modern versions) says, &quot;fear evil.&quot; There are numerous other differences, although they are not at severe as the difference between the Hebrew and the Septuagint of Origen.<br><br>What is commonly referred to as the LXX has numerous omissions and alterations, for instance in Genesis 5 the ages of the patriarchs is changed such that Methuselah outlives the Flood by 14 years.<br><br>Specifically:<br>Genesis 5:25 in the modern LXX makes Lamech be born twenty years sooner<br>Genesis 5:28 in the modern LXX makes Noah be born eight years later<br>The resulting consequence is that according to that version, Methuselah lived until Noah&#039;s 614th year, however the flood occurred in Noah&#039;s 600th year, which signifies that Methuselah outlived the flood by 14 years due to the change in numbers in Genesis 5:25 and 28.<br><br>Additionally, the following messianic prophecies are not found in the LXX, but they are found in the Hebrew/KJV.<br><br>Psalm 2:12, Isaiah 9:6, Jeremiah 33:15, Habakkuk 3:13, Zephaniah 3:17, Haggai 2:7.<br><br>I&#039;ve never seen someone give a legitimate converse example.<br><br>Also, the LXX or Septuagint removes vast amounts of the Old Testament. For instance in the Septuagint, the book of Jeremiah is missing about 1/8 of its content. In total, about 2700 words are removed from Jeremiah in the LXX, representing about 1/8 of the book. Other parts of the book of Jeremiah are altered to be inaccurate as well. For instance as one example, in Jeremiah 37:1, the name, &quot;Coniah the son of Jehoiakim,&quot; is replaced with the name &quot;Jehoiakim,&quot; a different person. Looking in other books, there are many other removals in the LXX. It is completely missing, for instance, more than 30 proverbs from the book of Proverbs. To mention just a few at random, Proverbs 11:4, 13:6, 15:31, 16:1, 16:3-4, 16:6-9, etc. And after these, there are many more verses that are only partially removed or are quite substantially altered in the Septuagint.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Origen et al were clearly in support of the Christian religion</span><br>I don&#039;t believe this, look up what Origen believed.", "time": 1670970447, "resto": 21371428}, {"no": 21380117, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)17:32:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21380104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21380104</a><br>Here are a couple of examples of what I&#039;m talking about.

No one in this thread would write what Kafka wrote. Not that I&#039;m sure we wouldn&#039;t all produce some good stuff. My point is that it&#039;s the specific style and the unfolding detail of the text that makes it a good story (imo), not the absurd premise or something thematic or symbolic.<br><br>Kafka develops the text of the story through inventive little steps of logic and feeling. Like Gregor minutely testing how to operate his new body. Like the picture of the women that hangs on his wall, which is mentioned in the first paragraph, and which he latter scuttles over to press his bugbelly against, enjoying the feel of the glass. Like the apple that, launched by his father, gets lodged permanently in his back. Like him lying there at night hearing his family on the other side of the door. Like all the little bits of practical fuss he makes as he inches towards death.<br><br>That careful attention trained on the specifics of the world and the way they interlock rattles your perception out of the normal categories and pathways it&#039;s used to. Which is why I feel like I look at things differently after reading Kafka stories. But the difference is unnameable; it&#039;s not just adding another category to slot things into, so you can say &#039;Ah, now I see, it&#039;s all about [despair/alienation/societal-reject<wbr>ion]&#039; and carry on as normal.<br><br>The difference just sort of surrounds you.

The central premise was simple: you are only allowed to believe in something that you can prove via reason and empiricism. This ideology was constructed by nerds on the late-90s to early-2000s internet, particularly in opposition to the comedic stupidity of the Republican &quot;Moral Majority&quot; ideology/philosophy of the Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush administrations. Around 2007 or so, a faction split off. This faction, in essence, believed that Atheism meant a rejection of Liberalism. When this turned out not to be the case (the Democrats began to takeup ant-Christian rhetoric at this time), this faction left and became what we now know as the Alt Right. There&#039;s more to be said about the genealogy here, but we aren&#039;t talking about these guys.<br><br>This left &quot;nuAtheism&quot;, which maintained the emphasis on rational argumentation (to absurdity).
