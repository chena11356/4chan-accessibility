One very important part about math is understanding how to read it. Part of that is intuition, so practicing manipulating equations, memorizing graphs associated with certain orders if equations, and putting these things into a tangible context as well as understanding the logic that gives it its concrete reality is the crux of appreciating math. My suggestion to people that have a high school understanding of math is to get 3 text books. First a discrete math structured text book that covers logic, basic proofs, and, if you can find one, some probability theory. Second, an intermediate trigonometry text book that goes over trig principles with complex numbers and some basic complex analysis. And finally a linear algebra text book because it shows you a really great way to visualize algebra that they dont show you in high school (a more intuitive method too, Im not sure why they dont teach it in high school).

You learn that something is horrifically wrong with you when your parents treat you in a way that makes you feel terrible and they do it to you regularly and from a young age. Your parents are the only people in the world you&#039;re born knowing and having a connection to and when they reject you, in any way really, you don&#039;t have the knowledge or field of vision or even reasoning skills as a small child or even infant to be able to internalize that as anything other than &quot;There&#039;s something wrong with me, I am bad&quot;. It leads to a problem like yours and one I sometimes still struggle with where you feel like if anyone were to really know you they&#039;d find that there is this disgusting irredeemable creature lying underneath whatever facsimile that exists that they seem to see that allows them to falsely believe that there are positive or redeeming qualities to you(outside of the ones that you&#039;re able to allow yourself to concede for one reason or another). For me getting over that was about realizing the roots of my negative introjects and moving past them by cultivating a real, true understanding of myself and my value.<br><br>Your mother for some reason just hated you and your siblings, her bullshit excuse is her own rationalization for treating her children fucking horribly that allows herself to not see the reality of her being a broken person that handicapped them out of pure spite.<br>You&#039;re being directed by adaptations in your unconscious system that are out of your control because you don&#039;t understand them and until you do they will remain in control. The outcomes you&#039;re finding in life are not the ones that you seem to want and it&#039;s because you&#039;re unable to take real action towards them. Explore your feelings and figure out what the root of that hesitation is, then maybe you can move forwards. Every feeling we have is a form of communication between us and our unconscious, there is an underlying emotional logic to everything, figure out what it is for you.", "time": 1670383921, "resto": 21350127}, {"no": 21352215, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:35:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21352117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21352117</a><br>There is more women than men in NYC and many attractive successful ones, if she is from bumfuck nowhere she may have been hit on by some of these men for the first time in her life combined with alcohol and feeling depressed about her new life that she easily gave into the excitement and thrill.", "time": 1670384114, "resto": 21350127}, {"no": 21352218, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)22:35:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21352178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21352178</a><br>I&#039;m married.

I had only read a handful of short stories and essays by him before this but I am now fully on board the Maupassant train. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman is probably the funniest book I have ever read. Not only did I laugh loudly very often but even when I was silent I was always incredibly amused. Barthes is maybe the best writer of essays I&#039;ve ever read. The charm, insight, and virtuosic prose is next to none. It&#039;s also delightful to read him describe things that you have no interest in to see how he imbues them with real power, such as competitive cycling and professional (I.E. fake) wrestling. <br>Don Quixote is an obvious one. Enjoyed every page and enjoyed it greatly. Plutarch&#039;s Lives is not something I think I will ever reread from cover to cover ever again but I can see myself reread individual biographies very often. Anytime I ever encounter a figure from this book in another piece of media I can see myself coming back here to read its chapter. <br><br>Interesting. Etruscan Places takes me to almost the end of Lawrence&#039;s travel writings. I think I prefer his travel writings to anything else he wrote. It&#039;s effectively an essay but there are characters and small scale events. It&#039;s lean, straight to the point, and compelling in its ideas while also being engaging. Rabelais&#039; biography by France really is a love letter. The author is deeply in love with the man, his writings, and the whole project of humanism, and this enthusiasm is wrapped up in lovely picturesque descriptions of renaissance France and Italy. Beautiful Boys/Outlaw Bodies is a history and analysis of the men who specialise in playing women&#039;s roles in Kabuki theatre. It&#039;s so weird it almost makes me feel like I&#039;m reading in some heavy world-building chapters in a sci-fi novel. <br><br>Disappointments. Orlando. I really wanted to like this novel. I love Woolf but it&#039;s obvious (and true) that this novel was something she wrote very quickly between more serious novels as I way to unwind. Enticing at first but wears out its welcome around a 1/4 way through and it is a very short novel. Due to a lapse in memory I thought that Raymond Carver and Raymond Chandler were the same person. I started The Big Sleep thinking of Carver whom I have some fondness for. Unfortunately I was wrong and Chandler&#039;s The Big Sleep is maybe the worst book I have any memory of having ever read in my life bar things from my childhood.

The Amish women, for instance, who must be practical, or conservative women in general who tend to do the same thing as a lot of conservative men, and over-romanticize stereotypically masculine activities - which would seem to favor an active life, and I suppose I can recall men who were especially well-loved by women on both sides; inactivity and activity. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion, that the most valuable way to gain from those lines of Yeats&#039;, whether as a man or woman, is to think on the sort of man he was imagining as one who is popular, yet useless, and the sort he imagined one ought to be. As a man, for the purpose of being him, and as a woman, so as not to make the mistake of going for the wrong sort. This we can do irrespective of degrees of agreement on whether women generally favor idle men. On the other hand, if it were true, I wonder why? <br><br><a href=\"#p21350901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21350901</a><br>I&#039;m planning on starting the Divine Comedy for the first time soon; once I finish what I&#039;m currently reading - although I have been debating whether to read Virgil first.

Truly, Christians fall short of the calling of God though we try - in proliferating the faith, and in living out Romans 12, &quot;rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep,&quot; yet those commands do run in opposition to human nature, rendering the necessity of command.

Get lost, schizo.&quot; is a prime example of how language can be used to express a range of emotions and attitudes. First of all, the use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; is quite striking. This is a profanity, and its inclusion in the post immediately grabs the reader&#039;s attention. It also conveys a sense of frustration, suggesting that the writer is not happy with the situation that they are describing. But the real power of the post lies in the phrase &quot;get lost, schizo.&quot; This is a very concise and effective way of expressing a strong sentiment. The use of the imperative mood (&quot;get lost&quot;) is commanding and assertive, while the use of the noun &quot;schizo&quot; is derogatory and dismissive. Together, these words convey a clear message: that the writer wants the person with schizophrenia to go away and leave them alone. Another interesting aspect of the post is the way that it uses language to create a sense of distance and separation. The use of the second-person pronoun (&quot;you&quot;) puts the reader in the position of the person being addressed, making them feel like they are the one being told to &quot;get lost.&quot; This creates a sense of alienation and exclusion, reinforcing the idea that the writer does not want to have anything to do with the person with schizophrenia. Overall, the language used in the post is very effective at conveying the writer&#039;s emotions and attitudes. The use of profanity and imperative mood create a sense of anger and frustration, while the use of the second-person pronoun and the noun &quot;schizo&quot; create a sense of distance and exclusion. These linguistic choices are very effective at communicating the writer&#039;s message and eliciting a response from the reader.</span>", "time": 1670380660, "resto": 21351759}, {"no": 21351968, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:41:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21351759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21351759</a><br>my poetry is dope<br>who cares about modern poetry<br>style your shit according to classical<br>standards<br>and be glad that posey still<br>means something to some<br>namby pamby <br>imagine letting modern sentiment<br>effect your enjoyment of transcendent<br>yet personal poetry<br>YOP", "time": 1670380906, "resto": 21351759}], "last_modified": 1670380906}, {"no": 21351501, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:52:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I kind of relate to Meursault.

McCarthy is one of the greatest American authors of all time, with a career spanning over six decades. His works have been praised for their intense and evocative prose, as well as their exploration of deep philosophical and moral themes. As I flip through the pages of &quot;The Passenger,&quot; I am struck by McCarthy&#039;s unique writing style. His words are raw and powerful, and they seem to cut straight to the core of human existence. The book is a haunting and thought-provoking reflection on the nature of life and death, and it is a fitting conclusion to McCarthy&#039;s impressive body of work. Reading &quot;The Passenger&quot; feels like a privilege. It is a glimpse into the mind of a literary genius, and it offers a glimpse into the depths of human emotion and experience. The book is a masterful exploration of the human condition, and it is a testament to McCarthy&#039;s ability to capture the complexities of the human experience in just a few well-chosen words. As I read &quot;The Passenger,&quot; I am struck by how timeless McCarthy&#039;s writing is. His words are as relevant and resonant today as they were when he first began writing. The themes he explores in this book - loss, regret, and the inevitability of death - are universal and eternal, and they will continue to speak to readers for generations to come. In many ways, &quot;The Passenger&quot; feels like a farewell. It is a final meditation on the human experience, and it is a reminder of the impermanence of life. As I read the book, I am filled with a sense of sadness and loss, knowing that this is likely the last time I will be able to experience McCarthy&#039;s unique and powerful voice. But at the same time, I am also filled with a sense of gratitude. I am grateful to have been able to read &quot;The Passenger,&quot; and to have been able to experience the incredible talent and wisdom of Cormac McCarthy. His words will continue to inspire and challenge readers long after he is gone, and his legacy as a literary genius will endure.</span>", "time": 1670377790, "resto": 21351735}, {"no": 21351846, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)21:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21351735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21351735</a><br>I won&#039;t be able to hold it in my hands until christmas.

According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of men who have read a book in the past year is only slightly lower than the percentage of women who have done so. Additionally, a study by the National Endowment for the Arts found that the gender gap in reading has been steadily decreasing over the past few decades. It is important to recognize that reading is a personal experience and not limited to any specific gender or sexuality. People from all walks of life and backgrounds can enjoy and benefit from reading. In fact, reading has been shown to improve cognitive function, reduce stress, and increase empathy and understanding. Additionally, the idea that only women and gay men read is harmful and reinforces stereotypes. It pigeonholes individuals into predetermined interests and ignores the diversity and individuality of each person. It is important to recognize that everyone has their own unique interests and hobbies, and reading should not be limited to any one group of people. Furthermore, the idea that reading is only enjoyable when shared with others is not necessarily true. While sharing experiences and discussing books with others can be a fulfilling and enriching experience, it is not a requirement for enjoyment. Many people find solace and fulfillment in their own personal reading experiences and do not need the validation of others to enjoy a book. In conclusion, the idea that only women and gay men read nowadays is a misconception and reinforces harmful stereotypes.

His work is heavily influenced by postmodern theory, and he is known for his critiques of consumer culture and modernity. While his writing may be difficult to understand or frustrating to some readers, his ideas and concepts have had a significant impact on fields such as sociology, cultural studies, and media theory. One of the reasons why Baudrillard&#039;s prose may be difficult to understand is his use of complex and abstract language. In his writing, Baudrillard often employs theoretical concepts and philosophical jargon to explore ideas about the nature of reality, representation, and power. This can make his work challenging for readers who are not familiar with the terminology and concepts used in postmodern theory. Additionally, Baudrillard&#039;s writing is often characterized by its dense and convoluted structure. Rather than presenting his ideas in a straightforward and linear manner, Baudrillard often employs a fragmented and non-linear narrative style, using digressions, paradoxes, and counter-intuitive arguments to challenge the reader&#039;s preconceived notions and assumptions. This can make his writing difficult to follow and can require multiple readings to fully appreciate the nuances and implications of his ideas. Despite these challenges, Baudrillard&#039;s writing can be rewarding for readers who are willing to invest the time and effort to engage with his ideas. His work offers a unique and provocative perspective on contemporary society, challenging conventional wisdom and offering new insights into the ways in which technology, media, and consumer culture shape our experience of the world. For example, in his book &quot;Simulacra and Simulation,&quot; Baudrillard argues that contemporary society is characterized by a proliferation of images and representations that have replaced the &quot;real&quot; world. He claims that we now live in a &quot;hyperreal&quot; world in which the distinction between reality and representation has been eroded, and where we are increasingly unable to discern what is genuine and authentic. This concept has been highly influential in fields such as media studies and cultural criticism, and has been applied to a wide range of phenomena, from the rise of fake news to the proliferation of social media &quot;influencers.&quot; In conclusion, while Baudrillard&#039;s writing may be difficult to understand and frustrating to some readers, it offers a unique and thought-provoking perspective on contemporary society. His ideas have had a significant impact on the way we think about technology, media, and culture, and his work continues to be relevant and influential today.</span>", "time": 1670374990, "resto": 21350660}], "last_modified": 1670374990}, {"no": 21345935, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)13:59:55", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Grimm&#039;s fairytales are stupid", "com": "They added entirely different, sadistic torturous endings that don&#039;t do anything to help the actual message get across.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He had Cinderella sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found that it went on very easily, fitting her as if it had been made of wax.

The fact that you have chosen to set the story in a small midwest state with multiple towns can be a great way to create a rich and diverse setting for your story. By focusing on a specific area, you can create a sense of place and give your characters a sense of belonging. This can also be a great way to explore the different ways that the war has affected each town and the people who live there. One potential challenge of setting your story in a small area with multiple towns is that it may limit the scope of your story. If your story is focused on a specific group of characters and their experiences, then setting it in a small area may not be a problem. However, if you want to tell a larger story that involves many different characters and events, then you may need to consider expanding the setting to include more locations. Overall, it&#039;s up to you to decide what works best for your story. If you feel that setting your story in a small midwest state with multiple towns is the right choice, then go for it! Just make sure to consider the potential challenges and how you can address them in your story.</span>", "time": 1670372961, "resto": 21349402}, {"no": 21351368, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)19:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21349402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21349402</a><br>Anything could be interesting if it&#039;s well written.

His ideas on reality seem similar to Platonic and Aristotelian theory, though much less coherent. The main sources of his philosophy can be found in his numerous unpublished notebooks, in one of which he wrote &quot;I am God&quot;.

A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. For example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man\u2019s freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn\u2019t want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man\u2019s freedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one\u2019s own pace; one\u2019s movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test,renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. Even the walker\u2019s freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it.)", "filename": "laughing_ted", "ext": ".png", "w": 735, "h": 492, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 167, "tim": 1670344020198654, "time": 1670344020, "md5": "/XvosadIRsa6Z1e1W/MT9Q==", "fsize": 319832, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "atg-antitech-literature-general", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 34, "images": 7, "omitted_posts": 29, "omitted_images": 5, "last_replies": [{"no": 21350969, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)17:47:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21349683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21349683</a><br>Has anyone here read any of Chad Haag&#039;s books?

She took definition as her province and challenged the existing definitions of poetry and the poet\u2019s work. Like writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman, she experimented with expression in order to free it from conventional restraints. Like writers such as Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she crafted a new type of persona for the first person. The speakers in Dickinson\u2019s poetry, like those in Bront\u00eb\u2019s and Browning\u2019s works, are sharp-sighted observers who see the inescapable limitations of their societies as well as their imagined and imaginable escapes. To make the abstract tangible, to define meaning without confining it, to inhabit a house that never became a prison, Dickinson created in her writing a distinctively elliptical language for expressing what was possible but not yet realized. Like the Concord Transcendentalists whose works she knew well, she saw poetry as a double-edged sword. While it liberated the individual, it as readily left him ungrounded. The literary marketplace, however, offered new ground for her work in the last decade of the 19th century. When the first volume of her poetry was published in 1890, four years after her death, it met with stunning success. Going through 11 editions in less than two years, the poems eventually extended far beyond their first household audiences.
