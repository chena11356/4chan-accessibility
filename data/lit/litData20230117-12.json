The physical world and the one are identical, and this is why philosophy has been divided between empiricism, which focuses on our perception of manifolds, and rationalism, which focuses on the inescapable deduction that all is one. Both are correct, when taken to their extreme, because empiricism will show you that pure experience by itself actually has no manifold at all and pure reason will show you that the One is identical to the absolute many.

If you&#039;ve actually read the fucking Timaeus you&#039;ll know that the only things that are exempt from this are immaterial, these are the gods and daimons who nevertheless are still forced to be in motion, albeit circular motion, which is capable of attaining quasi-eternal status, because all things in manifestation are forced to be in motion.<br>You don&#039;t know what pantheism is, what panentheism is, or what the ancients believed. You just don&#039;t. What is more, you make pronouncements on things that you do not understand. We could have a super long conversation on what the other great ancient traditions believed, but what&#039;d be the point? You are not informed on the matter, and would have to take me up on faith, which you won&#039;t do. Go read the Gita and see if that isn&#039;t panenetheism - it is. Same with Daoism - all things stem from the Dao, but the Dao itself is no thing in particular. Panentheism. As to Buddhism, it is a radical apophatic methodology for arriving in union with the transcendent - this is nirvana. Look around and you&#039;ll see some Buddhist sages say &quot;Nirvana is Samsara&quot;. But this is not the case for everyone - this is why enlightenment is necessary and useful in the first place. The transcendent and the immanent are united in a composite manner, but they are NOT one and the same - this is, once again, the panentheistic principle. For more on this perspective you can read up on Coomaraswamy.", "time": 1673885325, "resto": 21533054}, {"no": 21533843, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)11:16:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21533789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533789</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you can&#039;t say the same thing about particles.</span><br>I can say &quot;i don&#039;t know&quot; about them, because of the lack of information I can infer <br>naming this lack of mine and ,making a principle out of it, now that&#039;s intellectually dishonest as fuck<br>it&#039;s as if at the point when we hit barriers we invented terms to make sure we don&#039;t break them<br><a href=\"#p21533809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533809</a><br>his metaphysics is like his physics.

To chase after pleasures for 80 years and die a drooling retard in a hospice? You will die no matter what. If you live your life chasing after wealth and pleasure, you will lose everything regardless- you will even lose your death. What a meaningless death: bedridden, demented, and bespeckled with fetid sores and shit filled diapers. To the man that charges head first into death, he will gain exactly what he wished for: Death. His life and death becomes a poem crystallized into the annals of time; whether he is remembered or forgotten, his death remains eternal.<br>Mishima had a burning desire to help his people throw off the shackles of materialist nihilism, and he died to prove the sincerity of the words he had written and spoken his entire life.

It refers to loyalty. Suppose I make steaming rice balls with rice so hot it burns my hands. My sole purpose is to present them to His Majesty, to offer them in his sacred presence. Now as to the outcome. If his Majesty is not hungry, he will curtly refuse my offering or perhaps he may even be pleased to say: \u2018Am I to eat food so tasteless?\u2019 and hurl it into my face. In which case I will have to withdraw, the grains of rice still clinging to my face, and gratefully cut open my stomach at once. Then, again, if His Majesty is hungry and is pleased to eat the rice balls with satisfaction, there will still be no course of action open to me but to withdraw at once and gratefully cut open my stomach. Why? To make rice balls to serve as food for His Sacred Majesty with hands so common is a sin worthy to be punished with a thousand deaths. But, then, suppose I were to make rice balls as an offering but keep them in my hands and not present them, what would happen then? After a while the rice would certainly rot. This, too, would be an act of loyalty, I suppose, but I would call it a loyalty without courage. Courageous loyalty belongs to the man who, with no fear of death, dares to present the rice balls that he has thus made with single-minded devotion.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhile knowing he\u2019s sinning? Is that what he\u2019s to do?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYes, Your Highness. The gentlemen of the military, Your Highness foremost among them, are indeed fortunate. For the soldier\u2019s loyalty rests in casting away his life in obedience to the Emperor\u2019s commands. But in the case of an ordinary civilian, he must be prepared to sin by reason of his unsanctioned loyalty.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201c\u2018Obey the law\u2019\u2014isn\u2019t that a command of His Majesty? And the law courts\u2014 they are, after all, His Majesty\u2019s courts.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe sins I refer to have nothing to do with the law. And the greatest sin is that of a man who, finding himself in a world where the sacred light of His Majesty is obscured, nevertheless determines to go on living without doing anything about it. The only way to purge this grave sin is to make a fiery offering with one\u2019s own hands, even if that itself is a sin, to express one\u2019s loyalty in action, and then to commit seppuku immediately. With death, all is purified. But as long as a man goes on living, he can\u2019t move either right or left, or take any action whatever, without sinning.\u201d</span>", "filename": "mishima", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1800, "h": 2266, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673785791826623, "time": 1673785791, "md5": "5698dme4JBqypPEPu1Z68w==", "fsize": 649129, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21528720, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)07:30:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528634</a><br>I genuinely wonder how the Emperor must have felt when Mishima pulled his stunt.

He argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident (\u4e8c\u30fb\u4e8c\u516d\u4e8b\u4ef6, Ni-Ni-Roku Jiken) and the Japanese Special Attack Units (\u7279\u653b\u968a, Tokk\u014dtai) had died for their &quot;living god&quot; Emperor, and that Hirohito&#039;s renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain.

From the moment Mishima founded Tatenokai he was carefully preparing an idealistic and aesthetic suicide.<br><br>Runaway Horses is not a manifesto and while Isao is in many ways what Mishima thinks youth should be like there is clearly a lot of criticism towards the japanese conservatives he was the most aligned with. It is also abundantly clear that this image of a young man ready to lay down his life without out of sort of a instinctual and spiritual understanding of the true soul of Japan is an idealistic and carefully constructed ideal archetype that necessitates the reflection and maturity of an older intellectual. In a way Isao comitting to his glorious suicide after the political potency of the act is gone is the strongest reflection of Mishima himself in the book, glorious youth going out in a beautiful blaze never having known decay (of course Mishima wasnt nearly young enough to live up to his own ideal but he was young enough to avoid old age filled with nothing but decay (The Temple of Dawn and The Decay of The Angel expounds on this). Mishima himself did not embody this at all when he was Isaos age, he even all but admitted he took advantage of a misunderstanding at his health examination to escape service in ww2. If anything Isao is more of an image of Mishimas objects of admiration in Confessions of a Mask with the added shining laquer finish of his carefully perfected image of a true japanese hero than of Mishima himself.<br><br>Im curious how much Mishima youve actually read?

Adding to what you say is Makikos understudy being completely shattered by losing her son in the war to the point she completely ceases to be a person of her own and just lets Makiko control her like a marionette. Here we could also read that in defeat the cynicist prevails and assumes control while the simple people, idealists or not lose not only their way but their being as Japanese, the difference between the idealist and the non idealist simply being that one laments it while the other is largely unaware.<br><br>Another side of what you tackle in your analysis is that in Mishimas view old age is corruption and (especially in defeat) it is intolerable and almost unforgivable, even being in his forties felt at times intolerable to Mishima and if you want to put it (way too) simply but also somewhat succinctly both Sea (particularily Temple and Angel) and his Tatenokai era ending in suicide was a part of his (unusually complicated and idiosyncratic) midlife crisis.<br>The idealistic nationalist Mishima saw post war Japan as an emblem of defeat, surrender and extinction but the meticulous and reflected intellectual Mishima was completely aware of the deficiencies in the current nationalist milieu of post war Japan. I think these contradictions among other things lead to him taking the position of the emperors divinity as it marks a strongly old fashioned and uniquely japanese stance that marks him as an old school japanese nationalist that is hard to attack for a japanese nationalist without making concessions on how hardline they are while also being very hard to break down into an intellectual debate without getting abstract (there are many interviews where he discusses his views on policies and more tangible aspects of post war politics and its always very eccentric and almost mazelike.)", "time": 1673807473, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21529949, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:36:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529920</a><br>(cont.)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mishima too was wary of being idolized by Tatenokai members.</span><br>This leads us to yet another side of Mishimas contradiction filled idisyncratic being: Officially and maybe even to himself it is a safe haven for japanese youth sympathetic to the old ways and a way for him to interact with them as a mentor and guide without being their idol through having them operate as a militia with drill excercises, uniforms and even an anthem of their own.(a glorified fan club such as a debate club would pan out with Mishima as the deitylike centerpiece, a setup he even has a bit of fun with in his novella Act of Worship)<br>But at the same time Tatenokai is his perfect fever dream and most likely started with his suicide already sketched out meaning that he was looking for an acolyte to complete his seppuku all along. <br><br>He is often mocked for said acolytes failure to decapitate him but honestly that scene is the most Mishimasesque moment imaginable: Two acolytes, one fragile and emotional, one stoic and unwavering join him for his final act.

The life and death of this world about us took its<br>origin from the Ukei of the gods Izanagi and Izanami. Since men are the<br>offspring of the gods, however, if they preserve themselves from all<br>polluting transgression and, upright, just, and pure of heart, worship in the<br>ancient manner, they can put off the death and corruption of this world and<br>ascend to heaven to become one with the gods.<br>Master Oen was wont to recite this poem:<br>As the white swan soars to heaven,<br>Leave no traces here below.<br><br>This is the essence of Isaos beliefs. And according to this Isao is redeemed, whether Mishima personally considers it &quot;true&quot; or not is completely besides the point, Isao taking a stand and unflinchingly doing what he knows is right as a warrior of the spirit &quot;vindicates&quot; him in the sense that it puts him above everyone else in the nationalist clique and proves that he loyal to the true Japanese spirit until the end, in fact his final act is the only thing that could accomplish that as staying alive would be tantamount to accepting his fathers ways (or anyone else involved with the patriots for that matter). With all this in mind his heart being in the right place makes him a tragic hero, too pure to live on in shame. In this line of thinking Kurahara is still the most significant target as per his transgression against the spirit of Japan. All of this is more or less objective within the frame of the book, whether you &quot;agree&quot; with the ideals or aesthetics of it or not is irrelevant.<br>The final scene makes it clear that the poetry and beauty lies in the spirit of the act, not in the aesthetics of the location or the time of day.

There is no mention of his personal beliefs here. The reason it&#039;s not a triumphant ending is explained in the very next sentence: &quot;too far-removed from the poetry he envisioned.&quot; You assumed I was only referring to the tangible aspects of the suicide. This is indeed my fault, since I did focus on that in the previous post. I wanted to use the same term Isao does, but I should&#039;ve elaborated. <br>Isao&#039;s poetry is one of single-minded devotion to a god-like vision of the Emperor. The time and location of Isao&#039;s suicide are important, as they relate directly to his identification of the Emperor with the Sun (constant throughout the novel). In this sense, I think the fact that he commits his crime at night and dies in a cave is important symbolically: he&#039;s been forced to give up on the &quot;illusion&quot; he &quot;chased after&quot;. <br>This is a direct result of Isao&#039;s contact with corruption. The core of his poetry is the intent of his actions. Isao&#039;s devotion allows for &quot;sin&quot; (as he says in his conversation with Toin) and crime, because &quot;man cannot move right or left without sinning, anyway&quot; (in this sense, Isao doesn&#039;t consider himself pure at all). However, they must be motivated by dedication to the Emperor&#039;s Sun. As he explains to Toin, whether the Emperor himself takes his offering or not is irrelevant. No matter the result, he can commit seppuku gratefully: the offering could have never lived up to the Emperor&#039;s greatness, but it was whole-hearted. <br>The term &quot;quxotic&quot; is commonplace, so to say I borrowed the comparison from your post is somewhat conceited. Regardless, here I see the first parallel with Don Quixote. Isao&#039;s actions may seem outrageous to observers, but he&#039;s trying to conduct himself according to lofty ideals which demand absolute dedication, and which don&#039;t concern themselves with practicalities or the matter-of-fact workings of society (in his conversation with Sawa, Isao prides himself in not knowing how the Academy got funding). Naivety, in this sense, is seen as a proof of purity.", "time": 1673857575, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532754, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:01:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531659</a><br><a href=\"#p21532674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532674</a><br>The problem is that Don Quixote&#039;s actions do not, in fact, support the ideals he intends to defend. He constantly attacks innocents or otherwise puts them in danger. In the second part of the book, he starts to question himself, and dies after renouncing chivalrous literature.<br>Isao&#039;s case is similar. Throughout the novel, he doesn&#039;t conduct himself according to shinto: he twists shinto into agreeing with what he already intends to do. One example is that he decides the date for the attack personally, after receiving no sign from the gods in the ritual. More significantly, he discovers a conflict of interests: he has profited from Kurahara&#039;s money, and cannot murder him without going against his father. From this moment on, it is impossible for him to kill him in a pure manner. This is why he initially assigns someone else to do it, and why he gets angry at Sawa: he could not kill Kurahara while maintaining full dedication to the Emperor.<br>His mindset changes after being released from prison, though. If Isao had wanted to regain his dignity after being released from prison, he could&#039;ve committed seppuku immediately, like a samurai who&#039;s about to be captured in the battlefield. In this manner, he would have shown full dedication to his code of conduct, while avoiding to give an impure offering to the Emperor. However, he changes his initial plan and kills Kurahara personally. Considering everything that had happened before, this murder can not be taken as an impersonal and devoted offering to the emperor. Indeed, Kurahara is still, in his eyes, the embodiment of an illness in the Japanese spirit. However, Isao does not kill him to strike against this disease: it is a personal assassination, in which Isao directs his own feelings of anger and frustration against Iinuma, Makiko, and by extension the hypocrisy and cowardice of Japanese society, towards Kurahara. He emulates the League&#039;s actions but fails to carry with him any of the spiritual background. Hence, his seppuku does not redeem him, and the ending is not glorious.<br>This is not me personally disagreeing with Isao&#039;s philosophy: this is my interpretation of the events in the novel.", "time": 1673859699, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532824, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:30:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528828</a><br>Good post", "time": 1673861441, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532827, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:32:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528844</a><br>This is disturbingly true.", "time": 1673861573, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532837, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:38:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528912</a><br>Mishima transcended basedness", "time": 1673861938, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532843, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531224</a><br><a href=\"#p21530975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530975</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I assert that there is a difference between suicide and seppuku</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suicide and seppuku are different things</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u6b7b\u306c\u81ea\u6bba\u306e\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5</span>", "time": 1673862127, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532855, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:48:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528948</a><br>&lt;You deserves to be ridiculed.

Anyway, let&#039;s talk about an actually good writer: Ted Hughes!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I came to Lake Victoria, it was quite obvious to me that in some of the most important ways you are much more mature than I am. . . . But in many other ways obviously you are still childish \u2014 how could you not be, you alone among mankind? It\u2019s something people don\u2019t discuss, because it\u2019s something most people are aware of only as a general crisis of sense of inadequacy, or helpless dependence, or pointless loneliness, or a sense of not having a strong enough ego to meet and master inner storms that come from an unexpected angle. But not many people realise that it is, in fact, the suffering of the child inside them. Everybody tries to protect this vulnerable two three four five six seven eight year old inside, and to acquire skills and aptitudes for dealing with the situations that threaten to overwhelm it. So everybody develops a whole armour of secondary self, the artificially constructed being that deals with the outer world, and the crush of circumstances. And when we meet people this is what we usually meet. And if this is the only part of them we meet we\u2019re likely to get a rough time, and to end up making \u2018no contact\u2019. But when you develop a strong divining sense for the child behind that armour, and you make your dealings and negotiations only with that child, you find that everybody becomes, in a way, like your own child. It\u2019s an intangible thing. But they too sense when that is what you are appealing to, and they respond with an impulse of real life, you get a little flash of the essential person, which is the child. Usually, that child is a wretchedly isolated undeveloped little being. It\u2019s been protected by the efficient armour, it\u2019s never participated in life, it\u2019s never been exposed to living and to managing the person\u2019s affairs, it\u2019s never been given responsibility for taking the brunt. And it\u2019s never properly lived. That\u2019s how it is in almost everybody. And that little creature is sitting there, behind the armour, peering through the slits. And in its own self, it is still unprotected, incapable, inexperienced.</span><br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1673957965, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537518, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:20:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537514</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every single person is vulnerable to unexpected defeat in this inmost emotional self. At every moment, behind the most efficient seeming adult exterior, the whole world of the person\u2019s childhood is being carefully held like a glass of water bulging above the brim. And in fact, that child is the only real thing in them. It\u2019s their humanity, their real individuality, the one that can\u2019t understand why it was born and that knows it will have to die, in no matter how crowded a place, quite on its own. That\u2019s the carrier of all the living qualities. It\u2019s the centre of all the possible magic and revelation. What doesn\u2019t come out of that creature isn\u2019t worth having, or it\u2019s worth having only as a tool \u2014 for that creature to use and turn to account and make meaningful. So there it is. And the sense of itself, in that little being, at its core, is what it always was. But since that artificial secondary self took over the control of life around the age of eight, and relegated the real, vulnerable, supersensitive, suffering self back into its nursery, it has lacked training, this inner prisoner. And so, wherever life takes it by surprise, and suddenly the artificial self of adaptations proves inadequate, and fails to ward off the invasion of raw experience, that inner self is thrown into the front line \u2014 unprepared, with all its childhood terrors round its ears. And yet that\u2019s the moment it wants. That\u2019s where it comes alive \u2014 even if only to be overwhelmed and bewildered and hurt. And that\u2019s where it calls up its own resources \u2014 not artificial aids, picked up outside, but real inner resources, real biological ability to cope, and to turn to account, and to enjoy. That\u2019s the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when they\u2019re suffering, when something overwhelms their ordinary, careful armour, and the naked child is flung out onto the world. That\u2019s why the things that are worst to undergo are best to remember. But when that child gets buried away under their adaptive and protective shells\u2014he becomes one of the walking dead, a monster. So when you realise you\u2019ve gone a few weeks and haven\u2019t felt that awful struggle of your childish self \u2014 struggling to lift itself out of its inadequacy and incompetence \u2014 you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve gone some weeks without meeting new challenge, and without growing, and that you\u2019ve gone some weeks towards losing touch with yourself. The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn\u2019t live boldly enough, that they didn\u2019t invest enough heart, didn\u2019t love enough. Nothing else really counts at all.</span><br><br>(2/2)", "time": 1673958026, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537521, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:23:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537514</a><br><a href=\"#p21537518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537518</a><br>What % of people who know who he is only do so because of his connection to Plath?", "time": 1673958185, "resto": 21536926}, {"no": 21537531, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)07:27:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thinking about her poem Daddy, I find that women are usually better at writing deeply disturbing psychological stuff than men.

On the contrary, early Buddhism has acknowledged the possibility of an autonomous realization, exemplified first and foremost by its founder, the historical Bud-dha, who was the prince Siddartha. Considering the progressive materialization of humankind in the course of history, and the consequent development of physical individuality, later forms of Buddhism, especially in the Mahayana tradition, have reaffirmed the concept of initiation (diksha) as the usual way to achieve one&#039;s integration. Initiation, therefore, is defined as a real transmission of a shakti, and as a power and a guiding light. While Catholicism professes that the apostolic succession and the continuity of grace ensure the sacraments&#039; efficacy, in Hinduism there have been dy-nasties of spiritual teachers (gurus), who have uninterruptedly trans-mitted not only the tradition of their own schools but also the nonhuman power (shakti) that is required in order to expound and to activate that tradition. The image that this transmission evokes is that of a flame lighting another; spiritual organizations, called kulas within Tantrism, also follow the same principle. The power is often transmitted from the teacher to the novice through words of power (mantras), in which a shakti becomes intimately connected to a word, thus acquiring a vivifying and fertilizing quality; it propiti-ates a &quot;second birth.&quot;4 The nondualistic premise is reaffirmed, since this is a birth taking place within one&#039;s innermost being. Thus it has been suggested that &quot;those who embrace a person who is initiated into the supreme brahman are embracing themselves.&quot; And during the ritual, the great saying from the Upanishads is whispered: </span><br>&quot;Thou art that&quot; (tat tvam asi), and also: &quot;Think within thyself that I am He and He is I. Free from all attachments [nir-mana, literally, devoid of the sense of mineness] and sense of self, go as thou pleasest as moved thereto by thy nature.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the texts insist on the necessity of seeking the aid of a guru following this &quot;beginning,&quot; however, they may contain exag-gerations; some contingent circumstances may even play a role. </span><br>Considering, for instance, that there were no books containing certain teachings, and that some books were difficult to find, the guru was practically the only source available, even for the most exoteric elements of the learning process.6 Whatever may be found in various teachings that cannot be transmitted through ordinary language or written expositions should not be overlooked.", "time": 1673937407, "resto": 21529870}, {"no": 21536841, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:37:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536840</a><br>Cont.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The same goes for the coded and multivalent character of some texts, which involve a hierarchy of interpretative levels. This set of cir-cumstances, too, dictates the need for a spiritual teacher. Finally, we must consider the continuous relations between a teacher and the person being initiated, besides the transmission of a power, which is not just the guru&#039;s own Shakti but rather a super-individual shakti, connected to the initiatory circle to which the guru himself belongs. A positive factor in these relations is the assistance provided in the face of dangers and obstacles, which can be foreseen and rightly evaluated only by one who has already had a firsthand experience and who is thus endowed with a high degree of competence. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In any event, apart from the beginning, which may be consid-ered to be like the induction of the embryo of a supernatural power and light, spiritual development is the individual&#039;s responsibility. </span><br>After this power has been completely assimilated and actualized, the development must reach a point where the novice becomes utterly independent from the teacher. Figuratively speaking, it is said that at the peak of fulfillment (siddhi) the disciple &quot;has his own teacher under the feet,&quot; and that &quot;the kaula is guru unto himself and nobody is superior to him.&quot; No matter in what way it has been achieved, initiation has the general meaning of a consecration. Some texts suggest not only that initiation influences the efficacy of sadhana and of the &quot;acquired dignity,&quot; but also that, if initiation did not occur, sadhana and asceticism might assume an asura character, the term asura desig-nating a demonic, nondivine being (the Indo-Aryan equivalent of the Titans). <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As far as the technical instruments employed during sadhana are concerned, we may here recall the two main ones: the faculty to visualize precisely (&quot;to see through the inner light&quot;) and the faculty to focus one&#039;s mind through a training similar to that practiced in classical yoga.</span>", "time": 1673937469, "resto": 21529870}, {"no": 21536858, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)01:47:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536841</a><br><a href=\"#p21536840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536840</a><br>Tldr: Possible, but also dangerous, may assume a titanic/asuric character, you also require certain uncommon individual qualifications, <br><br>Anyway, my advice is get into hypnosis, &quot;new age &quot;energy work,&quot; but ignore all the malformed psychology of the unconscious and assimilate the energies into yourself conjured by the hyonotist with the variety of symbols they attempt to &quot;imprint&quot; upon the subconscious, <br><br>From the /trad/ point of view this is definitely &quot;black magic&quot; look into &quot;hands free orgasm&quot; hypnosis and erotic hypnosis, for the availability of these symbolic energies, and utilize them when the hypnotist suggests &quot;sleeping&quot; stay awake, and if you are adept enough the point where mental arousal transforms into an orgasm, you may be able to consciously subvert this energy and it will develop into the &quot;lightning&quot; of bliss, which you can integrate with voidness.", "time": 1673938039, "resto": 21529870}, {"no": 21537425, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)06:38:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536592</a><br>You more or less have it right, to be precise Evola&#039;s position is that reincarnation is true but that what reincarnates has nothing whatsoever to do with &quot;you&quot;.

Isn&#039;t this debasement, are they not defiling themselves and in turn the person i the future who might agree to take them in as a livelong partner? I don&#039;t understand, women are either uncapable of love in my eyes or for whatever reason they find joy in debasing themselves completely as some sort of sick form of self mutilation. Someone help me explain because i&#039;am going insane trying to figure out how i&#039;am supposed to muster up the respect and affection needed for love. I really do lack the cruelty of just being able to use women and be done with it but also have too much pride to settle for, what i would say is the average woman,so i have no other choice.", "filename": "1570012869536", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 1070, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673946914998773, "time": 1673946914, "md5": "fm69s0l3xGHSbpd6Y0vffw==", "fsize": 91750, "resto": 21537113}, {"no": 21537186, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)04:20:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why is it so difficult to find women that you can date and hang out with?

Honestly, I would venture to say &quot;No&quot;, insofar as we are concerned with the same type of love that men experience. It doesn&#039;t help that the constant blackpilling against women is extremely convincing and built on reasonable and rational, as well as historical grounds. When we look at the views of women from history, we can&#039;t help but see the same complaints about women then as we raise now. Women seem to be extremely superficial to a degree that is almost comical, yet we cannot ignore the simultaneous evidence that it is possible for women to experience &quot;idealistic&quot; love. Unless the men of antiquity were deluding themselves with massive copes, we can look to accounts of love such as that of Odysseus and Penelope, a woman that waited two decades for her husband faithfully, Romeo and Juliet, Aeneas and Dido, and so on. Even the Bible raises the possibility that virtuous women really do exist and really are capable of both enlightenment and love.<br>I would have to say that the reason for women&#039;s depravity today is a result of the depravity of the times. Feminists complain that women are being oppressed, and while they may be entirely wrong about the reasons, women indeed are being greatly oppressed by society. There has never been a point in history more tragically abusive towards women; and all of the areas in which a woman is led to believe she may alleviate these abuses are carefully constructed only to further that same abuse.<br>I believe women are cynical, jaded, and misled by society into living hedonistic and unfulfilling lives. They mistrust men, and indeed, abortion, birth control, fornication, and divorce increase the capabilities of men to serially exploit women. Women are, just as men, in a position where the only winning move is not to play. Their horrible decision making, shallow and dangerous short-term relationships, and other superficial behaviors may just be the optimal strategy for attaining some semblance of intimacy in a society that is designed from the ground up to put the malicious and evil at an advantage.<br><br>Or women could be shallow and entirely incapable of love.

What you&#039;re referring to as LLPSI, is in fact, Ranieri-LLPSI, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, Ranieri plus LLPSI. LLPSI is not a learning methodology unto itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning Ranieri system made useful by YouTube channels, audiobooks and graded readers comprising a full learning methodology as defined by Vivarium Novum.<br><br>Many language learners use a modified version of the Ranieri system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Ranieri which is widely used today is often called &quot;LLPSI&quot;, and many of its readers are not aware that it is basically the Ranieri system, developed by ScorpiusMartianus.<br><br>There really is an LLPSI, and these people are reading it, but it is just a part of the system they use. LLSPI is the textbook: the part of the system that teaches just enough Latin to make other media comprehensible.

One example I can think of: Cantos 21 &amp; 22 of Dante&#039;s Inferno. Except for this section, Dante is almost never what we would call funny (the closest he gets is a very wry, dry humour). But here he cuts loose with bizarre grim-slapstick comedy. D. &amp; Virgil come to this big river of boiling pitch. A load of corrupt officials are swimming in it, and a bunch of demons with pitchforks patrol the banks, jabbing them when they try to climb out. The demons all have wacky names (&quot;Snaggletooth&quot;, &quot;ChompyJaws&quot;, stuff like that) and they&#039;re partly scary and partly comically incompetent. (They fight each other and fall in the pitch and so on.) When they&#039;re given orders they all fart, instead of saluting, to acknowledge them.

This is a Chinese gay romance/danmei cultivation/xianxia written by a Chinese woman for Chinese women that has an official translation. I don&#039;t mind reading what I otherwise wouldn&#039;t from time to time, and that&#039;s certainly what this is. This is the first gay romance and first Asian cultivation novel that I&#039;ve finished.<br><br>This began as a serialized webnovel that after it ended it was revised and became a novel. As far as I know that isn&#039;t uncommon for webnovels that become novel series. Sometimes they&#039;re completely rewritten. I think that at least partially accounts for its quality of writing, the dialogue is especially horrendous, even after considering that it&#039;s been translated. I&#039;m unable to comment on the original work, so I can&#039;t say whether the !!!s, ???s, and various phrases in ALL CAPS are appropriate or not, as stylistic standards in originally self-published works are much looser. There are interspersed illustrations. This has adaptations in various types of media.<br><br>The protagonist is a mass murdering flute playing grandmaster of demonic cultivation/necromancer with a kill count in the several thousands at least. Also, he&#039;s already died before the story begins. Thirteen years later a teenage male homosexual sacrifices his soul to summon an evil spirit to slaughter his own family, and so the protagonist takes residence in his new body. The protagonist decides to jokingly go along with the homosexuality to antagonize and disgust everyone. Since he doesn&#039;t have any powers from his former body, he&#039;s rather useless overall. Not entirely so, but enough to where it doesn&#039;t matter much. Most of the book is him being escorted by the man in love with him and their previous school life together. The assumedly mid-30s man doesn&#039;t mind that the man he fell in love with is in a teenager&#039;s body that&#039;s roughly the same age as when they first met.<br><br>In this first volume in there isn&#039;t much romance. The most that they do by the end of this is arguably cuddling, if it can be called that, since it&#039;s arguably coerced. The protagonist carries on with the &quot;I&#039;ll do gay stuff to disgust him, oh no why isn&#039;t it working?&quot; act the entire volume. It&#039;s difficult to believe that he&#039;s this dense about what&#039;s going on, but it&#039;s a common trope, so it&#039;s probably exactly what&#039;s happening. I don&#039;t know if this eventually becomes a &quot;I&#039;m not gay, I only love you&quot; sort of thing, or something else, but clearly their relationship deepens in some way.<br><br>There wasn&#039;t much of anything for me to enjoy in this, which I suppose is to be expected. It didn&#039;t enrage me, make me regret my life decisions, or wail in anguish, so I can&#039;t it give it my lowest rating, not even rounded down.

It has brought home the conviction that the categories of understanding are finite in their range, and that any cognitive process confined within their pale falls short of the truth. But Kant had only a sight of half the truth. He explained the finite nature of the categories to mean that they were subjective only, valid only for our thought, from which the thing-in-itself was divided by an impassable gulf. In fact, however, it is not because they are subjective that the categories are finite: they are finite by their very nature, and it is on their own selves that it is requisite to exhibit their finitude. Kant however holds that what we think is false, because it is we who think it. A further deficiency in the system is that it gives only a historical description of thought, and a mere enumeration of the factors of consciousness. The enumeration is in the main correct: but not a word touches upon the necessity of what is thus empirically colligated. The observations made on the various stages of consciousness culminant in the summary statement that the content of all we are acquainted with is only an appearance. And as it is true at least that all finite thinking is concerned with appearances, so far the conclusion is justified.

But if this INTUITION BE QUALIFIED AS INTELLECTUAL, we must really mean intuition which thinks, unless, in a question about the nature of God, we are willing to interpret intellect to mean images and representations of imagination. The word faith or belief, in the dialect of this system, comes to be employed even with reference to common objects that are present to the senses. We believe, says Jacobi, that we have a body \u2014 we believe in the existence of the things of sense. But if we are speaking of faith in the True and Eternal, and saying that God is given and revealed to us in immediate knowledge or intuition, we are concerned not with the things of sense, but with OBJECTS SPECIAL TO OUR THINKING MIND, with truths of inherently universal significance. And when the individual \u2018I\u2019, or in other words personality, is under discussion \u2014 not the \u2018I\u2019 of experience, or a single private person \u2014 above all, when the personality of God is before us, we are speaking of personality unalloyed \u2014 of a personality in its own nature universal. Such personality is a thought, and falls within the province of thought only. More than this. Pure and simple intuition is completely the same as pure and simple thought. Intuition and belief, in the first instance, denote the definite conceptions we attach to these words in our ordinary employment of them: and to this extent they differ from thought in certain points which nearly every one can understand. But here they are taken in a higher sense, and must be interpreted to mean a belief in God, or AN INTELLECTUAL INTUITION OF GOD; in short, we must put aside all that especially distinguishes thought on the one side from belief and intuition on the other. How belief and intuition, when transferred to these higher regions, differ from thought, it is impossible for any one to say.</span>", "filename": "georg-wilhelm-friedrich-hegel-fbd235d7-9320-4516-af36-f9a5b941afd-resize-750", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 750, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673920096382765, "time": 1673920096, "md5": "ptAi/l4ZQu9cm1Aco6Z/eg==", "fsize": 65642, "resto": 21530179}, {"no": 21535928, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:06:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21530179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530179</a><br>What the fuck is German Idealism.", "time": 1673921215, "resto": 21530179}, {"no": 21535937, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21530397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530397</a><br>\u201cSpace\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d are in themselves thoughts or ideas, and hence in a mysterious way, thoughts, or ideas, are themselves the very basis of or ground on which space and time exist.", "time": 1673921320, "resto": 21530179}, {"no": 21535951, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:11:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21535928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21535928</a><br>Go back", "time": 1673921513, "resto": 21530179}, {"no": 21535972, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:18:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21533025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533025</a><br>Well, it&#039;s obvious you don&#039;t understand either Kant or Hegel then, even with your quotes. <br><br>Hegel is saying noumena are a false and mistaken worldview.

Under these circumstances examination is directed to the field of experience, to a psychological phenomenon. If that be so, we need only note, as the commonest of experiences, that truths which we well know to be results of complicated and highly mediated trains of thought present themselves immediately and without effort to the mind of any man who is familiar with the subject. The mathematician, like everyone who has mastered a particular science, meets any problem with ready-made solutions which presuppose most complicated analyses: and every educated man has a number of general views and maxims which he can muster without trouble, but which can only have sprung from frequent reflection and long experience. The facility we attain in any sort of knowledge, art, or technical expertness, consists in having the particular knowledge or kind of action present to our mind in any case that occurs, even, we may say, immediate in our very limbs, in an outgoing activity. In all these instances, immediacy of knowledge is so far from excluding mediation, that the two things are linked together \u2014 immediate knowledge being actually the product and result of mediated knowledge.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is no less obvious that immediate existence is bound up with its mediation. The seed and the parents are immediate and initial existences in respect of the offspring which they generate. But the seed and the parents, though they exist and are therefore immediate, are yet in their turn generated; and the child, without prejudice to the mediation of its existence, is immediate, because it is. The fact that I am in Berlin, my immediate presence here, is mediated by my having made the journey hither.</span>", "time": 1673923905, "resto": 21530179}, {"no": 21536155, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)22:09:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536085</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One thing may be observed with reference to the immediate knowledge of God, of legal and ethical principles (including under the head of immediate knowledge what is otherwise termed Instinct, Implanted or INNATE IDEAS, Common Sense, Natural Reason, or whatever form, in short, we give to the original spontaneity). It is a matter of general experience that education or development is required to bring out into consciousness what IS THEREIN CONTAINED. It was so even with the PLATONIC REMINISCENCE; and the Christian rite of baptism, although a sacrament, involves the additional obligation of a Christian upbringing. In short, religion and morals, however much they may be faith or immediate knowledge, are still on every side conditioned by the mediating process which is termed development, education, training.</span><br><br>Hegel literally telling you faggots the reason you cope and seethe after getting filtered is because you need to read more instead of buying books, watching booktube videos, lurking on /lit/, jerkin it to porn.

Yet, it always appears to me, in the telling of the story elements of worth or value seep through (I can&#039;t remember any for the Karamazov patriarch though). They are adults, and for the most part set, their subtle heroic changes retain most of their character, just altered perhaps in one direction to another.

There is so much potential and life in them, so much room for growth and blossoming. It almost sits side by side the tragedy and the hope.

Consumerism and liberal-democracy were at their apex and growing their strength by the moment. Rampant materialism was pandemic, covering all four corners of the globe for the first time. The youth, even when radical and national, were communistically and materialistically inclined. All traditional organisations were in full collapse and counter-traditions like Theosophy were at their peak. Contact with authentic traditional centres around the world was rare, expensive, and arduous - Evola had access only to a small fragment of the traditional texts and exponents that we have today. It was a different time, and Evola&#039;s considerations in that passage, in addition to his pessimism, were correct when he wrote them.<br>Now things are different. There&#039;s plenty of traditional material and connections one can follow. The question once again boils down to this: do you have the character for this? The answer is as in Evola&#039;s time - the vast majority, as a matter of fact, do not. Do you want to have that character? Then work at it, and indeed, &quot;strengthen your character&quot;. <br>Evola described the highest spiritual ideal, and people who set their sights on it should have the honesty to admit its infinite difficulties and the courage to tackle these difficulties anyway, with the full intention of total victory - if they really have set their eyes on this highest ideal.<br>If you have conviction and desires, then have confidence also, and fight.

There is a book by Dennis King but I haven&#039;t read it and he called them anti-Semites because their bugbear is the Anglo-Zionists, which I don&#039;t think is accurate (since a lot of them, especially back then, were Jews albeit of the self-hating type). <br><br>I do suspect that their ideology might be consistent as a vehicle for masking themselves in different movements like outsourced COINTELPRO after that was shut down (which is why it emerged when it did). They also have a zombie-like appearance if you ever run into them, which in the U.S. is typically outside post offices; that sudden switch into intense aggression is apparently something they do too, as cults do. I don&#039;t know if Haz is a member but he&#039;s definitely an associate and speaks at their events and there are others clearly showrunning it from behind the scenes.<br><br>Part of the ideology is a focus on producerism: maximize production and re-industrialize things (not socialize it though). The appeal of that is obvious but this leads them in quirky directions like loathing renewables and thinking more carbon in the atmosphere = good while being very pro-China (because production) even though China invests more in renewables than the E.U. does, and they&#039;ll tend to dissemble if pressed on this. They also really love Trump and Russia (they were anti-Soviet). Also they want a patriotic (and authoritarian) movement to re-industrialize America, and the British figure highly in this imaginary as the enemy, as if the U.S. had never thrown off the British or hadn&#039;t clipped them at Suez.<br><br>I think this can happen when a particular interpretation Marxism doesn&#039;t go according to the &quot;plan.&quot; The U.S. deindustrialized so the solution is to turn the whole clock back and make it a do-over with another revolution against the British. That is, rearrange reality to better fit the &quot;theory&quot; in that &quot;idealist&quot; way (also see the Trot-to-neocon pipeline where the spread of bourgeois democratic revolutions by the empire is gonna make socialism happen sooner). Also they&#039;re a bonafide cult so it&#039;s like hanging out with Scientologists.

Our mind cannot contain an infinity under the empirical view. As it came up in another thread tonight, take a collection of objects- to keep it simple, 3 oranges.

Again we might say, yes the three-ness is just a way our mind categorizes and makes sense of reality. Okay, but if all our minds were gone, if we were all killed, that three-ness wouldn\u2019t go away. This is where the \u201cmind of God\u201d comes into play.

Pulling on the cord, dragging it to the floor with a crash. Still, it turned on. The old wood floor was intact. The sable curtains were closed over the windows.

Any commentary is fine. <br><br>Main Character:<br><br>Solitary smuggler and mercenary. Wears cutting edge alien biotech armored suit. Driven by desire to do his duty in the form of jobs he takes based on risk/reward. Lives entirely off oddjobs and cultivating a reputation deliberately. Reserved, contemplative, tactical. Thinks a lot and his suit joins him in on that. Backstory and apperance beyond being a HUman who is old/young enough to be doing this is completely unneeded. He does not talk about his past before he got the suit, if so rarely. <br><br>Sidekick Character: <br>Tapped into main characters spine, they have no privacy between eachother. Gendered female because...well. It just makes sense. Fiery, stubborn, and petty. Keeps our protagonist alive in more ways that one. The suit is a life support system and our protagonist ain&#039;t doing good in that department. Sadomaschoistic. Comes with being a weapon of war and being battered by it. Intended as the foil character. <br><br>Initial Story Objective:<br>Transport flash frozen corpses to be eaten by carrion birds on another planet as an alien culture of migrant workers on a planet need this done to have their dead pass onto the afterlife. They are offering a large bounty to do this and supply of quality rations. Inspired by the issues contemporary Zorasterians have in India. They have no vultures to eat their dead due to pesticides killing them. <br><br>Initial Story Conflict:<br>Space pirates jumped our protagonist while travelling to gain the corpses to be eaten by decadent alien crimelords, as a novelty. He must outwit them and get the cargo to the migrant worker homeplanet so the birds can eat the dead correctly then return said bones. <br><br>Initial Setting:<br>Space opera, adventure. Pulpy, different galaxy uses whatever science isn&#039;t annoying to the story but isn&#039;t completely unbelievable. Humans arrived via space anaomly and made a colony. Considered a secondary power. Cold war between larger hegemonic species. Some slug snakes and toad wasps. <br><br>Initial Scene: <br>Debating whether to begin in an argument between the suit and its pilot or a very humble business meeting arranged the deal with said migrant worker aliens.", "time": 1673893174, "resto": 21530805}, {"no": 21534245, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)13:20:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21534177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21534177</a><br>I will add onto this. <br><br>Big cans is smart.

It&#039;s a game with an easy ability to work itself up despite being solved at the highest levels. <br><br>Now let&#039;s go with video games. Okay. They have a lot more fiddly bits and issues.

Less is more for a reason. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9<wbr>LJ-oMosg<br>Pro C&amp;C Generals Zero Hour. <br><br>The USA Air Force is favored massively because the meta for the USA is to use Humvees with fully loaded missile launcher guys in them with their upgrades which outclass tanks in damage. Air Force doesn&#039;t get tanks. They get better versions of the Chinook which transports guys and collects resources (and can combat shoot), attack helicopters who can get stealth which prevents them from dying as quick, and the best jet in the game. Also amazing support powers which can&#039;t be beat and they detect stealth from air. <br><br>The GLA Demolitions is not favored. They can plant bombs and blow things up more. They lose access to residual toxin damage, vehicles cost more, and lack the ability to be as stealthy. They are a downgrade to their base faction. The way they win is simply by microing explosives units way better. More damage by a lot, but they lack many things. The GLA&#039;s meta spam is using AA bearing Quad Cannons that can kill anything in enough number for good cost ratio. They also destroy aircraft which is the GLA hard counter and prevent infantry spam better than anthrax does. <br><br>Watch it and think on this, if you&#039;re going to write simulation combat.

Young authors are often too worried about getting things moving on the rails, and not worried enough about what\u2019s on either side of the tracks.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A sense of place distinguishes a piece of writing. It may be a distillation of different places. There must be a very good reason for not describing place.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meteorology is not superfluous to the story. Don\u2019t have an aversion to noticing the weather.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s very difficult, not to say impossible, to get physical movement right when writing. The important thing is that it should work for the reader, even if it is not accurate. You can use ellipsis, abbreviate a sequence of actions; you needn\u2019t laboriously describe each one.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You sometimes need to magnify something, describe it amply in a roundabout way. And in the process you discover something.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Significant detail\u2019 enlivens otherwise mundane situations. You need acute, merciless observation.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oddities are interesting.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Characters need details that will anchor themselves in your mind.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A tight structural form opens possibilities. Take a pattern, an established model or sub-genre, and write to it. In writing, limitation gives freedom.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every sentence taken by itself should mean something.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Writing should not create the impression that the writer is trying to be \u2018poetic\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s easy to write rhythmical prose. It carries you along. After a while it gets tedious.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Avoid sentences that serve only to set up later sentences.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don\u2019t revise too much or it turns into patchwork.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lots of things resolve themselves just by being in the drawer a while.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By all means be experimental, but let the reader be part of the experiment.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fiction should have a ghostlike presence in it somewhere, something omniscient.

He had brought his entire company with him, all sixteen of them. More boys than soldiers, most of them - younger than his own sons. <br>The others were all huddled around their campfires, some staring blankly into the fires, entranced by its dance to the beat of the crackling wood. Van stared at his own. He had watched far too many flames dance over the years - they ceased to speak to him long ago, all they did was just remind him of the hearth in his home where he would be with his wife and sons, watching instead - his granddaughter struggle to walk, while sipping on some sweet pumpkin stew. Damn the glory and honour of a soldier\u2019s life, he thought, as he held his hands nearer to the fire, feeling the pulses of heat lash at his palm and fingers. His ears ached against the frost. He cupped his hands around his ears to warm them. He sighed, letting out a thick vapour that quickly got fed into the flame. <br><br>\u201cDo you think the witch knows we\u2019re out here?\u201d Van heard Sims speak, almost a whisper.

Despite having seen him the most over the years, Van knew him the least. The campfires had a way of making men talkative, at least the ones not yet awakened to the meaninglessness of sentiments against the abyss, and Roskil was always the quietest one around the fires. Van had known likes of him before this company, men who had faced the abyss one too many times. Van had once respected their bravery in continuing to pick up their swords until one day he came to pity them once he realised that it was never bravery, but numbness. <br>\u201cShe\u2019s probably going through her recipes for white boys,\u201d snickered Orbel, the company joker. <br>\u201cWait, witches eat folks?\u201d asked Sims, his face ashen. <br>Orbel angled his head so that half of his face became shrouded under cover of darkness. <br>\u201cWhy do you think they never recovered the bodies of the last squad that paid her a visit?\u201d pressed Orbel, in a convincingly morose tone. <br>\u201cStop,\u201d Van intervened. <br>Orbel winked at Van then gave Sims a rough shake at his shoulders, grinning.

Under these circumstances examination is directed to the field of experience, to a psychological phenomenon. If that be so, we need only note, as the commonest of experiences, that truths which we well know to be results of complicated and highly mediated trains of thought present themselves immediately and without effort to the mind of any man who is familiar with the subject. The mathematician, like everyone who has mastered a particular science, meets any problem with ready-made solutions which presuppose most complicated analyses: and every educated man has a number of general views and maxims which he can muster without trouble, but which can only have sprung from frequent reflection and long experience. The facility we attain in any sort of knowledge, art, or technical expertness, consists in having the particular knowledge or kind of action present to our mind in any case that occurs, even, we may say, immediate in our very limbs, in an outgoing activity.

And yet it is as clear as noon-day that of course Vernunft (Reason) comes from. vernehmen (to comprehend), but only because Reason makes man superior to animals, so that he not only hears, but also comprehends (vernimmt)\u2014by no means,what is going on in Cloud-cuckoo-town\u2014but what is said, as by one reasonable person to another, the words spoken being comprehended (vernommen) by the listener; and this capacity is called Reason (Vernunft). </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uch is the interpretation that all peoples, ages, and languages have put on the word Reason. It has always been understood to mean the possession of general, abstract, non-intuitive ideas, named concepts, which are denoted and fixed by means of words. This faculty alone it is which in reality gives to men their advantage over animals. For these abstract ideas, or concepts, that is, mental impressions formed of the sum of many separate things, are the condition of language and through it of actual thought; through which again they determine the consciousness not only of the present (which animals also have), but of the past and the future as such; whence it results that they are the modulus, so to say, of clear recollection, of circumspection, of foresight, and of intention; the constant factor in the evolution of systematic co-operation, of the state, of trades, arts, sciences, religions, and philosophies, in short, of everything that so sharply distinguishes human from animal life.

As to criticizing your poetry, I&#039;m not in any position, though I can at the very least praise it. The emotion you capture in 165, it is the pressure of the family, the history of horror we all seem to bear, the mundane trust that next time we will be able to figure it out, that if we&#039;re careful we won&#039;t be cut again, the bleakness of backyard plans lay fallow, while relying on the pacifying beauty of nature. your clear resilience in our brief conversation is evident in 165, you have chosen to survive, to take what you can from life and love it, and to let the rough parts build calluses and you&#039;ve committed to love them too, somehow. there is no shortage of the beauty of emotion in you, and whatever function of form you miss are made up for in an extended hand that touches the heart.

They are constantly competing with other organizations. Vying for resources and influence. Despite their shortcomings, they are sturdy and very hard to kill. JFK threatened to destroy the CIA, and look where that got him. Their ability to escape accountability is what makes them so formidable. They are institutions that never sleep and every person and part within it&#039;s structure is replaceable. (In the first book of Dune this is exemplified in The Emperor being able to destroy a leading Landsraad house. Liet-Kynes (Herbert&#039;s self insert character), the Judge of the Change knows that resisting the coverup is futile). <br><br>Ideologies with the greatest effect are the ones that appeal to the sensibilities of dreamers, realists, intellectuals, and sheeple. They are not like a bureaucracy or leader. Bureaucracies have quarterly reports, budget restraints, minions to pay. Leaders expire/retire/sellout. However, ideologies are in a sense eternal. They are merely ideas. They promise an ideal of the future. Trying to appeal to so many people makes it hard to accurately map to reality. They can be preserved in a book, innovated on, and spread across populations through word of mouth. But without a thought leader, can become ensconced in dogma and preyed upon by opportunists. (Superstition and Dogma are the Bene Gesserit bread and butter for leveraging power amongst the unassuming masses. All one needs to do is appeal to their expectations to leverage power).

The 1940s was one of those times where the world stood on the precipice of having one of these figures. Frank Herbert even likens Paul to mustache man.

Similarly the novelist who deals with \u201cbefore now\u201d must pay some attention, respectful or not, to history. He is faced with a spectrum. History lies at one end \u2014 infra-red perhaps \u2014 and what is thought of as fiction occupies the opposite end \u2014 the ultra-violet. If he fails to employ his utmost accuracy in terms of the succession of commonly known events \u2014 Declaration of Independence, Battle of Waterloo et cetera \u2014 he does violate some kind of civilized expectation. He must admit to writing history with the same good humour as a historian shows when admitting that he writes fiction. It is a question of degree. The novelist, more allied than the historian to rogues and vagabonds, gets away with what he can. Generally he will find research such a bore! If you have a story to tell why not go straight on and rely on what accumulated in your head? After all, the reader will pick up your book in hopeful anticipation. He will be very willing to suspend that celebrated disbelief and be on your side. Of course there is a limit. At the play he will accept Sartre\u2019s picture of Kean and the Prince Regent roystering together because the piece is a comedy. But who, having an average knowledge of European history, has ever felt easy at Schiller\u2019s scene between Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots? We all know they never met and our principal awareness as we watch or read is that tragedy is not being deepened, but history trivialized.

Perscors knelt down near the man and placed his hand on his brow. The giant closed his eyes, but said to Perscors : \u201cWhoareyou?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cAwanderer from another cosmos.

I scribble what I found important for the day without much proof-reading. I don&#039;t know what Plotinus has to say about that, but I will try to argue the opposite of what you&#039;re saying from his position. <br>From the schema I&#039;ve come to understand so far, all idea is thought good, and matter evil (&quot;Essential Fire is good, but things burning can be bad&quot;). So if a person fully masters the Intellective-Principle, there is no room for evil. If a person is doing evil, it&#039;s because part of them is in Non-Being, or thoughtless Matter, which has nothing to do with their thoughts or intentions, since those are part of the Good.<br>A child who steals money from Aristotle thinking it&#039;s ok should be dealt with in a moral way where the behavior doesn&#039;t continue. We don&#039;t attribute agency to him since he doesn&#039;t know better, but he still might be chastised or punished. Plotinus seems to extend that rule to everyone, that in sum total, people who do evil always just don&#039;t know any better. <br><br>There is still responsibility Plotinus seems to assign everyone of trying to possess the Good, but punishment of an evil may instead be treated as whatever brings the evil to zero, or what balances it, prevents it&#039;s reoccurrence, or increases the thought associated with it and which necessarily will result in the opposite good.<br><br>A lot of early Christian scholarship equates evil as merely the lack/privation of goodness. I don&#039;t remember who. Plotinus seems to have this but with a source for evil, &quot;Absolute Evil&quot;, which has at least less reality than the Good, since he calls it a substratum/hypostasis for evil. Matter is evil, and translated as &quot;Non-Being&quot;, so unless there&#039;s some difficulty with the linguistic traditions or if everyone had an altered state of consciousness then vs. now, I don&#039;t comprehend why evilness can have a quality and act as a substratum while also being nothingness.

Trauma victims get resources, so it sparks the swarm&#039;s interest. It screws over people with actual need for the resources in some ways, but that won&#039;t stop the general push for them. <br>It&#039;s also the reason why PTSD gets assigned more and more often to people whom the diagnosis wasn&#039;t designed for: originally the diagnosis related to Vietnam vets returning from the war, who wanted to differentiate their problems from war trauma, because PTSD was about fighting in a war which you came home to find out was illegal and immoral and your government and chain of command had lied to you about it being a just war. It began being taken over by the nascent women&#039;s movement who felt they had been traumatized and lied to and to a similar extent as three presidents running a cover up and instigating a draft that killed and maimed thousands on both sides.<br>In an almost hilarious turn, this wasn&#039;t enough. cPTSD or complex PTSD was originally created for Holocaust victims. It combines both symptoms of PTSD and BPD, where a loss of sense of self and a repeated and inescapable trauma could be created without abusive parents. BPD is more commonly diagnosed in women, and seen as pejorative because it escaped into the mainstream and people began to use it casually to explain women who acted dramatically and theatrically disordered because they fear being alone. Because of that perceived prejudice, cPTSD is suggested as an alternative, because it focused on an external series of traumas which could be something other than &quot;acts shitty because shitty childhood coping skills&quot; and moee like &quot;it&#039;s an outside force that is responsible for my shitty actions and you should feel sorry for me and not try to contain my shitty actions until you kill all the nazis in the world&quot;. Most people with the diagnosis now are not after spending a year in prison or anything comparable to a slavery or extermination camp- they want the resources that you would give to such a person though, especially the sympathy and grace you might give them for abnormal reactions. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;Dr women think marathon man is about them.</span>", "time": 1673877262, "resto": 21531661}, {"no": 21533437, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)08:55:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21533398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533398</a><br>Duckduckgo admitted that they delist and censor too.

TM does that by having you focus on your mantra repetition, which resets the vagus nerve and ends the fight or flight response.

It was nice. I made the whole thing from scratch. It was very simple but sharp looking, without any of the bloat, no JS, only CSS. I would post the week&#039;s sketches I had made and a few thoughts if I had anything interesting to say. Posts were a couple paragraphs. I even had it mirrored on Gemini just because. It was cozy to maintain it, in a way that only small scale internet can feel.<br>I still have the whole thing saved on the computer and today I was cleaning up and I looked at it and I still love how it looked, and the posts I made, and of course I thought, man, why did I take it down. The reason for that is that, of course, nobody would look at it, so I was doing a lot of work for pretty much nothing. I received a single comment in all the time I had it up. I did not have much contact with other people on Neocities. I had one chat with someone in an IRC channel and I quickly understood that we had a horribly different idea of everything, so I left.<br>In the end I understand why, I mean who am I. I&#039;m not entitled to attention etc. especially on a website that isn&#039;t far reaching like twitter or some other thing. I could have done the same shit on Twitter or Tumblr or another site like that and I would have actually had more &quot;engagement&quot;, whatever that means, but I chose to make my own custom website and nobody would follow it. I am aware of things enough to not feel disappointed, but I&#039;ve got this little sadness in me. In the end anything you do is going to just be lost in a gigantic ocean, and there&#039;s no deluding yourself that you&#039;re really anything but that.<br>I started my first relationship back in the 2000s when I read a girl&#039;s blog on a livejournal style site and we started talking and we eventually told each other we were in love and we met. We stayed together about a year and a half. This stuff can&#039;t really happen anymore. It could happen back then because there were maybe 3000 people on a website like that.<br>It&#039;s like it&#039;s mandatory to be an exhibitionist or generally desperate to grab everyone&#039;s attention to have any of it. I never felt like this on the internet. There were so few people online yet it was so easy to just hit someone up and talk, or make friends, or be part of a group, or generally have a few eyes on what you were making. I don&#039;t seem to understand how to cope with this. I don&#039;t want to scream and be loud. I understand people who start off a profile by listing their special genders and mental illnesses because that&#039;s objectively a surefire way to send a very loud signal as quickly as possible. I just wish it weren&#039;t a requirement to be extremely loud. I know that things are what they are and if you&#039;re stuck in a crowd where everyone&#039;s screaming for attention you cannot get away with being quiet and unassuming.

So in<br>&#039;My Confession Recollections of a Rogue&#039; by Samuel Chamberlain, which is where much of the historical basis for Blood Meridian comes from, Chamberlain states that the judge has large hands and rapes and kills kids. McCarthy explicitly states that the judge has tiny hands in BM. He also says that the kid had large hands. I think he made those distinctions for a reason. At the end the kid fucks or tries to fuck a dwarf. You can read that as him liking children. When the kid walks into the jakes and the judge locks the door behind him, what I believe is that the kid gives into his dark side in there. I think they rape and murder the missing bear girl together. I believe the guy pissing outside of the jakes who warns the other man not to enter is the kid. He seems to know what went on inside and seems unfazed. Whatever happened in there was horrific to elicit the &quot;Good god almighty&quot; from the other man. We are talking about the most wicked city in Texas where murder was normal. I think he saw something truly horrible like a raped and murdered child. In the end the kid essentially became the judge. That&#039;s my theory.", "time": 1673856112, "resto": 21530811}, {"no": 21532666, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21532583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532583</a><br>I just read the book and I&#039;m certain the Gnostic theory is just a bunch of nonsense.", "time": 1673857327, "resto": 21530811}, {"no": 21533978, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)12:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21532635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532635</a><br>I never noticed the size of the hands in connection with chamberlain\u2019s book but overall seems like a stretch, the judge clearly has a thing for kids (giving out candy, scalping the little Indian, obsession with The Kid) compared to the scant evidence for the kid\u2019s dark side.

The answer to this seems clearly to be yes. We joke by questioning children with, if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around does it make a sound? This is essentially the same question applied to a non-material thing (logic). Some (nominalists) will argue that the laws of logic will cease to exist, as they are constructed/contained in the mind. Well, we then run into the problem of things like pi or the Mandelbrot sets. These are \u201cinfinites\u201d that cannot be contained in our minds. Yes, we can simplify them to contain them to the best of our ability, but their \u2018real\u2019 or actual existence cannot be contained in the mind. This suggests that our mind is not the determinate factor for metaphysics. These things cannot depend upon our minds to exist because we cannot fully conceive of them in our minds to begin with. Yet, they exist. This should lead us to God, as we know that non-material concepts, by definition, are not contained in the atoms or the strings or the lowest common physical denominator. Get 3 apples on a table and the quality of their \u201cthree-ness\u201d is not contained in any of the physical properties. Remove our minds and the quality of three-ness still exists in the universe.

Are your intentions to pluck little truths from untruths within my arguments, in an effort to chalk up a perceived victory in online debate? Or do you ask this because you wish to understand my point of view better?<br>I&#039;d find the latter a much more interesting partner of discourse than the former.<br><br>I already explained my reasoning: a lot of well educated people believe wildly different things with such conviction, that &quot;objective truth&quot; must not be as relevant (is that a better word for it?) as &quot;subjective applicability&quot;. If something seems right to someone, he believes it. I do not believe there is a &quot;great truth&quot; waiting to be discovered by man, that one &quot;true&quot; philosophy will eventually reach. I believe there is the world &quot;as it is&quot;, and people talking about it - having their own ideas, theories, analyses about it. Particularly smart people make particularly elaborate ideas, theories and analyses about the world - philosophies. But these, man-made, philosophies, objective as they seem, are in the end no less subjective than a child licking honey and saying &quot;I like this, it tastes good&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, which one or ones are not?</span><br>One rather objective topic is simply &quot;existence&quot;. There is something. Man came about and put this something into categories, so that he can mentally interact with that something, but these categories are subjective ideas that do not actually correlate to the something that exists. Matter arranged in the form of a chair is not actually a chair, since &quot;chair&quot; is a man-made, subjective, idea that we use to talk about the matter arranged in the form of a chair. But there is something that exists. The chair-arranged matter is objectively existing, but it is subjective that it is supposed to be a chair.<br>From here on, it is hard to pin down topics as objective. I think it is easier to find topics that are &quot;objective within given parameters&quot;. Measurement of temperature, for example, is &quot;objective given the parameters of temperature measurement&quot;. If we agree upon the concept of Celsius, and measure the room to be 20\u00b0C, that is the objective temperature of the room (even though the concept of Celsius is a subjective man-made idea).<br>If a ball crosses a goal line, it is &quot;objectively a goal given the subjective-but-agreed-upon parameters of the rules of football&quot;. But objectively it is not a goal because objectively there is no such thing as a goal, only &quot;something&quot; that someone calls a goal.<br>Science gives the idea of getting close to an objective description of the world, but only insofar that we divorce ourselves from the idea that the words used by a scientists are anything but usefull tools that make it easier for us to describe the &quot;something&quot; that exists. &quot;Man evolved from ape.&quot; is just a shorthand for &quot;something ape-shaped did something to rearrange into something man-shaped&quot; - and that still is just a very brief shorthand.", "time": 1673867092, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533085, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)06:15:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21533048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21533048</a><br>You could have simply written, \u201cI\u2019m a nominalist.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that deep.", "time": 1673867755, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533331, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)08:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531623</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only BASEDENCE is worth thinking pursuing!!!</span><br>You deserve to be ridiculed", "time": 1673874908, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533705, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)10:35:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529241</a><br>Mounier argued that Camus was describing the quintessential Catholic experience of Man&#039;s faith, including in his rejection of God.", "time": 1673883322, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21533740, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)10:47:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529188</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ow do I contradict this man</span><br>You don&#039;t, you agree with him because he provided the proper view of the Absurd and the tools to defeat it.

Would that infant still go on to develop autism?</span><br>Well as you or some other anon already pointed out, people in tribal societies never seem to get autism. But to answer your question, I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;. I believe some people have a predisposition to autism (so in that sense you could say it&#039;s compounding in the predisposition+environment look), however what seems to happen (based on the apparent etiology of autism) is that if certain developments don&#039;t occur in a young child&#039;s brain in the first few years of life, boom, they have autism forever.

Almost four and a half years after he was accused of murder, he is currently still in the Union County Jail, held on $3 million bail. Currently, he\u2019s locked down 23 hours a day in segregation. To top it off, there may be some extenuating circumstances regarding why he is being denied the \u201cspeedy trial\u201d guaranteed by the Constitution in the Sixth Amendment</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kai the Hitchhiker gained some major viral fame after he managed to save the lives of a utility worker and female bystander when a man he was hitching a ride with went off the rails. The man admitted to raping a young girl in the Virgin Islands, then told Kai he believed he was Jesus Christ and could do anything he wanted. At this point, he rammed into a man, pinning him to a truck and began chasing after a woman on the street. Kai took him out by smashing him with the handle of a hatchet he carries for protection. After appearing on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show and being featured by Stephen Colbert and others, he became something of an online celebrity, so it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary that someone might recognize him and invite him to hang out.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://philfairbanks.com/2020/12/<wbr>13/massive-miscarriage-justice-kai-<wbr>hitchhiker/</span>", "filename": "68688063_166592926160473_r", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3750, "h": 2118, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 141, "tim": 1673923720894402, "time": 1673923720, "md5": "KdLOKRYb0RMo6SEcZjUYew==", "fsize": 1248630, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "have-you-reserved-your-authorsigned-copy-yet", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}, {"no": 21536078, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:50:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536071</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That\u2019s what Kai assumed was the case when he was picked up by lawyer Joseph Galfy in New York\u2019s Times Square. Galfy offered him a ride to his house and Kai agreed. Kai alleges that Galfy drugged and raped him. From the time Kai was apprehended in Philadelphia and extradited to New Jersey, Kai has been faced with what basically amounts to a kangaroo court \u2013 issues being withheld, conflicts of interest, the brother of the deceased being allowed in the house during an active investigation. If you read Gardner and Suter\u2019s reports, you\u2019d see that in Gardner\u2019s report, it\u2019s noted that the dishwasher had been run between May 13 and 15. The report was written on the 15th and photos were being taken around that time. Why would you run a dishwasher in a house where an ongoing investigation into murder and rape is going on?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the Union County Sheriff\u2019s Office, reports at one point during the active investigation noted the dishwasher was run with glasses and mugs found in it. In Edward Suter\u2019s Union County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigative report, it shows they rinsed the beer bottles with fresh water. The beer bottles, glasses, and mugs should have been examined in toxicology reports. Instead, rinsed with fresh water? This is especially disturbing considering the fact that Kai had already reported that he believed he had been drugged and raped. Also left out of the prosecutor\u2019s case to the grand jury is the fact that the two eyewitnesses said Kai appeared glassy-eyed, drugged, and sporting fresh wounds.</span>", "time": 1673923813, "resto": 21536071}, {"no": 21536084, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)21:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536078</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The prosecutor makes multiple claims that conflict with the official accounts as laid out in the autopsy, forensic reports, and Officers Adrian Gardner and Edward Suter\u2019s UCSO investigative reports. For one, he notes that a rape kit was run on Galfy and came back negative. On Galfy? Of course, the rape kit run on the alleged rapist came back clear. In a proper investigation, the \u201cunidentified blood\u201d found on Galfy\u2019s genitals would have been tested to see if it belonged to the alleged rape victim. In fact, within the UCSO reports, it is made clear that signs of a sexual assault were present at the scene.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At one point, the prosecutor introduces an \u201cexpert doctor,\u201d Robert Pandina. Pandina refused to run a rape kit, and his claims about date rape drugs can be quickly disproved by anyone with a basic understanding of pharmacological agents. When Kai complained to the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners, they explained that Pandina was not a certified doctor in the state of New Jersey, and as a result, not under their jurisdiction. By the way, passing off someone as a doctor is a felony charge in New Jersey.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not offering proper services and processing for a victim of sexual assault is also a crime in New Jersey. The prosecutor broke several laws, for one, undermining the New Jersey Attorney General Standards for providing services to victims of sexual assault (NJSA 45:9-18) by pretending Robert Pandina was a medical doctor capable of examining a survivor of sexual assault. In pages 91-93 of the grand jury testimony, the prosecutor commits fraud by passing Robert Pandina off as not only a doctor but an \u201cexpert doctor\u201d at that.</span>", "time": 1673923892, "resto": 21536071}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21535342, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)18:07:57", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Catho/lit/", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Shorter Summa The Essential Philosophical Passages of Saint Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica - Peter J.
