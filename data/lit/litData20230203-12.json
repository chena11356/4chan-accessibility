Life has no savour for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendent. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of serving as an oppression.

[...] To punish warriors who, against overwhelming odds, fought for their country with a courage and determination that excited the wonder of the world, and deliberately to kill them because they were not cowards and traitors, because they did not betray their nation -- that was an act of vileness of which we long believed our race incapable. And to augment the infamy of our act, we stigmatized them as &quot;War Criminals&quot; which they most certainly were not, for if that phrase has meaning, it applies to traitors who knowingly involve their nations in a war contrived to inflict loss, suffering, and death on their own people, who are thus made to fight for their own effective defeat -- traitors such as Churchill, Roosevelt, and their white accomplices.&quot;</span><br>--Prof. Revilo P.

He vehemently rejected Wagner&#039;s concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk because of the challenge it presents to the traditional understanding of the poetic. The difference is shown in their interpretations of Sophocles. For Heidegger Sophocles is the poet, specifically of the choral sections, for Wagner it is Sophocles the dramatist, whose nature as an artist is governed by the actions of characters. Heidegger also hated classical music in general because, inverting Wagner&#039;s analysis, he thought it was an ontologically meaningless emotional satiation created by the bourgeois in reaction to the meaninglessness of their lives. In his view, a healthy peasant has no need for it. I don&#039;t think he disliked Wagner&#039;s dramas or music specifically. This all comes from his Nietzsche lectures. If you want more on where he situates Wagner&#039;s ideas, read those.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What Hegel asserted concerning art-that it had lost its power to be the definite fashioner and preserver of the absolute-Nietzsche recognized to be the case with the &quot;highest values,&quot; religion, morality, and philosophy: the lack of creative force and cohesion in grounding man&#039;s historical existence upon beings as a whole. Whereas for Hegel it was art-in contrast to religion, morality, and philosophy-that fell victim to nihilism and became a thing of the past, something nonactual, for Nietzsche art is to be pursued as the countermovement. In spite of Nietzsche&#039;s essential departure from Wagner, we see in this an outgrowth of the Wagnerian will to the &quot;collective artwork.&quot; Whereas for Hegel art as a thing of the past became an object of the highest speculative knowledge, so that Hegel&#039;s aesthetics assumed the shape of a metaphysics of spirit, Nietzsche&#039;s meditation on art becomes a &quot;physiology of art.&quot;</span>", "time": 1675425124, "resto": 21605682}, {"no": 21608440, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)06:55:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607958</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just don&#039;t see why /lit/ keeps sucking his dick.</span><br>You know why anon.

Like, did humans come from earth? why don&#039;t we have roots like trees then? is the earth and everything in space floating? then it means it came into existence by a force that didn&#039;t touch them, but spawned them into existence. No matter how you look at it, it always ends in a supernatural explanation, things had to once stick together and then be separated in order for it to not be supernatural, but obviously this wasn&#039;t the case. If there was no supernatural, creating things from thin air explanation, then everything would have had to have a physical parent from which they&#039;d have to have their roots cut off.

This is a clique of New York-oriented writers and critics who control much of the literary scene through the influence of the quarterlies and intellectual magazines. All these publications are Jewish-dominated and this particular coterie employs them to make or break writers by advancing or withholding attention. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any conscious, sinister conspiracy on their part\u2014just a determination to see that members of their particular clique rise to the top. Bernard Malamud and Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and Isaac Bashevis Singer and Norman Mailer are all fine writers, but they\u2019re not the only writers in the country, as the Jewish literary Mafia would have us believe. I could give you a list of excellent writers, such as John Knowles and Vance Bourjaily and James Purdy and Donald Windham and Reynolds Price and James Leo Herlihy and Calder Willingham and John Hawkes and William Goyen; the odds are you haven\u2019t heard of most of them, for the simple reason that the Jewish Mafia has systematically frozen them out of the literary scene. Now, mind you, I\u2019m not against any particular group adhering to its own literary values and advancing its own favored authors; such cliques have always existed in American letters. I only object when any one particular group\u2014and it could just as well be Southern, or Roman Catholic, or Marxist, or vegetarian\u2014gets a strangle hold on American criticism and squeezes out anybody who doesn\u2019t conform to its own standards. It\u2019s fine to write about specifically Jewish problems, and it often makes valid and exciting literature\u2014but the people who have other messages to convey, other styles and other backgrounds should also be given a chance. Today, because of the predominance of the Jewish Mafia, they\u2019re not being given that opportunity.

It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateley&#039;s upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog&#039;s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.</span><br>That&#039;s pretty, uh, vivid, don&#039;t ya think kids?", "time": 1675412610, "resto": 21607870}, {"no": 21607996, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:49:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607932</a><br>Well, he still wrote &#039;On the Creation of Niggers&#039; if that helps", "time": 1675414175, "resto": 21607870}, {"no": 21608026, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:02:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lovecraft gave absolute kino introductions to his letters, they could make great story-prompts:<br><br>Pulse-Beat of the Cosmic Fungus enveloping Yaddith, I<br>n the AEtherless Gulf of Re-entrant Angeles <br>beyond the 5th Trans-Imaginational Ring of Finite Continua.<br><br>Temple of Azathoth,<br>That which gibbers mindlessly in Darkness at the<br>Centre of Ultimate Chaos.<br>Hour of the Thin Piping of the Daemon Flutes, in the<br>year of N&#039; gah.<br><br>Ninth Vacuum of Negative Matter, in the Black<br>Nebula of Yl&#039; glhuh, beyond the Third Cluster<br>of Space-Time Continua<br><br>Shrine of Nng, in The Temple of Infra.<br>Red Vapour on The Doomed Nebula<br>Zlykariob, in the Hour of the Torturing of The Worm Bgnghaa-Ythu-Yaddit<br><br>In the Infra-Dimensional Abyss outside<br>Time &amp; Space, whence springs upward<br>the Singing Flame of the Unknown City<br><br>Crypt of H&#039;hphn-Yys-Echrr on the<br>extra-cosmic comet Phphun,Hour of Approach to the Black Sun<br>Gnarr-Kthun in the 7th Dimension<br>beyond the Uttermost Rim<br><br>Viscous Vortex of S\u2019llhaa, beyond the Rim.<br>Hour of the Shaping of the Nucleus<br><br>In the orange, carmine, &amp; blue-litten zone at the<br>end of the Angles . . . beyond the vague<br>twilight abysses.<br>Hour of the sounding of the gong at the bottom of the unplumbed pit.<br><br>Leaden hillside of Pnapf on the green-litten<br>planet Hchab in Dimension N<br>H our of the voice &amp; vapour from the bottomless cleft<br><br>From the 66th Vortex of the<br>new Space-Time Abyss,Hour of the faint scratching<br><br>Field of the Ultra-Spectral RaysHour of the Spiral Wind from Nith<br><br>Primal Basalt Bridge over the<br>black and oily River Gner.<br>Time of the Bulbous Shape&#039;s<br>passage up-stream.<br><br>Crest of Unknown Kadath in the Cold Waste,<br>Whence is seen the Insufferable Perspective.<br>Hour of the Monstrous Looming from the<br>Unplaceable Direction.<br><br>Tower of the Broken Angle on the Night-Side of Yuggoth: <br>Hour of the Triple Signal from the Other Dimension<br><br>Twisting-Hour of the Seven-Dimensional Force Units in the Reverse-Angled Continuum <br>Beyond the Universes of Matter, Black Light, &amp; Asymmetrical Etheric Polarity.<br><br>7th Ultra-Violet Plenilune, <br>98463mnth Year of the Crumbling of Yaddith&#039;s Citadel <br>After the Coming of the Ciscous and Unspeaking Ones<br><br>Vortex of Slth-Kgnr on the Liquid Planet Nrun in the Central Galaxy of the Sixth Dimension <br>Beyond the City of the Singing Flame. <br>Moment of the Up-Surge to Meet the Rising of the Black Satellite<br><br>Slope of Forgotten Gna-Haggosh in the Great White South: <br>Day of the Reopening of the Gate from Dimension \u221a\u00b5\u03b3", "filename": "1azathoth", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 450, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675414938402429, "time": 1675414938, "md5": "juBZXFCVR5oVtlV77SsyXA==", "fsize": 48131, "resto": 21607870}, {"no": 21608051, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)04:13:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21608026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21608026</a><br>Yeah his letters are great.

The north is the symbol of the physical because of its relation to ice (crystallized water) and to the body (crystallized spirit). In man the light shines toward the north but never from it, because the body has no light of its own but shines with the reflected glory of the divine life-particles concealed within physical substance. For this reason the moon is accepted as the symbol of man&#039;s physical nature. CHiram is the mysterious fiery, airy water which must be raised through the three grand centers symbolized by the ladder with three rungs and the sunburst flowers mentioned in the description of the Hindu painting. It must also pass upward by means of the ladder of seven rungs-the seven plexuses proximate to the spine. The nine segments of the sacrum and coccyx are pierced by ten foramina, through which pass the roots of the Tree of Life. Nine is the sacred number of man, and in the symbolism of the sacrum and coccyx a great mystery is concealed. That part of the body from the kidneys downward was termed by the early Qabbalists the Land of Egypt into which the children of Israel were taken during the captivity. Out of Egypt, Moses (the illuminated mind, as his name implies) led the tribes of Israel (the twelve faculties) by raising the brazen serpent in the wilderness upon the symbol of the Tau cross. Not only CHiram but the god-men of nearly every pagan Mystery ritual are personifications of the Spirit Fire in the human spinal cord.</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/st<wbr>a/sta18.htm", "filename": "restorednewtesta00pry_0031", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 325, "h": 507, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675396538859919, "time": 1675396538, "md5": "1X6o8627UoZymhMloKMqJg==", "fsize": 43156, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607424, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:05:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;<br><br>You have to believe on Jesus and then you will have the indwelling of the holy spirit to guide and teach you.<br><br>bannedpreaching.com/videos/BIBLEWAY<wbr>TOHEAVEN.mp4", "time": 1675397155, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607450, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607424</a><br>fuck off protestant smoothbrain, this thread is not for you", "time": 1675398010, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607476, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here&#039;s the esoteric meaning of the Behemoth and Leviathan<br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg43.htm<br>Info on Moses<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MOSES AN INITIATE</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg45.htm", "time": 1675398771, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607521, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:51:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>Esoteric meaning just means you&#039;re coming up with your own thing.

The other ones you seem to be misinterpreting a bit because that&#039;s not quite technically what it said. Samson didn&#039;t literally gain strength simply from keeping his nazarite vows, after all there were other people who were also nazarites; rather it was God that did it. It was all done for a specific reason to show us some things, and there are many teachings that find their application here. The term dragon is used in the Bible interchangeably with serpent, so that&#039;s nothing out of the ordinary. And unicorns are the same as rhinocerous, according to the 1611 footnotes they even specifically told us that. Lastly, the &quot;serpent&quot; entity didn&#039;t become a full-on snake until after it was cursed. It may have looked like something else before the fall. But we also have a talking donkey in another place, so yes there are very unusual things that have happened, but they all did for a reason. Hope that helps anon. Something can literally happen and at the same time have important lessons for us in them.

Like the number 40 keeps popping up. <br><br> <s>Moses stays on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights. Before his temptation, Jesus fasted &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; in the Judean desert. Forty days was the period from the resurrection of Jesus to the ascension of Jesus. According to Stephen, Moses&#039; life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people. In modern Christian practice, Lent consists of the 40 days preceding Easter. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count, there are 46 days in total of Lent; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included. The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Kirk Kilisse, &quot;Forty Churches&quot; in Eastern Thrace. Rain fell for &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; during the deluge.</s> <br><br>And then there are all those bizarre parallels between classical Paganism and Christianity.<br><br><s>The virgin Persephone&#039;s son, who was conceived by her father Zeus, was Dionysus. Dionysus is the god of bread and wine, Jesus is the transformer of water into wine and the multiplier of loaves of bread, and his primary rite involves the consecration of bread and wine which are said to transmute into the literal presence of the Lord, like in the Eleusian mysteries where the stalk of grain was to represent the literal presence of Persephone. Jesus was the son of the Virgin Mary, just as Dionysus was the son of the virgin Persephone, and in both cases the father God of heaven conceived in the virgin to give birth to a god of bread and wine. In the Greek instance, it&#039;s the maiden mother who descended into the underworld; in the Christian, it&#039;s her son the culture hero. In the Greek, the mother is resurrected as the staple wheat crop; in the Christian, the son is resurrected as the physical bread of life.

Today, the metaphysical ground of politics extends to states themselves - but instead of the traces of this founding ground being labeled as criminality (individuals who still don&#039;t submit to the sovereign), it&#039;s labeled as fascist (states that do not align in the new global system). The political spectrum is a spectrum of alignment, and a form of smooth space. The reality outside this alignment exerts pressure on this spectrum appearing to come from the &#039;right&#039; because it is based in a deeper, telluric order that the spectrum must smooth order with its own order. The order represented by the spectrum itself is like a &#039;swastika,&#039; because although it is always changing, and therefore &#039;leftist,&#039; it just preserves the pure formalism of modern politics itself. &#039;Leftism&#039; is the dominant ideology because it is the ideology of change. But it&#039;s not actual change, just the idea of it. The real change is what&#039;s inadvertently &#039;changing the Overton window&#039; of the political spectrum, but this can&#039;t be represented on it. It is manifested as the figure of the partisan, who cannot be categorized or labeled, &#039;coming from bellow the depths&#039; to wage guerilla war on modern politics itself. Polarities are what &#039;animate&#039; and &#039;charge&#039; politics in a certain direction.

The crazy idea is that politics is being driven by something that only exists &#039;in the future.&#039; Its similar to the logic of &#039;Communist Manifesto&#039; or Landian Skynet theory fiction. In this idea, sovereign states are a subject of a &#039;higher force,&#039; the specific resolution of modern political contradiction in the form of a determinate civilization state that unites order with change - which globalist political ideologies claim is &#039;Nazism.&#039; But they only claim that because Nazism is the founding sin of globalism itself, they can&#039;t imagine any determinate civilization state, only an abstract notion of Fascism/Nazism, which is actually a case of total projection.", "filename": "Screenshot_2023-02-03-00-40-08-068-edit_com.discord", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1086, "tn_w": 248, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675381259553172, "time": 1675381259, "md5": "w0K7FcgCZf+yUBq89xq2Rw==", "fsize": 359849, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "haz-from-infrared-just-dropped-some-gems", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 24, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 22}, {"no": 21606644, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)18:43:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The civilization state resolves &#039;left and right&#039; while being &#039;Left-Wing&#039; in its objective orientation (being revolutionary in requiring the overthrow of the status quo) while *appearing* right wing because it comes from a deep, telluric place of &#039;order.&#039; Civilization states, like Hegels universal state, unite the particular with the universal - destroying the &#039;political spectrum&#039; and instead grounding politics in the objective and material reality of the people, rather than in some abstract formalism.

This initially took the relatively mild form of a deconstructive postmodernism and poststructuralism, which, in the work of thinkers like Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and Jacques Derrida, cast aside all grand historical narratives while embracing a philosophical antihumanism emanating principally from Heidegger. In contrast, today\u2019s new philosophies of immanence\u2014associated with posthumanism, vitalistic new materialism, actor-network theory, and object-oriented ontology\u2014constitute a deeper irrationalism, represented by such putatively left figures as Gilles Deleuze, F\u00e9lix Guattari, Bruno Latour, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton. These thinkers draw directly upon an irrationalist, antimodernist intellectual lineage going back to the reactionary antimodernism of Nietzsche, Bergson, and Heidegger. Lacanian-Hegelian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has ultimately taken sides with the antihumanist tradition stemming from left-Heideggerianism, generating in his work a carnival of irrationalism. All of these various tendencies are coupled with skepticism, nihilism, and a pessimistic, end-of-the-world outlook.</span><br><br>Is he right, bros?

The relationship between a father and son is a very complicated affair that has no overlap with the relationship between a man and a woman. Your deliberate conflating of the two is below both of us.<br><br>At the beginning of their relationship the father is by far the senior and authoritative position but as the son ages and gains experience he will, or at least should, eclipse the father in terms of experience and ability. Thus it starts and ends as unequal relationship. First in favoring the father and as time progresses the needle shifts in favor of the son. So yes, a son should naturally submit to the authority of his father but constantly rebel within the framework of a growing up and finding the boundaries and a father should enforce gradually expanding boundaries. The father should then step back and allow his son the rightful position as the head of the family when the time comes.<br><br>Failure to do this results in <a href=\"#p21602833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602833</a>", "filename": "32", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 274, "h": 184, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675300935627262, "time": 1675300935, "md5": "klqo1i+JnBl3NN4MA4eYTg==", "fsize": 6220, "resto": 21602807}, {"no": 21602979, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:23:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I will once again attempt to diminish my internet/technology use down to the bare minimum.

If one interest becomes too domineering, too powerful over and against other powers, the others check it in some way in order to ensure some degree of balance and equanimity. You might then think of individual ambition/competition as not necessarily opposed to equality, but as in fact the very means of ensuring equality.

When I was at one, they would let me stay in my room for a while, but afterwards they decided that I needed to &quot;socialize&quot; and would lock me out. This was always a source of major psychological distress for me. It would usually result in me doing something &quot;psychotic&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, or &quot;impulsive&quot;, with the intention that they would let me back into my room. This would usually work for a time, but they (MHPs) believe that the best thing for &quot;mental health&quot; is socialization so I would inevitably be forced back to mingling with the &quot;population.&quot;<br>Unfortunately I have a problem with &quot;personas.&quot; Whenever I&#039;m in an unavoidable social situation I will sort of &quot;grow&quot; a personality out of an interaction and act highly sociable, friendly, and usually humorous. It causes intense fucking distress, and at every moment I&#039;m making stupid jokes and laughing I am filled with exhaustion and desire to withdraw. The worst thing is that this sort of effect is unknown to psychiatrists and they assume that socialization is &quot;working really well.&quot; This makes things worse when I want to really tell a psychiatrist or psychologist something about myself, because they will look at my &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;sociable&quot; behavior outside of my room and assume when I&#039;m saying things like &quot;I really want to die&quot; that I&#039;m looking for attention.

I get what you&#039;re trying to say here but there&#039;s no possible way Christ didn&#039;t know people would misinterpret His words. In fact in John chapter 6 a lot of people left Jesus after He made some statements that they misinterpreted and got offended by. I don&#039;t think that was accidental, rather, the people who are not fit for God - or perhaps just not ready yet - will hear what they want to hear and miss what God is really saying in these passages. That&#039;s why Jesus often says, let him who has ears hear. The implication is that there are going to be people who misunderstand, these being the proverbial people who do not have ears, as opposed to those that do have an ear to hear.<br><br>Christ also said in John chapter 10:<br><br>&quot;But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.<br>4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.&quot;<br>(John 10:2-4)<br><br>So basically, those who are His will hear. Those who are not will not grasp the meaning of the parables or the teachings, and the miracles done before their eyes won&#039;t even convince them. Like it says in John chapter 12:<br><br>&quot;But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<br>38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br>39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,<br>40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.&quot;<br>(John 12:37-40)<br><br>So you see, if people would just take Jesus at His word, they would be able to understand. The problem is many people are blinded and always inject their own false meaning into everything. That&#039;s why they misinterpret things like Matthew 16:18, and many other things besides, reading what&#039;s not actually there. Anyone that truly has ears to hear can understand regardless. I can prove it, since Jesus said so all of those times, and I know that God never does anything in vain or for no reason. Those whom God has blinded and hardened (for good reason, as typical of God who is infinitely good) are unable to see, hear, or be converted. It&#039;s no surprise you&#039;ve got people running around saying all kinds of ridiculous things about the Bible then, or living their lives in complete opposite of what it says. That situation is purposeful by God due to God&#039;s infinite wisdom.

But already in the Mediterranean mysteries there were hierophants and assistants present to \u201csupport\u201d the initiate\u2019s consciousness at the moment when the ground vanished from under his feet.

This work is long, demanding unbroken constancy and control and a gradual illumination; yet it is a work that anyone can do for himself, for the most part, given that for a long time he will not encounter obscure zones where it is uncertain whether or not his feet will find firm ground. Another important characteristic of this method is that due to its strong basis, once contact is achieved, the forms of higher consciousness can be made to act permanently within waking consciousness\u2014they are not limited to separate experiences, nor in principle do they require abnormal states of the human being. Every other method, in contrast, brings the danger of reducing the whole experience to fleeting glimpses unable to provide mastery, and whose effect on many people is probably little different from that of certain drugs.</span>", "time": 1675396067, "resto": 21605132}, {"no": 21607416, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:02:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607395</a><br>Is the second half describing the wet way?", "time": 1675396942, "resto": 21605132}, {"no": 21607419, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:03:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605132</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are phenomena such as a command issued in an extranormal way to a distant person, in which it makes no sense to speak of suggestion, as the metapsychologists do. In this and other phenomena the structure of a procedure of the magical type is clear to see: an image at the center; then a force that galvanizes and saturates it in a continuous process, to the point of crossing the borderline between the I and the not-I, between psychic and physical (or between one person and another) and translating it into a corresponding real event, in which the operators\u2019 active force, aware, perfectly rhythmical and harmonized, reaches its conclusion. There is a clear difference here from certain \u201cpsychic\u201d phenomena of the spontaneous sort. We recall that the medium Eusapia Palladino, when she was young, even without entering a state of trance would form a certain desire or image in her mind, and sometimes the matching phenomenon would inexplicably follow.

In the East, these tendencies had a limited development or were absorbed and framed by forms of the more ancient spirit, whereas in the West they found fertile ground, and gradually went on to construct what we may call the modern European spirit. In this way modern man now sees and perceives in an utterly different mode from ancient man, without even wanting to do so. We are dealing, in fact, with a condition based on his occult constitution: a new consciousness fixed in the higher seat is opposed to a consciousness that mainly belonged to the \u201cmedian man.\u201d The latter consciousness was still open or half-open to receive communications, points of non-difference, contacts; hence the fringes of a psychic perception, taking the form of \u201creflections\u201d unburdened by the yoke of cerebral control, together with a special sensation of the body and its functions that was simultaneously physical and \u201csubtle.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These are the implicit presuppositions of most Eastern techniques. The fluctuation that has recently arisen between the state of the higher seat and that of the median seat tends to be resolved by Eastern initiation in favor of the latter. It can speak of the \u201cI\u201d as a shell to be broken, because it has a barely veiled sensation of the true \u201cI,\u201d which it is ridiculous to call \u201cmine\u201d: the supramental Self that is the true center and light. Thus, there is less danger that by \u201copening up,\u201d one might dissolve and lose oneself. It is also significant that in the Eastern texts it is very rare to find references to what Western mystics called the \u201cdark night of the soul\u201d and the Hermetists the \u201cblack work.\u201d It is as though for that human type, this change of state, essential to every form of initiation, does not assume the character of a profound crisis.</span><br>Essentially the essay argues that &quot;modern man&quot; is too concentrated in the &quot;higher seat&quot; the field of a very logical, discursive positivistic thought which has the objective physical reality as its object. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have described what usually happens to a normal man of today if this descent occurs while the quintessence is lacking: he either falls into the \u201cmystical\u201d forms of the confused visionary, or upon attaining the \u201clight of nature\u201d the personality is not sustained; it loosens and disintegrates, and he falls into a state of passive, ecstatic contemplation.</span>", "time": 1675399105, "resto": 21605132}, {"no": 21607500, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:43:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607485</a><br>Essentially lacking the support of the pther two centers, the median and the lower, when the &quot;modern westerner&quot; shuts off his concentrated higher centre, it is more or less likely for him to enter a sort of &quot;sleep&quot; mediumistic state, that of visionaries, all because of the importance associated with &quot;individuality&quot; modernly, the essay gives advice about the quintessence, and the development of the other three centers, which is necessary, and also yeah that a &quot;lower to higher&quot; method of initiation is maybe better, so yeah &quot;wet&quot; indeed.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With reference to the theory of the occult \u201ccenters\u201d of the body, some are of the opinion that the Western method differs from the Eastern in that the latter awakens the lower centers before the higher ones, whereas the former takes the opposite course. This is quite erroneous. In either case it is first a matter of descending; then one exits from the base; then re-ascends (compare the theory of septenaries in Introduction to Magic, vol. II, 28). The real difference, as stated above, is whether consciousness of the higher or the median seat is taken as the principle and basis of the whole process. Given that the structurally \u201cnon-modern\u201d man naturally gravitated more or less toward the latter, to which the subtle state corresponds, it is possible that practices for the direct awakening of the basal energy of the lower seat (the Hindu kundalini, the ancient Egyptian uraeus) would yield a result for him. This becomes very difficult for the majority of modern Westerners, who must first traverse the median seat. The same applies to the practices with breathing. Abraxa, in the instructions for sexual magic (Introduction to Magic, vol. II, 335\u201347), has rightly said that it is impossible to \u201ctouch\u201d the energy of which the reproductive is only a low-grade manifestation, unless one is already able to attain a form of active ecstasy and to maintain it. Compare also the methods of Taoist alchemy (Introduction to Magic, vol. II, 379\u201394).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus, on this path, even in experiences of a higher order, the initiate will always have the power of fixing the volatile. As was said, in the se contacts, far from losing himself in ecstatic identifications, he will have the power to penetrate and energize the forces with which he unites himself. In a word, it is a \u201cmagical\u201d contact, in which the initiate has a decisively masculine role.</span><br>It makes some good points all together", "time": 1675399435, "resto": 21605132}, {"no": 21607509, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:46:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605279</a><br>Probably both are possible or even the same thing seen from different angles but are extremely, extremely rare.

His view of the world is shallow even if ingeniously elaborated. Depth of thought finds its material within ourselves; sagacity has to receive it from outside in order to have data. However, in those times the empirical data were in part scanty and in part even false. Therefore, the study of Aristotle is nowadays not very rewarding, while that of Plato remains so to the highest degree. The lack of profundity reprimanded in Aristotle of course becomes most visible in metaphysics, where mere sagacity does not suffice, as it does elsewhere; so that in this he satisfies least. His Metaphysics is for the most part talking back and forth about the philosophemes of his predecessors, whom he criticizes and refutes from his point of view, mostly in reference to isolated utterances by them, without really penetrating their meaning, rather like someone who breaks the windows from the outside. He advances only a few, or none, of his own dogmas, at least not in systematic fashion. That we owe a large part of our knowledge of the older philosophemes to his polemics is an accidental achievement. He is hostile towards Plato mostly where the latter is completely right. Plato\u2019s \u2018Ideas\u2019 continue coming back up into his mouth, like something that he cannot digest; he is determined not to admit their validity. \u2013 Sagacity suffices in the empirical sciences; consequently Aristotle has a predominantly empirical direction. But as empirical science since that time has made so much progress that it compares to its past state as the manly age compares to infancy, today\u2019s empirical sciences cannot be much advanced directly through the study of his philosophy, but indirectly they can through the method and the properly scientific attitude that characterizes him and was brought into the world by him.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The radical antithesis of Aristotle, in the way of thinking as well as in the presentation, is Plato. The latter holds on to his main thought as if with an iron hand, follows its thread, even if it becomes ever so thin, in all its ramifications, through the labyrinths of the longest dialogues, and finds it again after all episodes. One can tell, before he started writing, he had thoroughly and entirely thought through his subject and had designed an artful order for its presentation. ...Therefore, we need not be so much surprised if, as some reports indicate, especially in Aelian (Historical Miscellany III, 19; IV, 9; etc.), a major personal disharmony manifested itself between Plato and Aristotle, and Plato may even from time to time have spoken somewhat contemptuously of Aristotle, whose wanderings, vagaries, and digressions relate to his polymathy, but are wholly antipathetic to Plato. Schiller\u2019s poem \u2018Breadth and Depth\u2019 can also be applied to the opposition between Aristotle and Plato.</span>", "filename": "schoppi_d8rw6__please_credit[palette.fm]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 476, "h": 525, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675332937720809, "time": 1675332937, "md5": "6nQhytnFxyERCCcuoUnLmg==", "fsize": 60258, "resto": 21604270}, {"no": 21604503, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:27:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21604370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21604370</a><br>this is the final pill<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plato did not approve of his life and habit, for Aristotle wore rich garments and shoes, and cut his hair after a manner not used by Plato.

Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect. When used Peripatetically , the term &#039;substance&#039; refers to an individual &#039;this something&#039;; &#039;substantiality&#039; refers to the essence of a substance, that is, its core reality or being. For Plotinus, true ontological primacy is found in Substance and Substantiality, not in substance and substantiality. Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway.

It&#039;s like they went from being protagonists of a movie about their life to being ordinary, invisible background characters like everybody else. <br><br>It&#039;s really as if they don&#039;t even have the mental categories to process not being the center of attention. They keep trying to fix the problem by changing their fashion or trying to find a new &quot;character type&quot; that fits their situation, but can&#039;t realize the real underlying problem is simply that nobody cares about your style or what twist on the dark academia archetype you are when you&#039;re a 29 year old wine aunt who just works a remote job. I&#039;ve seen them ruin really good relationships with men that frankly would have saved them and given them a new lease on life because the men weren&#039;t accepting the &quot;role&quot; they were forcing on them, of mirroring their dark academia academic girl archetype back at them. The men just saw a nice 29 year old girl and wanted to date her, not enable her play to a character. <br><br>I wonder how much of women&#039;s misery could be prevented if they just got having kids and starting a family out of the way while they were young, so they didn&#039;t base their entire identity on the perpetual edging session of &quot;dating.&quot; Their behavior reminds me of things I did in my preteen and early teen years, dumb shit that is just funny in hindsight, like how I thought I was going to run away and join the Foreign Legion, or how I wanted to be a cool drug dealer so I lied and told people I sold weed. Women don&#039;t have the same character types, but it&#039;s the same energy of trying too hard to be &quot;cool&quot; and nobody giving them any honest feedback. But the reason nobody gave me any feedback at 14 is because 14 year olds are stupid. It&#039;s normal to give them space to figure things out. These women are 23-27 years old and their entire sense of self comes from the attention they get while dressing up as characters in movies they haven&#039;t seen. I&#039;ve tried telling the women close to me that life gets both more mundane and paradoxically more exciting when you&#039;re no longer a twentyish person who thinks the world revolves around them, that somehow the other people on the bus know what movie soundtrack you&#039;re listening to on your &quot;earbuds.&quot; I&#039;ve told them that they could be any other college girl archetype and they would get just as much attention, that the attention is because of the &quot;college girl&quot; part of the equation and not the &quot;archetype&quot; part. But I&#039;m just one voice in a life full of social media and ephemeral boyfriends validating them. <br><br>If you&#039;re a man you can&#039;t really get how hard it is for women. A woman hitting her late 20s and realizing she&#039;s just some anonymous random worker now is like the pain of going bald in your 20s, times a thousand.

I think, to abstract away from what you&#039;re specifically saying about /lit/ type younger women who aestheticize being a intellectual &amp; &quot;indie&quot;, women especially as they age, have very different baggage from men. Whereas boys are always taught that they do not have intrinsic value, that their feelings do not matter, etc. girls are socialized to believe they do have intrinsic value because they are young, pretty and pure. As they age and become adult women I imagine it&#039;s quite painful to adjust to this, which is something that men cannot relate to at all because their pain comes from a completely different source. At least I think that&#039;s the spirit of what you&#039;re saying. The only point I&#039;d disagree with is that settling down and having kids will offer your life meaning.

That shit would get old fast. But if you gotta do at least one good one my process is:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.</span><br>Think of a great analogy or metaphor or aphorism. The greatest poems are typically a word painting that depicts an idea as a scene, sprawling or otherwise. Of course it&#039;s not always easy not only think of a good one of either of the three, so if you can&#039;t make it happen in your time frame, just select a beautiful thought or scene and start there. If you do that though, it makes step three harder. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.</span><br>Figure out your opening line and your meter in tandem. If you can think of your opening line in iambic off the bat you&#039;re golden. If it falls into another metric rhythm then you can try it but outside iambic and dactylic it can become difficult. Secondly, and equally as important, you want the same amount of syllables in each line. Tetrameter (4), pentameter (5), and hexameter (6) are typically the easiest to work with if you&#039;re writing in iambs or dactyls, which are each based around two syllables. If you follow the structure you start with, rhyme isn&#039;t always needed.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.</span><br>Keep your writing active, and avoid writing actual comparisons directly. Don&#039;t write &quot;X is like Y&quot;. Your poem doesn&#039;t always need to have profundity, it can simply be beautiful or resounding. But if you can, make your poem bricks of metaphors carefully building into the grand idea or scene being captured. Allow your language to follow the &#039;camera&#039; or scene, keeping its movement fluid and logical. Don&#039;t let your writing jump around the scene semi randomly, it diminishes the impact and nature of the poem. <br><br>Good luck.", "time": 1675360093, "resto": 21597191}, {"no": 21605681, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)13:31:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21597936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597936</a><br>this post but add removal of the irony", "time": 1675362664, "resto": 21597191}, {"no": 21605801, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600021</a><br>Don&#039;t sperg about it.

The idea that we don&#039;t simply define our reality by ourselves is foreign to a lot of the younger generations. Truth is truth, however many think truth can&#039;t exist and doesn&#039;t. Whether indirectly or directly they live out this worldview. This is hence why everything about society has its foundations on air. Nothing absolute, nothing concrete, no claims of goodness or Truth.

Atheism as a self proclaimed (dis)belief has made steady gains over the years in western &quot;Christian&quot; countries, and would be even more advanced in the United States, as it is in Europe, had there been less immigration. I would expect most atheists are apathetic and the fedoras are outliers.

Heresy is contextual. <br><br>To teach that it was allowable to eat pork and work on the Sabbath was heretical. And yet Jesus tells us of the shepard who, having lost a sheep on the Sabbath, saved it. He rewrites the Law. The Law is not the object we aspire to, but its particularization. It is the discrete phenomena that embodies the universal.<br><br>However, it is the universal of the law we want to promote. Justice, compassion, and above all, the promotion of human freedom.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Law to promote human freedom!? Law constrains, it says &quot;thou shalt not.&quot;</span><br><br>That is only negative freedom. It&#039;s the freedom of Thelema, &quot;do what thou wilt,&quot; or the freedom of the revolutionary sans-colottes who can only riot and destroy. <br><br>This negative freedom seeks pure abstraction because any actuality, the actual particulars of real life, necessarily makes for constraints. Particulars always constrain; simply, when one makes a choice, one has chosen and the freedom to choose no longer remains. You cannot have your cake on your plate and eat it too. But the zealots of negative freedom retreat into abstraction to avoid limits. Hence, SJWs rail on about an amorphous White Privilege and they and /pol/tards alike want to rail against an amorphous elite, but never can particularization this without fracturing their coalition since now they must fight real people, particulars. &quot;Intersectionality,&quot; is a blanket term to abstract away the fact that identity can both support and cut against existing power.<br><br>But there is also positive freedom, the freedom to do what one wills rationally, not to be drive on all sides by ones instincts and desires. This is Paul in Romans 7-9. He does a death in sin to the &quot;members of his body.&quot; This is not a biological death, but a death of personhood, of autonomoy. Drive and desire rules him. <br><br>Paul is resurrected in this life by Christ, the Logos. The law of his mind desires what is good, the aim of God&#039;s Law, and only rationale constraint allows him to live free from the &quot;Legion within,&quot; (see the story of Christ driving the demon into the pigs). See also: I Peter 4, on living &quot;with the will of God.&quot;<br><br>But obviously the Law of Christ and Law of Moses differ. Contradiction!? No, because the goal is the goal of all law, the promotion of human freedom. States and laws change over time, moving dialectically towards greater freedom. Systems with internal contradictions, e.g., a state that allows slavery, must resolve these. Hence, freedom has grown over time.

I read Bobbi&#039;s character as an annoyingly pretentious undergrad and CWF gives you the space to allow for that interpretation. Bobbi&#039;s spergs didn&#039;t have to be read with a &quot;YAS SLAY QUEEN!&quot; mentality. It was far more about Francis&#039;s insecurities in relation to Bobbi and having to deal with a person like that, being young enough to idolize that bloviating aspect of Bobbi&#039;s personality, honestly just gave me more sympathy for her character. The biggest flaw in the book was Rooney&#039;s handling of Nick; his own mental illness was cliched and honestly just came off as a means to illicit and appeal to Florence Nightingale syndrome in female readers. Also, themes relating to class issues were fairly muted and you weren&#039;t being hit over the head with shallow ideas about such (just Bobbi&#039;s jargon and, as I said before, there&#039;s enough space to interpret her character negatively).<br><br>With BW all of the above is out the widow. Lot&#039;s of writers recycle their character dynamics with only slight variations on characterization so I can&#039;t fault Rooney for writing the same basic novel again--but everything that was good in CWF is gone. We basically have watered down versions of Rooney&#039;s self-inserts in the sense they&#039;re no longer interesting. Also, excerpts like that you posted from CWF are now contained in emails (which alternate between chapters) and basically equate to preaching at the reader. So yeah, BW is far fucking worse than CWF in regard to what you&#039;ve highlighted. There&#039;s no distance anymore; it&#039;s like Rooney is appealing to a brand instead of just writing a novel she wants to write.<br><br>As for her depiction of mental illness, which was great in CWF, it&#039;s just something in the background of one of the main characters (the self-insert writer character). It never really interacts with the plot in any significant way and we don&#039;t see change in characterization; there isn&#039;t space to read the same type of empathy into the character. The male characers are just as flat as CWF and the depiction of class is ridiculously heavy-handed (unlike what we had with Francis). The love interest for the &quot;mentally ill&quot; self-insert is a cliche of crassness (but...but...he&#039;s also a bisexual manlet, doesn&#039;t that make him interesting? kek). The love interest for the Francis-type character is just another distant man akin to Nick; Rooney makes him a practising Christian but it&#039;s a fetishization of what that says about him to the reader and we don&#039;t see it in his character at all.<br><br>I enjoyed CWF and found redeemable qualities in it. BW is the trash that best exemplifies the stereotypes you project about Rooney. (Also, I like this passage <a href=\"#p21602710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602710</a>. The imagry is cliched but it&#039;s used effectively and bleeds into the tone and reflects Francis&#039;s outlook).", "time": 1675375026, "resto": 21598711}, {"no": 21606519, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)17:57:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21602497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602497</a><br>Because I had to wait for the seethe to build up before giving an honest opinion. I don&#039;t think Rooney lives up to the marketing hype (obviously) but CWF was a decent novel. It was also written before she was an international celebrity author and I think there&#039;s a valid argument to be made, given BW, that this status elevated her sales at the expense of her literary potential. BW is more confident than CWF but in a bad way--her writing became more superficial in relation to her perceived celebrity (e.g. there are literally multiple scenes where people look up her self-insert&#039;s Wikipedia and talk about her celebrity status) with less self-awareness and honest reflection in relation to her characters. <br><br>I only read BW because I bought it for someone who didn&#039;t show up to family Christmas (I gave that cousin a Virginia Woolf novel the year before and she complained about it afterward...so I gave her something more accessible). CWF was good enough that I didn&#039;t mind reading something by her again but wasn&#039;t something that lead me to intentionally seek out her books.

It&#039;s similar to what George R.R. Martin does in Games of Thrones in that a less influential character&#039;s viewpoint is provided to show how the world sees an important character and how their relationship changes. This also provides for a more detached assessment of a supposed hero&#039;s actions, as it can be all too easy for a reader, let alone the characters, to just go along with whatever they do.<br><br>The story begins with the party&#039;s arrival in Sova, the city at the heart of the Sovan Empire, and with that everything changes. The previous book took place at the fringes of the Empire where its might held less sway. That allowed for a lot of personal agency, but being here strips all of that away to reveal obeisance to institutional authority. The Empire could described as a liberal autocracy in that it has free markets and doesn&#039;t discriminate among its citizens. There&#039;s also a long tradition of secular common law meant to be applied fairly to all. However, all of that only continues to exist at the pleasure of the Emperor. If civil rights are dictated by the whims of one, or only a few unelected individuals, how much can their continuance be counted upon? Much of the book is in contemplation of the relationship an individual has to their government and the interplay between its estates.<br><br>Unraveling the conspiracy that was discovered in the first book is of the utmost concern. There&#039;s also a murder mystery, an infiltration, multiple battles, purges, relationship drama, and the occasional horror scene. The action-oriented scenes were nice, though I enjoyed the contemplative ones more. What interested me the most was the questions that are brought up along the way and my consideration of them, especially in terms of contemporary similarities.<br><br>The characters are of a decidedly gray morality. There&#039;s a clear delineation between being lawful and what many would consider being good. Mostly they&#039;re just trying to survive through their trauma and obligations. The utmost priority is the continuation of Empire, despite their reservations about its methods. The Emperor&#039;s directives must be obeyed regardless. Many ethical compromises are required to preserve the status quo. How much ought a person sacrifice to ensure the victory of the lesser evil?<br><br>The first book set up the world, this one sets up the stakes, and third is assumedly the consequences. I&#039;m quite interested to see what form that takes, specifically whether it&#039;s viewed at a distance, as is done with the viewpoint protagonist. The outcome has been already been known since the opening of the first book, so it&#039;s only a matter of how they get there. I hope that it&#039;s a path less taken.<br><br>Rating: 4/5", "filename": "81EWfJxU6cL._SL1500_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 968, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675284364759446, "time": 1675284364, "md5": "ctfvFTwllEdiZTzkZI36iw==", "fsize": 205898, "resto": 21599850, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21601818, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)15:47:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21601810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21601810</a><br>I received this advance reading/review copy (ARC) from Orbit through NetGalley.

He seemed to have a lot of talent in conveying ambience, world building, and plot development all through how people talked. I firmly believe that is a major component of why Neuromancer is so fantastic. Peripheral feels like a shitty knockoff of Neuromancer. The characters speak in stilted &quot;cool&quot; parlance like they do in Neuromancer, but none of the characters are actually cool or interesting.. They&#039;re all country hicks, ex military, or extremely rich fucks. I get that it&#039;s not meant to be cyberpunk, but god damn were all the characters boring and uninspired. The dual world setup was cool and the only, ONLY redeeming factor of the book. Can&#039;t believe Gibson actually wrote this.<br><br>DADOES - I&#039;ve seen Bladerunner, so I always held off on reading it. To my surprise, it was WAY different from the movie. The themes were different, the characters were different, the plot points were different. There was a cool religious undertone, the whole obsession with animals, the whole fake police station. Rachel was way more built out too..

You always wanted to be an Opera singer growing up, but you gave up after that particularly nasty heckler at karaoke.&quot; Giuseppe simply looked shocked.<br><br>&quot;Now, with that in mind&quot; the wife says, stepping forward &quot;we would like to perform for you: The Aristocrats!&quot; The father and son start off by singing &#039;Nkosi Sikele Afrika&#039;:<br>&quot;Nkosi sikele Afrika,<br>Malu pa kamissu phan du lwa yo,<br>Yiva ima tanni zo ye tu,<br>Nkosi sikele la&quot;<br>Then the mother and daughter come in with perfect timing, creating a wonderful canon.<br>&quot;Thee na lu-&quot;<br>&quot;Nkosi sikele Afrika&quot;<br>&quot;-sappawayo&quot;<br><br>A rhythmic bouncing can be heard off stage, keeping time. Netballs are thrown from off stage, and as each family member gets a netball they stop singing and start passing netballs to each other, faster and more netballs as other family members get their netball in turn. Before long everyone is throwing netballs around. A camera above captures netballs forming trails as they move, creating shapes as the family changes how they&#039;re passing. The video is projected behind them, and the judges are treated to a cross, a square, a hexagon, a circle, and, finally, a pentagram. A stagehand wheels a netball hoop on stage and they all get their balls through the net in succession.<br><br>Finally, it&#039;s time for the dad&#039;s solo. The rest of the family step aside as dad puts on a clown wig. He looks directly at Giuseppe and sings:<br>&quot;RIIIDIII,<br>PAGLAAACCIO,<br>SUL TUO AMOOORREE,<br>INFRAANTOO!&quot;<br><br>They all finish by gathering together and bowing before the judges, all of whom are absolutely blown away. They give the family a standing ovation and Cynthia says: &quot;That was fantastic! And you can pretty much adapt that act to any audience?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure can&quot; Joe says.<br><br>&quot;Wow. Wow. Well, as executive producer, I say you&#039;ve got the gig!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hold on, you&#039;re an executive producer?&quot; Joe asks, incredulous.<br><br>&quot;Well, yeah, I&#039;m an executive producer, Peter here is the director, and Giuseppe is the casting director.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; Joe says, seemingly disappointed.<br><br>&quot;Is that a problem for you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well&quot; Joe says &quot;it&#039;s just&quot; he continues &quot;I&#039;m not really interested in working with a wop, a nigger, and a cunt.&quot;", "filename": "The_Aristocrats", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 259, "h": 383, "tn_w": 169, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675410025694369, "time": 1675410025, "md5": "Na0FFwoh+RcK8xh308tggA==", "fsize": 26427, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-aristocrats", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21605929, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)14:47:15", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Is there a term for this?", "com": "filthy crossboarder tourist here, unsure if this is the place to ask<br><br>I&#039;ve been thinking about this the past few days, but is there a term in linguistics and/or writing that refers to phrases like &quot;Without further ado,&quot; &quot;let&#039;s get right into it,&quot; or &quot;without wasting any more time&quot; and anything similar?
