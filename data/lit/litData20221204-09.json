He said he\u2019d followed his father through the streets of western cities and they collected odds of junk from the houses there and sold them. He said that sometimes in trunks and boxes they would come upon old photographs and tintypes. These likenesses had value only to the living who had known them and with the passage of years of such there were none. But his father was a gypsy and had a gypsy mind and he would hang these cracked and fading likenesses by clothespins from the crosswires above the cart. There they remained. No one ever asked about them. No one wished to buy them. After a while the boy took them for a cautionary tale and he would search those sepia faces for some secret thing they might divulge to him from the days of their mortality. The faces became very familiar to him. By their antique clothing they were long dead and he pondered them where they sat posed on porchsteps, seated in chairs in a yard. All past and all future and all stillborn dreams cauterized in that brief encapture of light within the camera\u2019s closet. He searched those faces. Looks of vague discontent. Looks of rue. Perhaps some burgeoning bitterness at things in fact not yet come to be which yet were now forever past.<br><br>The photographs that hung from the wire became for him a form of query to the world. He sensed in them a certain power and he guessed that the gorgios considered them bad luck for they would scarcely look at them but the truth was darker yet as truth is wont to be.<br><br>What he came to see was that as the kinfolk in their fading stills could have no value save in another\u2019s heart so it was with that heart also in another\u2019s in a terrible and endless attrition and of any other value there was none. Every representation was an idol. Every likeness a heresy. In their images they had thought to find some small immortality but oblivion cannot be appeased. This was what his father meant to tell him and this was why they were men of the road. This was the why of the yellowing daguerreotypes swinging by their clothespegs from the crosswise of his father\u2019s cart.<br><br>He said that journeys involving the company of the dead were notorious for their difficulty but that in truth every journey was so accompanied. He said that in his opinion it was imprudent to suppose that the dead have no power to act in the world, for their power is great and their influence often most weighty with just those who suspect it least. He said that what men do not understand is that what the dead have quit is itself no world but is also only the picture of the world in men\u2019s hearts. He said that the world cannot be quit for it is eternal in whatever form as are all things within it.

If we look at other texts by Aristotle, like On the Heavens or On the Soul, things are more coherent. Aristotle&#039;s entire philosophy is in the model of his cosmology: a world full of natural things, surrounded by a multitude of Gods, who move in concentric circles and as such can never cross but are yet similar in their nature, with the outermost being the greatest (Zeus). This is in comparison to Plato where once we jump out of the realm of irrational and trivial matter, everything follows a very clear hierarchy of trees of distinct entities going back to The One. <br><br>To that end, Aristotle isn&#039;t trying to explain how things all go back to one singular thing (an idea he explicitly rejects, arguing that there are 47-55 possible origins, with a possibility of a causal chain branching off back to multiple origins). Rather, he&#039;s trying to describe the world around him. This is a project that he personally never could finish out of simple time constraints. Rather, he&#039;s trying to get us started on being able to observe and understand the world around us, because (in his view) the next part (taking these natural things back to the divine) isn&#039;t really all that hard to do. This seems to be another fundamental opposition with Plato: Plato said that the basics are easy, the more advanced stuff is harder, but Aristotle thought that the basic were hard and the more advanced stuff was easy after you got over the initial hurdle.<br><br>It&#039;s interesting to see how much Aristotle gets right, in that sense. He accurately noted that all mammals have similar uteruses and wombs. His criticisms of atomic origins of life lead him to positing something very much like modern Genetic Selection. He also made the radically correct observation that life does not acquire physical material for the sake of physical material, but to continue living.", "time": 1670164864, "resto": 21339142}], "last_modified": 1670164864}, {"no": 21339129, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)20:01:01", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "In which position you read books ?", "com": "i prefer chair and table", "filename": "1669904372990308", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 602, "h": 666, "tn_w": 225, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1670115661037801, "time": 1670115661, "md5": "o5+y98qAgUsOLNaX+YlIWQ==", "fsize": 64641, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-which-position-you-read-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 9, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 4, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21339155, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)20:08:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339129</a>", "filename": "Taraksvasana", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 379, "h": 570, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670116135947190, "time": 1670116135, "md5": "UWIvcgYWODStiVpkqre71g==", "fsize": 32021, "resto": 21339129}, {"no": 21340744, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)05:46:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339129</a><br>on my bed most of the time", "time": 1670150803, "resto": 21339129}, {"no": 21340754, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)05:51:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i don&#039;t read but usually when im playing on my nintendo switch i like to lie down on my couch", "time": 1670151079, "resto": 21339129}, {"no": 21341244, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:35:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bed or lounge chair", "time": 1670164525, "resto": 21339129}, {"no": 21341251, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:39:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339129</a><br>Desk and bed", "time": 1670164752, "resto": 21339129}], "last_modified": 1670164752}, {"no": 21337971, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)14:36:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hey, degenerates,<br><br>I\u2019m making a lit zine, I doodle the covers individually and hide them in the classics section of bookstores wherever I can.<br><br>If you want to submit poetry or short essays or stories please do", "filename": "1287EEA7-FC49-4A53-8AAE-99519C24074C", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1440, "h": 1800, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670096202363116, "time": 1670096202, "md5": "YFj3sUsGug14W/eByKvqzQ==", "fsize": 385256, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "hey-degenerates", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 31, "images": 15, "omitted_posts": 26, "omitted_images": 13, "last_replies": [{"no": 21341137, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:43:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OP, mind if I steal this idea for my city?", "time": 1670161417, "resto": 21337971}, {"no": 21341151, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)08:48:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21341137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21341137</a><br>not at all!", "filename": "C4859D8C-E449-4575-B5D9-123B2293DC9E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4032, "h": 3024, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1670161694502823, "time": 1670161694, "md5": "Nn39wl3VLQvDvztNu0dL7Q==", "fsize": 3264581, "resto": 21337971}, {"no": 21341218, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)09:23:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Damn, man.

His ideas on reality seem similar to Platonic and Aristotelian theory, though much less coherent. The main sources of his philosophy can be found in his numerous unpublished notebooks, in one of which he wrote &quot;I am God&quot;. The notebooks contain complex and technical diagrams explaining his metaphysics. Scriabin also used poetry to express his philosophical notions, though arguably much of his philosophical thought was translated into music, the most recognizable example being the Ninth Sonata (&quot;the Black Mass&quot;).", "filename": "E58E67B6-4B0A-4C41-ABAC-C3E7089285C8", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1027, "h": 1700, "tn_w": 151, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670096443843524, "time": 1670096443, "md5": "rMAkKbmtf6LZQ7F0+1D8hQ==", "fsize": 229158, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "scriabin-was-interested-in-friedrich-nietzsches", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 23, "images": 3, "omitted_posts": 18, "omitted_images": 3, "last_replies": [{"no": 21339148, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)20:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21338972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21338972</a><br>It&#039;s basically the same thing except more schizophrenic.

In paragraph 127 we pointed out that if the use of a new item of technology is INITIALLY optional, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional, because the new technology tends to change society in such a way that it becomes difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that technology. This applies also to the technology of human behavior. In a world in which most children are put through a program to make them enthusiastic about studying, a parent will almost be forced to put his kid through such a program, because if he does not, then the kid will grow up to be, comparatively speaking, an ignoramus and therefore unemployable. Or suppose a biological treatment is discovered that, without undesirable side-effects, will greatly reduce the psychological stress from which so many people suffer in our society. If large numbers of people choose to undergo the treatment, then the general level of stress in society will be reduced, so that it will be possible for the system to increase the stress-producing pressures. This will lead more people to undergo the treatment; and so forth, so that eventually the pressures may become so heavy that few people will be able to survive without undergoing the stress-reducing treatment. In fact, something like this seems to have happened already with one of our society\u2019s most important psychological tools for enabling people to reduce (or at least temporarily escape from) stress, namely, mass entertainment (see paragraph 147). Our use of mass entertainment is \u201coptional\u201d: No law requires us to watch television, listen to the radio, read magazines. Yet mass entertainment is a means of escape and stress-reduction on which most of us have become dependent. Everyone complains about the trashiness of television, but almost everyone watches it. A few have kicked the TV habit, but it would be a rare person who could get along today without using ANY form of mass entertainment. (Yet until quite recently in human history most people got along very nicely with no other entertainment than that which each local community created for itself) Without the entertainment industry the system probably would not have been able to get away with putting as much stress-producing pressure on us as it does.</span>", "time": 1670150965, "resto": 21338943}], "last_modified": 1670150965}, {"no": 21337139, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)10:31:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Father\u2013in\u2013law constantly gives pseudo-marxist talking points in political/economic discussion</span><br>What book should i give him for christmas /lit/ ?

This lines up with a practice of awareness. When one is distracted, or emotional, one gets poured into a single channel of thought or emotion, and the overall awareness is lost. Notice how happiness is a full body emotion. That is because when you are aware of your whole body you can reach a place of awareness beyond thought which stops any body emotions from taking over your mind with negative feedback thought loops.<br><br>All of this relates as much to writing as to life.

Princess Celestia clearly represents the solar Indo-European King-Priest, responsible for the rising and setting of the Sun, stern, cultured, full of the creative Hyperborean soul and aristocratic character. Her co-ruler, Princess Luna, represents the beholden aspect of the Lunar upon the Solar. She is responsible for the function of the moon, kind, gentle, and yet there is a darker aspect to her character , and she will often convert to a malefic aspect, Nightmare Moon. The society of Equestria at large too reflects the other two strata of the Aryan tripartite society. The rulers of Equestria exercise their rule through a martial caste, the E.U.P Guard, known more casually as the Royal Guard. They are an initiatic brotherhood of knights, responsible for order and situated close to the reins of power, as is reflected by their chieftain, Shining Armor, being brother to the heir of the Equestrian throne and married to a member to the Equestrian royal family, Princess Candance, and the coruler of the Crystal Empire. The importance of Initiation in Equestria is reflected in all classes of Equestrian society, with its most overt marker being the a pony\u2019s \u201cCutie Mark\u201d, whose form is a reflection of the inherited traits and spirit of the pony that bears it. Below the Kings, Knights, and commoners, there is a subjugated class of helots, the various non-Pony races held under the iron hoof of the Equestrian state, from dragons, to griffins, to changelings and other lesser creatures, and a quasi slave revolt even occurs in \u2018School Daze\u2019. However, near the end of the series, it is shown that members of these helotic classes are given more power, and the mismanagement of Princess Twilight Sparkle hurtles Equestria towards decline, thus clearly signaling that the Equestrians shall enter their own Kali Yuga", "filename": "B12F7E0D-BCE3-4900-B919-6EC79554A1C6", "ext": ".png", "w": 1035, "h": 780, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 188, "tim": 1670133333388743, "time": 1670133333, "md5": "cwry3U6GHPUovjcuRogfhw==", "fsize": 627435, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "upon-closer-examination-one-can-see-how-equestria", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21340098, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:59:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21340080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21340080</a><br>true", "time": 1670133580, "resto": 21340080}, {"no": 21340111, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)01:05:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This", "time": 1670133924, "resto": 21340080}, {"no": 21340582, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)04:41:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The height of right wng though", "time": 1670146912, "resto": 21340080}], "last_modified": 1670146912}, {"no": 21340456, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)03:46:46", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "read my rambling blog post", "com": "Is it possible to write a good novel without being extremely well read and knowledgeable about literary theory?

Thus this is the self-movement of concepts where two opposing concepts synthesise, and that to Hegel is how cognition works. <br>According to Hegel, being and nothing are both concepts we cannot really conceive, for when we think of being it vanishes into nothing, and when we think of nothing it vanishes into being, therefore they are both sublated into becoming. <br><br>Now Schopenhauer points out that the most immediate thing which is willing, willing can not be subsumed under any other concept; as a child is born it breathes, you also breath unconsciously but you can use the intellect (meta-cognition) to break consciously. Furthermore, Schopenhauer remarks that cognition can not be cognized as it is self-contradictory: &quot;But the proposition \u2018I cognize\u2019 is an analytic proposition because cognition is a predicate inseparable from I and always <br>assumed with it.&quot; But since the &#039;Knower&#039; cannot be cognized, it is the known that is precedes that can be know; and all men find themselves with a will, that manifests in unconsciousness manners such as breathing, hunger, etc. In all animals and with humans, they all have a will to life, therefore Schopenhauer seems fundamentally right compare to Hegel.", "filename": "vcd", "ext": ".png", "w": 1105, "h": 683, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 154, "tim": 1670115554452864, "time": 1670115554, "md5": "XTjgtKUFG3tWryBU1yqp3A==", "fsize": 1052630, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-have-been-reading-up-on-hegel-to-broaden-my", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21339156, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)20:09:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "okasy", "time": 1670116167, "resto": 21339121}, {"no": 21339947, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:16:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump for OP", "time": 1670131006, "resto": 21339121}, {"no": 21339992, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:27:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339121</a><br>Good post, but I would point out that Hegel does not necessarily posit that pure being is absence of thought (nor that his overall thought is &quot;presuppositionless&quot;). For Hegel, everything is intelligible (&quot;the real is the rational&quot; and vice versa), and therefore everything is a &quot;thought&quot; in some sense, no matter how basic. This is how he initiates the dialectic in the Sense-Certainty chapter of the movement from direct presence of being to simplex universal (&quot;non-being&quot;). It&#039;s only possible when you ascribe words to direct sense presences, ie when you think about sense presence, being as matter of factly there, that it automatically sublates itself into an abstract universal, &quot;here&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, all of which are without content or substance. In other words, if pure unmediated being were absence of thought, his entire book would not get off the ground; hence why he spends quite a few paragraphs writing about why anything beyond the conceptual is strictly non-existent (I believe this was either in the introduction or the preface).", "time": 1670131626, "resto": 21339121}, {"no": 21340467, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)03:50:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339992</a><br>Interesting, this sort of explains why Schopenhauer had such a vitriol hatred of Hegel; he opposed all notions of concepts being anything other then what has been seen intuitively through perception and re-represented so far that it has become devoid of concepts. He explicitly mentions &#039;being&#039; as the emptiest of all, and for him the subject was simply willing (i.e. breathing is the will to life) and that it was an unconscious force which is not subject to the principle of sufficient reason (causality with matter, concepts with logic, math/geometrical with pure intuition of space and time, and motivation with inner cause).<br><br>But I see your point of Hegel taking all senses being sublated into &#039;here&#039;, &#039;there&#039; and &#039;now&#039;, but it&#039;s also presupposing that concepts are somehow universal, because animals and microorganisms who exhibit clearly a will to live do not have conceptual reasoning - to assume so is strange. Schopenhauer posits that using cause (only applies to alterations of matter, that are constituted of will i.e. energy) with logical deduction is what leads to other speculative philosophy&#039;s.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%<wbr>E2%80%93energy_equivalence <br>Funnily enough, the mass-energy equivalence proposed by Einstein was already predicted by Schopenhauer (Einstein was also a reader of him).", "time": 1670143816, "resto": 21339121}], "last_modified": 1670143816}, {"no": 21339318, "now": "12/03/22(Sat)20:57:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do you like going to the library?", "filename": "9780241610510-jacket-large", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 326, "h": 500, "tn_w": 163, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670119028945077, "time": 1670119028, "md5": "9IcjR2bAhfkIX2y9L83RDw==", "fsize": 145228, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "do-you-like-going-to-the-library", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 13, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 8, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21340019, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21339318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21339318</a><br>Where else am I going to masturbate?", "time": 1670132195, "resto": 21339318}, {"no": 21340043, "now": "12/04/22(Sun)00:43:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Yeah, it\u2019s really peaceful on the second floor.
