Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90 (2d Cir. 1987)[1] is a United States case on the application of copyright law to unpublished works. In a case about author J. D. Salinger&#039;s unpublished letters, the Second Circuit held that the right of an author to control the way in which their work was first published took priority over the right of others to publish extracts or close paraphrases of the work under &quot;fair use&quot;. In the case of unpublished letters, the decision was seen as favoring the individual&#039;s right to privacy over the public right to information. However, in response to concerns about the implications of this case on scholarship, Congress amended the Copyright Act in 1992 to explicitly allow for fair use in copying unpublished works, adding to 17 U.S.C. 107 the line, &quot;The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.&quot;[2]<br><br>Fair use would not apply for a book letters or the Huntington Library sticking them all on the web.", "time": 1671087676, "resto": 21385135}, {"no": 21385999, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:34:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21385928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21385928</a><br>Thus the reeducation camps.", "time": 1671089672, "resto": 21385135}, {"no": 21386010, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)02:38:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21385135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21385135</a><br>Wait, people don&#039;t know if he&#039;s dead or alive?

It is the word for bee, which has always been a symbol of those who collect the precious &#039;honey&#039; of traditional wisdom and preserve it for further generations. A collection of legends, well known in Armenian and Syrian circles with the title of The Bees, was revised by Mar Salamon, a Nestorian Archimandrite in the thirteenth century. &quot;The Bees&quot; refers to a mysterious power transmitted from the time of Zoroaster and made manifest in the time of Christ.... Man is Persian meaning as the quality transmitted by heredity and hence a distinguished family or race. It can be the repository of an heirloom or tradition. The word sar means head, both literally and in the sense of principal or chief. The combination sarman would thus mean the chief repository of the tradition.&quot; Yet another possibility was &quot;those whose heads have been purified&quot;, in other words: the enlightened.</span><br><br>Tl;dr Bees are hence reputed to be one of the symbols of the Sarmouni (an obscure Central Asian religious sect), because they gather nectar from flowers to form honey, much as the Sarmouni hold themselves as gathering religious lore and teachings to produce enlightenment. \u201cSarman\u201d means bee in Persian, and yet another etymological dissection of \u201cSarman\u201d has it as \u201cthose whose heads have been purified\u201d or \u201cthe chief/head repository of the tradition.\u201d", "time": 1671039737, "resto": 21377731}, {"no": 21383272, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:57:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The True Gospel of Chrishna-Jeseus <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The True Gospel of Chrishna-Jeseus is a facsimile of The Book of Sa-Heti by J.

Heaven is therefore blue, earth yellow, and hell--or the underworld--red. The fiery condition of the inferno merely symbolizes the nature of the sphere or plane of force of which it is composed. In the Greek Mysteries the irrational sphere was always considered as red, for it represented that condition in which the consciousness is enslaved by the lusts and passions of the lower nature. In India certain of the gods--usually attributes of Vishnu--are depicted with blue skin to signify their divine and supermundane constitution. According to esoteric philosophy, blue is the true and sacred color of the sun. The apparent orange-yellow shade of this orb is the result of its rays being immersed in the substances of the illusionary world.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the original symbolism of the Christian Church, colors were of first importance and their use was regulated according to carefully prepared rules. Since the Middle Ages, however, the carelessness with which colors have been employed has resulted in the loss of their deeper emblematic meanings. In its primary aspect, white or silver signified life, purity, innocence, joy, and light; red, the suffering and death of Christ and His saints, and also divine love, blood, and warfare or suffering; blue, the heavenly sphere and the states of godliness and contemplation; yellow or gold, glory, fruitfulness, and goodness; green, fecundity, youthfulness, and prosperity; violet, humility, deep affection, and sorrow; black, death, destruction, and humiliation.

You have to be taught the arts directly, by someone who already is initiated into them. Thus you get a lot of claims of people to have been initiated into secret orders.

At worst, this is just fraud, but you can also consider it a sort of literary device.<br><br>Meditations on the Tarot always stood out to me as a good one.

Mind consciousness acts as organizers/giving meta consciousness abilities, where as other external sensory consciousness acts as instantaenous consciousness of the events.

Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Essentially, Traditionalism&#039;s critique of Christianity is very similar to the Theravada critique of Mahayana Buddhism&#039;s soteriological and eschatological elements. <br><br>But these criticisms potentially force Traditionalism itself into a passive and quietistic position, which it is supposedly criticizing Christianity for.

In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

Guenon and Evola both emphasize that there is nothing &quot;moral&quot; in what they are doing, and that the vulgar sentimental and moral religion of everyday faithful is merely exoteric, basically its only value is containing dumbed down versions of symbols that keep ordinary people anchored in their Traditional-Platonic republics, while maintaining pathways of symbolic ascent for talented individuals to pursue to their eventual initiation. But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions.

Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active. From this perspective, Evola and Guenon would be doing exactly what they criticize New Agers for doing: stripping people of their everyday protections and throwing them into trans-personal psychic experiences in which they will simply be subject to whatever forces are nearby. <br><br>In rejecting all claims to revelation as contingent and samsaric, Traditionalism also misses out on the possibility of a symbolic interpretation of &quot;dispensationalist&quot; revelation, in which history is not merely samsaric and cyclical, and attaining enlightenment is not merely optional and always potentially open to amoral initiates, and the occult war is not merely a particularly bad patch in the most recent kali yuga in an infinite cycle of them, but instead, history is not cylical, there is a fixed goal here, there are win and lose conditions, enlightenment is not just &quot;available&quot; to initiates but is a responsibility and a duty, and thus enabling others to be enlightened is also a duty, etc.", "time": 1670832087, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of them<br>start with the mystery of the grail", "time": 1670832095, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373699, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21370825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21370825</a><br>Evola was influenced by the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich so it&#039;s not like he disregarded all protestantism.", "time": 1670832118, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373700, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373697</a><br>And therefore, the mythic-eschatological content of a religion like Christianity, with its publically available emphasis on resisting Satan and imitating Christ in daily life, is not just an incidental exoteric form of symbols that are only really relevant to autistic initiates, there is actually a purpose to the &quot;opening&quot; of the mysteries, which, yes, vulgarized them from a certain perspective, but perhaps only because this was analogous to sprinkling thousands of seeds, formerly been contained in neatly condensed form in individual pots, over a huge field of soil and manure, so that at first they seem merely &quot;lost,&quot; but in time they grow and become many thousands of fruit-bearing, seed-bearing trees themselves? <br><br>If all of history can be interpreted symbolically in this way, then we can begin to ask questions that the Traditionalists are afraid to ask: What does it MEAN, using symbolic interpretation and sympathetic intuition, that Christ figures appeared and managed to embed moral messages and fundamentally change history, turning pagan Europe into a moral and even sentimental Christian Europe - which Evola can only view as an aberration, from his Traditionalist perspective?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way. The presupposition of autistic initiation and meaningless cyclical samsara should be dropped, and the &quot;merely accidental&quot; elements of traditions (that is, that don&#039;t accord with autistic initiation and meaningless cyclicality) should be reinterpreted in this light.", "time": 1670832148, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373703, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373700</a><br>Much of the Traditionalist understanding of history doesn&#039;t stand up to scrutiny.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

But personality and freedom are symbolically analogous to history: apparent contingency that can contain or reflect symbolic truth. Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence. But if the nature of all being is that of essence, which is pure in itself but which struggles to manifest clearly in becoming, then why shouldn&#039;t becoming itself (and its subordinate aspects: personality, freedom, history) have its own essence and meaning? Why not interpret ALL temporal contingency, all becoming qua &quot;mere negation of, or derivation or divagation from, atemporal being,&quot; as itself the symbolic emanation of an essence that combines and explains both being and becoming, instead of merely LEAVING becoming as an empty/negative category as almost all nondualist metaphysicians, including Traditionalists, do?

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function. To unite with God means more than to honour him in your heart - it means to become one with him, literally, and consequently also transcend everything, as he does. That&#039;s henosis. If you don&#039;t reach that level, you are still dealing with manifestation rather than with the source, the essence.", "time": 1671013978, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21382633, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382153</a><br>I can see why that apply to Abrahamic religions, but i dont get why Evola (and Guenon too) then do not offer the same criticism to Islam, which also relies on faith, a fallen view of man, and the inadequacy of man without God.", "time": 1671028721, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21383195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382633</a><br>It&#039;s because Islam has institutionalised Sufism which knows much higher metaphysical heights than exoteric Islam.

They spend more attention and time on Islam than on anything else, and almost all the major figures heavily specialise in Islam and constantly promote it or support Islamic groups. The ones that are not pro-Muslim are just vaguely perennialist, which would be fine if the rest weren&#039;t so heavily pro-Muslim.

Fate is a nice tool to contextualize values and human agency, since Achilles knowledge of his death in the war means he has to decide what matters to him. It contextualizes his rage over the death of Patroclus, his choice to return to the war and face death for personal vengeance against Hector.

I&#039;m glad some people here know the Greeks. Particularly, I don&#039;t think many modern people seem to read the Odyssey and really question what is going on with Telemachus and Penelope. It might just be the archaic way it is all written, but it seems like people glaze over at that. The suitors both don&#039;t need Penelope and do need her to take possession of Ithaca. Penelope isn&#039;t the &quot;heir&quot; of Ithaca per se, Odysseus inherited the throne through his father and Penelope is just his wife, but Telemachus is not the one in charge of the household either because he doesn&#039;t seek to claim it, he believes his father lives. It is just de facto the case that Penelope is the one who represents the household of Odysseus and the closest position to the power over Ithaca, so the suitors compete with each other for Ithaca by competing over Penelope. She just finds herself in the position of being the means to claim some legitimacy over Ithaca. <br><br>But also as you said, while I think Telemachus doesn&#039;t want to claim power over Ithaca because on some level this could be seen as a betrayal of his father, or a challenge to him (the situation could get sticky if Odysseus returns), he also simply doesn&#039;t feel secure enough to do so. There are tons of adult men in Odysseus&#039; house who have many friends and kinsmen who would fight on their side, and Telemachus doesn&#039;t feel capable of opposing them. This is the flip side to him potentially feeling conflicted about claiming the household for himself, what if the suitors simply try to kill him and take Ithaca? Suppose his father returns, he would find that his incapable son lost everything. So ultimately Penelope and Telemachus are of the same understanding that the best thing to do is stall for time and try to find Odysseus.", "time": 1670958853, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379470, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:15:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "being gay used to be cool now its just female fantasies where one guy is essentially a woman that preteen chicks scared of penetration self insert into so that they dont have to think of vaginas getting fucked<br>women ruined being gay", "time": 1670958935, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379498, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:24:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379346</a><br>I only saw the movie once when it first came out and tried hard to forget it afterwards.

They don&#039;t always, it isn&#039;t some necessary condition of patriarchy, but it happens in multiple cultures throughout history and doesn&#039;t seem like a coincidence. Consider how the companionship of women can become devalued by their general status as tools for powerful men to trade between each other. Women are still arousing, but even in this capacity they can easily be equated to slave women and prostitutes who are just objectified for their qualities of being arousing.<br><br>So the female sex in general becomes partially sub-human, they&#039;re just the inferiors of men. The test of companionship for women becomes their loyalty to you, but their loyalty is expected of them and isn&#039;t exactly valuable as something given to you. Greeks in Homer still showed strong signs of being a gift giving culture, since the aristocracy proudly gave, received and displayed gifts as signs of respect and alliance. In the Iliad there were even cases where somebody would recognize somebody else as a friend because their fathers had exchanged gifts. Gift giving is done between, roughly speaking, people who are equals, and it displays how you are valued by others when they freely give you gifts. <br><br>The loyalty of a wife in a culture as patriarchal as the Homeric Greeks was not a gift given by the wife, she owes loyalty as a member of the patriarch&#039;s household. But the loyalty and devotion of a man can really inspire pride, because men can be equals in honor. So the relationship between men can take on a deeper value. That isn&#039;t to then say that love between men and women in the way we understand it as a kind of companionship of &quot;equals&quot; was unheard of, but it was usually very ambiguously presented as something like intense lust. But male companionship wasn&#039;t as sullied by the quality of women as sexual objects that brought houses together in alliance. So it is easy to see how it can paradoxically (for us) appear as &quot;masculine&quot; to have semi-sexual companionship with men, because it is like an equal is giving themselves to you freely. But there are still tensions around dominance and who is giving to who, so you also get the common element of the older man and the younger man who is often something like an &quot;apprentice&quot; to the older man (see the gay samurai too).", "time": 1670960134, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379629, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379498</a><br>The prophecy of glory for Achilles is not in the Iliad.

There are a few more I&#039;m forgetting. I&#039;m about to have my second story published in another journal in the US, they are much kinder to my work than Australian journals, and they aren&#039;t your average digital mags either (not that calibre/tiers should matter too much but my work is good and I&#039;m proud of it). Anyway, I have seen you comment on Australian journals criticising your themes e.g. outback Australia, bogans, ordinary shit etc. but in my experience I find that editors are way too obsessed with 101 understandings of plot, character, and action - I am constantly criticised for structural elements of my stories, whereas I the editors for the last two stories that has been accepted by US journals are really open to my prose style, and more open to that being the point of the story. I wonder if you have any thoughts on this? Anyway, I always want to reply to you because I see you shill your stuff here and I kind of consider you to be a peer of mine - I compare myself to kind of like the episode with The Simpsons and he keeps Edison on the wall, a bit gay, and I&#039;ll calm down.

(It has fewer moments you feel are there just because Cormac wanted to write them). If I were Cormac&#039;s editor I would have cut 20-30 pages from TP, but little or nothing from SM.<br><br>\u2014 The worst of TP is worse than the worst of SM.<br><br>\u2014 The best of TP is better than the best of SM.<br><br>\u2014 TP more or less works on its own, but SM doesn&#039;t at all. If you could keep only one, it would be TP.<br><br>\u2014 The project as a whole is a lot more successful than I expected. (That serves me right for having any faith in critics &amp; advance readers. They&#039;re all idiots.) CM did a fine job of making a novel (two novels) out of basically un-novelish material.<br><br>\u2014 Cohen is slightly annoying because he isn&#039;t sharp enough. I understood at least half the things Alicia said that he didn&#039;t. (Maybe that was Cormac&#039;s intention \u2014 make Alicia more intelligent than the reader, and Cohen less so. It worked for Arthur Conan Doyle.)<br><br>\u2014 Alicia is likeable. Her worst habit is constantly saying &quot;I know&quot; when Cohen says &quot;I don&#039;t understand&quot;. She sounds like a smart-aleck twelve-year-old taking a euphemism/colloquialism literally. She&#039;s meant to be a bit like that but not that much. I think Cormac slightly misjudged it.<br><br>\u2014 The two books should be a single volume, as originally intended. Cut down the Alicia-Kid banter sessions and have the SM transcripts after them, all alternating with Bobby&#039;s narrative. Get rid of the duplicate stuff (there isn&#039;t much). You would end up with one 550-page novel instead of a 400-page novel with a 200-page appendix. Begin with Alicia&#039;s suicide &amp; end with Bobby&#039;s last five pages.

Name of the Wind... I liked. The &quot;draccus sequence&quot; near the end was goofy, but that&#039;s a minor quibble.

I was interested enough in what would happen with the story that I ended up reading Wise Man&#039;s Fear a couple weeks later.<br><br>In the meantime, I started browsing /lit/, and didn&#039;t understand the hate the books got. &quot;Patrick Rothfuss is a fat lefty beardo soijak textbook male feminist.&quot; Looking him up, that seemed to be true, but so what? You should separate an author from their work, and none of the personal complaints about him seemed to effect his book.

Then we got to the Adem. The fucking Adem. I&#039;ve never hated 100-or-so pages of a book as much as I did this shit. After finally getting through that, we get the goddamn Gypsies. It became more tolerable nearing the end, but when it was all over, there had been essentially no plot progression.

Maybe it&#039;s a schizo take but I see the car here, introduced very early on, as a symbol of something like the libido or maybe the Will in general. Michel loses his and becomes depressed, the chad drives his too fast and harms a woman, and Tisserand loses control of his and dies alone and is soon forgotten. In Houellebecq&#039;s unauthorised biography there are some interesting details such as the fact that originally the novella begins with the chapter where he addresses the reader and talks about how novels are hard to write today because people communicate less (making lengthy dialogue rather alien) and so on, but the editor insisted that it begin with the scene at the party. There are also some links to passages in other works of his, such as the woman early on who strips in front of the guests until she is nude but then doesn&#039;t know what to do and just slowly puts on her clothes, like the caged pet parrot in Elementary Particles which flees its cage at the first opportunity it gets but then just shits itself and falls down to its death several floors below (as the disabled woman does later on in that book). I like the portion of the book where Michel attends a work party where someone is retiring, and he talks to one of the computer programmers who is optimistic about computers, and talks about how society is like a brain and that improving society consists of increasing the connectivity between each individual, but then Michel points out that one of the most important functions of a brain is a unified goal. What is quite funny is that the name of this character is actually the name of a guy Houellebecq used to work with, and in the book he crticizes him and suspects he is a virgin. We come across various atomised characters, like the dentist with the ferrari, the young guy who buys a ton of new gadgets and is content with it, and the lonely woman in her 30s who can&#039;t stand Paris and visits her parents in the countryside whenever she can. Then there&#039;s the obvious Camus reference near the end with the attempted murder on the beach (but Houellebecq strips away the obscurity behind the killer&#039;s motives). It&#039;s a great read, and as someone else ITT said it summarises much of what Houellebecq writes about in later books. Though actually his first book (about Lovecraft) also summarises this. The oft-quoted passage from Whatever about sex and money is actually formulated in a similar way in the Lovecraft book. k thx bye xxx", "time": 1671105612, "resto": 21384646}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21386436, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:08:56", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Inspiration for my common app essays", "com": "Dumb post but I like reading books before writing essays and since the common app essay is probably ganna unironically be the most important essay i will be writing so any recommendations?", "filename": "App-Buttons-01-414x507", "ext": ".png", "w": 414, "h": 507, "tn_w": 204, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671102536980402, "time": 1671102536, "md5": "0z8Z6JKN3+MUWNMiBvP7Wg==", "fsize": 23527, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "inspiration-for-my-common-app-essays", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 21386443, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:13:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386436</a><br>Bhagavad Gita and write about how getting into an ivy is your dharma", "time": 1671102798, "resto": 21386436}, {"no": 21386499, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:41:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386436</a><br>Maybe a book on grammar?", "time": 1671104496, "resto": 21386436}, {"no": 21386500, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)06:43:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386436</a><br>You should assay whether man&#039;s ideas determine man&#039;s social relations, or whether man&#039;s social relations determine man&#039;s ideas.

But there&#039;s the rub. Someone who is unhappy with their life either does not know how to change it, or finds changing it in the way that would be conducive to happiness is not possible for any number of reasons up to and including:<br><br>1. They are too unhappy to concentrate or work toward something better: beaten down, crushed, debilitated. Their unhappiness is an unforgiving quicksand that sinks them ever deeper into a gurgling oblivion. <br><br>2. What would make them happy is beyond their objective power to change. Reasons for this may vary.<br><br>3. Their habits are too destructive and it&#039;s too late to make conscious change. By the time the build up of the past has been determined that you will have an unhappy life, your fate is sealed. Past decisions are like so many chains binding you in place. Misfortune clasps you in ice. Luck alone might make all the difference, but luck is out of your control, and the mana of serendipity which drips luck is running dry. <br>Time and chance is the architect of your end, possibility withers. Even the dream of growth becomes a mere thought in the head, dead and insubstantial and ungraspable.<br><br>Life, as it happens, does not relent in compounding its cruelties neither. More pains accumulate, loved ones will get sick. The body will falter and break. You will retreat into anger and bitterness as your fortress, only to discover a prison. You will finally realize that redemption will not come before death. Perhaps you will find God, or shape your struggles into art or good deeds, or perhaps you will go into nothingness with that frustrated suffering unanswered. Eventually, you must act, you must decide. Even if that one act happens in the most agonizing of midnight silences, without witness or testimony, recognition or fanfare. In the quiet pain of your heart you must decide to fight. Because so long as you fight, you have dignity. Happiness can be transcended.

My point was that other anon should understand that too, instead of conflating these basic things with precious interior qualities that may or may not necessarily coincide with the practice.<br><a href=\"#p21382298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382298</a><br>I am referring to wypipo bro.", "time": 1671019563, "resto": 21377604}, {"no": 21382320, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)07:10:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382313</a><br>Islam teaches we just by the apparent.

Honestly it would be more &quot;advantageous&quot; to not cover up fully or at all, but most of the people I know, especially if they are from Sharqiyya the eastern province, frequently say their father may be more strict but their mothers are always more religious and more of a good muslim.

Or if friends are visiting someone&#039;s house and they will pass by a woman, they usually ask the person if this family member is ok with them passing by and seeing her or should they wait for her.

It became a private service; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all participation in social production. Not until the coming of modern large-scale industry was the road to social production opened to her again \u2013 and then only to the proletarian wife. But it was opened in such a manner that, if she carries out her duties in the private service of her family, she remains excluded from public production and unable to earn; and if she wants to take part in public production and earn independently, she cannot carry out family duties. And the wife\u2019s position in the factory is the position of women in all branches of business, right up to medicine and the law. The modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual families as its molecules.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/archive/ma<wbr>rx/works/1884/origin-family/ch02d.h<wbr>tm", "time": 1671095466, "resto": 21386174}, {"no": 21386260, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386174</a><br>Engels has evidence for his claims regarding the past.

They pondered too the eminent advantages of Opera, though it finally passed their understanding how this Opera was to be dealt with from their standpoint. Schiller, transported by Gluck&#039;s &#039;Iphigenia in Tauris&#039;, nevertheless could not discover a modus vivendi with the Opera; and Goethe appears to have plainly seen that the task was reserved for the musical genius, when he regarded the news of Mozart&#039;s death as effacing all the splendid prospects of a Musically-conceived Drama opened up to him by Don Giovanni.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Through this attitude of Goethe and Schiller we are afforded a deep insight into the nature of the poet pure and simple. If on the one hand Shakespeare and his method to them seemed incomprehensible, and on the other they felt compelled to leave to the musician whose method was equally incomprehensible the unique task of breathing ideal life into the figures of the Drama, the question arises: how did they stand as poets toward the genuine Drama, and whether, solely as such, they could feel themselves equipped for Drama at all? A doubt of this seems to have invaded more and more these so profoundly truthful men, and the constant change of Form in their projects shews, of itself, that they felt as if engaged</span><br>in one continual series of experiments. Were we to try to probe that doubt, we might find in it the confession of a certain insufficiency in the poetic nature (das Bekenntniss einer Unzul\u00e4nglichkeit des dichterischen Wesens); for Poetry, taken by itself, is only to be conceived as an abstractum, and first becomes a concretum through the matter of its<br>fashionings.

Agencies want people who can advertise on their own. The idea that they do it all for you is dated. Nowadays most books that agencies pick up don&#039;t sell for shit because they don&#039;t do advertising, the authors have no following, and the general populace doesn&#039;t read enough for middling books to get big organically.

Homosexuality is actually extremely comfy as an idea when you divorce it from the cringe as fuck aesthetics of the pride parades and rainbows and shit like that. Take homosexuality, and implicate it in an outwardly amoral and dark aesthetic, and it becomes very attractive to the sorts of deviants who spend their days on 4chan. The problem I think most people really have with homosexuality is that the alphabet soup crowd gays are extremely annoying moralfags who lack cool vibes, and they are infantilized and stuck within this sort of retarded cosmopolitan liberal humanism which is just ugly and boring. They pretend to be happy, and like they are not a threat to anyone, but this is dumb. I like men who ARE a threat to other people, and who have the vibes, you know. And, unfortunately, that doesn&#039;t describe most homosexuals, because most of them are just lame poseurs with assworms.

Adler</span><br><br>This book helps me read better. To read a book is to understand a book. To understand a book according to Adler, one needs to:<br><br>- Identify its genre and type;<br>- Identify its common words;<br>- Identify each definition of the word;<br>- Identify the relation or causation of every proposition or sentence.<br><br>(Note: these are only fragments. To get the whole conception, you need to read the book).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg</span><br><br>This book helps me replace my bad habit into the good ones. According to him, habit is being consisted of cue, routine, and reward. To replace your bad habit into the good habit, you need to find the new routine with the same que and the same reward. For example: i feel bored (que), i smoke cigeratte (routine), and i feel happy (reward). Now i replace it with the good ones. I feel bored (que), i read short story (routine), and i feel happy (reward).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4) Dhammapada - Buddha</span><br><br>This book tells the fourth noble truth: there is suffering, there is the cause of suffering, there is a ceasation of suffering, and there is a way of ceasation of suffering. When things turned into void, i used remembering this concept and then i felt so much better. However Buddha also teaches the concept of attachment: one feels suffering because he is being too attached by the material things, and the ideas of past and future. To combat this, one needs to have pure consciousness (a total awareness of the present moment) by practicing meditation.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5) How to Get Out of Friend Zone: Turn Your Friendship into a Relationship - Jet &amp; Star</span><br><br>This book helped me getting a girlfriend. The authors of this book told me that to get a girlfriend, one needs to have a realization that romantic relationship is power dynamics. This means don\u2019t give too much power too your crush.

In the languid hours of afternoon, the men and women moving in and out of his field of vision were mere blurs of limbs propelled by the same insistent energies that drove the wind through the branches above him or brought his snuffling sheep to the very grass where his legs rested.<br><br>The thoughts that occurred to this man might have seemed outrageous to anyone but myself. I had watched many a distant village in sombre illustrations and seen their inhabitants stripped of the invisible but bulky layers of moral fabric that I sensed about the people nearer me. The face of the man was haggard and creased. I knew he had done in his native valley what I would not have failed to do between far hillsides. And years before I knew that his homeland was called Romania, I called it, for convenience, Romania.<br><br>A group of farm-workers straightened their backs and rested for a moment from their threshing. Women and men stood elbow to elbow. The drudgery of their work in the shadeless sunlit field and the nearness of the keen-eyed older women should have protected the only girl I was interested in. And even though she looked willingly into the eyes of some passing traveller with a camera, the folds of the white shawl hiding half her face should have proved that she held herself aloof from the stocky scowling men around her. But I could devise only one explanation for the troubled expression that marred her delicate features. Young as she was, she had been besmirched already by the ruling vice of her race.", "time": 1671019946, "resto": 21377893}, {"no": 21382501, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)08:42:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tell me why you like Murnane, Murnaneanon.

He is trying to write how our internal lives are lived exactly instead of just narrating them as a stream of intelligible thought (stream of consciousness; a little nonsensical since most of our inner world is non-verbal).

He is seen as dominating the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. Romanticist writer Sir Walter Scott called him &quot;Glorious John&quot;.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dryden was the dominant literary figure and influence of his age. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet\u2014Auden referred to him as &quot;the master of the middle style&quot;\u2014that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century. The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident in the elegies written about him. Dryden&#039;s heroic couplet became the dominant poetic form of the 18th century. Alexander Pope was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him; other writers were equally influenced by Dryden and Pope. Pope famously praised Dryden&#039;s versification in his imitation of Horace&#039;s Epistle II.i: &quot;Dryden taught to join / The varying pause, the full resounding line, / The long majestic march, and energy divine.&quot; Samuel Johnson[25] summed up the general attitude with his remark that &quot;the veneration with which his name is pronounced by every cultivator of English literature, is paid to him as he refined the language, improved the sentiments, and tuned the numbers of English poetry.&quot; His poems were very widely read, and are often quoted, for instance, in Henry Fielding&#039;s Tom Jones and Johnson&#039;s essays.</span>", "filename": "John Dryden", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 642, "h": 800, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671054577390776, "time": 1671054577, "md5": "yHBi0W4FhgIGxLZUh4ZGKA==", "fsize": 103513, "resto": 21383983}, {"no": 21384102, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)17:31:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I really liked this one.

At the top was a great pavillion wrought of fine stones, a platform, but with temple elements. It would be hard to describe them clearly because my focus was upon three large and beautiful spirits, feminine in form. They were slender, tall - taller than human women - and amazingly beautiful. Their bodies were intermixed with living stones of varying kinds - the stones were apart of them. These same crystalline stones also floated about them and around them like living halos, or shawls of gems, and these demonic women engaged me immediately in warfare. They flew about speaking in beautiful musical voices in a harmony which would have destroyed me, and in response, the Holy Spirit rose from deep, deep within me like a mighty bubbling volcano which, upon reaching my mouth, burst forth in Heavenly tongues which were light and power, and after sometime of speaking these Words of God (whose meaning I still do not know) the spirits were defeated, and I awoke. This was the entire dream. <br><br>The trend was one where women were posting themselves, nude, but covered as though clothed in stick-on gems, or gem-like stickers all over on Instagram and other media. I do not know its name, but my eyes grew wide and I was in shock when I first saw it! <br><br>For the first time, I beheld how literally the enemy brings things upon the Earth, and always, they seek to glorify themselves among men, and undo them.

He manages to make a battle- an event seen all the time in fantasy writing- and make it something incredibly unique and special. The way he switches up points of view and narration give us a comprehensive view of the battle while maintaining an interesting and powerful human element in something so large and chaotic. The perspectives of the generals, the scouts, the messengers, and the foot-soldiers are all considered, and he reveals glimpses into the future as people consider Brenna as a historical event. He blends present and future masterfully in narration- we see many different parts of the battle from many different perspectives but he makes it all flow seamlessly. One passage is set in a Nilfgaardian military academy years after the Battle of Brenna and is told almost entirely through dialogue. This passage nonetheless meshes perfectly with the next passage- told in third person narration from the perspective of a mercenary at the Battle of Brenna. Sapkowski&#039;s brilliant cast of more minor characters really shine during this battle, making it compelling and meaningful on a personal level as well as it&#039;s significance in regards to the war. Jarre, Shani, Dennis Cranmer, Yarpen Zigrin, Coen, and more characters from previous books end up at Brenna for some reason or another, and combine to tell a compelling tale totally bereft of the major characters of the series but nonetheless a testament to the fantastic characters of this series. Sapkowski&#039;s ability to weave interesting and engaging life stories with sometimes heartbreaking endings into a battle scene is incredible, and I feel like words are failing me as I try to describe all the amazing things Sapkowski does with his writing in this scene. Learning the fates of those who survived the battle is also so melancholy- some characters get to live happily while others end up meeting with misfortune. I have read series where the deaths of major characters don&#039;t effect me at all, but learning about the ends of some of the characters who survived Brenna was tough, although also another example of Sapkowki&#039;s excellent writing. I would love to delve further into some of the fascinating scenes of this battle but then I would never wrap this post up. Throughout his telling of the Battle of Brenna Sapkowski mixed battlefield tactics with the more visceral parts of the human experience. Hope and despair, loyalty and fear, bravery and cowardice. All this framed with exceptionally clever narration choices, interspersed with dark and ironic humor throughout, creates what is in my opinion one of the most complex and original examples of storytelling there is.<br><br>TL;DR This section of the books was one of my favorites as it really demonstrates the strength of Sapkowski&#039;s writing and the depth of his characters.", "filename": "Andrzej_Sapkowski_-_Lucca_Comics_&amp;_Games_2015", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1560, "h": 2188, "tn_w": 178, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671072640404096, "time": 1671072640, "md5": "EE62cBlWQN1XDN3NJ5sz1A==", "fsize": 955509, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lady-of-the-lake-battle-of-brenna", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21385815, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)01:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21385095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21385095</a><br>Sapek to stary burok i gbur", "time": 1671084936, "resto": 21385095}, {"no": 21385827, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)01:20:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21385815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21385815</a><br>ile ci mniemcy zap\u0142acili za ten antypolski paszkwil ty jurgieltniku targowicki?!", "time": 1671085224, "resto": 21385095}, {"no": 21386220, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:26:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21385827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21385827</a><br>nie pij denaturatu przed pisaniem post\u00f3w sapkowski", "time": 1671096388, "resto": 21385095}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21384458, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:05:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Now that the dust has finally settled", "com": "who was in the wrong /lit/?", "filename": "1541378092615", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 500, "tn_w": 175, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671062706550019, "time": 1671062706, "md5": "2jKnzTKVZwcAvps0M+G5kw==", "fsize": 18761, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "now-that-the-dust-has-finally-settled", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21384461, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:05:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hey Sean, no long no shill.", "time": 1671062734, "resto": 21384458}, {"no": 21384484, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:09:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21384461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21384461</a><br>The goodreads reviews are pretty funny<br>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show<wbr>/32934577-the-foundation-for-explor<wbr>ation<br><br>Women are dumb as fuck, they have such limited ability to cope with things outside the frame of reference they have built up from TV shows and high school", "time": 1671062983, "resto": 21384458}, {"no": 21384497, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)19:14:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21384458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21384458</a><br>I don\u2019t recommend you read this unless you are a homophobic misogynistic POS.

To get in you need to have very good letters of recommendation ideally from professors who present you as a &quot;get&quot; for the department, not just as a smart guy from 5 years ago, if they even remember you enough to say something distinct. In Philosophy especially I think there is a concern for poaching students who are obviously plugged into hot or soon to be hot trends, maybe slightly more so than in other disciplines, because Philosophy &quot;moves&quot; in trends and schools and figures associated with them.

Remember this is coupled with the ongoing retirement of older professors, and their replacement by &quot;up and coming&quot; late gen-x&#039;ers and early millennials, where &quot;up and coming&quot; is defined by the standards of the current liberal consensus, so, often but not always, woke networking by oversocialized drones. The old professors who remember the golden era of rubber stamping and smaller admin are leaving, and the new professors who have only known the days of bloated admin and cutthroat networking and trend-chasing are arriving.

Even the luckiest and most brilliant graduates will probably do a postdoc or adjunct, or a tenure track job at a less prestigious institution, with salaries in the mid five figures for most postdocs and adjuncts and still not great for tenure track. And you also don&#039;t control where you get a position, so you will once again probably have to move and start over, now 35-40 minimum. If it&#039;s a postdoc or adjunct position, this is all so you can just restart the process and move again wherever your next position is. If it&#039;s tenure track, you&#039;ll still be hunting for a higher prestige/pay job, and likely have to move again. Once your PhD is done you will still be slogging to publish and stay relevant for a couple more years, while also hunting for these jobs and moving as necessary.

I know exactly what I would have done, because I still do it: I would daydream for years and have all these intentions, and never do anything, or only ever do 5% of it, because there&#039;s always next month, next year, this weekend. The only reason I grew and actually developed my skills and interests is because I was forced to, by one absolutely pointless deadline or another. This still happens on a regular basis, I pile up a bunch of &quot;oh yeah I&#039;ll definitely have that project underway or done this year,&quot; and I don&#039;t do shit but daydream for 10 months, and then the responsibility I signed up for forces me to actually do it because I&#039;ll be shamed or fired otherwise. <br><br>If by some miracle you can impose these strictures on yourself without external compulsion, then I agree that academia has nothing to offer you. But I know for a fact that I would have stagnated if I hadn&#039;t been forced through the gauntlet, and forced to rebel against it partly out of spite. I hate academia but at least it forced me to keep studying Japanese every day. Then again this probably only applies to autists, and has very little to do with the program itself. All of your peers will still be professionalized mediocrities with no passion for the subject. <br><br>If some other institution could provide this compulsion, academia would have no value.

Even if your goal is to make the next Dwarf Fortress game, you need something external that continuously forces you to produce results for years on end or you will never do shit, especially in this era where everybody we&#039;re all spaced out, spoiled excuse-makers and &quot;gifted underachievers.&quot; <br><br>Right now I&#039;m preparing for a brief interview in a month about some topic the person thinks I&#039;m an expert on, and while I theoretically am, I am so scared by the prospect of looking like a dumbass that I am re-reading the entire corpus on that thing, and having a good time. And this is having the side benefit of kicking me back into gear for a project I wanted to write on this topic. Why didn&#039;t I do this for the last 5 years of being an &quot;expert&quot; and intending to write that project? Because I don&#039;t do shit unless I&#039;ll be embarrassed otherwise.

I mean, who gives a care in 2022 about such a story? I was entirely bemused by it and a little pissed that he made a big deal out of nothing.

How did you get up here?\u201d<br>\u201cMy name is Meredith. Don\u2019t tell anyone but I used magic.\u201d<br>\u201cMagic?\u201d <br>\u201cYes, magic. Let me show you.\u201d<br>With a wave of her hand, sparks of mana took shape. She performed for the Prince, dazzling his mind with the beauty she conjured. <br>\u201cWow! How did you learn to use magic? And can I do it too?\u201d<br>Meredith smiled at the Prince. Her eyes welled with tears and her smiling lips drooped into a frown. <br>\u201cIt is a curse which I would never wish upon another. To mock Nature is a crime upon itself.\u201d<br>\u201cI wish to learn anyways. A talent this powerful could never be a curse. I\u2019ll do anything to be able to cast magic!\u201d<br>\u201cAre you prepared to sacrifice what you love?\u201d<br>\u201cYes!\u201d<br>Meredith\u2019s eyes glowed a yellow that shocked the dragon. The beast stepped back and arched his neck. Smoke formed from its nostrils, and in a single instant it blew a fire directly at the girl. <br>\u201cDraco! Stop!\u201d the Prince cried. He turned to Meredith. She was still there, unburnt, and unharmed.", "time": 1670991174, "resto": 21381156}, {"no": 21381242, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:13:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21381237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21381237</a><br>The dragon flapped its wings, ready to take flight, but chains of mana sealed its fate.

Meredith touched the nose of the beast and in an instant, decay set upon its body. The Prince was shocked; speechless at the events that took place. Meredith turned around and held in her hand, a glowing blue orb.<br>\u201cHere. This is your gift for defying Nature.\u201d<br>\u201cWhere did Draco go?

For example, I can&#039;t take the name Asher Lockman seriously; it sounds too edgy, even though it&#039;s a real-enough name. The sentence &quot;there were goofy mechanical rubber hands that removed her clothes, sort of like the famous contraption from Wallace and Gromit.&quot; needs to stop at the comma; goofy mechanical rubber hands is enough, and insisting that the reader imagine exactly the thing from that TV show that one time is... too insistent. The further crudity at this point is again undermining the writing.<br><br>The tweest at the end is good and I like it, but it doesn&#039;t seem fully developed. The crudity makes more sense when you get the tweest but the problem is that the crudity just feels crude until you make it that far. It would be better if it felt sinister - instead of making the reader feel like he&#039;s reading someone&#039;s bad erotic fiction you want him to feel like he&#039;s reading a well-written horror story about a woman who is trapped in someone&#039;s bad erotic fantasy; you want it to read sinister instead of reading crude. As for the &quot;point&quot; that Asher makes, it&#039;s fine to make it so briefly but only if the rest of the work is adding context to it. You want the &quot;point&quot; to tie together all of the &quot;evidence&quot; that your story has presented in a lightbulb moment.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

We want stories more complex than some jacked demigod killing a hydra, and we have some standards about what is and isn&#039;t appropriate for goofy kids&#039; stories. In a modern environment, kids are going to be exposed to the fact that there are terrible things happening in the world either way. The argument also ignores that they have a limited effect. Even if a fairy tale gives someone a basic idea of death, it&#039;s still gonna hit hard when their loved one dies for real.

The world of phenomena is a test, projected by the noumena, and to conquer it you must conquer yourself.<br><br>Although I might try to convince myself that life has some external value, after a night drinking with \u201cfriends\u201d or a sexual encounter with woman, it quickly becomes apparent that most friends are not worth having, and that woman\u2019s sexual desires are so perverse and banal that their even having desired you bears the weight of a bad conscience. What man does not disgrace himself by submitting to a woman\u2019s desires? He becomes a fool, a brute, a scoundrel, a cuckhold, all at once\u2014 and looses himself in the process.

He devoured his life\u2019s work to the machinations of warfare and industry, he trampled the earth, he becomes bound up in stories told to gullible children, he is sold slavery and like an idiot wears his chains with pride.<br><br>Service originates in the Latin word &quot;Servi\u201d, meaning slave. That\u2019s what society, friends, woman the whole world, asks from you, your slavery. In English, the familiar for of \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cthou\u201d, has long since died from the language. For those lonely men in Anglo countries seeking company, this should be (with honest reflection) enough proof that you will never find it. We live in a civilizational world-spirit which lacks even the words to express friendship, closeness.<br><br>There are two things in life worth their weight in gold: freedom and silence. How many men exchange these treasures for paper? Or for a soft touch of flesh? Or for some false sense of meaning to disguise their emptiness?<br><br>In books, there is the peace of forming a genuine connection with another person. If you cannot read, write. If you cannot write, read. If you are still lonely, hire a whore; it is less demeaning and less expensive than going to clubs.

What&#039;s impressive about it is that it&#039;s Mark Twain&#039;s best work (and he also considered it his best), and it&#039;s very lovely and reverent towards Joan, despite Twain&#039;s life-long atheism. It makes you wonder if he had a Road to Damascus moment near the end of his life, since this was one of the last books he wrote. Most books about Joan of Arc are written from a secular point of view where the author writes her off as mentally-ill, which makes it curious that Mark Twain--a lifelong atheist--treats her visions and revelations as fact.<br><br>It&#039;s also very accurate, because he spent years in both England and France studying Joan&#039;s history, both the English and French side of the Hundred Years&#039; War, and he mastered French to understand the French transcripts of Joan&#039;s court trial. The only inaccuracy for the most part is that he refers to Joan as &quot;chief general of France,&quot; but no such position actually existed. She might as well have been general, though, because despite the common belief that Joan was merely a figurehead, she actually did have authority and led every charge, despite never personally killing anyone because it was against her beliefs.", "time": 1671063694, "resto": 21383228}, {"no": 21384681, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)20:01:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My favorite, starring Tom Sawyer and Nigger Jim", "time": 1671066107, "resto": 21383228}, {"no": 21385021, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:32:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21383243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21383243</a><br>delicious", "filename": "1612332570519", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 391, "h": 604, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671071566469936, "time": 1671071566, "md5": "3u5PysUBM9NGrNC+o+dT0w==", "fsize": 40513, "resto": 21383228}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21384896, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:04:30", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "What&#039;s the literature equivalent of this?", "com": "https://youtu.be/zGGA74Ie0aQ", "filename": "Screenshot_20221214_085541", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 944, "h": 719, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 190, "tim": 1671069870934616, "time": 1671069870, "md5": "b9iCa8QjyVaeO2JpZlkHmQ==", "fsize": 128999, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-the-literature-equivalent-of-this", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 21384911, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:08:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You&#039;re only posting about this because TikTok rediscovered this stupid ad.
