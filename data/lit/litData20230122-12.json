Quaker Whaling Hyper industry and maximum frugality kinda stuff. Most period sources and analysis seem to agree on this general pervasive mentality. It somewhat maybe connecting to the particular branches of protistantism that focus on a hyper personalized connection with god in religion, born agains and revivals and Methodists and Baptists and even historically, if nominally waning, puritans.<br><br>Just seems to be an odd critique in reference to this fundamental mentality. Not that it doesnt have merit, a certain sort of excellence is of course detracted, but an ontological excellence seems to have been a pervasive piece of the culture. Even Neitche I think often commented on this. I also Found it odd, as a usual critique of the sort that might be qualified as the &quot;atheist left&quot; tends to poopoo the sort of cult of personal (individualism) excellence exaltation, as a detraction from communal concerns.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Love of money but not of excellence or nobility.</span><br>not nobility, maybe, but excellence yes.

The subject matter seems a bit scattered, almost feeling a bit &quot;generated&quot; rather than having a particular poetic purpose. The variance in meter appears from lines 3 to 6. Unsure what the intention behind this was. Line 9 particularly sticks out as varied in rhythm compared to what preceded it with the &quot;silvered&quot; construction. Line 13 ends rather softly as &quot;with&quot; &quot;er&quot; and &quot;ing&quot; are all usually unstressed sounds (although not always in the word itself), but it felt maybe you were dissipating the stress here. Line 15 shifts again as I think &quot;metal shavings&quot; becomes trochaic depending on the rest of the line. There&#039;s no need not to vary it but I&#039;m struggling to see the purpose or pattern; maybe you can illuminate me. &quot;Back at&quot; in line 16 also feels a bit awkward at the start of the line, but that is probably due to the grammatical construction forcing you to use it. &quot;al dente&quot; followed by &quot;and&quot; is a bit odd, since I&#039;d put in &quot;rending small&quot; instead of &quot;and rend small&quot;. The mentions of potentially Athena or Metis being related to Zeus was a nice touch.<br>Some of it reminds me more of Rossetti and maybe Shelley with the seemingly freer, more energetic form of iambic pentameter (as opposed to some more rigid iambic pentameter), which is not a bad thing, but to know why you chose certain pressure points and moments of waning from pressure would be good.

My guideline is not metre as much as it is a syllabic structure (the Milton part is subterfuge, for the most part, but explicitly intended to reference the syllabic construction of the poem).

It&#039;s a tale told by Hoid of self-discovery, courage, determination, friendship, loyalty, and of course, love. If you find those ideas to be trite, then this book will have substantially less to offer you. For me it was a considerable amount of visceral joy, especially near the end.<br><br>What was most surprising for me is how little I minded the length considering its content. Usually when I&#039;m reading Sanderson I think that it could be much shorter. It&#039;s not even that he&#039;s necessarily better at short length, he has some awful short fiction. The content for a full three-quarters of the book is being on ships sailing. I don&#039;t know if that makes it nautical fantasy, but there&#039;s certainly an argument for it. There&#039;s not much to do fill several hundred pages worth of being on a ship other than discussion, experimentation, and a few dangerous events on the high pollen seas. Yes, the seas are filled with pollen, twelve varieties around the world that each have their own magical effects.<br><br>There&#039;s a twist, but considering the extensive foreshadowing it receives to where it&#039;s all but stated multiple times, I don&#039;t know if it really counts as one. I thought I caught it early on, but at the end, the book literally tells the reader when the earliest point they could&#039;ve known and how. Considering how obvious it was in retrospect, I was rightfully put in my place. As to whom Hoid is telling all of this, it&#039;s indirectly stated near the very end, but that requires having read the relevant novella and remembering. As to why he is, I guess that&#039;s just a Hoid thing to do.<br><br>I&#039;m very pleased by this simple and straightforward story that&#039;s filled with heart.<br><br>Rating: 4/5", "filename": "60531406", "ext": ".png", "w": 943, "h": 1471, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674329308465725, "time": 1674329308, "md5": "lBfeIB7nF4IAGmdxYhLg/Q==", "fsize": 1444355, "resto": 21553468, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21554681, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)14:32:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Gameplayers of Titan was great.

Like nigga, don&#039;t you known most white Europeans are racist towards other groups of white Europeans just as much as they are to other races? Look into the Balkans and see how mich value the average Serb, Albanian, Greek, Croatian or Bosnian puts into the concept of a white race that includes his blood enemies. <br><br>In terms of Islam, it&#039;s not as big of a threat in Europe as Americans make it seem.The vast majority of Muslims have children that become extremely secular and often are more degenerate than their European counterparts. If anything is killing this world, its secularism and glowies promoting retarded internet ideologies like socialism, white nationalism (which is only promoted for the sake of having an eternal enemy and not its actually effective at what it foes) and globohomo capitalism.

Later, i realized i had been manipolated, gaslighted and cheated on by him and perhaps he had narcissist tendencies. <br>So that was my wake up call: i started working out, eating well, non-stop walking, walking, walking. Journalling and writing stuff. Unstuck myself with my studies, went into therapy to improve myself. <br>Meanwhile - i admit - i kept stalking him online and on dating apps (which he always was online, even while we were together) for a while. Found out he jumped into another relationship the same week he left me. (he proclaimed himself polyamorous during our monogamous relationship). 2 months after he dumps the new polyamorous guy and gets back to monogamy (what a surprise). He has some hook-ups with other 3-4 guys, i get to know this thanks to a spy (another funny story i could develop further). he seemed he couldn&#039;t find his mr. right during his obsessive research.<br>Meanwhile, i kept going and improving myself throughout the summer. by pure luck i match with a 10/10 looking dude and i get to know him and meet him. he lived 2 hours far away. The new guy looked so into me. So sweet at first, a bit cold perhaps. I meet him once and twice. We kiss and have sex. seemed like he was into me for a relationship, despite always having the fear he wants to use me running on background.<br>Meanwhile, my ex was alone. You&#039;d say now: &quot;well, seems like there&#039;s some justice left in the world&quot; right? not at all. <br>August comes, i had my planned trip to Canada (I live in italy and this was my first trip in america, i planned it right after my ex dumped my as a mean to move on). <br>I get back from holidays, in the meanwhile the new guy starts to pull away and gives me breadcrumbs. I try to stay chill, but i die inside, too afraid to speak up. <br>Someday in september i tell him: &quot;well, if you&#039;re not interested anymore just tell me, no prob&quot;. He doesn&#039;t *actually* say yes or no, and keeps stringing me along. I can&#039;t manage to hang out with him a third time because he keeps bailing. Finally he accepts. Felt like he friendzoned me.<br>Finally, after two months of anxiety and war flashbacks, i got the courage to speak up. he gives me some weak ass excuse and that day i ended the situationship. Mentally destroyed by this second dude. Meanwhile my ex got together with this gay guy from a group chat he used to lurk in and is now totally happy. he deleted all his dating apps. And i&#039;m here, alone, with nobody in sight. working on myself. <br>At this point, there&#039;s no logic in this world. no justice, no balance, just cruel randomness at best.

There are time and place specific genres like the japanese prose-and-poem travelogue &quot;haibun&quot; which has genre tendencies that I don&#039;t think have traditional analogues in other literary traditions, but it is certainly being written in other languages today. There&#039;s certainly a difficulty in translating certain kinds of literature, I&#039;m thinking particularly of regionalist novels with heavy use of dialect. Dialect written on the page does more than simply tell the reader how a given person sounds when they speak, it is also used to communicate a variety of cultural understandings about time, place, class, or personal qualities, and I have no idea how translators handle novels where dialect is an important feature, but most genres could be written in multiple languages, and if they aren&#039;t there&#039;s likely cultural or historical reasons why.<br><br>As to the other, literary genres are collections of conventions. I&#039;m sure lots of languages have the capacity for literary experiments that cannot be replicated in other languages, but whether they would ever coalesce in to a genre I have no idea.<br>There are probably languages with cases or tenses that are fairly idiosyncratic in their use, and something could be written largely in a way that simply neither translates nor is possible in another language.<br>When I read medieval japanese in translation I am struck by the level to which expression in written communication is dependent on homophone-related wordplay. It&#039;s by no means specific to japanese, but it&#039;s quite a prominent feature of that period&#039;s literature deliberately. I wonder if there&#039;s a language that is homophonic enough that literature could be written where the entire work has multiple meanings depending on your choice of reading specific homophones. Obviously short passages can be constructed this way in pretty much and language&#039;s literature, but maybe there&#039;s one out there so homophonic that entire novels could be written in a way that they deliberately contain multiple separate linguistic interpretations. Whether any written language has the capacity for this to be an actual genre I have no idea. <br>While certain things like Finnegan&#039;s Wake are probably impossible to translate in to an ideographic writing system, there is probably a potential (or existing) genre is say Chinese which is equally impossible in other languages due to the nature of the writing system. Look at lion-eating poet in the stone den. It&#039;s a gag, sure, but it&#039;s made possible by the disconnect between spoken language and writing system. I don&#039;t know if anywhere in the world there exists a situation where this kind of thing could be an actual genre rather than a one off experiment or joke, but maybe there does.<br><br>So I&#039;m going to give you a hard maybe on there being any if you are talking about possibility.", "time": 1674347965, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556087, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:56:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555808</a><br>It&#039;s not solely Brazilian, it&#039;s a Portuguese thing.<br>t.Portuga", "time": 1674348990, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556097, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:00:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555862</a><br>like thomas wolfe?", "time": 1674349217, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556247, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:43:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555689</a><br>wuxia/xianxia - china<br>nachkriegsliterat\u00fcr - germany/austria<br>dorfkrimis - germanic countries", "time": 1674351791, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556281, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:56:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "every language is probably its own genre<br>but to write books you have to have tons of intelligent people<br>also, if one genre appears in one country, it quickly gets cloned in other countries as you only need &quot;reasonably intelligent&quot; people to do that<br>so probably the only four genres that exist are the superpower (chinese) one, the lewd (french) one, the procedural/criminal (english) one, and the speculative/wishful (italian) one", "time": 1674352584, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556295, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:02:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555689</a><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doina<wbr>", "time": 1674352973, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556318, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:11:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555689</a><br>None. <br>All literature is based on English, French and German forms.", "time": 1674353510, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556319, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:12:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556295</a><br>a nice blend of Arabic delight and Troubadour love?", "time": 1674353537, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556322, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556318</a><br>what is the German form? serious question, as I can place the English and French ones", "time": 1674353600, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556326, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:15:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556319</a><br>Nah the wiki page is just garbage", "time": 1674353707, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556334, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:18:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556326</a><br>but youtube only give me stuff on flute and other woodwinds... don&#039;t they have transcriptions on strings and/or keys (organ), like Germans did with their folk songs? with a soloist and/or choir of course; that would be magnificent", "time": 1674353887, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556379, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:36:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556322</a><br>Essentially derivative of French and German, but I thought it was worth noting because they consolidated important genres that were exported later.", "time": 1674355018, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556383, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:38:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556334</a><br><a href=\"#p21556326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556326</a><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3y<wbr>JEsRvrEM<br>this sounds nice but no lyrics :/<br><a href=\"#p21556379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556379</a><br>French (Turkish influence from their shameful period) and German lyrics (the high Troubadour aka Minnesaenger) sounds like a pretty sweet combo", "time": 1674355112, "resto": 21555689}, {"no": 21556428, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555689</a><br>Pic related is so deeply British I dont see how whatever it is could exist anywhere else.

This argument was fake (though presented without fraudulent intent) but didn&#039;t work convincing contradictors.

Of course secular rulers taking over their local churches was the main reasons protestantism spread with backing from political leaders (like the rogue princes gave a damn about the tranny soteriology, at most they wanted to divorce and have harems) or why easterners kept the schism. <br>Third, the office of pope is from the earliest apostolic tradition but the specifics of the job have changed a lot through history and that relative power (which I assume you are alluding to).

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1674372637, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557138, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21557136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21557136</a><br>Dostoyevsky was a far superior writer if I&#039;m being honest.", "time": 1674372681, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557404, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "At first I was lukewarm on Pale Fire (didnt even try to do that) cuz I thought its structure was just Nabokov showing off and I&#039;m generally apprehensive when it comes to praising books solely for being intricate, but its the final third or so of the book where all the small pieces really come together.

The Enlightened One makes him a wager that, if he can jump out of his hand, the macaque will become the new ruler of heaven. Monkey agrees to the wager and jumps into his palm. With one tremendous leap, Sun speeds towards the reaches of heaven, clouds whizzing by him in a blur of colors as he travels across the sky. He lands before five great pillars, thinking them to be the edge of the cosmos. He tags one of the pillars with his name and urinates at the base of another in order to prove that he had been there. Upon returning, he demands that the Buddha live up to his end of the bargain.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

In case duplicate data hasn\u2019t reached you, I\u2019ll say briefly that grief about REH\u2019s mother was the cause. When he was told that she could not live more than 48 hours, he entered his car, closed the doors, and shot himself through the head\u2014never regaining consciousness and dying 8 hours later. That was June 11. His mother died the next day without regaining consciousness or knowing of his act. The shock to Dr. Howard must be devastating\u2014wife and splendid only child gone in one dread blow. I only hope he can weather it successfully. I\u2019ve just written him a letter of sympathy. His letter showed tremendous bravery, and the paper spoke of his being about to visit relatives in Missouri. One can imagine his suffering\u2014as well as the degree of grief which drove REH to his own desperate act.

REH\u2019s idolisation of both his parents was always manifest, but the present sad extreme was hardly to be looked for\u2014although his father says he feared it for some time. I suppose that, in the last analysis, his desperate reaction to his grief came from the selfsame endowment of sensitiveness and imagination which made his stories stand out so. He saw everything in the heightened light of its dramatic relationships to things behind and around it, and subjectively felt the events of history, and the spirit and overtones of scenes and personalities, as very few are able to see and feel. Turned on the sorrow in his immediate life, this faculty must have given things an intolerable aspect and precipitated the fatal act. One could wish that, for once, he had been less of a sensitive artist.</span>", "filename": "WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_011921_1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 714, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 59, "tim": 1674349580179121, "time": 1674349580, "md5": "wVJhzVzgVskxfwsXvCsZ2w==", "fsize": 245572, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21556226, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556123</a><br>oh shit I ( <a href=\"#p21556101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556101</a> ) confused him with John Norman for a second... mille scusi!!!!!!", "time": 1674351458, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21556287, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555920</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe there is a word or phrase for this that I&#039;ve never heard, idk</span><br>Being white (not a nigger)?", "time": 1674352760, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21557385, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555560</a><br>I am unironically doing this as we speak<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they are fine with it</span><br>Rich parents for the win, suck a fat one poorlets", "time": 1674380367, "resto": 21555560}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21556049, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:47:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;...it would still have been in place to remember the words of Plato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which the wicked man does in actual life.</span><br>What&#039;s the Platonic source of this remark?", "filename": "Sigmund-Freud-3-e1530897929153[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1021, "h": 814, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 199, "tim": 1674348457996554, "time": 1674348457, "md5": "xMIDl9O0Z7y5OZk3Zn0nVw==", "fsize": 106391, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "it-would-still-have-been-in-place-to-remember-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21556055, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:49:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Plato would likely grab Freud by the throat and savage his bitch ass.", "time": 1674348540, "resto": 21556049}, {"no": 21556131, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:08:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556055</a><br>You shall see who is stronger, a gentle little dialectician who doesn&#039;t eat enough, or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body.", "time": 1674349696, "resto": 21556049}, {"no": 21556179, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:23:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556131</a><br>So you&#039;re throwing Jung in his prime in there?", "time": 1674350594, "resto": 21556049}, {"no": 21556388, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)21:40:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556179</a><br>JUNG was a sentimental pansy who never had the stones to fabricate a citation from Plato", "time": 1674355202, "resto": 21556049}, {"no": 21557384, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:39:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Republic book 9, 571c", "time": 1674380351, "resto": 21556049}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21556152, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:14:01", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I got two (2) Audible credits.", "com": "Got any good recommendations bros?", "filename": "unknown-8", "ext": ".png", "w": 910, "h": 810, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 222, "tim": 1674350041429290, "time": 1674350041, "md5": "O5LQ1IK1OeJSh0fFnwnWgg==", "fsize": 680067, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-got-two-2-audible-credits", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 21556161, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:15:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556152</a><br>Yes.

For Kaczynski, a proper compromise could be found in the fact that, even if one does not have permission by their authority to commit some act, so long as that authority is unable to monitor and enforce its will, then the individual has freedom to commit the act. In the past, as Kaczynski states in paragraph 94-95, and as can readily be known from a simple perusal of history, while governments were highly restrictive and authoritarian, small communities and individuals paradoxically possessed a far greater level of freedom than the average person does today.

The Greeks and Romans weren&#039;t able to enforce their will as is possible in a modern industrial country, so there was no total uniformity with law and custom. The very problem of enforcement is why small groups and local communities were given so much freedom and autonomy by ancient empires; there was no practical way to enforce a centralized government.

A message for Europe, continent-sized, inescapable. Europe had found the site for its Kingdom of Death, that special Death the West had invented. Savages had their waste regions, Kalaharis, lakes so misty they could not see the other side. But Europe had gone deeper\u2014into obsession, addiction, away from all the savage innocences. America was a gift from the invisible powers, a way of returning. But Europe refused it.

What it could not use, it killed or altered. In time the death-colonies grew strong enough to break away. But the impulse to empire, the mission to propagate death, the structure of it, kept on. Now we are in the last phase. American Death has come to occupy Europe. It has learned empire from its old metropolis. But now we have only the structure left us, none of the great rainbow plumes, no fittings of gold, no epic marches over alkali seas. The savages of other continents, corrupted but still resisting in the name of life, have gone on despite everything... while Death and Europe are separate as ever, their love still unconsummated.

No attempt succeeded (in western Christianity at least, not sure about Orthodoxy) in setting up an official, widely accepted esoterism, but there are many attemps and Gnosticism is one flavor. Rather than Gnosticism specifically you might just be craving esoterism that&#039;s attached to the figure of Jesus in general.<br>2. It doesn&#039;t matter what the historical Jesus actually taught or was like, nobody can assert this in an objective sense, they just have faith in one narrative or another regarding who he was. I too went through a phase of feeling convinced that the &quot;real Jesus&quot; was Gnostic, for the simple reason that the Gnostic texts spoke very powerfully to me. The simple truth is the real Jesus is in your heart and has to be sought spiritually rather than historically.<br>3. If Gnosticism is your thing that&#039;s great but don&#039;t forget the focus always has to be on spiritual discipline, don&#039;t let Gnosticism just be some alternative narrative for you and that&#039;s it. I personally moved more toward perenilliasm but I still have a fondness for Gnosticism. Remember the focus has to be on spiritual discipline.<br>Hope that was helpful in some sense, if not our experiences are more different than I perhaps assumed.

The Anglo-American bloc couldn&#039;t let a distinct continental bloc exist, because its own survival conditions required global financial tyranny and &quot;soft power&quot; imperialism, what we now call globalism. For smaller Rhodesias (plural) to survive, aka European countries, they had to be part of a larger strategic bloc, an umbrella, which was what the Fascists and Nazis were trying to provide. Similar organizations were attempted after the war by people like Mosley and Thiriart, and the project then passed to Alain de Benoist&#039;s Nouvelle Droite and its Euro-federalist ideal. <br><br>Also, many former Nazis continued to spread the ideals of a third world to the rising Arab world, effectively creating modern Arab and Islamic nationalism.

They don&#039;t care about whites, or only subsets of them do because the subsets are also being used/manipulated by the whole. Whether the whole has real goals or is just the aggregate behavior of a quasi-organism, who knows. But one thing is clear, it cannot allow for independent ethnically homogeneous states, because it can only allow for a world of loose economic zones that fundamentally are dominated by foreign finance capital, and now they are transitioning to China-style surveillance regime stuff, probably some kind of UBI + social credit + &quot;unified health passport&quot; combination system once it&#039;s fully implemented. It only allows nations like China and India to continue to manifest ethnic or religious or national solidarity because they are still weak and living in the past, they aren&#039;t really challenging the system as a whole.

It is theoretically indifferent about &quot;local&quot; solidarity, like Poland remaining BASED WHITE AND CONSERVATIVE for an extra generation or even an extra century of lagging behind the more western countries, because the net tendency of the system is overall toward homogenization and destruction of all effective identities, including European, white, Christian, etc. Already you can see that all Poland&#039;s major cities are typical progressive globalist trash. The system knows that it dominates the urban elites so nothing else matters. If Poland actually made itself into a major problem, like a few states like Italy and Hungary are sort of trying to do, it would be isolated and destroyed in a brutal and humiliating fashion like Rhodesia was. Again it doesn&#039;t even matter whether what the system is doing is intentional or it specifically hates whitey or not, it&#039;s just a fact that the system will tend toward destroying all EFFECTIVE whiteness over time, just like it will eventually come for India and the Hindu nationalism there, and just as it has a thousand and one plans for how to break China apart and prey off the ensuing warlords and civil wars. It isn&#039;t sure of winning every battle but it knows how to win the war. <br><br>How do you react to this? There is no way except to fight it equally globally, in an equally totalizing fashion. You have to not only create white nationalism in one nation but spread the ethnostate model to an alliance of nations that have a common enemy in globalism.

You don&#039;t have to do this in a vacuum, because obviously huge crises are looming on the horizon. The question is whether those crises will be &quot;met&quot; by a divided Europe that still delusionally thinks it&#039;s living in a permanent 1990s (watch the documentary Hypernormalization by Adam Curtis if you can), or whether, when those crises begin to set in and the world starts to feel like it did around 1910 or 1935 again, there will be a general consensus in Europe that a powerful and united Europe is the only way to overcome the challenges, and this will inevitably also mean forming a united front against countries like China, which will further increase solidarity if we&#039;re lucky.", "time": 1674287590, "resto": 21550025}, {"no": 21552927, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)02:54:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21552926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21552926</a><br>Basically, you have to re-do what the fascists were trying to do, but do it successfully this time. All the other blocs are already trying to do this: Dugin is just applying all the ideas I have mentioned here to Russia. China is doing the same. They are waiting for the Anglo-American system to have moments of weakness and hoping they can make very lucky rolls of the dice, theoretically possible but longshots, but still better to make the throw than to just give in and let finance capital rape your ass and destroy humanity. The only question facing Europe and white people is: if the world is inevitably about to be a final face-off between this Anglo-American bloc, China, Russia, and whatever other blocs try to cobble together some form of resistance (maybe India), do we want to be a passive party in all this, effectively absorbed into one or other of the victorious blocs or destroyed when their fighting just ends the world? Or do I want to be one of the blocs, fighting to impose my own victory conditions on things? <br><br>No matter what, someone has to win the conflict, unless we all lose because everybody dies. What this means is that to fight at all means to fight 100%, globally. You either fight a global total war and aim at becoming the global hegemon or you accept that someone else will. What this means is that white European civilization only has two options: accept either death or slavery to some other bloc, OR accept that victory means a reunified and powerful European empire that also dominates the world to some degree, the same way the Anglo-American system does currently. That doesn&#039;t mean enslaving the world, it just means imposing the same kinds of control conditions on it that the USA already imposes, for example by not allowing nations to nuke each other because everybody simply knows that the USA and its vassals would &quot;intervene&quot; to &quot;restore order.&quot; <br><br>Because Europeans innately believe in rule of law and pluralism, and because alliances are more useful than slavery, this would probably mean an alliance structure with other blocs like India, ideally Russia, and other things like a Monroe doctrine forbidding China from economic activity in Africa, for example. China would be very useful as a common enemy for a good while. But the main goal is first to dismantle the Anglo-American system that is poisoning the west from within by making it think it&#039;s awake while it&#039;s really in a coma and being picked apart by a million enemies. <br><br>To maintain perspective, just keep reminding yourself that this is what the World Wars were really about.

The general population mostly had to know only the application of the ideology so weren&#039;t educated as much in the full background. So writing was largely left to the SS or high up party members which of course was a far smaller group who then made mostly short books or articles. So as far as I&#039;m aware there is not one grand overarching book covering the whole ideology. Also very few books the SS made are translated. Their economic policy also was not fully developed but if you want some from that period the 3 main books of gottfried feder are pretty close to Hitlers views. Italian Fascism actually has the same problem which is why some historians viewed it as having no clear ideology or it just being irrational, they just didn&#039;t write that much of it down. Shame National Socialism doesn&#039;t have someone who can make sense of it like A.J. Gregor did for Fascism. With the BUF it&#039;s the exact opposite. Mosley was nothing that special and of course completely failed in the end but simply by writing so many books he is still known and celebrated by some.

Other anons have addressed you from an intellectual standpoint but I would also say that there must be a movement of the heart. And I don&#039;t mean that in a New Age effeminate way. What I mean is that Christ is also experiential and that if we only approach the matter from a rational perspective we can harden our capacity to accept anything. That goes for any other philosophy or ideology. Likewise, when we are too reliant upon our emotions, we get swept away with any wind that comes across our path. Ideally, there needs to be a movement in both because both faculties are to operate in symphony. Discussions about the heart are extensive in both Christ and the writings of His saints. <br><br>Above all else, pray that He may reveal Himself to you in some way that you understand. And pray for a supple heart to be able to accept this revelation in a humble way. I know it sounds ridiculous and I know that when someone first starts praying if feels mechanical and silly. But if you take one step towards God, He will take a hundred towards you. His love for you is beyond measure. Also, maybe visit a church near you and talk to the priest there and maybe also attend a service. I&#039;d personally say to attend an Eastern Orthodox church if you can.

Is this attempt at establishing a causal relationship correct? Maybe, but what I am sure of is that these cultures that Urwin studies certainly had a variety of different social, economic, and cultural factors other than sexual restraint that made them decay. These societies experimented war, economic downturns, leadership problems and other issues. These societies were not brought down solely because of sexual restraint, although this factor is very influential. <br><br>That being said the book establishes a correlation of past cultures and societies before the industrial revolution. The past 200 years have changed the entire landscape of the productive and social relations in human societies, which means the such relations, although important, are not neccesarily irrevocable as Urwin says. We can certainly try to better the social conditions which have brought the modern societal decay(extreme economic inequality, lack of social trust, alienation, shitty goverment structures). <br><br>We must look forward to the future brothers, and struggle and fight for a better one, even in a decaying society.

Modernist novels were all about diving INTO the subjectivity of the protagonist, ironically in a format derived from Emma. The kind of objectivity they practiced is at odds with this aim; take, for example, the scene in which Emma convinces Harriet Smith to reject Robert Martin&#039;s proposal. Much of the content of this passage consists of Emma&#039;s observations of Harriet&#039;s internal state, of a sequence of emotional and logical reactions which illustrate Harriet&#039;s internal conflict. Emma remains constant in terms of her inner journey through the sequence\u2013 the only relevant outcome of the scene is whether Harriet follows Emma&#039;s advice, or not, and to what extent Emma is culpable for the refusal. However, detail (filtered through Emma&#039;s perspective, unlike other works of Austen and Shakespeare) regarding Harriet&#039;s inner journey is lavished upon the reader, and a clear arc which bears a causal relation to Emma&#039;s, but does not CONTEXTUALIZE Emma&#039;s, is illustrated.

Mercutio curses both houses of Montague and Capulet because of &quot;who he is&quot;; he is not reacting to Romeo&#039;s inner conflict, condemning or approving Romeo&#039;s decisions, but is instead reacting to Romeo&#039;s actions, which (from Mercutio&#039;s point of view, ignorant of Romeo and Juliet&#039;s entanglement) are that of a blood enemy of the Capulets.<br>In thematic terms, his death speech is a non-sequitur; Romeo has ALREADY made the resolution which would dissolve the conflict between the two families, whether in death or in marriage. Mercutio&#039;s condemnation of the houses serves to illustrate Mercutio&#039;s convictions and journey, NOT the central conflict of the play. This violates the storytelling economy which dominates subjectivity oriented literature.<br>Similarly, Austen&#039;s Mr Knightly comes to his resolution regarding his feelings for Emma not as a result of Emma&#039;s internal changes, but coincidentally alongside them, due to the material shifts of circumstance the events of the novel engineered between them. He realizes that he has always loved Emma, not that Emma has grown to be worthy of his love.", "time": 1674335137, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555066, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)16:07:12", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555019</a><br>A failed experiment hiding behind the greatest work of linguistic virtuosity ever conceived.", "time": 1674335232, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555108, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)16:17:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21554963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21554963</a><br>Joyce????", "time": 1674335869, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555115, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)16:19:22", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555108</a><br>Subjective psychological realism, see<br><a href=\"#p21555003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555003</a>", "time": 1674335962, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555149, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)16:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Jane Austen looks like she was a babe from that portrayal of her", "time": 1674336486, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555257, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)16:49:33", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555149</a><br>Yeah, I&#039;d bang <s>read:worship</s> her", "time": 1674337773, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555604, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:04:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21554963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21554963</a><br>I get what you&#039;re saying (I think) that these characters in Shakespeare/Austen exist as wholly their own, not just vessels to further the main character/author&#039;s worldview. <br><br>I&#039;m confused on what you mean by &quot;polemicize about whatever societal condition they feel oppressed by&quot;, are you saying the side characters are reduced to think pieces of the author&#039;s subjective opinion separate of what could be a more accurate representation of these individual entity&#039;s thoughts and feelings? <br><br>also, I&#039;m interested in your comprehension of side characters being wholly themselves, at least in a way that severs their connection to the main character (and the author somewhat) entirely. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weave conflict out of reality, rather than depicting reality to contextualize conflict.</span><br>this is a very interesting way to look at it. suppose there truly is that distinction to be made, how can you tell when a conflict is coming from an organic reality as opposed to the scenes, scenarios, and entire lives of those characters being subservient to a previously conjured conflict had in mind?<br><br>wish we had more of these discussions on here, genuinely a fascinating topic to bring up OP", "time": 1674342267, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21555609, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:05:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555003</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everything in Joyce is so filtered through the protagonist that events themselves are bent into allegorical significance,</span><br>Real people are actually like this too, if we&#039;re honest.<br>It&#039;s annoying, but it&#039;s accurate.", "time": 1674342356, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21556027, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)19:42:22", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555604</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reduced to think pieces</span><br>Yeah, I&#039;d say that&#039;s accurate. Certain genres of literature are aimed at provoking a change in society, rather than introspection in individual readers. It&#039;s not a terrible thing, A Farewell to Arms and The Great Gatsby do this in part. But characters become cyphers for social classes when this is the priority. Their behavior is generally dramatized and they subject themselves to a lower degree of scrutiny than a real person would.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how can you tell when a conflict is coming from an organic reality</span><br>I look for characters&#039; actions being motivated by their own flawed understanding of events rather than by an accurate assessment of the protagonists views or actions. Misunderstandings are a key part of Shakespeare and Austen, and I think that&#039;s both a generic convention and a product of the realism of their characters.<br>I also look for characters undergoing arcs which are independent from the protagonists, not in timing or in circumstance, but in the connection between the smaller arc and the larger one being tenuous enough that the smaller doesn&#039;t seem to be designed to reflect on the larger one.<br>Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax&#039;s story, for instance, is essential to Emma&#039;s own growth in terms of cause and effect, but is constructed out of thematic material that don&#039;t bear a very direct relation to that growth. They&#039;re essentially the protagonists of a separate, much more melodramatic story, one which the audience is told of in its entirety but not shown. It reminds me of the Shakespearean side characters who tell basically their whole ethos in the course of delivering a comedy scene. The commonality is that their psychological existence serves plot, moreso than theme. Because they think a certain way, they do certain things, and it&#039;s their actions rather than their thoughts which weigh on the central conflict.", "time": 1674348142, "resto": 21554963}, {"no": 21556137, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:10:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21554997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21554997</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we as a civilization just haven&#039;t caught up to the Wake yet</span><br>Cringe, we as a civilization haven&#039;t caught up with our runaway global warming.
