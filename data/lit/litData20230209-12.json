Perceived freedom is where you are bound to the laws, rules, and obligations of society but you are free to buy a house, start a family, drive a car etc providing that you meet the requirements to actually do so, that being have an income, have a good credit score, have the means to support and provide for the family, have a license and so on and so forth.

To put it simply, the ABSOLUTE left is that of absolute nihilism, subjectivity, egoism, and hedonism, and the ABSOLUTE right is that of a supernatural yet objective reality grounded by a higher principle, metaphysical truth, or higher power(s). An even more simple definition is simply this: Truth and relativity.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hierarchy.</span><br>One distinguishing feature of The Right is belief in an absolute power; power that does not radiate \u2018from below,\u2019 but which originates from above. This inevitably manifests itself as support for an absolute monarch (not beholden to the people), an objective hierarch that serves his own interests or that of the State (as a power greater than the simple desires of the people), or a form of theocracy (power from a god, God, or metaphysical Truth).<br>An argument against this might be that leftists have supported autocratic leaders in the past and continue, in some fashion or other, to support them. For example, Stalin was an indisputable leader of &quot;leftism&quot; yet an autocrat nonetheless. This discrepancy is fairly easy to explain; his power was justified not by a higher power (or by himself alone), but by his being a figurehead of the will of the proletariat. This is an emanation of power \u2018from below.&#039; His power was simply a representation of the base desires of the people, NOT that of a principle or of someone or something that is an OBJECTIVE HIERARCH.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truth</span><br>Another distinguishing feature of The Right is objectivity. The idea of reality, Truth, and Telos being OBJECTIVE in nature and not in any way relative to human beings. Leftism is diametrically opposed; there is not &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;reality&quot;, there is no &quot;fundamental purpose.&quot; A leftist MAY believe that there is an &quot;objective reality,&quot; but that this reality is ultimately indeterminable, unknown, uncertain, or even unimportant. In this regard, Protagoras sums up leftism: &quot;Man is the measure of all things.&quot;<br><br>Now for schizo-time: History is the proverbial Fall from the Garden of Eden. On the Right, Man governed by the most absolute of hierarchy, life at one with natural principles and truth and without &quot;philosophical mist&quot; over his eyes; everything is as it appears, and he lives out his telos with exactitude. On the Left, Man is purposeless, reality is in flux or unreal, truth is subjective, he cannot trust his own eyes. While it is unlikely for any specific movement to be &quot;purely&quot; right- or left-leaning, every political movement throughout history has had more or less of these qualities. The general trend is that of sprint towards the left, with minor &quot;re-adjustments&quot; back towards the Right. The Middle-Ages following the staunchly left-leaning Late Roman Empire is an example of a readjustment towards the Right.", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 1864, "h": 598, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 40, "tim": 1675662724221142, "time": 1675662724, "md5": "F2RkCEmnZ4pFClGR5z9QvA==", "fsize": 100161, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621902, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:53:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Damn, I used the draft image.", "time": 1675662800, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621909, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Another example of readjustment towards the objective Right is that of Classical Athens; Socrates and Plato were &quot;rightists&quot; steering the increasingly egalitarian and hedonistic Athenian society towards &quot;The Right.&quot;", "time": 1675662974, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621914, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:58:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621269</a><br>I recognize your shitty writing from other threads on this board.

are inherently mean, bc &#039;&#039;money &amp; absolute power corrupt absolutely&#039;&#039; and rich people become selfish forever. It&#039;s impossible to stop being selfish alone, this is why all atheists want bureaucrats to make rich people poorer.<br><br>so you have the atheist dilemma: the atheist want to coom, they need money for this and they say money will make people happy. but once people have money they coom alone instead of making other people coom. Atheists also need a whole intellectual apparatus to feel mentally safe about their way of life.<br><br>This is because atheists and women have no morality beyond hedonism, but still have the deep desire to see themselves and being told that they are virtuous. However, hedonists know that they are subhumans, and since nobody tell atheists that they are righteous, they are addicted to self-made stories where they self insert and are righteous, ie &#039;&#039;because they say so&#039;&#039; lol.<br><br>Don&#039;t forget that atheists and women are natural born schizophrenic so they dont have any critical thinking in their lizard brain.

They did an experiment about this- they showed a picture of the characters from Sesame Street to a bunch of children, in which Elmo was eating cookies. They asked them &quot;who is eating cookies&quot; and all the kids pointed to Elmo. But then they asked them &quot;who be eating cookies&quot; and the white kids mostly pointed to Elmo again but the black kids mostly pointed to Cookie Monster. It&#039;s probably ultimately of Hiberno-English origin.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he good</span><br>Yes, AAVE habitually drops copulas- as do such respectable languages as Russian, Classical Arabic, and Hebrew.

We played in abandoned working mens and respectable working mens clubs, in pubs where wharfies and steel workers and merchant shippers no longer drank; and had only a programme of automated mechanisation as revolution.

I didn&#039;t realize he had such a fascinating life story. It&#039;s no wonder he grew into such a troubled, clear minded person. There&#039;s one part where the boy sticks his finger into the mouth of Japanese fighter pilot&#039;s corpse in a field and the boy describes how he resurrects him from the dead. We also get treated to a couple very unsettling characters who the boy forms weird bonds with. There&#039;s a lot of very clinical, detached descriptions of disgusting realities of war like a sailor being pulled from the mud by a man holding a &quot;yellow glove&quot; that turns out to be the skin of the sailor&#039;s hand boiled off in an oil fire, and when the man realizes it&#039;s his hand skin he just tosses it aside. I&#039;m not doing any of this justice by the way. There&#039;s a huge chunk of the book where it gets really dark and bleak as the reality of Japanese prison camps, starvation, and isolation sets in too.

I want to read more Ballard but I&#039;ve never gotten around to it, partially because I&#039;m afraid his writings will haunt my head the way some of the things in Crash did. He has this weird way of writing about almost like...liminal spaces or something, I don&#039;t know; like the deserted office parks built in the 80s that are strangely affecting and you don&#039;t know why. There&#039;s something sad and missing. There&#039;s something very psychological and strange and somehow nostalgic in it, like the whole &quot;the cancellation of the future&quot; thing. Then alongside, underneath, and tied into this liminal spaces aspect Ballard goes into the human detachment and spiritual death of techno-modernity, then there is the experimentation with living things and playing with the human body and its possibilities in very unsettling ways. Very early in Crash, for example, there&#039;s talk of automobile parts penetrating into wombs and penises spurting semen across dashboards as the drivers are mutilated and changed by the car accident. He writes about the protagonist analyzing the pool of vomit that came out of his wife&#039;s stomach after a car accident and the clots of blood and his cum floating in it.

I don&#039;t really understand the Hegelian or ontological or Zen stuff you mentioned but damn. That&#039;s fucking dark. Especially so because I think I know exactly what you mean about the Asian worldview.

But I think my appreciation and envy has always been surface level, because I think I&#039;m slowly realizing that the &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;just go with the flow shit&quot;, the collectivism, absurdism, and bright colors of Asia/the East really come down to what you said, the knowledge that reality is at its core a liquid void without face or shape or name or reason for being anything at all, and the Asians do not cope with this, they immerse themselves in it and swim in it. They rightly recognize that none of them has a self, that as Ballard says in Empire of the Sun &quot;they are born knowing they are already dead&quot;. They recognize that the fleeting joys and strange coincidences of life are the most important thing because anything else is a lie or a trick. I think for a long time I always assumed Westerners were born Materialists, but I think with age, experience, and education, I am learning that Easterners are truly the Materialists and the West is Idealist through and through, even the Anglos.

In general, leave &quot;Literature,&quot; the thing called &quot;Literature&quot; at present, to run through its rapid fermentations (how more and more rapid they are in these years!), and to fluff itself off into Nothing, in its own way, like a poor bottle of soda-water with the cork sprung; it won&#039;t be long. In our time it has become all the rage; highest noblemen and dignitaries courting a new still higher glory there; innumerable men, women and children rushing towards it, yearly ever more. It sat painfully in Grub Street, in hungry garrets, so long; some few heroic martyrs always serving in it, among such a miscellany of semi-fatuous worthless ditto, courting the bubble reputation in worse than the cannon&#039;s mouth; in general, a very flimsy, foolish set. But that little company of martyrs has at last lifted Literature furiously or foamingly high in the world. Goes like the Iceland geysers in our time, like uncorked soda-water; and will, as I said, soon have done. Only wait: in fifty years, I should guess, all really serious souls will have quitted that mad province, left it to the roaring populaces; and for any Noble-man or useful person it will be a credit rather to declare, &quot;I never tried Literature; believe me, I have not written anything;&quot; and we of &quot; Literature&quot; by trade, we shall sink again, I perceive, to the rank of street-fiddling; no higher rank, though with endless increase of sixpences flung into the hat.

And yet of Shakspeare too, it is not the Fiction that I admire, but the Fact; to say truth, what I most of all admire are the traces he shows of a talent that could have turned the History of England into a kind of Iliad, almost perhaps into a kind of Bible. Manifest traces that way; something of epic in the cycle of hasty Fragments he has yielded us (slaving for his bread in the Bankside Theatre); and what a work wouldn&#039;t that have been! Marlborough said, He knew no English History but what he had got from Shakspeare; and truly that is still essentially the serious and sad fact for most of us; Fact thrice and four times lamentable, though Marlborough meant it lightly. Innumerable grave Books there are; but for none of us any real History of England, intelligible, profitable, or even conceivable in almost any section of it!</span><br>\u2014Thomas Carlyle, Shooting Niagara, \u00a7 VI, \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136", "filename": "carlyle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1152, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 97, "tim": 1675891887194344, "time": 1675891887, "md5": "8vxZBoLg0WjBI2bT3oUV8Q==", "fsize": 124653, "resto": 21632708}, {"no": 21632882, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)16:32:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21632771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21632771</a><br>No. If its good book the story carries a truth within that you see playing out through the characters.

You may personally be able to donate a lot more over your lifetime: assuming you donate $300 per paycheck, two paychecks per month for all twelve months of the year every year for sixty years, you will be able to give $432,000 in monetary contributions to charity over the course of your life. That&#039;s a lot of money, isn&#039;t it! But how much does it really help?<br>Roughly 1260 people are raped per day, or around one every 68 seconds.[2] The average cost of a rape, in numbers alone, is $122,461[3], and even more if we count the legal costs of the state prosecution (but let us ignore this). That means that you contribute, at least, the total cost of three rape victim&#039;s expenses (ignoring the unseen costs) to the good in the world, or 0.3% of the total monetary cost of rape per day, or again roughly 0.0007% of the cost per year in the USA alone.<br>That doesn&#039;t look like much, does it? But it is even worse than that. Every year, roughly 25,000 people are murdered, or 68 per day[4]. If we assume the average value of a human life is 6 million[5], that is 410 million dollars worth of human life lost per day, or 150 billion per year. Quite a lot, huh? Totalling the cost of rape and murder brings the contributions to charity over the course of your entire life to 0.000215% of the monetary costs of the evils of rape and murder every year in America alone. This is an incredibly optimistic number: I do not think a human life is worth merely its economic value, nor do I think the evil of rape is solely the cost of medical and mental health care afterwards. With these numbers now out of the way, it&#039;s time to address the elephant in the room: You cannot possibly hope to bring even a sliver of good into this world through charity alone.

It&#039;s not that we need to mortify our bodies so the soul can go free, it&#039;s that we need to free it from false opinions that keep it oriented downwards looking at the shadows. The body is not what leaves the cave, it is the soul and what binds it is false opinions like &#039;pleasure is the only good&#039; that need to be broken through mental/spiritual inquiry/dialectic and purification. If you&#039;re mortifying the flesh but internally moaning to yourself about what a horrible thing it is to be alive and how you can&#039;t wait for death, that&#039;s a big error imo, possibly worse than the moderate hedonist who is at least tries to be virtuous, do good for others and try&#039;s to keep in mind the Good.", "filename": "Barry-Lyndon-3-1600x900-c-default", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675593907281642, "time": 1675593907, "md5": "4Pg5qTJQIOJ2CR/QRkEbfQ==", "fsize": 160545, "resto": 21614908}, {"no": 21617497, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:04:32", "name": "Strange Love", "com": "<a href=\"#p21616738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21616738</a><br><br>What is the basic principle of &quot;life&quot; I ask here.

At all times our subconscious is there atop us like a vast patchwork castle swaying this way and that. To think that a man can spend ten years working for nine or so hours a day in some meaningless, mind-dimming, nerve deadening, depressing, often ethically contemptible job and then suddenly flick a switch and become an authentic, lively, impassioned, articulate author is to trust that this man must, by necessity, have suffered every single day during that time, while those around hum (unburdened by literary creativity and the psycho-emotional phenomena that accompanies this kind of creativity) where relatively content with their own workload etc.<br><br>I myself, to me everlasting shame, spent several years working full-time for little pay or prestige, performing the most mundane and pathetic routine tasks in an open-plan office full of very sociable, sane, enthusiastic, frankly very friendly and well-balanced people. Other ethnic groups talk of &quot;white privilege&quot; but frankly the privilege of being unburdened by a heightened degree of sensitivity (which is neither a virtue nor a vice) affords one more opportunity than the colour of one&#039;s skin etc. What I believe is the main cause for the &quot;burnout&quot; one experiences during such exertions is the constant denial of one&#039;s instincts, perhaps even one&#039;s &quot;will&quot;. In my own experience, I repeatedly insisted to myself that these instincts (e.g., to quit my job and hike across Europe, to work part-time and focus on literary activity etc) were a consequence of my naivety, &quot;entitlement&quot;, laziness, etc. So I squashed them at every opportunity, and essentially LARPed as a normal person for several hours a day then returned to my tiny rented room in a shared apartment utterly drained and demoralised. After this experience ended a couple of years ago, I felt rejuvenated and authentic, even if I had suddenly fallen down to the lower rungs of social status, romantic potential, etc. I really don&#039;t care about that kind of thing any more, although I do not discount the idea that I am mentally ill and mentally shattered.

It reminded me first of this thread and the discussion about agricultural (value of land) vs pastoralist + nomadic (value of luggage), but it also reminded me of things i&#039;ve heard about modern day Jews, about how they&#039;re a nomadic people that place no value in land and bounce around between places with relative ease. A lot of people on 4chan argue about whether modern day Jews are the spiritual successors of the Old Testament or whether the Christians are, but from the viewpoint of this thread (and the dichotomy of agriculture vs pastoral/nomadic) I&#039;d say that the nomadic Jews are the spiritual heirs of the original nomadic Hebrews. <br>They may live in dense cities, much like the original agriculturalists did, but they don&#039;t work the land and place no value in land, instead preferring jobs that are more mobile and that allow them to cut all ties to a locality and move to &quot;greener pastures&quot;.

Cain, however, offered of the fruits of the earth, it would seem by the description, with some indifference. And when God does not receive Cain&#039;s gift, God encourages Cain. Cain, however, remains bitter and envious of Abel and so conceives an abominable thing--Cain slays Abel in mockery of Abel&#039;s sacrifice, for after all, is not Abel pleasing in the Lord&#039;s sight? But in all these things, God teaches a great lesson through Cain--never be discouraged, but always hope in the Lord. For thought Cain does great evil, his greatest evil is to think that his cause is lost. His offering is rejected, and so he falls away from worship altogether and turns from a weak love to hatred. A great sin. And even after this, God tells him that he can have mercy if he bears his punishment and that God will preserve him in order to fulfill the penance and will protect him from his enemies, but Cain remains discouraged and adds sin to sin, raising up a people of sin rather than accepting God&#039;s mercy.

(perhaps not the &quot;entire&quot; Jews, but certainly the aristocratic Jews, which would have been the pastoralist conquerors, the elite)<br>We also know that the earliest Christians were more likely to be part of the underclass, slaves, servants, women, the weak: i.e. not the militaristic/pastoralist elite who had conquered much of the ancient world.

Plato said that there was a transcendent Realm of the Forms where the Form of the Tree lives, right? And Aristotle said that that&#039;s wrong, the Forms are actually what the Matter is in (we today would say that &quot;the matter is in the shape of the Form&quot;, however), meaning that Forms exist inside things. Both of these posit what is called &quot;Realism&quot;, which holds that some things are ontologically real; in this context it&#039;s what is called a &quot;universal&quot;, a discrete thing that all things of a class partake in in order to be part of that class. There are, for example, epistemological realists, which hold that there is a real world outside of our heads (in contrast to certain schools of thought which hold that we can never be sure that there is any reality beyond our senses). Thus, Plato and Aristotle were both realists in regards to the ontological status of universals.<br><br>The problem with that is that Plato and Aristotle were both polytheists, and Christians are (silliness about the Trinity aside) monotheists. Christians thus run into a number of problems if they posit an ontologically realist stance regarding universals. The most common stance, held by most Christian philosophers, then was what is called &quot;nominalism&quot;. Nominalism is the rejection of the ontological reality of universals. There is no &quot;Form of the Tree&quot;, there&#039;s just trees. The most common stance held was that we make forms in our heads based off of impressions (hence how you can draw a new tree if I tell you to &quot;draw a tree&quot;). Yahweh has a bunch of forms in his head, but they only exist IN HIS HEAD, thus meaning that they have no connection to the actual trees around you (like how a building&#039;s blueprints aren&#039;t part of it, they&#039;re something separate and are unnecessary for its continued existence).<br><br>With few exceptions, most Christian philosophers were nominalists.

Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is &quot;wrong&quot;; they can&#039;t be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains \u2014 in the brains of even the stupidest person \u2014 is as &quot;correct&quot; as what&#039;s in my mind or Nietzsche&#039;s or Baudrillard&#039;s. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the &quot;truth&quot; that&#039;s hiding inside even the dumbest person&#039;s brains. For example, when a Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, he is not wrong. It&#039;s just that the concepts he designates with the words &quot;God&quot;, &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word &quot;God&quot;, going by the Christian&#039;s definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says &quot;God&quot;, he doesn&#039;t really mean an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being&quot; (since he&#039;s so dumb he can&#039;t even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means &quot;a very powerful being&quot;. Similarly, when he says &quot;universe&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;universe&quot; (i.e. &quot;everything&quot;), he simply means &quot;the earth&quot; \u2014 or at most, if he&#039;s had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps &quot;the solar system&quot;. And finally, when he says &quot;love&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;love&quot; (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. &quot;help me&quot; (= shape me).<br>So basically, when the Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, what he&#039;s really saying, translated in our language, is &quot;A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me&quot; \u2014 which could very well be true!<br>All of this stems from Nietzsche&#039;s positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener.

So these people are superior to the base crowd-pleasers like Peterson because they at least make a concentrated attempt at grappling with the big issues, and the results are at least readable, if not exactly useful.

Once you have understood that power is more important than happiness (which latter is merely a tool of the former, and not the other way around, as it appears from the inverted perspective of sick, declining lifeforms), the next thing you need to understand is that phrases such as &quot;to seek power&quot;, &quot;to want power&quot;, &quot;to take power&quot; and the like are merely subhuman misunderstandings of how power actually works.<br>If you seek power, it simply means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore will never get it either, because power is something you give, not take).<br>If you want power, this once more means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore once more will never get it, for the exact same reason I explained in the previous parenthesis).<br>If you take power, it simply means that someone is giving it to you, and is therefore the more powerful of the two, and will remain so for as long as you are drawing your power from him instead of bestowing it on him.<br>So how does power actually work? Take an extremely simple example from the physical sphere, where the mechanics are easier to understand. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, and try to figure out how he became so physically strong. The subhuman theory of power as something to be taken would suggest that Arnold took his power from somewhere, but from where exactly? From the barbells, perhaps? In this view, barbells would be magical instruments with the capacity for bestowing power on all those who... try to lift them, I guess. But if you or I tried to lift the kinds of barbells Arnold typically lifts, we&#039;d get literally crushed. Not only would we not &quot;gain&quot; any power: we&#039;d have to be hospitalized. We could of course start from smaller weights and work our way up, the same way Arnold did: but I have bad news for you here, sonny: we&#039;d probably fail at getting to his level, or even anywhere near it, no matter how hard we tried. Far more genetically gifted individuals than us in this sphere have already tried this, after all, and failed: that&#039;s why Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times while scores of his closest competitors didn&#039;t. This means that the subhuman theory of magical power-bestowing barbells is false: if the barbells do indeed play a role in the strengthening of an individual, then at the very least this individual must be of a specific type that is CAPABLE of benefiting from their effect: he has, in other words, to be WORTHY of them, which is merely another way of saying that he has to be ALREADY STRONG.<br>QED: Power is not something you can take but something that you must give, and the only reason subhumans are adamant that it is the other way around is because they are so inherently and irremediably weak, that they don&#039;t have the slightest conception of it. <br><br>460.

Though it could be argued that the Overman is the only one who is able to manifest what he wishes, because he is the only one who truly thinks himself capable and deserving of it. If the average person tried to manifest their dreams, they might fail because subconsciously they know they aren\u2019t worth it, and since they don\u2019t want to manifest that guilt along with their dreams, they can\u2019t manifest the dream at all. Also, the belief in causality and determinism can be another hindrance, which the Overman is not susceptible to. He doesn\u2019t need to know precisely HOW he gets what he wants, the universe bends its rules for him, because he creates the universe. So these things might explain why some people are able to manifest thousands or millions of dollars while others can only manifest a free coffee. But you could also argue that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d doesn\u2019t occur at all, but that the people who are confident and believe that they can manifest are the ones who are already powerful enough to attain their goals naturally, and so they attribute their success to manifestation when it was just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Again, the subhuman doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth anything, and believes in strict laws of causality and science etc. so if he fails at manifesting then he will just blame his lack of belief \u2014 a clever way of preventing blasphemers of manifestation.

In this case the question is whether our everyday intuitions about what is possible or impossible are sensible. For example, for thousands of years people were trying their hand at the geometric problem of &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, i.e., constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straight edge. Eventually, it was proven that this was mathematically impossible. Because it&#039;s impossible, it would be pretty stupid to keep trying to do it.<br><br>On the other hand, some things seem &quot;possible&quot; but don&#039;t happen. Sticking with the example of mathematical theorems, a person might try to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem, but fail.

There were specific technical problems with trying to show how they could be incorporated into logic (in particular, modal logics were not &quot;extensional&quot;). On this basis people began to seriously doubt that there was anything meaningful about statements of possibility and impossibility, despite how intuitive they were.<br><br>Kripke revolutionized the field by introducing so called &quot;possible world semantics&quot; which overcame the technical problems identified by Quine and others.

In fact I would say having to rid oneself of resentment is just as bad as having it in the first place. The feelings which created such resentiment still exist, you have only adopted the values which you were critical of, i.e a hypocrite.<br><br>Now what is resentment? Often it is confused as simply rationalizing one&#039;s feelings of inferiority by condemning an external object for the subject&#039;s impotence. But one component is missing in this simple categorization of resentiment. That is &#039;envy&#039;. Why is envy essential for resentiment? It is because in order to feel quantitively inferior, one most also value the same measure of the external object which is being blamed for the inferiority. For example, the individual resentful of wealth values poverty over money, he still values money however he values the inverse of wealth &#039;poverty is good&#039; , &#039;wealth is bad.<br><br>Now you are saying that you have grown out of anti-Semitism by ridding yourself of resentiment. That is, not only have you never opposed Jewish values, but that you were envious of them and adopted them yourself! This only means that you were a Jew yourself, and your resentiment was simply self hatred at your ineptitude at being a Jew. <br><br>It is spiritual Jews like yourself, and that Jew Walter Kaufman who accused the NSDAP of resentiment towards both monopoly capitalism, and of course the Jewish race. That is, in your Jewishness you extoll money to be an objective value, and that one can be a master and value it, or a slave who resents it.<br><br>But this is of course far from the truth, now when I speak of the values of the NSDAP I speak of it not in individuals, not even in it&#039;s programs, but in it&#039;s form. I can best summarize it in this quote from Hitler:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]we do not say to the rich people &quot;Please, give something to the poor.&quot; Instead we say &quot;German people, help yourself!&quot; Everyone must help, whether you are rich or poor. Everyone must have the belief that there&#039;s always someone in a much worse situation than I am, and this person I want to help as a comrade. If one should say, &quot;Yes, but do I have to sacrifice a lot?&quot; That is the glory of giving! When you sacrifice for your community, then you can walk with your head held up high.</span><br><br>Of course the Jew, in his self interest cannot see this. For the Jew, the spiritual Jew is only interested in himself. The concept of SACRIFICE is alien to them. For they are only interested in advancing themselves, in a community they are of course alien to, and do not belong.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now I don\u2019t really stress about these things</span><br>You have comfort!

He ran off with his tail between his legs and his eyes were streaked with tears of rage.<br><br>Suddenly the sky cracked open and a thousand Dexters from Dexter&#039;s Lab rained down on his position. To him, they represented all of his fears and dreams. They stormed him as a silver cigar shaped space ship followed behind the dexters in the hole on the sky. <br><br>The sky closed shut and the silver cigar ship transformed into a giant bipedal mechanicus. Its arms extended from the windows, four on each side. It held a spear sixty feet tall, and the mechanicus stood but 20 feet below it. The body looked like the shaft of the cigar, and two small retractable legs pushed from the vertical exterior. The engine bay opened, and a small head shaped like a leaf raised to the top. <br><br>The Rake&#039;s Reckoning is now here. Wind swept over the leafy battlefield, yet it was quiet. The calm before the storm. The Silver Cigar Mechanicus stands into a battle pose and pushes a button with 4 of his hands wielding the speer. The tip of the spear turns into a rake. The Mechanicus begins to rake the leaves on the battlefield, like a cannibal. <br><br>Off in the distance, a loud neigh would pierce the ears of anything present on the battlefield. Even the sentient leaves. Arriving from the south was a large man sitting on a small horse. The man had an ugly smirk on his face, with blonde hair, brown eyes, and missing or rotting teeth. His hat had corks hanging all around it. In his right hand was a large fence post covered in feces. <br><br>&quot;G&#039;day, mate!&quot; the man roared as he rode to the Leaf Sweeper Mechanicus Mk II. Without hesitation, he struck the legs of the Leaf Sweeper with his post, and knocked it down to a new level. The Dexters realize their leader is in peril, and swarm the man on horseback.

That is resulting in your feeling the problems that your characters are living.<br><br>You might consider taking a bit of time off from that portion of the novel, just to see if your mind can come down from the fatigue summit that you have climbed. <br>As an amateur myself, I can relate to some of these issues, and I would say that you must finish the project! Do not abandon it, my guy. <br>Pinpoint those parts of the novel that cause teh most stress and work through them at a slower pace, or put them aside and work on other chapters or plot points.

I intentionally try to go outside of my own experience and write about others, but usually find that this ironically leads to discovering far more intense and meaningful material. The traumas depicted aren&#039;t mine, but do trigger an intense response from me. Also skeptical of psychology, it&#039;s hard to say whether this is something repressed or deep within my psyche. <br>In this case, the art is mostly done in the first person and emphasizes senses of space, depth, and subtle intensity within others&#039; expressions. The images also crawl around backgrounds and focus on mundane details. These emphases are extremely relatable for me, but I try to approach this theme differently from various perspectives in a way that forces me to look at it differently, too.<br>The mentally ill perspective opens room for a lot of experimentation with abstract images approached this way, too.

If we all acting in ways that would benefit us in the long term while sacrificing short term gratification, the word &quot;hangover&quot; would never exist.<br><br>The very reason many of us write is -because- it is hard. Life is easy if you simply comply and do your 9-5 job and never wallow in self-pity or take a moment for introspection and analyze what your life-suit is doing in the overall scheme of things. If you don&#039;t sit back and take a moment to digest where you are and what you&#039;re doing, life can fly by and you can wake up at 50 years old alone, without kids, without any legacy. Think of how many people by 2040 will have had no kids, no body of work, no nothing to point at and say &quot;I did this&quot; outside of an excel spreadsheet or a job they hated but tolerated because it put a roof over their heads and food on their plate, all while their tax dollars funded the very shit that they hate but never had the balls to speak up against.<br><br>If you simply follow along with what you&#039;re supposed to do and how you&#039;re supposed to be an adult, chances are, you&#039;ll have a decent life and be able to experience most things that people work towards. A career, a place to live, a community, (maybe a family), a sense of belonging. However, in this wild and turbulent world we live in, more and more of us want to create some inertia from our lives, some pragmatic direction in life that might not make sense to others, but once you have your mind set on a destination, writers cannot help themselves and will sacrifice to reach that end. We see it time and time again over the history of writers, mad men(and women, no they/thems)who have pushed the boundaries of common sense to finish a manuscript without any guarantee that a single soul will read it.<br><br>You have to think of writing in a similar vein to mountaineering. What motivated green boots to climb Everest? What do you think went through his mind in his last moments, freezing to death in that shallow cave?

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible. And unlike anti-natalism, there are strong sociological and technical grounds to predict that the application of biotechnology will wipe out the substrates of suffering for good.</span>", "filename": "The Hedonistic Imperative - David Pearce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 279, "h": 445, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675759844213973, "time": 1675759844, "md5": "GU7wbhImRIt8qsWCkouz9g==", "fsize": 10616, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626937, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no meaningful arguments against antinatalism</span><br>If you accept utilitarianism.

One, that the Asymmetry argument for antinatalism fails.

One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller.

You put in the work and you are the one to make it happen for yourself.

It\u2019s all over the psalms, it\u2019s all over the gospels, Paul gets it. Way back in the pentateuch God lays it down and tells Moses that He chose the Hebrews because they are exceptional, they are exceptionally shit and He wants it to be completely obvious that He is the one who makes it all happen. Gideon is about that. <br>In John, early on, there is a statement about how we are invited to be children of God. And when asked how to pray, Jesus directly instructs us to start with \u201cOur Father.\u201d That\u2019s some heavy shit. <br>For a while I felt like I didn\u2019t really know Jesus. Like, I had read all these books, I prayed, I meditated, I had insights, I improved myself, things were coming together for me. But I felt like there was this blank spot right in the middle. And I knew that it was THE most important thing. I got into the Sacred Heart chaplet. The Sorrowful mysteries are also very important. The Agony is pretty profound. Julian of Norwich helped unravel the Scourging for me. <br>There are variations on how to pray the Sacred Heart chaplet, one way just recycles Rosary prayers. Another fixates on Christ\u2019s love, meekness and humility\u2014this is the good one. <br>I was awake in the middle of one night and in the chamber of my heart He was there. I called Him Master, but He told me to call Him Brother. We embraced and I could feel His love, it\u2019s incomparable.

Definitely true what you say about obligations.

Really, what I was asking regarding your theophanic experience is more along the line of its phenomenal nature, what brought it on, what symbolic knowledge you managed to grasp from it if any, etc. I realise now that that might have been far too personal a question upon reading your posts. It&#039;s interesting how your approach to these things is different to mine because any revelation I&#039;ve ever had has been from a perspective of self-induced &quot;Jnana Yoga,&quot; through learning and contemplation rather than prayer. I actually consider prayer a great talent. Really, most people, myself included, lack affinity for the meaningful type of communion you&#039;re describing because it requires a certain &quot;letting go&quot; of the ego, that if one is skilled at, then they&#039;re already most of the way there to being a good and whole person.<br>Reading your posts, I&#039;m curious what you think about Gurdjieff if you&#039;re familiar with him at all?<br>Apologies if this post is a bit all over the place, and happy birthday btw.", "filename": "a cool guy", "ext": ".png", "w": 953, "h": 702, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1675923840765754, "time": 1675923840, "md5": "varg1lpktXbw1ByR94f0OA==", "fsize": 1445487, "resto": 21627155}, {"no": 21634707, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)01:31:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Death isn&#039;t really scary to me.

The main value is assurances and these are invaluable when you are in a state of desolation. <br>Yeah it\u2019s personal but fortunately this is an anonymous forum so\u2026<br>You can find a pdf of Three Pure Land Sutras. The middle one is a series of visualization exercises. It is VERY much in the vein of western occult non-emptying directed meditation. It provides a systematic way to work on getting a view of the Pure Land to the west. If you see it, then you have assurances that it is real and that you can go there and get out of this rat trap. It is an intermediate step on the way to \u201cwinning\u201d by dropping out of karmic entanglement that perpetuates being. The Samantabadhra sutra at the end of the Lotus Sutra (which I have a sweet spot for) is similarly a set of visualization exercises if you know to read it that way. I mainly practiced samatha backed by pali suttas but read that mahayana stuff on the side in addition to a bunch of western occult stuff so was able to put two and two together and practice on my own. <br>With the group I practiced with, I learned about brahmavihara meditations and how to couple them with jhanas. You can access the first three immaterial jhanas this way. Outside of this practice, I was half samatha-meditating on the jhana of infinite space but half directed-meditating of infinitude and the infinity of one universe and the possibility of having another infinite universe next to it and so on. In a vision I saw a corner of the Throne, jewel encrusted, where each shining gem was a single universe. So God the Father has these transcendent qualities\u2026 He is outside all the universes, they serve to glorify Him, He is truly \u201cOur Father who art in Heaven.\u201d<br>They are assurances. They tell you that these paths are true and valid and that you are on the right track. That\u2019s the real value.

Too bad it doesn&#039;t help because everybody is still showing disrespect to you and sexualizing your humiliation while you&#039;re supposed to do a lecture, so it&#039;s pointless to continue.

You just automatically exclude certain undesirables out of your conception of humanity altogether, or imbue them with magical properties somehow visible on their face, when in reality, what determines everything is bone and fat distribution, or matter. You can observe many people talking complete tiresome bullshit yet diverse results with regards to popularity: so what explains it? That&#039;s when you notice the facial structures, the body shapes, the scents and the importance of the first second impression which is used to interpret everything after that. That is the real measure stick. There&#039;s no content to what people say, there is only matter. We react to each other&#039;s bone structures and fat distributions. And things like musculature, depth of one&#039;s voice etc. anything that determines the first second reaction. <br><br>This should not be shocking to a leftist materialist, but for some reason this keeps eluding them: of course these reasons are simply status quo-related.

From the day he came into this world, it was clear to all who lay eyes upon him that he was the ugliest lad that ever lived. His skin was rough and scaly like a barnacle on the side of a ship, hence the name Barnacle.<br>In the small village where Barnacle lived, all the villagers shuddered at the sight of him. No one would dare play with him, no one would speak to him, and the poor lad was left all alone. But Barnacle was a jovial sort, and he took it all in stride. He would go about his day, singing and whistling, a smile upon his face.<br>One day, the villagers were beset by a great monster that terrorized the land. They all cowered in fear, for no one had ever been able to defeat the beast. But Barnacle, with his ugliness, had a plan. He approached the beast, and with a great grin, he let out a loud, belly-splitting laugh.<br>To the villagers&#039; surprise, the monster began to shrink away from Barnacle, for the monster had never seen such an ugly sight in all his life. With each peal of laughter from Barnacle, the monster grew smaller and smaller until it was but a tiny creature that scurried away into the shadows.<br>The villagers were overjoyed, and they hailed Barnacle as their hero. They threw a great feast in his honor and danced and sang all night long. But in their joy and revelry, they forgot one important thing: the monster was not dead, only scared away.<br>As the festivities drew to a close, the monster returned, seeking revenge upon the ugly boy who had mocked him. With a roar, the monster charged into the village, and the villagers all fled in terror.

Massa damnata makes more logical sense than universalism otherwise why create a world with any pain or suffering unless to separate one&#039;s self from it as offer it as a taste for what is even worse in store.

How can one ensure their child does not sin? This is a difficult task and even worse the consideration of all their progeny which if they have 3 children each after ten generations will number over 80,000.

There is no indication from either the Hebrew scriptures or the New Testament that God&#039;s infinite nature entails that all offenses against him are also infinite. It generally seems to imply the opposite; for example, how exactly could Isaiah say that Israel had received &quot;double&quot; for all her sins when the debt incurred by any singular sin is infinite? If the proper response from God to any sin is to immediately inflict endless torture on the offender, why does Jesus tell us in the Gospels that the way to be like God is to forgive your enemies and be kind to the good and bad alike? If this theory of retribution were true, wouldn&#039;t he have said, &quot;And if a man slaps you on the cheek, immediately slap him back with the exact same amount of force?&quot;<br><br>Moreover, we must consider the concept of &quot;mens rea&quot;. Mens rea defines the level of intention, lucidity, and available knowledge that a person has, and which will influence the level of culpability that they are judged to have had in their offense. A sin of &quot;infinite malice&quot; must necessarily entail perfect knowledge of the offense and perfect knowledge of its infinite-ness. But of course, therein lies the rub: we are finite. And not only finite; we are created, contingent. A major point of St. Thomas&#039;s metaphysics, along with many other veritable theologians, is that God is ultimately unknowable in his very essence. &quot;We cannot know what God is,&quot; Aquinas famously states, &quot;only what he is not.&quot; This isn&#039;t limited to humans, either - even Lucifer does not actually know WHAT God is. This clearly implies that it is completely impossible for any created being to have the perfect knowledge necessary to be fully and infinitely culpable for an offense of this nature. The only being with full knowledge of God is God; but God, by his very nature, can&#039;t sin! Therefore on closer analysis it turns out to be metaphysically impossible to commit an infinite sin at all.<br><br>Another problem: God is not our peer in an ontological sense. When we judge human offenders, regardless of their status, we judge them as beings of the same finitude and existential type as us, as human beings. But God is transcendent. God is not one agent among many, who stands side by side with any of his own creations. He has ALL the power - impervious to harm or obstruction in any way by the creations whose existences are wholly dependent on him. There is nothing that any of us can do that would affect God in any way. A microbe can do more to us than we can do to God. If our sins have any effect, it must surely be on ourselves and not God.<br><br>I could keep going but unfortunately I&#039;m running out of characters.
