His works were written most closely to what I felt like someone sitting around telling people a story. My favorite HCA stories are maybe the ones about inanimate objects thinking and having personalities or his fantastical ones. His fairy tales which were more grounded and about regular people were ok but not quite the same. The Brothers Grimm are still solid however. <br>I also liked Aesop a surprising amount more than I expected since his stories are all extremely short and mostly no more than a page. The brevity which he uses to convey a scenario, players, incident and moral was very well done. So for the classic advice of start with the Greeks, for fairy tales you can&#039;t go wrong with Aesop.<br>The book I am going through now is called Four and Twenty Tales: Selected from Those of Perrault and Other Popular Writers. I recommend it because it has many fairy tale writers that don&#039;t get as much name recognition, like Madame de Villeneuve who wrote Beauty and the Beast plus others like Countess de Murat and Mademoiselle de la Force.<br>Be careful which books for Grimm you get because I noticed there is a fair bit of censorship and editing some people like to do. For example do not read the copy that Project Gutenberg offers. One quick way to tell at a glance if the collection has been changed to be more palatable to modern sensibilities is to check for one particular story. The original story called sometimes The Jew in the Bush or The Jew Among Thorns will be changed to The Miser in the Bush. If you see The Miser in the Bush.<br>Overall, I enjoyed the fairy tale reading. I got good glimpses into people&#039;s culture and lives with stories the people told themselves; plus the moral messages and values from them; and of course the works and stories that lots of modern culture builds on and uses in their older forms and not modern movie interpretations.", "time": 1671328430, "resto": 21387856}, {"no": 21398703, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:18:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398215</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hot takes on &quot;Three Japanese Buddhist Monks&quot; and &quot;The Heart of the Buddha&#039;s Teaching&quot;?</span><br>&quot;The Heart of the Buddha&#039;s Teaching&quot; seemed like a pretty straight intro to basic Buddhist concepts with a minimum of jargon, with a few anecdotes from Thich Nhat Hanh&#039;s life. &quot;Three Japanese Buddhist Monks&quot; was more hit-and-miss for me.

Nietzsche was so influenced by Dostoevsky I think it is entirely possible Crime and Punishment is what made him rush to intervene in the horse beating, since there is a very powerful dream/memory sequence (and as I said when Dostoevsky wants to put not just uncanny and intensely surreal material in, he uses dreams and hallucinations) in Crime and Punishment about a poor horse being brutally beaten to death again and against until she finally dies. It expresses just how uncanny it is to come to the realization that people have this close bond with an animal that is considered majestic and noble but beating the animal with a whip is fundamental to that animals existence, this weird contrast functions as a metaphor for so many things, the idea of maximum dignity in one sense and maximum pain and humiliation not only incidental but taken as mundane and part of the package", "time": 1671363739, "resto": 21397450}, {"no": 21399997, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:12:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397450</a><br>Have you read him in the original Russian?", "time": 1671365525, "resto": 21397450}, {"no": 21400023, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)07:27:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399997</a><br>No, (neither did Kafka or Nietzsche), rather what prompted this thread was the remarkable similarity between the literalist P&amp;V of translation of Dostoevsky and the new literalist Schocken translation of Kafka.

If you could keep only one, it would be TP.<br><br>\u2014 The project as a whole is a lot more successful than I expected. (That serves me right for having any faith in critics &amp; advance readers. They&#039;re all idiots.) CM did a fine job of making a novel (two novels) out of basically un-novelish material.<br><br>\u2014 Cohen is slightly annoying because he isn&#039;t sharp enough. I understood at least half the things Alicia said that he didn&#039;t. (Maybe that was Cormac&#039;s intention \u2014 make Alicia more intelligent than the reader, and Cohen less so. It worked for Arthur Conan Doyle.)<br><br>\u2014 Alicia is likeable. Her worst habit is constantly saying &quot;I know&quot; when Cohen says &quot;I don&#039;t understand&quot;. She sounds like a smart-aleck twelve-year-old taking a euphemism/colloquialism literally. She&#039;s meant to be a bit like that but not that much. I think Cormac slightly misjudged it.<br><br>\u2014 The two books should be a single volume, as originally intended. Cut down the Alicia-Kid banter sessions and have the SM transcripts after them, all alternating with Bobby&#039;s narrative. Get rid of the duplicate stuff (there isn&#039;t much). You would end up with one 550-page novel instead of a 400-page novel with a 200-page appendix. Begin with Alicia&#039;s suicide &amp; end with Bobby&#039;s last five pages.

During this &quot;immediate aftermath&quot; period, even the black SNL actor/comedian Tracey Jordan exhorted authority figures to &quot;shake &#039;em down&quot;, referring to muslims in general. By which he meant not that they should be mistreated, but that they should be profiled and watched with respect to the specific sort of terrorism that they are wont to wage. (The later San Bernadino shooting, IIRC, also comes to mind). Jordan made this comment with some understanding of racism himself, and he was in the city at the time, so his feelings are sensible. It&#039;s true that there are many racial forms of terrorism, and the arab/muslim one was foremost in people&#039;s minds at the time.<br><br>In short, it was very culturally safe to be bigoted against muslims during the early 2000s, and with good reason.<br><br>For Hitchens, as for myself (a lifelong atheist, I was 17 years old at the time of the attacks so I have clear formative memory during the transition to adulthood, the event did much to shape and cement my worldview), 9/11 was a major cultural event which showcased the very worst of religion. Muslims fly planes into a building (yes, that is what actually took place) in part because they are aggrieved over occupation of their lands, but above all because, together with their generally lower intelligence, they are benighted and socialized into a backward and violent traditional culture which entails A FALSE PROPHET AND A FALSE GOD. In response to this, a christian blames the events on gays and feminism. You can make a fair argument that these groups are responsible for social decline, but Falwell&#039;s invocation within hours of the thing was still a disgusting display, mostly because it was irrelevant to why it had actually happened, because it assumed &quot;god&#039;s punishment&quot;. Third, a bunch of Scientologists cynically used the event to be little goody-two-shoes and volunteer as clean-up helpers while wearing identifying &quot;we are Scientologists&quot; vests. While having awareness of the Great Leap Forward and the Stalinist purges as atrocities waged by atheists (the religion in this case however was not atheism as such, but communism), 9/11 remains more convenient for myself as a formative display of the worst of religion. And let&#039;s not forget the jews, but given Hitchens&#039; stances, I don&#039;t know exactly how I want to go about assigning blame to them, apart from the general things like occupation of Israel and influence in American foreign policy.

He says Europeans are the ones who retain the most &quot;spiritual virility&quot; which is the legacy of the Aryans. Some races also retain elements of it, and ancient China interests him partly because of this. In Revolt he talks about the Ancient Aryans being pale and white, and the Chinese legends of pale, blue-eyed giants teaching them the secrets the empire-building. He routinely refers to darker races in harsh terms, if you read Revolt then you would know that he believes that Aryans and Nordic races are solar while darker races are telluric and chaotic, metaphysically.

He could not possibly marry a commoner, that would be against the rules of the kingdom. <br>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d he bemoaned, \u201cperhaps a bit of fresh air would be for the best.\u201d Taking his horn, he blew a bellowing cry for his steed; a Dragon given to him by his godfather, the Wizard of Pillarime.<br>A gust of wind and a loud thud could be heard on his balcony. The large red dragon knelt in front of the prince, knowing what was desired. Securly mounted, the two took flight across the kingdom of Pillarme. They flew past the forests and into the mountains, finally landing near a large secluded lake surrounded by the snowy peaks that guarded it. It was their spot, a spot no one else knew, except one other; a girl of ashen hair and hazel eyes. She was drinking from the lake undisturbed nor worried about the man and beast in front of her.<br>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Prince, \u201cI\u2019ve never met another person here.

Let me show you.\u201d<br>With a wave of her hand, sparks of mana took shape. She performed for the Prince, dazzling his mind with the beauty she conjured. <br>\u201cWow! How did you learn to use magic? And can I do it too?\u201d<br>Meredith smiled at the Prince. Her eyes welled with tears and her smiling lips drooped into a frown. <br>\u201cIt is a curse which I would never wish upon another. To mock Nature is a crime upon itself.\u201d<br>\u201cI wish to learn anyways. A talent this powerful could never be a curse.

The beast stepped back and arched his neck. Smoke formed from its nostrils, and in a single instant it blew a fire directly at the girl. <br>\u201cDraco! Stop!\u201d the Prince cried.

Meredith touched the nose of the beast and in an instant, decay set upon its body. The Prince was shocked; speechless at the events that took place.

The sentence &quot;there were goofy mechanical rubber hands that removed her clothes, sort of like the famous contraption from Wallace and Gromit.&quot; needs to stop at the comma; goofy mechanical rubber hands is enough, and insisting that the reader imagine exactly the thing from that TV show that one time is... too insistent.

The crudity makes more sense when you get the tweest but the problem is that the crudity just feels crude until you make it that far.

As for the &quot;point&quot; that Asher makes, it&#039;s fine to make it so briefly but only if the rest of the work is adding context to it. You want the &quot;point&quot; to tie together all of the &quot;evidence&quot; that your story has presented in a lightbulb moment.

There were gods, demons, curses, possession, magic, interdimensional traveling, and other stuff, but it&#039;s not what the novel is about. There&#039;s a lot about how the Pallesand Archipelago is conquering and oppressing everyone in their quest to establish what they believe to be utopian socialism. It didn&#039;t explicitly say that, but it was heavily implied. The name may or may not have been a reference to Solzhenitsyn&#039;s Gulag Archipelago, and/or the British Isles and Empire, especially as depicted in Orwell&#039;s 1984. They&#039;re all about controlling every aspect of behavior to come closer to their arbitrary ideal of perfection.<br><br>The novel had an unusual narrative structure where the viewpoint moved from one character to another from chapter to chapter. Some characters only had a single chapter and others had several. It began by establishing the primary viewpoints which were often included in the other viewpoints. A minor character in one viewpoint became the viewpoint in the next chapter and so on. I wanted to call this a mosaic novel but the paths of the characters are too overlapping for that to seem accurate. A few chapters were explicitly called mosaic because the narrator is the viewpoint in them, which was odd because there wasn&#039;t a frame story. The author simply described what happened as an omniscient narrator. The chapters open with similar narration.<br><br>The narrative was also different in its neutrality, as it&#039;s more an exploration of ongoing events through the lives of the characters rather than being about the characters themselves. So, in a way, the city could be considered a character, which is something I&#039;ve seen in several books published in 2022. The downside was that because of the constantly changing perspective the characters were underdeveloped. I also disliked them. They&#039;re almost all stock characters with nothing to particularly distinguish them. The most egregious to me were the overeager and blindly idealistic college students eager to be martyrs for the revolution.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what this novel was meant to be about. To be entirely reductive, it&#039;s about the consequences following the theft of a magical item that leads to the death of one of the most important government officials. Everyone then wanted wanted to know who had the magical item and where it was. There were also various factions that worked towards revolution, but each had their own methods and incompatible end goals. I wouldn&#039;t be so concerned about what it meant if it weren&#039;t that it seemed like it was constantly trying to say something meaningful. Maybe that was intended or I read too much into it, but it left me unsatisfied.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5", "filename": "60147395", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 2458, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671222050267490, "time": 1671222050, "md5": "L781DbQI3JGvikqfbEIK0w==", "fsize": 1074791, "resto": 21391224, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21392891, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21392882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21392882</a><br>I&#039;ve now read a book that was published in each month of 2022 in the month that it was published.

It was more of a side quest than the previous books and probably could have been reworked into a solo novel with minimal changes, it does tie into the story nicely at the end and I had a great time with it. This book felt different. It felt like it was written for little children- and children only . There were many caps, too much emphasis, and Peril is an extremely childish character who largely acts like she was born yesterday and is a hair-trigger away from mass murder multiple times. Tui absolutely nailed Peril as a point of view. Every word mirrored Peril\u2019s possessive, childish, bloodthirsty and and altogether very unstable personality. Some of it was over-exaggerated, but it is very clear that Peril is a completely different dragon than others, with her unique one tracked mind because she has been killing since she was a dragonet (baby dragon), when someone is hostile or irritable to her, she hopes that they attack her so she can freely murder them.<br><br>Peril to other dragons is a weird, crazy sociopathic dragon who can kill effortlessly and that&#039;s exactly how I felt when I first read Escaping Peril. across the story I realized that she changed. From the beginning she always obsessed over Clay, Scarlet and her Killing potential, but near the end, she thought less about aproval and more as a normal-ish sane pov, completing her arc. Peril is hilarious. Honestly, the author&#039;s writing style ensures that all her books are humorous, She has no filter, and says whatever she&#039;s thinking regardless of how awkward that makes other dragons feel. Which leads to some pretty damn funny conversations.<br><br>The plot moves at a fast clip and lot happens in this story both to Peril and dragon society as a whole desu, You wouldn&#039;t expect it from the more personalized stakes involved here but there were actually a large number of twists happened throughout. The third act involves a lot of twists, which frankly, I should have seen coming after the magic seen in the last book. <br><br>4.8/5: The best thing in the series since darkstalker&#039;s standalone book.", "filename": "iu[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 734, "h": 304, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 51, "tim": 1671250257967225, "time": 1671250257, "md5": "h6EIyfZKkbWnokZ8Xm4Amw==", "fsize": 38597, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394633, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:18:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394385</a><br>It&#039;s that still around? .org was in pretty sad shape last time I looked.", "time": 1671250702, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394694, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)23:44:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394614</a><br>your &quot;&quot;&quot;reviews&quot;&quot;&quot; are shit<br>fuck off", "time": 1671252256, "resto": 21391224}, {"no": 21394854, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:03:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Judging Eye was like a breath of fresh air. <s>Hardly any Kellhus.

The non-man shit in general would be better delivered all at once, separate from the main story as its own fulfilling arc, and then the intersection with the main story could be a mystery until you read the tie in.<br><br>Sort of like how it seems like Bakker is writing prequels for the No God, which must be a way to explain the ending in various ways since you know where the story ends up in the future when you write prequels in any series.<br><br>But you&#039;re in for a treat with the Survivor, the climax, etc. There is almost no Kellhus POVs in the whole series. They are few and far between but some of the best parts.

Golden Son and Dark Age are some of the most riveting, edge of your seat fiction I&#039;ve read, and it sustains it for the entire book each time. Brown is very good at introducing lots of threads and places a story can go and then surprising you. It does not feel on rails at all.<br><br>The premise of the story is kind of silly. It was made even more silly by the editing of Book I, and while it is neat how you keep thinking you&#039;re reading one kind of book, and then it totally &quot;shifts the paradigm,&quot; the suspension of belief is a little hard. This goes away significantly in Golden Son and on, as he fleshes out the world and culture way more, and you realize the color scheme is just a way to get to classical Greece/Rome worshiping genetically engineered, honor obsessed super humans fighting for control of the solar system.<br><br>The third book isn&#039;t quite as good as the second because the end comes in a bit of a rush, and there is a somewhat hackneyed part near the end that you&#039;ll know when you see it, but book five is potentially even better than Golden Son and holds it for all 800 pages.<br><br>Great series. We&#039;re getting two new books over 800 pages in 2023. There is apparently a show coming out. I don&#039;t know how they will handle that decently, but it will at least blow up the spotlight on a very good series and make it more likely we get a game out of it.

She isolated me from everyone and used to humiliate me so badly that there were times I wanted to kill myself. I finished highschool with no friendships or self esteem, then out of the blue after HS finished she was nice to me.

I love her and all but I can&#039;t shake this feeling that after all these years I&#039;m still somewhat scared of her. When she&#039;s upset with something I did she still reverts to how she treated me back in HS especially when it comes to her accusing me of being flirty with people like retail staff.

The oldest question in philosophy: How is unity (concept, idea, universal) ever reducible to or derivable from multiplicity (particulars, individuals, contingent experiences), without a subject-enacted, decisional component, that is fundamentally distinct from the particulars themselves? How many apples does an abstract &quot;mind&quot; need to receive sense data from before it can correctly identify what an &quot;apple&quot; is, every time? Imagine yourself as Plato or Aristotle wondering at the fact that the mind can have imperfect, shitty information about an infinite plurality of imperfect, shifting sense information out in front of it, and correctly still determine that it&#039;s looking at one instance of &quot;apple&quot; against a backdrop of irrelevant or less relevant information. There is something happening IN the mind at that moment, what the Greeks and Husserl call noesis, the intending of a concept that is stable in all the continuous flux of plurality. Even when that apple is then moved, destroyed, or revealed to have been an illusion. Intentionality is irreducible to flux, its very function is the selection of things out of the flux AS not-flux. Hegel&#039;s Phenomenology of Spirit starts with this basic idea and scenario.<br><br>The only way to really explain conceptuality is by presupposing that the particular-identifying, concept-possessing &quot;thing&quot; (the mind) has something in it that is distinct from the particulars it is tasked with identifying. One simply can&#039;t logically derive, or provide, a completely subject-free, decision-free model of an abstractly conceived &quot;mind&quot; that correctly identifies an infinite multiplicity of sense data, and correctly identifies some blobs within the flux of data as apples and other blobs as mere noise. The very notion of &quot;correct&quot; just recursively invokes the issue of a decision, since &quot;correct&quot; tautologically means &quot;corresponding to the concept, intending the concept correctly,&quot; which is something we can only conceive of a mind doing. <br><br>The very concept of a concept tautologically presupposes a decision-making, subjective, non-objective mind, doing something different from what objects do. A decisionless, non-subjective mind (a contradiction in terms as) wouldn&#039;t even be able to separate one &quot;datum&quot; from another &quot;datum&quot; in the flux, because data in this case are themselves concepts, they themselves presuppose a DECISION (which tautologically presupposes a subjective mind) on what a &quot;bit&quot; is, on what the fundamental informational &quot;atom&quot; of the system is. Even to intend &quot;flux&quot; as a &quot;something&quot; requires an instance of intentionality, and again this is what Hegel&#039;s Phenomenology starts with. As Hegel would say, to intend flux is also to suppress not-flux, to make a decision and division of things.", "time": 1671326465, "resto": 21392881}, {"no": 21398357, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)20:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398355</a><br>The only way to conceive of a mind without decisions is to conceive of it as purely governed by efficient and material causation, so that all apparent decision-making is just very complex instances of physical movements in a system that ultimately possesses no mental character. So all apparent subjectivity would then be an illusion. But this raises the old question, an illusion for whom? &quot;Illusion&quot; is a concept that involves the exclusion of &quot;real&quot; (and thus a concept of the real), as decided upon (intended/correctly identified) by a thinking subject. <br><br>It&#039;s just BARELY thinkable to posit a universe with absolutely no contents whatsoever other than material bits moving around, impacting one another, forming pseudo-structures that are actually not structures at all because there is nothing other than the bits, except from the perspective of subjects (who don&#039;t exist) who are insufficiently informed about how they don&#039;t exist. But this is obviously full of absurdities. In a thoroughly materialistic universe, nothing other than the atoms could exist, all larger structures would be pseudo-structures, and only structures from the flawed &quot;perspective&quot; of... whom? <br><br>And if you want to go even further than this: even in a universe where we only have efficient causation operating between material bits, it is still a DECISION to identify the bits (atoms or strings or whatever) as distinct - distinction is a noetic, intentional, conceptual activity. Even if you respond to this by saying, there are no bits, only a continuous space-time fabric and its laws, well, you still have a distinction between the fabric and the laws, and between the laws if there are multiple. Any conceptual distinction, any attempt to think anything, presupposes subjectivity in a way that can&#039;t be reduced to a material model, because all material models themselves presuppose non-material conceptual elements, &quot;ideal&quot; entities, and ideal distinctions between entities, which are &quot;structures,&quot; and we have already clarified that in a materialistic metaphysics, structures can only be pseudo-structures, all distinctions are illusory, but we need structural distinctions just to elaborate the materialistic theory in the first place. To define the bits, to intend them as distinct from one another and from the laws governing them. The ancient atomists ran into this problem immediately.

Would have taken a good months worth of work to fix up and a good chunk of change, mast needed to come down, a month or two of yard rental at the marina, launch fee, new sails and rigging would be about $10k alone. Expenses add up quickly. I almost went for that one but didn&#039;t since winter was just about to and adding in winter storage fees plus the work I would absolutely have to get done to insure more damage did not happen over winter was a bit much. Irony is that if that guy had asked a sane price for it from the start I would have bought it, but he wanted about $10k more than it was worth, had only a slight leak and minor easy to patch rot back then, but he kept it over priced and neglected it for 2 years, that leak got bigger and the rot spread until the interior was essentially a total loss.", "time": 1671358723, "resto": 21398590}, {"no": 21399947, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)06:42:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;21399914</span><br>Why?

Accidents still happen these days \u2013 God knows accidents still happen \u2013 but it&#039;s much easier to know when the sea is going to be rampant, only kicks and hooves, so the boys know when it&#039;s time to stay home bothering their missus, watching TV and playing canasta with the parents. It&#039;s the technology, my girls, I\u2019m sure you know. Satellites, weather buoys, telecommunication, all this helps to play chess with the sea. But in the end no one knows the consciousness of the ocean. There are days when he&#039;s in his pajamas, yawning, so calm you could squeeze him into a bottle and feed him to a baby. But sometimes, without warning, he becomes so ferocious that all his waters seem to be made from the frothy marrow drawn from the bones of some monster. I&#039;ve already caught a sea like that, when I was a fisherman. I&#039;ll tell you, my little cherries, it&#039;s not a pretty thing to look at, it&#039;s not a pretty thing. You seem to be trapped between two hells: the sky and the sea. You look at the waters below the boat and it doesn&#039;t look like water, it looks more like a school of shark&#039;s teeth, each drop a sharp tooth, all tingling and jumping and writhing in flocks of nervous effervescence. It&#039;s like old Neptune&#039;s gastric juices when he has heartburn. Then you look up at the heavens, at the clouds, and that thing up there, that greasy gray fur, that doesn&#039;t look like air, it looks more like a sticky swamp, and you swear it would be easier for you to see sharks and whales crawling through the clouds than a rescue helicopter tearing its way through that mangrove swamp. The world goes dark. The sun, the heart of the day, is clogged with the cholesterol of the salty fog, stuffed with a swelling of spongy syrup, and for that reason it disappears and becomes silent and no longer pumps out light. There is only light in lightning. There is so much thunder and lightning in the sky that it looks like a cleaning lady is scrubbing and rinsing the floors of the Heights with a bucket of bubbling thunderbolts. North, south, east, west, above and below, night and day, sky and sea: it seems that God shouted in Nature&#039;s nape and she, in enormous fright, mixed up all the cards in the deck, and no longer knows who is who. It is at these times that you feel a chill inside your bones, as if the blood of all the drowned who moan under the waters were now crying inside you.

J. P. Taylor, the eminent British historian, and hardly a Nazi sympathizer, writes:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Fascism, it was claimed, represented the last aggressive stage of capitalism in decline, and its momentum could be sustained only by war. There was an element of truth in this, but not much. The full employment which Nazi Germany was the first European country to possess, depended in large part on the production of armaments; but it could have been provided equally well (and was to some extent) by other forms of public works from roads to great buildings. The Nazi secret was not armament production; it was freedom from the then orthodox principles of economics . . . the argument for war did not work even if the Nazi system had relied on armaments production alone. Nazi Germany was not choking in a flood of arms. On the contrary, the German Generals insists unanimously in 1939 that they were not equipped for war and that many years must pass before \u201crearmament in depth\u201d had been completed.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Answering predictions of ruin by orthodox economists throughout the world, Hitler explained that Germany had not withdrawn from world trade but had bypassed the international financial system by means of barter, stating:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If certain countries combat the German system this is done in the first instance because through the German method of trading their tricks of international currency and Bourse speculations have been abolished in favor of honest business transactions. . . . We are buyers of good foodstuff and raw materials and suppliers of equally good commodities!&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More recently a professional economist, Henry C K Liu[18], who can hardly be suspected of Hitlerism, analyzed the methods by which Germany emerged from the Depression:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, at a time when its economy was in total collapse, with ruinous war-reparation obligations and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit. Yet through an independent monetary policy of sovereign credit and a full-employment public-works program, the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany, stripped of overseas colonies it could exploit, into the strongest economy in Europe within four years, even before armament spending began. In fact, German economic recovery preceded and later enabled German rearmament, in contrast to the US economy, where constitutional roadblocks placed by the US Supreme Court on the New Deal delayed economic recovery until US entry to World War II put the US market economy on a war footing. While this observation is not an endorsement for Nazi philosophy, the effectiveness of German economic policy in this period, some of which had been started during the last phase of the Weimar Republic, is undeniable.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1653939673591", "ext": ".png", "w": 956, "h": 1804, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671244709359835, "time": 1671244709, "md5": "5pi4TTPLY09rsfNpvdN+Ww==", "fsize": 680731, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394370, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>That analogy is stupid and doesn\u2019t fully work.", "time": 1671244914, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394377, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394281</a><br>Most Greek philosophers were what we today would call fascist", "time": 1671245112, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394381, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21390680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21390680</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5&#039;1&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark complexion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bavarian (embarrassment)</span><br>Shall I continue?", "time": 1671245243, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394384, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refusal to give a clear condemnation and breakaway from Nazism after WW2, seems to have been a matter of principle and intrinsic distaste to what he, in his own way, saw as the rise of \u201cglobohomo\u201d, and the West essentially trying to claim it was significantly moral superior to Germany, even with its own firebombing of Dresden, the detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the like.</span><br><br>True, and there\u2019s also no end to apologising, as the recent history of Germany has shown", "time": 1671245289, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394392, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:49:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>I don&#039;t care about persecuting Jews, Gulf Arabs, or blacks.

They had boosted their personnel from approximately 100,000 regulars (fully equipped) up to approx. 13 million regulars through WW2. This force was spearheaded by relatively small but fully operational armored divisions, which for the most part had their basic combat effectiveness close to 100%, because they had the necessary tanks, equipped with newly produced radio gear, already produced by German industry. What was required by the infantry and motorized divisions was transports, let alone armored transports, in a huge quantity given the relative size of the infantry compared to the mechanized. This was a quantity which could not be supported even when the entire German economy was fully deployed, which is why the majority of the German &quot;motorized&quot; divisions (IIRC the figure was between 70-80% in 1941) were using horses and horse-drawn guns pulling them through Russia. The armored spearheads were highly effective and German soldiers already had small arms, the problem was producing such a large quantity for such a large force in such a small time (ultimately 1933 - 1939, but more realistically it was 1936 - 1939), which is what the generals were referring to. They were always scared that the armor would outpace the infantry and cause severe catastrophes due to encirclement (which didn&#039;t happen at the start of the war due to the disorganization of France, Britain and Russia, as well as the skill of German spearheads and special operations units).

More plainly, contemporary right-wingers are people who were taught one thing by their parents (that was probably very much in vogue when they were taught it) and then came of age into a world where those values are long out of style. Because they are not prepared to abandon those values they pick the party (which is only one of two) that most closely resemble what their values are and ride or die with it. <br><br>Because patriotism and American exceptionalism are some of those holdout traditional values this makes for an easy fit despite the fact that the Republican Party, on closer inspection, is in reality a disgusting amalgam that, while paying lip service to the traditionalist crowd, in reality does not substantially support their interests or their values at all. We can characterize the pre-Trump Republican party as primarily being made up of poor/middle class traditionalists on one side and ultra-wealthy businessmen on the other. Due to the fact that the libertarian-leaning lingo of the businessmen uses the same keywords that the poorer party-members have learned to revere (freedom, personal choice, personal responsibility, free markets, low taxes, low government involvement etc) the treachery of the business class is hidden, and they are able to pursue interests that are very much at odds with the poorer classes while making only a few concessions that are useless anyway (gun control, abortion, Christianity). <br><br>So to answer the OP, the reason right wing books are cringe is because the Republican platform is incomprehensible and not consistent. There isn&#039;t a driving force behind it except to lower labor costs. It&#039;s a catch-all for the people that get fucked over by Progressivism. <br><br>Also important to note this is why people like Trump get elected, and why the base is so receptive to ideologies that speak to them from a more philosophically-grounded place (Populism, Carl Schmitt&#039;s existentialism).<br><br><a href=\"#p21397964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397964</a><br>Destiny is a clown.", "time": 1671346246, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399385, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:59:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397583</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1671346776, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399541, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:29:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398212</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;largely reinforced with the fact that no self-respecting intellectual wants to be associated with the embarrassment that is modern right-wing politics</span><br>This is a bit misleading.

This means that a lot of RW figures come from different walks of life and as such their takes aren&#039;t going to be as refined as they could&#039;ve been, and coupled with the thing that I&#039;ll go over below makes it an embarrassing shitshow.<br>Then the main problem is that RW politics is deliberately setup to work out an electable position and grift the shit out of it.

As such when you look at political landscape in countries like Germany, Poland, the UK and the US you notice that the right wing parties are trying their hardest to make anyone to the right from them unelectable and they do it via means of public scrutiny and defamation.

Leftist political formations on the other hand cultivate their radicals(they&#039;ll only get rid of the real stinkers like open and unapologetic pedophile advocates), they won&#039;t give them everything they want for political reasons, but they will setup what amounts to patronage networks to give them the ability to be subversive and &quot;generate ideals&quot;, obviously something made much simpler by the fact that the academia is captive so at this point every taxpayer pays for leftists to give patronage to their radicals in public universities, but even without it they would always do it.<br>To put it simpler - leftists don&#039;t engage in witch hunts against &quot;communists&quot;, but rightists engage in hunts against &quot;fascists&quot;(obviously both words are rendered meaningless because both communism and fascism are as dead as absolute monarchy based on divine right is, you can bring them back but it&#039;ll be just LARP)", "time": 1671352156, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399547, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studies show </span><br><br>Studies show the opposite is true actually.", "time": 1671352392, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399568, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399547</a><br>Depends on year and how do you distinguish between the two.

Shankara specifically addresses the Yogachara position in some detail in his writings and he patiently explains why he thinks it is wrong/illogical and he highlights why Advaita is different. Even before Shankara came along Gaudapada was already criticizing the doctrines of the Yogacharins a few centuries earlier, and in Shankara&#039;s commentary on Gaudapada&#039;s text he unpacks these criticisms of Yogachara in greater detail. Shankara does not hold to Yogachara positions, he criticizes them instead.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vasubandhu, the Buddhist who wrote the initial philosophical treatises of the Yogacara school, argued that &#039;external dharmas&#039;, a class of objects which depending on the school could include atoms or gross objects such as apples, did not really exist in a mind-external way. With regards to mind-external objects, the Yogacara school has an identical position to the Advaita Vedanta school. </span><br>No, that&#039;s incorrect, Yogachara does not &quot;have an identical position&quot; to Advaita. Shankara criticizes Vasubandhu&#039;s/Dinnaga&#039;s/Dharmakirti&#039;<wbr>s position with regard to external objects in his Brahma Sutra Bhasya and he calls their position illogical. According to Shankara, objects exist conventionally in a mind-independent way and he says there is no rational grounds for denying that they are mind-independent. Shankara only accepts the dream-analogy to the extent that it can be used to undermine belief that the waking world is itself the actual true reality (instead of Brahman being reality) but he does *not* accept it as a valid basis for rejecting the independence of exterior objects from the mind and he instead calls this irrational. <br><br>&quot;Consequently, Sankara\u2019s attempt is not to show that Vasnbnndhu is wrong in rejecting proof of externality, for Sankara himself accepts that rejection. To say that Sankara\u2019s argument does not prove that externality exists would be to miss the point His attempt, rather, is to show that Vasubandhu is wrong to reject the assumption of externality in any account of experience. So, the argument is over whether a coherent account of experience can be given while rejecting the externality of objects\u2018 i.e., without referring to objects as extrinsic to cognition. Vasubandhu holds that that is possible and right, Sankara disagrees.<br>- Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, Advaita Epistemology and Metaphysics: An Outline of Indian Non-Realism, page 64", "time": 1671160542, "resto": 21385199}, {"no": 21390158, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:04:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389918</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the equivalent of practice in Advaita Vedanta? </span><br>There is no &quot;practice&quot; per se. Once initiated into an Advaita monastic order you are told the truth about your true Self and so on, and then you study Shankara&#039;s works (sometimes other works too) and teachings under the close guidance of a teacher. If someone is ready to fully grasp the teaching then liberation and enlightenment will just naturally dawn on them at some point during this process, and if it doesn&#039;t happen that is just because they didn&#039;t cultivate the necessary qualities first or didn&#039;t study and focus long enough until they overcame their own misunderstanding.<br><br>There are lists in the Advaita writings of certain qualities and things like self-control and purity of intention etc that someone is supposed to cultivate first before even being qualified to pursue liberation as a monk. The normal steps in the process of arriving at liberation are held to be Sravana (listening to the teacher or teaching), Manana (reflecting on the teaching and grasping its meaning) and Nidihyasana (focusing on or meditating on the core truth of the teaching to the exclusion of all else or directly intuiting it), but these can all occur just in a normal session of studying Shankara&#039;s writings with a teacher or listening to their verbal teaching by a riverside etc somewhere. Sometimes, a particular lineage of teaching Advaita will teach a certain mantra to recite or meditation to perform that will a supplementary practice that one can do when not studying Advaita texts, but this differs by lineage and it&#039;s never taught to be what produces liberation itself (which happens via knowledge and not an act) but it is only supplementary. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apart from the liberaion through gnosis what sort of practices form part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition?</span><br>They will do things like hatha yoga or worship deities.

Instead, you can just go about your life or even practice other religions and spiritual teachings while still appreciating and benefiting from the wisdom offered by Advaita.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.</span>", "filename": "nabokov", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 244, "h": 206, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 105, "tim": 1671176906487822, "time": 1671176906, "md5": "qfDqfavyfd//DZtoxWVILA==", "fsize": 8229, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21390940, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:11:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21388006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21388006</a><br>absolutely filtered.", "time": 1671181905, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21390982, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:29:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21388630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21388630</a><br>What does it even mean?", "time": 1671182954, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21391018, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:48:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21390982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21390982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What does it even mean?</span><br>Retarded zoomerspeak.", "filename": "its-giving", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1079, "h": 1088, "tn_w": 123, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671184105040696, "time": 1671184105, "md5": "2y97NNScRCH2YvVtuL7Qqg==", "fsize": 353685, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21391020, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)04:49:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21391018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21391018</a><br>I... still don&#039;t understand", "time": 1671184158, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21391689, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)09:46:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21388607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21388607</a><br>That\u2019s where I found it lol", "time": 1671201997, "resto": 21388006}, {"no": 21391691, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)09:48:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21391020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21391020</a><br><a href=\"#p21390982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21390982</a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure it means &#039;this is giving me the feeling of X&#039;.

Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.<br><br>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Ach\u00e6ans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant&#039;s wreath, and he besought the Ach\u00e6ans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.<br><br>&quot;Sons of Atreus,&quot; he cried, &quot;and all other Ach\u00e6ans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.&quot;<br><br>On this the rest of the Ach\u00e6ans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. &quot;Old man,&quot; said he, &quot;let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.&quot;<br><br>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto had borne. &quot;Hear me,&quot; he cried, &quot;O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.&quot;<br><br>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them.

The result is that society becomes monomaniacal. The only possible deviation, change, etc, then, is the destruction of society. His example is the USSR: after a certain point, the only possible action that one could take in regards to the USSR was destroying it. The metaphor of the Warrior Caste rejecting the Priestly Caste is apt: a warband that no longer fights for a cause, but simply to fight. When they run out of enemies, who will they fight? Each other. When the last enemy is dead, the last warrior will have no one to fight but himself. &quot;Microfascism&quot; is the potential in any given thing that demands totalitarianism (that is, demands to be the CENTRAL thing in society that defines EVERYTHING) to become a macrofascism. You can see this in a lot of SJW stuff, like Woke activists demanding that the entirety of society be viewed through their special snowflake intersectionalism (&quot;blxck trans jewish bodxs of coloxr&quot;). But, it&#039;s also present in Christianity, in literal actual Italian Fascism (which was literally about totalitarianism of the state), etc. Microfascisms aren&#039;t so much something to be rooted out as much as they are something to be untangled, as any microfascism is deriving from some kind of issue that, when untangled, resolves itself. There&#039;s some kind of kernel embedded in each, and that kernel causes agitation, which builds up as the microfascism, which becomes the pearl in the clam. Neutralize the kernel, and you neutralize the threat.<br><br>This, alongside his rejection of Freud, rejection of the Labor Theory of Value, and rejection of Marxist historiography, is one of the takes that got him excommunicated from Communism. He wasn&#039;t really a Liberal, but more so a Classical Republican. His ideal society is one with several overlapping centers, each of which is actually incomplete to some degree (and thus cannot become totalitarian because each center cannot actually totalize society), and thus is reliant upon the others. Society can never be totalized, meaning that it&#039;s always in a state of organic, virile flux, producing novelty and rejuvenating itself. If you want to see what this looks like, imagine Ancient Greek city states plus what the Chinese do with Daoism/Buddhism/Confucianism but with like six more religious traditions.<br><br>It should be noted that Nazism is less Fascist than actual literal Fascism, or, humorously, Christianity and Feminism, as Nazism was still rooted in (what Deleuze would call the) Pre-Signifying Regime. In essence, because Nazism was still rooted to the biological realities of race and the spiritual realities of religion, it had less potential to become totalitarian than actual literal Fascism, because the ideology was still bound to something real (constructed =/= unreal).

EVERYTHING has to be understood through the totalitarian ideology. Trannies love Deleuze because they love everything. Their ideology demands that they colonize all flows and redirect them for the ideology. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s nonsensical or obviously wrong, what matters is forcing people to see the world through the ideology BY FORCE. When someone looks up Deleuze, they must &quot;hear trans voices&quot;. Replace Deleuze with everything. Tranny voices on cooking, on baking, on gardening, on beekeeping, EVERYTHING. When Lefties do &quot;the Racist History of Hiking and How Black Femme Queer Bodies are Taking It Back&quot;, they&#039;re doing this. Everything needs to be seen through the ideology.

All the better, more subtle ones with basically the same ideals were either too effete and modernist themselves (like Junger) or too bourgeois, too unwilling to be truly revolutionary (the Jungkonservativen around Papen/Schleicher). Waste time in a crisis by waiting for the perfect solution, and you get the second best solution: the NSDAP. Doesn&#039;t really matter anyway, since it would have levelled out, like all movements do, and produced a basically sane political consensus, like all movements do.

So Mussolini did the only thing one can do, and realized his job was to bind all these retards together into a mighty faggot and wait until the best tendencies among them can trickle down into a new generation not raised under Weimar conditions. Mussolini&#039;s main political strategy for Fascist Italy wasn&#039;t the implementation of any one autistic program, it was &quot;durare,&quot; &quot;to last/survive,&quot; i.e. to last long enough that the healthy impulses can percolate into the body politic and reawaken it, while the unhealthy and disintegrative impulses are purged.

This is one of the reasons global capital has supported the popularity of homosexual exclusivity for nearly twenty years now. Of course these days, transsexuals (better called &quot;self castrators&quot;) offer even more benefits than homosexuals to systems of global capital: they can&#039;t reproduce and they are reliant upon complex technological systems of capital to complete and maintain the illusion of transition. For this reason, you&#039;re witnessing the passing of capitalist favor from homosexual exclusives to self-castrators.<br><br>Western capital systems carry the property of anti-fragility. Homosexual exclusives have been economically assess and reconvened to serve global capital even better than heterosexual exclusives. No babies means the effortless conversion of traditional by-blood families into work-home secondary &quot;professional&quot; families.

Thus Badiou&#039;s categories are correct and right because they talk about the &quot;right infinity&quot; and Deleuze talks about the wrong horizon of &quot;infinity&quot; (plain of immanence). But what it boils down to is an obscurantist heriarchy of traditional philosophical concepts and how Deleuze in reality fits in none of them. Badiou wants it to reduce into a thing, such as the rhizome, immamnce, differance but fails to do any of that becuase it is his won philosophical thinking that boils to one thing, such as , the one, absolute, infinity etc. If isn&#039;t clealry enough Deleuze yawns with these concepts and with academic philosophy in general. Look at who are Deleuze&#039;s fathers: Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, and Hume. All non academic &quot;outsiders&quot;, it is they who allowed him to embrace an anarchic style of thinking which is non stratified, non historicaly determined, non traditional. Then look at Badiou, he gives the image of someone who is both intellectually and even politically insecure. Spending half of his work in trying to align concepts with other thinkers. <br><br>Then lets look at politics and the famous accusation of Deleuze being a reactionary and what transpired. The only dudes that came out clearly in favor of May 68 as a total revolution and in testing the limits of what is &quot;acceptable&quot; politically, where Deleuze and Guattari. Foucault and Badrillard decried it later and said it was a failure and sold out. Badiou and the communist party did nothing and did not support the unions that were striking, they were against May 68 from the beggining like the systemic stooges they always were. Is it any wonder then, that the high priests hijacked any social movement that came out later? The reaction to Deleuze one might say is even very &quot;French&quot;.

The result is that society becomes monomaniacal. The only possible deviation, change, etc, then, is the destruction of society. His example is the USSR: after a certain point, the only possible action that one could take in regards to the USSR was destroying it.</span><br>I think if the term &quot;totalitarian&quot; means anything it&#039;s much like a state of war (or a war footing) in which the intensity of &quot;politics&quot; becomes so great that debate itself freezes up. But I think that the totalitarian communist system differered from Nazi-fascism which labeled Jews (among others) as antagonists at the ontological level (in which there&#039;s also no real way to deal with them other than ending their lives), and from the anti-fascist perspective, the Nazis were the perpetrators and the Jews were the victims.<br><br>But in the communist system, it&#039;s not so clear, because they had a way of collapsing the distinction between perpetrator and victim. Perpetrators, secret police, etc. often had dissident views themselves or sheltered people (such as in Enver Hoxha&#039;s Albania), or the dissidents within the country could also be glowies from the internal security bureau. In Marxism-Leninism, there&#039;s a dialectic between subjectivity and objectivity in which one&#039;s subjective intentions (or political &quot;mistakes&quot;) and objective actions can be two different things, or principles and tactics (affording a great deal of flexibility in practice), but somehow this collapsed (in the 1930s) so one&#039;s objective actions became re-subjectivized: you didn&#039;t just make a mistake, it was your subjective intention all along to make a mistake which makes you guilty, so anyone could be sent to the GULAG.<br><br>The system was more all-pervasive than fascism, and could be argued to be more genuinely totalitarian. So was everybody guility? Or everybody innocent? Or both? How do you deal with that after it collapsed? So a theory is that post-communist societies dealt with it by rejecting everything about socialism and Marxism because it&#039;s easier to attack ideas than people, since everyone was complicit but also victimized in some kinda way.<br><br>&quot;Economic&quot; freedom is also bundled in with democratic freedoms (&quot;freedom of speech,&quot; &quot;freedom of assembly&quot; etc.), but people have different definitions of freedom. It&#039;s bizarre but I kinda feel that neoliberal societies can also make everyone complicit while also making everyone a victim. Everyone is getting cancelled but they&#039;re also cancelling others. &quot;Free speech absolutists&quot; regularly prove they can only exist as an oppositional posture, a signaling of virtue if you will, because the second you give them their own platform to put their ideas into practice their coalition falls apart because they all have different definitions of what &quot;freedom&quot; means.", "filename": "laibach", "ext": ".png", "w": 620, "h": 500, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1671286191841037, "time": 1671286191, "md5": "xDelppJ4GeLtSiJ7HVHlbg==", "fsize": 389284, "resto": 21391335}, {"no": 21396086, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)09:10:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21395390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21395390</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine having some disgusting sex pest tranny in charge of censorship laws.

What if you did that at every level, fractally, down to and below the individual? <br><br>Deleuze even does this to Substances. Aristotle posited that a thing is a Substance, whereby there is some Form in some Matter. Makes sense, right? Deleuze expands this to deal with processes over time: there&#039;s TWO Forms, a Form of Content, and a Form of Expression (this is &quot;Double Articulation&quot;, hence why &quot;God is a lobster&quot;, because diagrams of this look like two little lobster claws, get it hah hah). The Form of Content plucks specific particles and streams from the Matter (the Heraclitean flux), and the Form of Expression organizes how they flow. Matter, then, is the undifferentiated primal stuff of existence. But, Deleuze flips the Univocity of Being on its head. This is traditionally referred to him making Substance &quot;turn around&quot; the Modes. Spinoza posited that all things are just one Substance (Deus AKA nature), and that one Substance performs different Modes, which are the different things of reality (&quot;trees&quot; are a &quot;Mode&quot;). Thus, while there is only one kind of being, which all things perform, there are two kinds of existence (that of Substance and that of Mode). Deleuze instead does a Univocity of Existence: the Substances and the Modes exist in the same manner. <br><br>THUS, and this is the big break with Aristotelianism, Substances can be the Matter for other Substances, so you get Forms within Forms within Forms, and Substances within Substances within Substances. The Form of Content of a man plucks a heart, lungs, etc, from the Matter, and the heart and lungs have Forms of Content that pluck tissues, which have Forms that pluck cells, which have forms that pluck proteins, which have Forms that pluck atoms, etc. All Matter is up for grabs, you can be made of flows of flows of flows in all sorts of whacky manners. But, it&#039;s all cool, because monism.<br><br>Some could say that that anon is taking it a little far, because Deleuze didn&#039;t want people to not have connections, he just wanted things to be so interwoven and so multiplicitious that no one thing could ever draw anything else to it (and thus lead to &quot;fascism&quot;). Every connection is a rope spliced together from other connections, so if a connection ever becomes &quot;knotted&quot; (thus doing a &quot;microfascism&quot;) it can be untangled by other connections. Whether that still allows for meaningful connection of course is up to you, many people (rightly?/wrongly?) see this as a total nominalist acid bath where nothing can meaningfully be said.

But when threads are good they&#039;re good. <br><br>There is simply no substitute for being able to talk with a bunch of fairly smart/autistic guys, who can all maintain a level head and keep talking normally even while discussing difficult/obscure topics, all while people are calling eachother faggots and retards, and saying offensive or unusual or contrarian things. Any other social media site is filled with whiny faggots who need you to soften your language like you&#039;re talking to a testy woman, and file a brief with the court 6 months in advance before saying something mildly unusual. You can almost feel normies jamming on the brakes any time you say something unexpected, even if it&#039;s benign. If it&#039;s not normies, it&#039;s the tyrannical kind of autist that prefers overmoderated communities and cliques with endless drama. <br><br>/lit/ is one of the few places left where you can just talk to men the way men used to be, where the worst case scenario is they go &quot;lol fuck off mate you&#039;re a retard&quot; and that&#039;s that. Makes for the best jokes and banter. /lit/ probably has the same spirit as a gentleman&#039;s club back in the day, the only thing it lacks is a bit more substance because every individual poster, on average, is a disaffected young male who doesn&#039;t read much.

Yes, it would be good if the entire world could laugh and play and jump around bonfires with glee, but that isn&#039;t reality. Tribalism is really the preservation of one identity against others. Tribalism isn&#039;t inherently bad, but due to its nature it is competitive. Generally, this will entail harming other &quot;tribes.&quot;<br>If we talk about the most obvious example, ideology, you can see the example illustrated clearly. If you believe in &quot;anti-tribalism&quot; and want to ensure that the world is peaceful and &quot;humanistic&quot;, you will have to defend your &quot;tribe&quot; against the others that will very gladly tear it to pieces and replace it with a far less tolerant ideology. Because the more tribalistic peoples will have no qualms with crushing anything and remaining intolerant of your ideals, your tribe will inevitably disappear through out-competition. We can see this with the failure of liberal democracy to assimilate minority groups and extremist minority religions.<br>For the example of race, we have to talk in pragmatic terms. Jews are highly tribalistic, and this isn&#039;t a bad thing. The fact is that Jews, whether they overall like the Jewish community or not, are forced to rally together at every turn to defend themselves from possible racial or ethnic threats. They are tribalistic to survive. Blacks must be tribalistic in the same way, and their tribalism is what kept their culture alive. Whites are far less tribalistic, and their tolerance is being rewarded with the disappearance of their race and culture. This won&#039;t result in a more tolerant world; they will simply disappear and be replaced with more tribalistic peoples.<br><br>Tribalism is just a fact of human evolution. You cannot and should not avoid it, unless you&#039;re okay with being replaced.

And just because the little half niglet is born of the white womans womb does not make it Aryan, because although it has physical characteristics similar to the Aryan, it will lack those characteristics exclusive to a being of pure Aryan blood, the form of a pure Aryan being necessary as the vehicle which biologically makes these higher powers possible.

But organization-dependent technology DOES regress when the social organization on which it depends breaks down. Example: When the Roman Empire fell apart the Romans\u2019 small-scale technology survived because any clever village craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith could make steel by Roman methods, and so forth. But the Romans\u2019 organization-dependent technology DID regress. Their aqueducts fell into disrepair and were never rebuilt. Their techniques of road construction were lost. The Roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten, so that not until rather recent times did the sanitation of European cities equal that of Ancient Rome.</span><br><br>You keep getting filtered.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

Despite being written by a philosophy PhD and being heavy on ideas, the ideas are all delivered in the context of a large scale fantasy conflict based on the First Crusade, generally as part of the world. A lot is characters restating famous positions in philosophy and showing the intersections and debates, but using a magic system where metaphysics affects magic in a cool way.

Fear of being alone, feaer of being looked at with scorn and bewilderment. Fear of being different. So they will marry the first woman who gives them the time of day, they will have an uneventful marriage and a kid or two who end up hating their guts. They will spend the rest of their life in half awake haze milling about through this industrial nightmare with no purpose behind it all. Forever chasing the image of what they yearn for. They will then scorn and shame boys who perhaps wish for something else until they menteally subdue them into making the same choices as they did.<br>Not that all men who choose this path are like this. Some accept the cards they were dealt and try to make the best of it, those ones usually have a more laid back attitude and a healthier outlook on life and relationships.<br><br>If you, on the other hand, for whatever reason wish to take a different path in life such is your right. Let no one tell you otherwise. No matter how many people think ill of me or however low my reputation gets I will never stop chasing young college aged girls. I will never not spend my summers sexpating around the orient. I will never work as a pathetic wageslave compared to my easygoing work as a contractor.<br>I will live my own life at my own pace.

When this did not occur, he became a socialist. This shift was caused by his observation that the Depression was harming American society. It was also influenced by the increase in socialism&#039;s political capital during the 1930s. One of the main points of Lovecraft&#039;s socialism was its opposition to Soviet Marxism, as he thought that a Marxist revolution would bring about the destruction of American civilization. Lovecraft thought that an intellectual aristocracy needed to be formed to preserve America.[138] His ideal political system is outlined in his 1933 essay &quot;Some Repetitions on the Times&quot;. Lovecraft used this essay to echo the political proposals that had been made over the course of the last few decades. In this essay, he advocates governmental control of resource distribution, fewer working hours and a higher wage, and unemployment insurance and old age pensions. He also outlines the need for an oligarchy of intellectuals. In his view, power must be restricted to those who are sufficiently intelligent and educated.[139] He frequently used the term &quot;fascism&quot; to describe this form of government, but, according to S. T. Joshi, it bears little resemblance to that ideology.[140]</span>", "time": 1671333369, "resto": 21393403}, {"no": 21398706, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:20:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398687</a><br>I was referring to the Spanish Republicans in particular with the nun executions, but you can find similar things with the Russian reds, the Paris Communards, etc. American socialism has always been tamer on religious matters, probably because as I mentioned the existence of powerful state churches was what enraged them against religion, and in America there was no single state church.", "time": 1671333637, "resto": 21393403}, {"no": 21398708, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:21:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398695</a><br>Meant for<br><a href=\"#p21398622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398622</a>", "time": 1671333698, "resto": 21393403}, {"no": 21398719, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:24:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398706</a><br>American socialism has always been tamer in general, because left or right, the base idea is that every man is still his own boss. <br>I don&#039;t think anyone wants to actually muck with that wonderful thing, even if they say they do.", "time": 1671333848, "resto": 21393403}, {"no": 21398728, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:26:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393445</a><br>Bro it&#039;s 2022, stop using fucking g**gle.<br>Duckduckgo<br>Yandex<br>Brave search<br>Bing<br>Seriously g**gle isn&#039;t good for shit anymore.

Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions.

Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active.

What does it MEAN that analogous developments occurred in India, with Mahayana and other soteriological movements introducing new ideas into the stagnant and formalistic ritualistic cults?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence.

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights.

The legal inequality of the two partners, bequeathed to us from earlier social conditions, is not the cause but the effect of the economic oppression of the woman. In the old communistic household, which comprised many couples and their children, the task entrusted to the women of managing the household was as much a public and socially necessary industry as the procuring of food by the men. With the patriarchal family, and still more with the single monogamous family, a change came. Household management lost its public character. It no longer concerned society. It became a private service; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all participation in social production. Not until the coming of modern large-scale industry was the road to social production opened to her again \u2013 and then only to the proletarian wife. But it was opened in such a manner that, if she carries out her duties in the private service of her family, she remains excluded from public production and unable to earn; and if she wants to take part in public production and earn independently, she cannot carry out family duties. And the wife\u2019s position in the factory is the position of women in all branches of business, right up to medicine and the law. The modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual families as its molecules.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/archive/ma<wbr>rx/works/1884/origin-family/ch02d.h<wbr>tm", "time": 1671095466, "resto": 21386174}, {"no": 21386260, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386174</a><br>Engels has evidence for his claims regarding the past.

Men generally spend more hours in paid work than women. Women are often forced to seek employment by the meagreness of their partner&#039;s wage. But since they are trying to earn a mere increment on top of their partner&#039;s wage, an additional sum to secure the family&#039;s survival, they don&#039;t need to be as picky with their choice of employment as men - they take up part-time, poorly remunerated jobs. Men, by contrast, need to earn enough to function as the primary &#039;breadwinner&#039; so that their wives can look after the household.

One interesting thing about it is that author said that the communist regime was much more competitive than capitalism in fact, it was ultra-competitive in comparison to capitalism, but it was through education like getting really good grades at school, or learning multiple languages, because that was the main asset in a system in which money wasn&#039;t a factor in your success in that system.

Even the people who made out in the best in the 90s were former communists who turned into capitalists. There were a lot of secret police guys who were sheltering dissidents, and dissidents were who spies. So when people rejected that for democratic freedoms of expression and association (which she thinks are good), they rejected everything about socialism and Marxism because that was the only way they could cope with what had happened, you attack ideas rather than the people who were all complicit, and that led to extreme hostility to everything that smacks of Marxism, socialism, or communism and all these ideas that have been part of the discourse of propaganda of the communist regime. Therefore, the democratic freedoms also became bound up in &quot;economic freedoms&quot; which is liberalism and privatizing everything and free markets, which produces a whole new group of victims, which is what happened when the main pro-capitalist party that took part bankrupted the country in a giant pyramid scheme which took the shine off and resulted in a civil war.

By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England, Fourierists in France, [See Robert Owen and Fran\u00e7ois Fourier] both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in both cases men outside the working-class movement, and looking rather to the \u201ceducated&quot; classes for support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany. Thus, in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, \u201crespectable\u201d; communism was the very opposite. And as our notion, from the very beginning, was that \u201cthe emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself,\u201d there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take.

The issue is not so much that they use &quot;big words&quot;, since often it is beneficial to have a lexicon of terms with a generally agreed upon meaning. The sciences are great at this, whenever I read a scientific abstract, I can understand immediately what the paper is about. &quot;Big words&quot; are taken from Greek and Latin roots and generally the meaning is easily deciphered. Moreover, in a scientific abstract, the motivation, results, and conclusion are all clearly related. The issue arises, funnily enough, in the humanities, where papers are written with overall poor communication. The reason for this is because unfortunately the humanities are responsible for policy, not the sciences. Certain policies are passed with ulterior motives which are obfuscated by &quot;complex&quot; theories and language underpinning them. For example online safety bills are often pushed as a means to protect children, and various papers and findings are purposefully misrepresented in the media. If we try to turn to the source material, it&#039;s all so convoluted and awkwardly written that we give up (if people at all bother to look at the source material, since, it&#039;s put behind a paywall and is almost always guaranteed to be difficult to understand without wasting one&#039;s free time). In reality, the policy of online safety is pushed because it forms a protective shield for political figures who want to punish anyone who uses the free and open internet to criticise them and their policies, since us proles shouldn&#039;t really be trusted to spread information to each other (we should save such a role to the &quot;objective&quot; press). <br><br><a href=\"#p21398391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398391</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nah, they are written that way in an attempt to make a rather sloppy and ambiguous language concise. Written in plain English a legal document would either be 10 times longer or filled with loop holes. </span><br>Except laws are full of loop holes, and these arise precisely because the obscure, lengthy documents allow for businesses to hire large teams of people to find and exploit loopholes. This is why so many lawyers exist - they exist because other lawyers exist. It&#039;s very similar to armies existing because other countries have armies. The people with the most resources will use their resources to build the best army, which thus enables the further accumulation of resources. <br><br><a href=\"#p21398436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398436</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is a massive difference between a dumb person trying to look smart and a smart person -- and that difference is what I am eluding to.</span><br>You present yourself as belonging to the latter, since you used the wrong &quot;alluding&quot;", "time": 1671331902, "resto": 21395999}, {"no": 21398660, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)22:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398614</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Except laws are full of loopholes</span><br>You are confusing intended loopholes for unintended loop holes.

Indeed, he was deterred from making it his chief medium only by the example of John Milton and the advice of Robert Southey and William Wordsworth, and as an old man he remarked, &quot;I am sometimes at a loss for an English word, for a Latin never.&quot; Though the &quot;Latin savour&quot; (Arthur Symons&#039;s phrase) and the formal skills of his works have always attracted the particular attention of fellow poets, so that Wordsworth, for instance, wrote to Landor that he would rather have been the author of his verses &quot;than of any produced in our time,&quot; T. S. Eliot summed up Landor&#039;s achievement as that of &quot;only a magnificent by-product,&quot; limited by a single-minded adherence to the classical humanist tradition that was under siege in the age of industrialization. William Butler Yeats in A Vision (1925), on the other hand, admired the completeness of Landor&#039;s cultural mask and saw it as one peculiarly appropriate for a notorious firebrand: &quot;The most violent of men, he uses his intellect to disengage a visionary image of perfect sanity ... seen always in the most serene and classic art imaginable.&quot;</span>", "filename": "Walter Savage Landor", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 448, "h": 293, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1671318398759137, "time": 1671318398, "md5": "kLXHLG3mcyw6hMEw+9yynQ==", "fsize": 19008, "resto": 21397825}, {"no": 21398330, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)20:13:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1671326030, "resto": 21397825}, {"no": 21398605, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)21:47:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s okay...

He was \u2018Father\u2019 for the day, elevated above his \u2018brothers\u2019 in this licensed folly. This of course gave even more opportunity for humour, particularly for a chaste figure like the nineteen-year-old John, particularly because he had been chosen at the last minute to fulfil the role, and perhaps even because of his appearance. John Milton was, by all accounts, a beautiful young man. One of his early biographers describes him as having auburn hair, a good complexion and an \u2018exceeding fair\u2019 oval face, the word fair carrying dominant meanings at the time of femininity and purity. John\u2019s portrait, painted as he approached his twenty-first birthday in 1629 (now known as the Onslow Portrait), reveals a young face with luscious full lips, an image of his innocence and, perhaps, his femininity.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So when he says, \u2018But I ask, how does it happen that I have so quickly become a Father?\u2019, John draws attention, playfully, both to his recent elevation to master of ceremonies and to his own sexual exploits, or lack of them: how come he is \u2018suddenly altered from female into male\u2019, he asks (making the joke in Greek). Having raised the issue, the speech becomes, remarkably, a public performance that challenges explicitly those who had bullied, denigrated and dismissed John over the preceding years. As he puts it, \u2018For some have recently called me \u201cLady\u201d. But why do I seem unmanly to them?\u2019 He wonders whether it is because \u2018I never had strength to go in for drinking competitions, or because, or because my hand has not grown calloused holding a plough-handle, or because I was not an ox-herd by the age of seven and so did not lie on my back in the midday sun; or lastly perhaps because I have not proved my manhood in the way these debauchees do.\u2019</span>", "time": 1671315467, "resto": 21396420}, {"no": 21397656, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)17:25:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397531</a><br>This thread is literally about Milton, a Protestant writer, you fucking faggot.

De Saumaise, or Salmasius as he was called in European Latin circles, was, like Milton, known for his remarkable facility with languages at an early age, with Hebrew, Arabic and Coptic among his linguistic armoury.
