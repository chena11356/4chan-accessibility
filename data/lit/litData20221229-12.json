I had decided to revisit Sonic Unleashed when I got a knock on my door. It was the mailman. \u201cPackage for Tom\u201d he said, handing me a small, rectangular cardboard box. I signed the form and took it inside as he left. It was from my old friend Kyle. That alone was kinda strange, given how I hadn\u2019t heard from him in two weeks. But what was actually inside the package was something a lot stranger. Inside was a note attached to a CD case. The handwriting was a little messy, like he was in a rush while writing it, but I managed to read it fine anyways. The note went like this:<br><br>Tom,<br>I can\u2019t take it anymore. I played the game attached to this note and I\u2019ve been losing my mind ever since!

Firstly, he would\u2019ve called me if something was actually wrong and secondly, he always had a flair for the dramatic. I pulled out the CD case and the cd inside had \u201cSonic\u201d written on it in black sharpie. I decided to put it in my spare PC, which is separate from the main one for the sole purpose of checking if any USB sticks I get from anyone else isn\u2019t filled with viruses. I put the disc in and found a rom for Sonic 1 on it. I installed a genesis emulator and used it to run the game.<br>It started out normal, but when I pressed the start button, something changed for about a frame before fading to black.

First off, there were no enemies, secondly, at one point the level just turned into nothing but flat land with a few trees as set decoration. Lastly, the music had changed to something that sounded like it would be a good melody if it were reversed. After that, it was onto Green Hill Zone Act 3, or rather just \u201cHill\u201d as it was called. Same weird music, same flat landscape.

The level was incredibly short-lived, with it only taking me around 30 seconds to get to the cutscene. Robotnik looked up as the screen panned to the right to reveal the \u201cSonic\u201d standing atop a purple Master Emerald.

Favoured by Anglicans but essentially translated from a secular perspective, with lots of textual notes highlighting differences in various ancient versions. It includes all books used by Catholics and Eastern Orthodox chuches, which is unusual.

The main option is the received Hebrew Old Testament. This is what the KJV and many other accurate Bibles are translated from. It is represented by texts like the Bomberg 1525 second edition Tanakh, but also others as well such as the Complutensian edition which came a few years earlier as well as other accurate editions of the Old Testament Hebrew (mostly Hebrew w/ some parts being in Syriac-Aramaic where appropriate) that came somewhat later, like Elias Hutter&#039;s 1587 edition of the Tanakh which came with hollow-type letters (for identifying root words).<br><br>The above is your first text type, it is the oldest and goes back to the original manuscripts, predating the others. The next text type appears to be the Greek &quot;Septuagint.&quot; However, there is an issue with this one that needs to be noted, because according to our historical sources, the original translation by the seventy elders (where this version got its name &quot;Septuagint&quot;) was only a translation of the books of Moses, not a translation of the entire Old Testament.<br><br>It isn&#039;t until the 3rd century AD that a complete Greek Old Testament is confirmed to exist, and it came from the scriptoria of Origen in the 3rd century AD, not BC. This version of the Old Testament is the primary basis of modern translations of the so-called &quot;Septuagint.&quot; Really they are based almost entirely, if not entirely, on Origen&#039;s work, and not on the older pre-Origen version, which we know little about as it is mostly lost except for a few fragments. It&#039;s likely that other writers translated various other passages of the Old Testament into Greek - aside from the books of Moses - between the original translation of the Torah and Origen&#039;s edition, which Origen neatly gathered together into his own edition before putting some edits of his own into it.<br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1672289374, "resto": 21436637}, {"no": 21447030, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)23:51:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447022</a><br>Scholars widely accept that Origen edited parts of this &quot;Hexaplar Septuagint,&quot; which comes to us from Origen&#039;s Hexapla, and other copyists who came after him. This &quot;Hexaplar Septuagint&quot; is the source for the version of the Old Testament which is missing all of these verses in Jeremiah and Proverbs, and the omitted Messianic prophecies mentioned previously, and it contains many other errors besides these. In Genesis chapter 5, for example, the ages of some of the patriarchs are changed, in such a way that Methuselah actually outlives the flood of Noah by fourteen years. Some translators of the Septuagint are too embarrassed by this fact and have taken the numbers for their ages from the Hebrew version in this part of Genesis in their translations in order to avoid this glaring error. For instance, the 2008 Septuagint translation, the OSB, borrows the numbers &quot;187&quot; and &quot;182&quot; for Genesis 5:25 and 5:28, respectively. Whereas the Greek Septuagint actually has the numbers &quot;167&quot; and &quot;188&quot; here, as can be seen in the 1844 Brenton Septuagint English translation or in the 1935 Rahlf&#039;s Septuagint (in Greek).<br><br>The third option beside these two is the Ben Asher Masoretic text. This is what modern versions, like the NKJV, the NIV and others use. It is based on the Biblia Hebraica of Rudolf Kittel, first published in 1906, and is also in Hebrew. This text is based on the Codex Leningradensis, among other sources, which comes from the Masoretes. The Masoretes were a medieval religious group. The &quot;Masoretic text&quot; is generally close to the original Hebrew, as mentioned in my first post, but it differs in some respects. For instance in 1 Kings 20:38 and 41, the word &quot;ashes&quot; from the original Hebrew instead says &quot;bandage&quot; in the Ben Asher MT. Also, in Zeph. 3:15, the phrase &quot;see evil&quot; is changed to &quot;fear evil&quot; in the MT, among other minor differences. These differences are not as numerous as the differences that exist with the Greek Septuagint, but still noteworthy.<br><br>I always recommend one take the first option, which is the oldest and the original version for both the Old Testament and the New Testament.", "time": 1672289482, "resto": 21436637}, {"no": 21447285, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:05:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21446881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446881</a><br>If you&#039;re Catholic or Protestant, you just stick to the Masoretic.

That is what people value about philosophy, the belief they can equally access the &quot;truth&quot;. Which is ironic because while that sounds very empowering, functionally it is a &quot;philosopher&quot; telling you what to think using elaborate and compelling language. You can deny them their power by finding them unconvincing, but so long as you believe in the overall tradition of accessing the truth you are probably rejecting them for some other guru that was more compelling. And what was the source of that? Why is there a general disagreement across time and space about what is compellingly presented as the truth? I think it is all post-hoc rationalizations for a nature we can&#039;t reflect on in an ultimately satisfying way. It&#039;s just what we are, what we do. Why do I desire what I do? Why does it seem to change? Why are the objects of my categories always so illusory, so fuzzy, always bucking out of my concepts and resulting in eureka moments of thinking new concepts, new ways to contain these notions? Why do I have notions, why do I desire anything at all, let alone my constantly shifting but particular desires? There isn&#039;t any way to know, just to make more or less detailed rationalizations, each one always based on some unreasoned assertions. It seems like my reason is always serving my nature, and I can&#039;t really grasp what my nature is anymore than a camera takes a picture of its medium. It is that impetus to keep doing things that I just can&#039;t explain, it&#039;s just there. But what I can discern is that I&#039;m surrounded by other things that seem similar to me in their automatic motion, whatever that desiring-doing stuff is. And they&#039;re susceptible to rationalizations, so there is some power in compelling them through rationalizations, even if I&#039;m just as much of an animal as them. Does everyone want to engage with that? No. Is there a fundamental reason to? Maybe they&#039;d like you to believe so, but no.

If you believe everything ultimately resolves into a single substance (not necessarily material substance but literally sub-stans, that which is &quot;under-standing&quot; or under-lying other things) then you are a monist (&quot;one-ist&quot;). If you believe ultimately there are two kinds of things, like two primal forces of Good and Evil, you are a dualist. <br><br>These are extremely general terms with many possible shades of meaning though. For example, monism is often used for pre-Socratic materialist monism, which is a form of materialist/physicalist reductionism (all things are ultimately just modifications or conglomerations of the one really underlying substance, which is some form of material stuff). Dualism is often used for creationist theologies like Judeo-Christian ones in which strictly speaking God is the one, true, originating &quot;substance,&quot; but once He has created creation, there are two irreducibly real things: creation (the &quot;conditioned&quot; world, since its being is conditioned by God) and the uncreated (the unconditioned condition of the conditioned: God). <br><br>Nondualism is a form of monism but it is generally and especially used for idealist philosophies in which all apparent, manifest being is reliant upon an ultimate divine being, like Plato&#039;s and Plotinus&#039; Good, Meister Eckhart&#039;s God, or the Hindu Brahman. These are often called &quot;emanationist&quot; philosophies because they describe the manifest and apparently multiplicitous/varied world as being an emanation from its non-manifest base, which is the divine being. Usually these philosophies constantly emphasize that the divine being from which everything else emanates and on which everything depends, as the unconditioned condition of all apparent being, is not itself &quot;a&quot; being, it is something beyond all being. A good source for this is The Cloud of Unknowing: God is beyond all knowing. Since we can only perceive and intuit conventional beings with our normal senses and thinking, we thus need higher forms of mystical intuition to &quot;grasp&quot; the divine &quot;non-being.&quot; But because we too are beings, dependent on this divine non-being, what we are actually doing when we grasp it is realizing that we ARE it, realizing &quot;its&quot; presence at the inmost &quot;center&quot; of ourselves. <br><br>The terms are just useful ways of talking about some of the paradoxes that arise from trying to discuss these topics.

There are two answers to that question, historical/contingent and logical/abstract. The historical/contingent answer is that Descartes, inspired by Galileo&#039;s and Kepler&#039;s platonically inspired mathematization of nature, took geometrical mathematics (both its ability to idealize and model physical phenomena AND its axiomatic-deductive method) as the ideal replacement for the scholastic Aristotelian paradigm that had by then been critiqued and de-centered for basically 150 years by Renaissance humanists and platonists. <br><br>Husserl has the best description of this in his &quot;Origin of Geometry&quot; essay, which is short but difficult. Basically, in this moment when &quot;normal science&quot; (to use Kuhn&#039;s terminology again) had broken down and was lacking a paradigm, Galileo and Descartes were instinctively groping about for other absolute standards capable of explaining the physical and manifest world. Remember this is 200 years into various philosophical trends: nominalism justifying an increase in philosophical concern with the this-worldly since the 14th century, early experimentalism in northern Italy (especially University of Padua), Copernicus&#039; anti-Ptolemaism, etc. There was a general feeling that the sciences were both capable of being put on a new footing, and needed to be, and that a new systematic rigor was the way to begin, AND that the faded Aristotelian physics still taught in the schools was probably not going to be it. That is the true context of both Galileo&#039;s &quot;Dialogue on the Two World Systems&quot; and Descartes&#039; Meditations. <br><br>So in that &quot;moment,&quot; Husserl argues, they landed on the mathematical/geometrical &quot;Euclidean&quot; method, shot through with extremely Platonic and Pythagorean ideas (including their mystical sides thanks to Renaissance hermeticism - cf. Kepler&#039;s Neoplatonism). And of course at this time mathematics is absolutely booming, the late 16th - early 17th centuries were a period of great innovation, prestige, and perceived potential in mathematics. Also keep in mind that around this time, mythical and poetic notions of the heavens were being called into question, for example by the invention of the telescope which famously demonstrated that they are not heavenly spheres but contingent bodies - thus indicating that what we should concern ourselves with is the mathematical/geometrical harmonies underlying them and not the bodies themselves.", "time": 1672251275, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444882, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444876</a><br>Descartes suspends his belief in all philosophical systems with his method of doubt, proclaims the mathematical/geometrical method based on deduction from &quot;clearly and distinctly&quot; perceived axioms as the surest one, and recommends it to all of philosophy (including natural philosophy or what we would call science) as its model. The major implications of this are twofold: (1) Descartes wants to be extremely careful about bestowing ontological status on anything, because with his deductive-axiomatic method, he has to start from ONLY those ideas that can be clearly and distinctly perceived. He can&#039;t just posit &quot;matter&quot; willy-nilly unless he has, in his mind, an absolutely clear logical idea of it, about which nobody in their right mind could argue. <br><br>(2) Descartes has necessarily inherited the crypto-Platonic, crypto-Pythagorean, Renaissance platonist tacit ASSUMPTION that underlying all particular physical things is their ideal form, which the post-Ptolemaic and frankly proto-Newtonian celestial geometrical mechanics of Kepler reveal - he is looking for ideal geometrical structures in everything. All apparent movements of the planets are just &quot;appearances&quot; to be brought into tighter and tighter correspondence with the ideal and harmonious geometrical structures underlying them, a very Platonic/Pythagorean idea. It&#039;s often said that Galileo &quot;brought Kepler down to Earth&quot; by applying this geometrizing ideal to terrestrial matter - a huge move, because prior to this, for thousands of years basically, astronomy and geometry were considered tandem subjects precisely because the &quot;superlunary&quot; celestial realm was considered so ideal in its nature/structure/movements, radically distinct from the grittier sublunar terrestrial reality down here. Galileo demonstrated forcefully and intuitively the applicability of geometrical abstraction to ALL PHENOMENA. In doing this he effectively inaugurated what we call classical mechanics.", "time": 1672251336, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444885, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:16:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444882</a><br>This is what inspired Descartes (and incidentally Hobbes&#039; extreme mechanistic materialism also). So now he has a deductive method that absolutely must designate the bare minimum of logically possible substances (underlying really existing things) in order to function, and a very strong preference for geometrizing idealizations of ALL external phenomena. When you combine these, you get the classic Cartesian dualism: as he says explicitly, when he tries to think of all existing phenomena, he finds that he can sort them all into two categories, as all other categories reveal themselves to be really just modifications or expressions of these two categories, which cannot be reduced to one another. The categories are, basically, mind and matter. But again, it&#039;s important that Descartes is trying to avoid any ambiguity, because these are intended as the absolutely primordial, inarguable, axiomatic starting points for all subsequent philosophical deduction. &quot;Mind&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; are too vague, they are subordinate expressions of the two categories. When pushed to logical extremes, as Descartes famously did in his thought experiment about the wax, the two categories have to be formulated in terms of their absolutely minimal phenomenal properties: the &quot;extended something&quot; and &quot;thinking something.&quot; (Ultimately God is the highest substance/category, as the other beings depend upon him.

Descartes has effectively divided the world into two spheres: the geometrical-quantitative and the conceptual-qualitative. From this division it&#039;s barely a hop and a jump to Locke&#039;s nominalistic &quot;primary and secondary qualities&quot; (what is real in the thing is its physicality; what is unreal is whatever qualia it causes in you, subjectively), which many readers of Locke happily interpreted as the modern distinction between &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;merely subjective,&quot; with special emphasis on the derogatory &quot;merely.&quot;", "time": 1672251398, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444887, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:17:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444885</a><br>This whole Keplerian-Galilean-Cartesian-Hobbes<wbr>ian-Lockean complex was also absorbed by Newton, who was the Einstein of the 18th century, even more famous than Einstein. He was basically considered to have &quot;finished&quot; science and conquered nature, because his method (premised on a fairly crude variant of Lockean epistemology) was so unbelievably powerful for geometrizing nature, as proved by its virtual completion of astronomy via the positing of the bare minimum of empirically observable forces (gravity acting upon abstract bodies in a geometrical plane), in a reduction similar to Descartes&#039;. But his system presupposed the geometrization of nature to the utmost degree. Even mass is just another variable, another function of a more primordial force better expressed in quantitative terms, terms that guarantee no connection to qualitative mental categories (like weightiness). In brief, the reason the Newtonian perfection of classical mechanics via calculus worked, and is still taught today prior to general and special relativity, is that it devised a method for finally reducing all apparent contingency (read: disparity between real objects and their geometrical models) to geometrizing, idealizing abstractions. Now the entire world could be &quot;reduced to physics.&quot; There were controversies about this, because there are severe epistemological problems inherent in calculus&#039; dealing with infinities and infinitesimals, but Newton was treated the way we treat Einstein. People wanted to be &quot;the Newton of X&quot; for two centuries. <br><br>And in the Newtonian system, just like in the Cartesian and Galilean systems, the idealizing geometrical abstraction of nature is presumed to be more primordial than any Lockean qualitative &quot;secondary qualities,&quot; including even those that we associate with matter, like &quot;weight,&quot; &quot;mass,&quot; etc. Competing materialist/atomist philosophies, like Gassendi&#039;s, never really stood a chance and were always relegated to being curiosities, because they were simply too qualitative, they smelled of the old qualitative physics.", "time": 1672251474, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444892, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:18:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444887</a><br>The one lingering problem in the Galilean-Cartesian terrestrializing of geometrical physics had been how to account for force. This was also a problem in late Aristotelian physics, where impetus theory was in development. The Aristotelian account of movement in his Physics is highly qualitative, involving non-geometrical categories and explanations in terms of essences etc. (this is what Galileo&#039;s &quot;Two World Systems&quot; is about). The desire was to maintain the non-qualitative, quantitative purity of geometrical space while also accounting for force and movement. Descartes&#039; answer to this was his famous corpuscularism, which famously denied void (because logically void would have to be given ontological status as a substance), and which never really worked - although it was extremely logically consequent, as it had to be according to the principles of Cartesianism. Newton&#039;s &quot;solution&quot; was simply to lean even harder into geometrization by accepting the existence of void - essentially the blank space between geometrized objects - without philosophical justification. And again because it simply worked so beautifully, corpuscularism basically died. <br><br>From then on, Newtonian physicalism has basically been our reflexive way of seeing external reality: as an ideal geometrical space or plane, that only appears lumpy and contingent at the manifest level of &quot;ordinary experience,&quot; which is implicitly inferior to &quot;scientific&quot; experience, which sees the &quot;real&quot; truth, the Newtonian and later the Einsteinian truth, which is mathematical abstraction. The original standpoint, that geometry/mechanics only abstracted natural phenomena for pragmatic reasons, and that the contingent lumpiness and qualitativeness of the manifest world was the primary, concrete reality of things, was overturned, and the basically platonic/pythagorean viewpoint of Galileo and Kepler was made reflexive and instinctive. The original relation of idealized model (IM) modelling apparent reality (AR) was changed into a relation of (IM) --&gt; (AR) &lt;-- (IR), where (IR) = ideal reality, so that both (IM) and (IR) are mathematical &quot;models,&quot; and greater truth is achieved by greater adequacy of (IM) to (IR).", "time": 1672251535, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444897, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:19:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444892</a><br>From this viewpoint, even ancient atomism and materialism seem quaint and unscientific, because they are insufficiently mathematically abstract.

Before Jesus Christ there were, without doubt, numerous examples of the experience of God\u2014being \u201cseized by God\u201d (experience of the prophets), being \u201cimmersed in God\u201d (experience of yogis and mystics in antiquity), or seeing the revelation of His work, the world (experience of sages and philosophers in antiquity), but no one ever saw God. For neither the inspiration of the prophets, nor the immersion in God of the mystics, nor the contemplation of God in the mirror of the creation by the sages is equivalent to the new experience of the \u201cvision\u201d of God\u2014the \u201cbeatific vision\u201d of Christian theology. For this \u201cvision\u201d takes place in the domain of essence transcending all substance; it is not a fusion, but an encounter in the domain of essence, in which the human personality (the consciousness of self) remains not only intact and without impediment, but also becomes \u201cthat which it is\u201d, i.e. becomes truly itself\u2014such as the Thought of God has conceived it for all eternity.</span><br><a href=\"#p21444837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444837</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;morass of urges and emotions</span><br>This is your brain on guenonism, the elimination of urges and emotions, ot rather matters of mental purification does not require your allegience with depersonalization, it does not require the elimination of the human personality. <br>Rather, the perfection of it and total harmonization of it with God-consciousness in such a way that the personality and consciousness is not made extinct, total perfection and heaven.", "time": 1672273891, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21446237, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:40:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21446206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446206</a><br>Now you can argue that yeah what I am saying is crass sentimentalism, and that buddhism and advaita defacto reject any notion of heaven, but yeah at least admit that this is depersonalization and that it is a distinct way, one of depersonalization opposed to a total personalization, and that the ends are totally different, and that there is a real distinction between these types of mysticism, of course both are right, <br>But my point in making this thread is to highlight that Gu\u00e9non is clearly making an error to reduce the original type of mysticism to the ways of depersonalization, and all traditions which are to be taken seriously, to crypto-depersonalization, he does so almost rhetorically, and tries to establish a sort of supremacy with respects to depersonalization, when really it seems that even sufis and kabbalists are not as extreme with nondualism, and do not teach a proper extinction of consciousness, like buddhism and vedanta, and pretend that there is no such thing, I am obviously not talking about a proper non-existence/cessation of consciousness, because according to the metaphysics, there is no existence apart from one God consciousness.

An advanced pupil of yoga or Vedanta will for ever have dry eyes, whilst the masters of the Cabbala, according to the Zohar, cry much and often. Christian mysticism speaks also of the \u201cgift of tears\u201d\u2014as a precious gift of divine grace. The Master cried in front of the tomb of Lazarus. Thus the outer characteristic of those who choose the other mystical way, that of the God of love, is that they have the \u201cgift of tears\u201d. This is in keeping with the very essence of their mystical experience. Their union with the Divine is not the absorption of their being by Divine Being, but rather the experience of the breath of Divine Love, the illumination by Divine Love, and the warmth of Divine Love. The soul which receives this undergoes such a miraculous experience that it cries. In this mystical experience fire meets with FIRE. Then nothing is extinguished in the human personality but, on the contrary, everything is set ablaze. This is the experience of \u201clegitimate twofoldness\u201d or the union of two separate substances in one sole essence. The substances remain separate as long as they are bereft of that which is the most precious in all existence: free alliance in love.</span>", "time": 1672274448, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21446259, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:47:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21446237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446237</a><br><a href=\"#p21446206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446206</a><br>For you to reduce anything which is not depersonalization, disassociation, which usually always leads to destroying individual dignity through extreme taboo breaking (see nondualistic tantra) which actually takes advaita seriously practically, to mere sentimentalism is simply just pride, spontaneously realizing yourself to be an illusion, superimposition, projection of ignorance, and for you to neither exist nor not-exist, without any subtle awareness, no power, no mind-image, no substantial perfection, is according to the personalistic mystics a type of sterility a defect. <br>You can argue that you just by depersonalizing possess these attributes, like perfection and all this, but then you are just lying to yourself with regards to the extent of your spiritual realization, as you dont really exist except absolutely as impartite infinite god-consciousness, so youre defending the spiritual path of noone at all, on here for no reason at all.", "time": 1672274846, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21446291, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)19:58:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442947</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just commit spiritual suicide and larp as a sage, whilst spending your entire life writing books on rhetoric, all to just say well &quot;metaphysics is what you cant define&quot; </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am so devoid of sentiment that I paritcipate in muslim rites for &quot;spiritual realization,&quot; and intentionally misinterpret sufi mysticism to be nondual vedanta, and buddhism, its not depersonalization or a negation of the individual bro, its supraindividual suprahuman states of consciousness samadhi (trance) I reach through chanting at dhikr ceremonies. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;absolute depersonalization is the way of the elite bro..</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am still a westerner but we are not the same, I am a deracinated superior brahmin, who doesnt even exist, or have any trace of individuality, as according to tradition we all know all that can do is dissolve... </span><br>Imagine taking this hack seriously", "filename": "1577987298653", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 544, "h": 800, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672275494687896, "time": 1672275494, "md5": "GDZPiwdOo7YkyiUhtIcr0w==", "fsize": 86932, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21446588, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)21:35:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21446259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446259</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For you to reduce anything which is not depersonalization, disassociation, ...to mere sentimentalism is simply just pride</span><br>I&#039;m not saying &quot;anything that isn&#039;t depersonalization is sentimentalism* anon.....

Atman IS non-conceptual awareness, but the whole point of Advaita is NOT to dissolve all thought permanently into a catatonic or lobotomy-like state until your body dies (this is a retarded misunderstanding), but rather the point is to realize the non-conceptual awareness that is present *at the same time as thought* and to realize that it&#039;s present always and free etc, even in the exact moment when conceptual thought is occurring, when you realize this experientially the occurrence of conceptual thought can happen at the exact same time as you having intuitive and immediate knowledge of your own non-conceptual awareness..... without the former erasing the latter... they can occur at the exact same time for the exact same person, ie the sage doesn&#039;t forget about or fail to notice the presence of his own foundational non-conceptual awareness simply because conceptual thought happens to be occurring.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also you talk about karma yoga and jnana yoga, but you should be more proper, the &quot;jnana yoga&quot; in the advaitins case is not at all any ordinary &quot;yoga,&quot; and what you call &quot;karma yoga,&quot; in the advaitins case is as valid as christian or sufic mysticism. See how plotinus attributes to what buddhists and advaitins do namely, severing the very root of the mind, as a &quot;defect of the body,&quot;</span><br>&quot;Slower&quot; is not treated as synonymous with &quot;invalid&quot; in Advaita so it&#039;s totally incorrect for you to imply that Advaitins consider karma yoga to be invalid. Karma Yoga is what is MOST valid for non-monks, and it has the potential of raising one&#039;s changes of being liberated in the post-death state (ie as in Brahmaloka), any path that leads to the same end goal is valid by virtue of doing so, even if some are a lot slower.

People also seem to miss that Bunny is a talking piece for what the group is actually like, he just made them look bad for being upfront about it. Secondly, Bunny was the only person kind to Richard in the beginning, regardless of if he tried to take advantage of him later at the dinner, he\u2019s the only reason Richard was able to make it \u201cin\u201d to the elite group. The book would have been much different if instead of Henry finding Richard in the cold, it was Bun, I really wonder what an alternative like that would look like. Also, Bunny was the only person who reacted appropriately to the farmer. You can see him breaking down over the morality issues he\u2019s facing over knowing when he talks to Richard about it, I really don\u2019t blame him for mooching off everyone during that as 1.) he was losing it 2.) those rich assholes <s>covered up a murder[spoiler/] as if that\u2019s not justification enough he was the only one who suggested they tell authorities what they had done. I notice when I talk to other queer people of colour we share the same opinions on this, when white queer and white straight people who read this book fully back the group and defend them and turn Bun into some type of villain when he was just a foil. Frances isn\u2019t innocent either, he enabled the group. The only person I have sympathy for to an extent is Richard, because he really did not know that the fuck he was getting into it what to do. He was out of his element and had never been around a class of people like that, he was most likely more underprivileged than just being of a working class family. His dad ran a gas station and he was from Plano, he\u2019s the only character who\u2019s skin colour isn\u2019t described in detail too. I don\u2019t care if Dartt herself told me to my face he is white, it would just make him so much less if a do-nothing character to imagine he was a normal Chicano from California who got mixed up with white kids who thought money made them invincible.</s>", "time": 1672198385, "resto": 21439677}, {"no": 21443534, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:13:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anyone read \u201cIf we were villains\u201d yet?

His argumentation is ultimately a new version of transcendental reflection: when I as a neuroscientist argue that I am just a set of neuronal and biological processes, I always do this in the form of rational argumentation, trying to convince others, as a part of scientific community\u2014the space of this community where I address others (and act as) a free rational being convinced by reasons is always-already here, operative in my activity, not as an abstract Cartesian cogito but as a human collective . . . So, to simplify the image a little bit, while Flisfeder is ready to sacrifi ce subject but not humanity, not the basic dimensions of our beinghuman, I am tempted to do the exact opposite: I am ready to sacrifice (what we perceived until now as) the basic features of our</span><br>being-human but not subject. \u201cHumanity\u201d is a notion at the same level as personality, the \u201cinner wealth\u201d of our soul, etc.\u2014it is ultimately a phenomenal form, a mask, which fills in the void that &quot;is\u201d subject. What subject stands for is the inhuman core of beinghuman: what Hegel called self-relating negativity; what Freud called death drive. So in the same way that Kant distinguished the subject of transcendental apperception from a person\u2019s soul and its wealth, in the same way Freud and Lacan distinguish the subject of the unconscious from the Jungian personality full of deep passions, we should in our unique predicament stick to the inhuman core of subjectivity against the temptations of being-human. Subject is what is in a human being more than human, the immortality of the death-drive which makes it a living dead being, something that insists beyond the cycle of life and death", "time": 1672263111, "resto": 21444646}, {"no": 21445539, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)16:32:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445518</a><br>Couldn&#039;t agree more.

I&#039;m sorry if they&#039;re not eloquent or well developed, but I hope that they are somewhat reasonable.<br><br>My primary reason is to do with faith/thought. The concept of an omnipotent God that, in Islam&#039;s case, has literally written down everything that will ever happen in a book, before any human existed, and who still punishes humans seems absurd to me. I have asked imams about how God can find people responsible for sinning, if the sins were preordained by God, and I have never heard a compelling answer. Free will in humans seems like it would have to limit God, which is impossible in Islam. If that is not possible, then God does not seem justified in punishing, or rewarding humans. I also don&#039;t see much reason to believe in Islam as a religion. Many of the claims that it makes are quite dated. The Quran claims to be an eternal message, yet Imams across the world are trying to sanitize it to make it palatable for modern, western tastes. Sects are emerging within Islam. It seems significantly weaker as a faith than it claims to be.<br><br>Social circumstances also play a role. It seems reasonable to expect that those who follow the correct religion live better than others in some sense. I don&#039;t mean just financially. I mean I expect that if one has access to some universal truth, that ones life is somehow more meaningful or more fulfilling. After observations of many muslims and muslim communities, I fail to see a link between Islam and a better life. There may be statistics that show that religious people are generally happier, but that is not the point. Among muslims, I see a quite depressing trend. Because they believe, they live quite predictable, dull lives intellectually. They don&#039;t seriously question anything. They don&#039;t think critically about the way that they live their lives. Most of them just sleep through their life as mediocre musilms, taking comfort in the promise of paradise. Not all muslims are like this, but so many of them are that it has led me to doubt the value of the faith. For me, anything that dulls one&#039;s mind is to be avoided, Islam seems to dull the minds of many people. Muslims that are not intellectually dull tend not to be good muslims. I think back to all the times I&#039;ve sat in Quran reading groups or muslim gatherings and I remember how dull the conversation is, nobody is challenged, there is no debate. I have much more respect for my less dogmatic friends, who are open to the possibility of being wrong.", "time": 1672299921, "resto": 21441170}, {"no": 21447583, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:48:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447579</a><br>hello.<br>i wrote this for people like you<br>it is currently a shambles and reads like the notes of a mental patient, because it is<br><br>give it a skim before the main contents of information, the part about philosophy and introduction<br>that covers, ramblingly, what you&#039;re asking about<br><br>let me know what you think about it, if you&#039;re not keen on reading it i&#039;ll try sum it up for you, otherwise...let me know", "filename": "316408791_175735998386005_3360863558337550350_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 598, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 103, "tim": 1672300139148728, "time": 1672300139, "md5": "m755vKCgJFwyTpBKUuGluA==", "fsize": 41956, "resto": 21441170}, {"no": 21447586, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)02:50:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447061</a><br>This is an interesting point, it is how I have been living my life thus far.

Then, he started to have an important exoteric practice of Islam.<br>The way he was feeling and thinking about religion, whether he considered Hinduism closer to primordial tradition or not, all of what is going in his mind DOESN&#039;T MATTER here, because the point is just demonstrating that he decided to live AS a muslim after he got closer to the teachings of that religion, that the 8 years span between his arrival in Egypt and his shahada were not spent doing nothing.

Miller, Jr. (1959)<br><br>A Canticle of Leibowitz is three novellas that have minimal overlap due each one taking place roughly six hundred years after the previous one. Its structure is due to it being a fix-up novel composed of previously serialized works that were revised to form a novel. As a general rule, I don&#039;t like fix-up novels, though I didn&#039;t know this was one until after I read it.<br><br>The three parts are concerned with with the Abbey of St. Leibowitz and its residents, though outsiders are also present, and there a few times where the narrative goes elsewhere. The titular Isaac Edward Leibowitz has been deceased for roughly six hundred years and serves no role other than he founded the abbey to preserve human knowledge and was martyred. Sometimes I found the story be so farcical that Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz seemed like a more appropriate reference.<br><br>This is very much an idea novel, to the exclusion of almost all else. I suppose it can be read for its post-apocalyptic nuclear fallout setting, but I don&#039;t know who would read it for the characters, as they&#039;re seemingly only for the functional purpose of delivering the narrative. The central idea, there are several, to me is that humanity is doomed to its own intentional self-destruction, over and over again. It&#039;s thoroughly fatalistic, but there are also elements of optimistic wishful thinking that are still with us today, particularly that are currently viable escapes from Earth. I also believe it to be Sisyphean, which may be what I dislike the most about it. The very concept of continually losing progress after much effort and suffering, over and over again, is disagreeable to me.<br><br>I&#039;m not able to relate to the effusive praise or awards I&#039;ve seen for this book, though I also feel the same way about Isaac Asimov&#039;s Foundation, of which it bears at least a passing resemblance. There are ideas, passages, and commentary that I enjoyed, but overall I wasn&#039;t able to engage with this is in any meaningful way. One of the main reasons for this is that I found it to be too concerned with allegory. They&#039;re of the Catholic sort, but there are many secular ones as well. I don&#039;t want to emphasize the Catholicism because despite itnearly omnipresent from beginning to end, I felt it was more a thematic choice to support the idea of cyclical history than to be religiously oriented fiction.<br><br>I won&#039;t be seeking out more from this series or author. The novel is worthwhile, but it&#039;s style doesn&#039;t suite my tastes. I don&#039;t have any issue with saying that others should try reading it and seeing what they think. If you enjoy a low-action novel about religion, long-term preservation of knowledge and tradition, philosophical contemplation, and ideals being more far important than people or anything else, then this may be something you&#039;d enjoy.<br><br>Rating: 3/5", "filename": "A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz_cover_1st_ed", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 315, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672243895838252, "time": 1672243895, "md5": "Qx6G0vz1XLdNP0BhWKb9dg==", "fsize": 31478, "resto": 21443786, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21444531, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:30:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444499</a><br>Nice dubs and another nice review.

He had a simple explanation of when and why this surge had started.

Before the Reformation the devil had kept Christendom in darkness, &#039;benumbed in conscience. The dawn of the true gospel had merely exposed the unbelief that had always been there. Calvin was forced to concede, however, that these unbelievers were not simply Catholics revealed in their true colours. They were people who had &#039;sampled the gospel, even if it were only a contemptuous nibble&#039;. Protestantism had taught them to &#039;make witty mockery of the absurdities of the papists, which in itself was a good thing, but they then proceeded to &#039;pour out the poison of their ungodliness in all directions, so that they fill the world with atheism&#039;. In particular, Calvin believed, they had drunk too deeply from one intoxicating Protestant doctrine: gospel freedom, the heady claim that Christians ought to be liberated from the laws and regulations of formal piety. A great many people&#039;, Calvin feared, were using that principle to &#039;emancipate themselves from obeying God himself.&quot;</span>", "time": 1672070466, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21435892, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:07:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435874</a><br>The original Reformation was understood to be magisterial in nature, which is to say that it was understood as being national.

Here&#039;s a full quote from Basil, with the context needed to actually understand what it&#039;s about:<br><br>&quot;... we have never, even at the present time, heard of a second God. Worshipping as we do God of God, we both confess the distinction of the Persons, and at the same time abide by the Monarchy. We do not fritter away the theology in a divided plurality, because one Form, so to say, united in the invariableness of the Godhead, is beheld in God the Father, and in God the Only begotten. For the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; since such as is the latter, such is the former, and such as is the former, such is the latter; and herein is the Unity. So that according to the distinction of Persons, both are one and one, and according to the community of Nature, one. How, then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a king, and of the king&#039;s image, and not of two kings. The majesty is not cloven in two, nor the glory divided. The sovereignty and authority over us is one, and so the doxology ascribed by us is not plural but one; because the honour paid to the image passes on to the prototype. Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the other case the Son is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is dependent on the form, so in the case of the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in the communion of the Godhead. One, moreover, is the Holy Spirit, and we speak of Him singly, conjoined as He is to the one Father through the one Son, and through Himself completing the adorable and blessed Trinity. Of Him the intimate relationship to the Father and the Son is sufficiently declared by the fact of His not being ranked in the plurality of the creation, but being spoken of singly; for he is not one of many, but One. For as there is one Father and one Son, so is there one Holy Ghost. ... &quot;<br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3<wbr>203.htm", "time": 1672073863, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21436039, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:00:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Epiphanius (d. 403), Bishop of Salamis, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem<br><br>&quot;I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there.

Even today, the icons of Orthodox Christians are not the center of worship, but the altar and the eucharist is.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1672198546, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442489, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:35:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the real tripcode</span><br>...", "time": 1672198558, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442492, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:36:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442482</a><br>The Divine Comedy<br>The Bible<br>Don Quixote", "time": 1672198593, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442514, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:43:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442423</a><br>where is this from?", "time": 1672199023, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442517, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all four James Joyce books</span><br>holy BASED", "time": 1672199072, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442538, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442461</a><br>Same /tv/boomer spamming genre shit all over the board.", "time": 1672199542, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442555, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:56:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br>I know Journey didn&#039;t make the list, and Demons has.

In the East the Mogul prince Dara Shikoh wrote the Confluence of the Two Seas, stressing the meeting between Sufism and early Hindu mysticism. The Rosicrucians in the West adopted almost literally the teaching of the Spanish illuminist Sufis in claiming an unbroken succession of inner teaching, in which they included \u2018Hermes.\u2019 ... Count Michael Maier in 1617 wrote Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecimal Nationum (Contributions of Twelve Nations to the Golden Table), in which he showed that the Sufic tradition of a succession of teachers was still being maintained. Among the alchemical teachers were several whom the Sufis also recognize, including Westerners who had studied Saracen lore. They are: Hermes of Egypt, Mary the Hebrew, Democritus of Greece, Morienus of Rome, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) of Arabia, Albertus Magnus of Germany, Arnold of Villaneuve of France, Thomas Aquinas of Italy, Raymond Lully of Spain, Roger Bacon of England, Melchior Cibiensis of Hungary, and Anonymus Sarmata (Michael Sendivogius) of Poland. All Western alchemy, of course, is attributed by tradition to Geber (Jabir Ibn el-Hayyan) the Sufi.\u201d<br><br>The text we were extracting then continues thus:]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sufi mysticism differs tremendously from other cults claiming to be mystical. Formal religion is for the Sufi merely a shell, though a genuine one, which fulfills a function. When the human consciousness has penetrated beyond this social framework, the Sufi understands the real meaning of religion. The mystics of other persuasions do not think in this manner at all. They may transcend outer religious forms, but they do not emphasize the fact that outer religion is only a prelude to special experience. Most ecstatics remain attached to a rapturous symbolization of some concept derived from their religion. The Sufi uses religion and psychology to pass beyond all this. Having done so, he \u201creturns to the world,\u201d to guide others on their way.</span>", "filename": "A5E4AA5F-8617-4FC7-A1B6-5D5DCF9B60B9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1132, "h": 980, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1672250928012424, "time": 1672250928, "md5": "8UayT2m6B3nH/Nk5rH8dew==", "fsize": 514719, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445043, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444856</a><br>A note about the bee/flower/honey analogy (one which also turns up sometimes in Sufi folk tales and teaching stories, if not identically then in a similar form): the Sufi here is the bee.

And, of course, Ibn Gabirol, the Jewish follower of the Arab Sufi, exercised an immense and widely recognized influence upon Western thought. God is called by the Jewish teacher Azriel in his system of the Cabala EN SOF, the absolutely infinite, and it was he who undertook to explain the Cabala to philosophers after its appearance in Europe ...</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This Sufi tradition is underlined by the Jewish Encyclopedia, which says, \u201cTo the spread of Sufism in the eighth century was probably due the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muhammadan countries at that period.

The effect of the Sufi system upon the mystical Jewish Markabah-Riders was so profound that some of the phenomena (the transition of colors and then to colorlessness, for example) produced in the mystic are identical with those of the Sufi.

As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non- Jews are totally satanic creatures &quot;in whom there is absolutely nothing good.&quot; Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is &quot;inessential,&quot; whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This book is circulated in countless editions, and its ideas are further propagated in the numerous &quot;discourses&quot; of the present hereditary Fuehrer of Habbad, the so- called Lubavitcher rabbi, M.M. Schneurssohn, who leads this powerful world- wide organization from his New York headquarters. In Israel these ideas are widely disseminated among the public at large, in the schools and in the army. (According to the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, Member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda was particularly stepped up before Israel&#039;s invasion of Lebanon in March 1978, in order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from &quot;Gentile wounded.&quot; This Nazi- like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but simply to &quot;Gentiles,&quot; goyim.) A former Israeli President, Shazar, was an ardent adherent of Habbad, and many top Israeli and American politicians headed by Prime Minister Begin publicly courted and supported it. This, in spite of the considerable unpopularity of the Lubavitcher rabbiin Israel he is widely criticized because he refuses to come to the Holy Land even for a visit and keeps himself in New York for obscure messianic reasons, while in New York his anti- Black attitude is notorious.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that, despite these pragmatic difficulties, Habbad can be publicly supported by so many top political figures owes much to the thoroughly disingenuous and misleading treatment by almost all scholars who have written about the Hassidic movement and its Habbad branch. This applies particularly to all who have written or are writing about it in English. They suppress the glaring evidence of the old Hassidic texts as well as the latter- day political implications that follow from them, which stare in the face of even a casual reader of the Israeli Hebrew press, in whose pages the Lubavitcher rabbi and other Hassidic leaders constantly publish the most rabid bloodthirsty statements and exhortations against all Arabs.</span>", "time": 1672257790, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445254, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)15:04:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445251</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A chief deceiver in this case, and a good example of the power of the deception, was Martin Buber. His numerous works eulogizing the whole Hassidic movement (including Habbad) never so much as hint at the real doctrines of Hassidism concerning non- Jews. The crime of deception is all the greater in view of the fact that Buber&#039;s eulogies of Hassidism were first published in German during the period of the rise of German nationalism and the accession of Nazism to power. But while ostensibly opposing Nazism, Buber glorified a movement holding and actually teaching doctrines about non- Jews not unlike the Nazi doctrines about Jews. One could of course argue that the Hassidic Jews of seventy or fifty years ago were the victims, and a &quot;white lie&quot; favoring a victim is excusable. But the consequences of deception are incalculable. Buber&#039;s works were translated into Hebrew, were made a powerful element of the Hebrew education in Israel, have greatly increased the power of the blood- thirsty Hassidic leaders, and have thus been an important factor in the rise of Israeli chauvinism and hate of all non- Jews. If we think about the many human beings who died of their wounds because Israeli army nurses, incited by Hassidic propaganda, refused to tend them, then a heavy onus for their blood lies on the head of Martin Buber.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I must mention here that in his adulation of Hassidism Buber far surpassed other Jewish scholars, particularly those writing in Hebrew (or, formerly, in Yiddish) or even in European languages but purely for a Jewish audience. In questions of internal Jewish interest, there had once been a great deal of justified criticism of the Hassidic movement. Their mysogynism (much more extreme than that common to all Jewish Orthodoxy), their indulgence in alcohol, their fanatical cult of their hereditary &quot;holy rabbis&quot; who extorted money from them, the numerous superstitions peculiar to themthese and many other negative traits were critically commented upon. But Buber&#039;s sentimental and deceitful romantization has won the day, especially in the USA and Israel, because it was in tune with the totalitarian admiration of anything &quot;genuinely Jewish&quot; and because certain &quot;left&quot; Jewish circles in which Buber had a particularly great influence have adopted this position.</span>", "time": 1672257851, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445272, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)15:11:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445251</a><br>My proof is already stated in the fact that Jewish philosophers tied to the origins of the Cabala were verifiably influenced by Sufi (and other Gentile) theologians and mystics, whom they respected enough to learn something from.

Once it comes up in its proper place, we&#039;ve learned that Meno likes what Socrates characterizes as &quot;tragical&quot; sounding accounts like the Empedoclean one Socrates offers about color as effluences. So it might be less surprising that the account starts off as if Socrates is letting him in on some big sacred secret teaching, the culmination of which is with a math demonstration cnducted with his slave (ha!) where the answer turns out to be an incommensurable line (ha!). Socrates then immediately follows up the demonstration by stating that they&#039;ve proven the presence of *opinions* (the word &quot;knowledge&quot; gets dropped) in the slaveboy, and then they continue on as if Recollection wasn&#039;t relevant anymore to rest of the dialogue. One of its last uses ends up characterizing Recollection in a &quot;rational&quot; manner as giving an account of causes through speech. (And &quot;speech&quot; here might be important, since Socrates asking if the slaveboy speaks Greek also brings up the issue of what language anything is learned about in Hades).

Merry Christmas! You should try it seriously, for your own benefit, but a word of caution - once you understand this system it becomes impossible not to see. People&#039;s functions start leaping out at you all the time, and sometimes you&#039;ll recognize correlation between persons you wouldn&#039;t necessarily want mentally associated, and it can have emotional effect.

Jung would be excited. Personality Types was a major part of his work, yet most of it was relegated to the past, and he was largely eclipsed by Freud in mainstream psychology. It&#039;s only with advanced development of his theories that the correlations to modern neurology will become fully clear. Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences.

It is easy to confuse order of precedence (both in time and in dependency) when you have not isolated the entities you are dealing with intellectually. As a rule of thumb, you should consider a statement problematic whenever it goes something like this: &quot;X comes from [negation of X]&quot;, as this directly violates one of the most fundamental principles of reality, which, in very simple terms, is that nothing comes from nothing, and the contrapositive that something comes from something (where these two somethings are related in their quiddity). There are at least two methods for dealing with this dilemma, however, neither of which you have admitted: Either we say that consciousness is caused by consciousness, thereby erasing the negation, or we say that consciousness is caused by something which is superior to consciousness (known as a &quot;virtual cause&quot;), in other words, &quot;supra-consciousness&quot;, in that it is not the same as consciousness (thereby is a negation of consciousness) yet possesses the power to actualize it and is superior in that it has this power, whereas consciousness itself does not. In other words, the &quot;unconscious&quot; only comes first when considered relatively, in isolation from reality as a whole. This is equivalent to a &quot;chicken-and-the-egg&quot; dilemma which cannot be resolved unless there is recourse to principles, which would clearly affirm the primacy of the chicken, at the very least in contingency.<br><br>Also, riddle me this: What is the difference between an unconscious mind and a computer, or any other mechanical contraption which performs computations?

In any situation where it seems that exerting a primal sort of power would actually make one lose power, this is because it violates the social collective\u2019s rules of value.

Nietzsche will also say that there\u2019s something distorted in the concept of withheld power or latent potential. There may be energy in tension ready to release like Heraclitus\u2019 Bow, but it isn\u2019t power until that release. Until the *effect*. I don\u2019t know how much Nietzsche commits his way of speaking about power to this sentiment (I have certain remarks from the genealogy of morals in mind here), but it should be kept in sight\u2026 Power is something that involves some sort of positive emanation, some consequence. If it doesn\u2019t emanate then it\u2019s status as \u201cpower\u201d is suspect.<br><br>As for the proof behind all this\u2026 that\u2019s elsewhere. It\u2019s a borderline naturalism, framed in some parts as a riposte against Darwinism. Contest for power as opposed to contest for survival. He goes on to say that it is the weak who tend to win this - like in Plato\u2019s Gorgias, the many, weak but colluding masses - are ultimately the stronger. The weak tend to win. They\u2019ve won history, as it stands. <br><br>Now this is probably the problem. Nietzsche spitting on something we consider important, supposing something unhealthy and cruel in its place. Endorsing selfishness and domineering over fellowship and altruism. It\u2019s subversive, maybe a bit ugly, but he will tell you in the very beginning of most of his works: He\u2019s putting these ideas, and his audience, to the test.<br> The seed of the Genealogy of Morals: \u201cwhat happens if we question the morality of compassion?\u201d<br>The seed of twilight of the idols: \u201cwhat sound will philosophy make as we hit it with a hammer [as with a tuning fork], will it ring hollow?\u201d<br><br>That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all hypothetical. He means more than enough of it. But the essence of any given argument is a step subtler than the bombastic and villainous rhetoric. He\u2019s fucking with you. Lightheartedness is what Nietzsche declares to be one his absolute operating principles. If you don\u2019t see this - the playfulness- if you hear someone cruel and hostile instead, you\u2019re missing something vital.", "time": 1672225401, "resto": 21436719}, {"no": 21443827, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:05:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21439375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21439375</a><br>Also I\u2019m ( <a href=\"#p21438909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21438909</a> ) not any of the people you were arguing with before.

Take Jews vs. European Christians, Nietzsche knew the history there and that Jewish antipathy toward Euro gentiles was motivated by resentment and humiliation and all those feelings due to having been quasi defeated so often, NOT by any sort of poor material treatment they were receiving in contemporary times. Same with Africans, Chinese. He knew that it wasn&#039;t a lack of material equity that was pissing these groups off, but the loss of their power and the ascendancy of Europe&#039;s, causes a resentment, that would inevitably be Europe&#039;s undoing if not dealt with. He knew that attempts to further oppress these groups to keep them at bay would only fuel their embittered resolve, and it has to be confronted and dealt with directly...any attempts to oppress or buy off these groups wouldn&#039;t do anything to tamp down the resentment and thus heal the relationship.

If a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not go.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo, you&#039;re not free,&quot; he said. &quot;The string you&#039;re tied to is perhaps no longer than other people&#039;s.

You need a touch of folly to do that; folly, d&#039;you see? You have to risk everything! But you&#039;ve got such a strong head, it&#039;ll always get the better of you. A man&#039;s head is like a grocer; it keeps accounts: I&#039;ve paid so much and earned so much and that means a profit of this much or a loss of that much! The head&#039;s a careful little shopkeeper; it never risks all it has, always keeps something in reserve. It never breaks the string. Ah no! It hangs on tight to it, the bastard! If the string slips out of its grasp, the head, poor devil, is lost, finished! But if a man doesn&#039;t break the string, tell me, what flavor is left in life? The flavor of camomile, weak camomile tea! Nothing like rum-that makes you see life inside out!\u201d<br><br>\u201cLife is trouble. Only death is not. To be alive is to undo your belt and *look* for trouble.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo. I don&#039;t believe in anything. How many times must I tell you that?

Like the Odyssey and Don Quixote, it is nearly plotless but never pointless. Like the heroes of those fictional sagas, its hero, Alexis Zorba, casts a larger shadow on the world than the world does on him. \u2026 Who is Zorba? He is Everyman with a Greek accent. He is Sinbad crossed with Sancho Panza. He is the Shavian Life Force poured into a long, lean, fierce-mustached Greek whose 65 years in the Mediterranean sun have neither dimmed his hawk eyes nor dulled his pagan laughter. \u2026 Zorba is a great unbeliever in everything but the abundant life. Pockmarked with bullet scars, he has no faith in war. Full of reverent awe before the universe, he cannot stomach organized religion or priests (&quot;[They] even fleece their fleas&quot;). Child of instinct, Zorba defines the hours as if he had created them. &quot;Daytime is a man,&quot; he explains, &quot;night is a woman.&quot; <br>On many a night Zorba heads for the home of Bouboulina, a blowzy, scow-bottomed &quot;old siren,&quot; once the darling of admirals and of fleets. When his boss refuses to make love to a young, appetizing widow, Zorba warns him: &quot;Every man has his folly, but the greatest folly of all ... is not to have one.&quot; The boss takes Zorba&#039;s advice to heart and the young widow to bed. Meanwhile, Zorba never misses a chance to ask such puzzlers as: What is a woman? Who made the stars? Why do men die? The boss&#039;s widow is murdered by puritanical peasants, Bouboulina dies, the lignite mine fails \u2014 and all these calamities lead to the heart of Zorba&#039;s message: live as if one were to die the next minute. <br>Zorba is too full of juice to die onstage. Author Kazantzakis tries to kill him off in a letter. His last words: &quot;I&#039;ve done heaps and heaps of things in my life, but I still did not do enough . . . Good night!&quot; But Author Kazantzakis reckons without his own talent. He has created Zorba, but he cannot kill him.<br>Review in TIME magazine (20 April 1953)", "time": 1672265037, "resto": 21445202}, {"no": 21445676, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)17:09:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445651</a><br>Here, his Odissey. <br><br>Here is the translation.

The earliest settlers were predominantly Puritans/Anglicans/Protestants who were trying to separate themselves from, among other things, the gaudy excesses of Catholic iconography. Calvinists especially were very secular in their art tastes; they liked paintings of landscapes that showed the beauty of God&#039;s creation as opposed to paintings of God himself. This attachment to boring, Doctor&#039;s office landscape art runs strong even today with boomers and their ravenous support of artists like Thomas Kinkade. This is also why America has a ton of boring, white, steepled churches but not a ton of image-rich cathedrals (government buildings got all the cathedral-like architecture instead). <br><br>Europe had centuries to develop its art and centuries for its citizens to acquire a taste for it. They had an entire Renaissance and were in the beginning throes of the Enlightenment when America was just being colonized. Nobody knew whether they wanted to do what they liked from the Old Country or just invent a whole new system. Classical fine art lost its prestige while craft flourished. America is a place of inventors and investors, not so much artists. Or at least not artists of the Old World kind. <br><br>So classical fine art has always struggled to gain a foothold here, especially among the no-nonsense working class. They&#039;ll pay for a 5-cent copy of The Saturday Evening Post with a beautiful Norman Rockwell illustration while upper crust elites sneer at them for it while trying to imitate their European superiors by ooohing and aaahhing over shit they make.

Once in power, it moves further on its pursuit of creating something new while also rooting itself ontologically. Basically, the creation of this new order, epoch, empire, era, renaissance, revival, aeon, etc. - founded on the ultra-nations civilizational Aryan blueprint of the past.

Or he could be a demon or fallen angel, wiling away his long existence by meddling in humanity\u2019s affairs.<br><br>I think for the fun of the narrative, all those interpretations are hinted at at different points in the novel. Personally I think the judge is a general symbol for man\u2019s timeless and inherently malevolent/violent/Dionysian nature which will never truly change or reform. See the quote from the beginning about scalping being present on 300,000 year old skulls, and the part about war existing before man was on earth, and that it was waiting for him.<br><br>I think that the Judge\u2019s embracing of science does not mean he symbolizes the progress of modernity. I do think it means that modernity will be swallowed up by man\u2019s violent/destructive nature. It will simply become a tool For the destruction. In the NYT interview from 1992 McCarthy says something about feeling suspicious of the idea of \u201cprogress,\u201d probably thinking of a kind of humanism, scientism kind of faith of the modern era, \u201cthings will get better and better\u201d type of thing.

What is the unwelcome message that someone doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge?

The judge is a representation of the violence inherent in mankind. This is a pretty obvious reading, but it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s wrong. Violence is an undefeatable part of the human condition, and as such cannot be killed. He always wins. He destroys whatever he wills to destroy, &quot;whatever exists without my knowledge&quot; and all that.<br><br>2. He&#039;s a gnostic archon on earth trying to keep humans in the horrible, violent world we&#039;re currently trapped in. This is actually supported a few places in the text, the biggest one that it actually explains that otherwise pretty inscrutable dream the kid has about the judge judging the coldforger&#039;s forgeries. The forger is attempting to imitate pneuma/divine spark, but is unable to. The judge works for a false god who cannot impart such beauty.

They argued that the creation of the cosmos cannot be free if it is the product of the Logos, because the Logos is eternally part of God, therefore the creation cannot have a beginning.

Theology is a very simple concept, really. As I have already pointed out, theology means &quot;study of the divine&quot;. The word &quot;theology&quot; is made up of two words, the word &quot;theos&quot; (meaning god) and &quot;logos&quot; (meaning reason or study). To claim that theology is an activity specifically related to Christianity or any particular revelation is ignorant, false, and biased. People have been &quot;studying the divine&quot; long before Christianity or Judaism. The Greeks were great theologians, even though they couldn&#039;t care less about the Torah or Jesus Christ. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When we do theology we proceed from the presuppositions rendered by holding that revelation is true</span><br>That is simply not true.

When you have faith, everything makes sense. You don&#039;t have to understand or argue about anything. Most importantly, you don&#039;t have to admit your own ignorance. When you have faith, the whole world makes perfect sense. So, it makes sense that you would consider a theology without faith to be lacking. In truth, it is not lacking at all. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whereas natural theology proceeds from what is known or at least knowable to everyone without exception</span><br>If it&#039;s a truth known to all, why can&#039;t you argue for it?

A handsome lady with pale skin and green eyes where in their shine you determine a spiritual aptitude unlike others. She initially moved to a village called Al-Riyadhah. The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil. When she moved, the people of Al-Riyadhah were so accepting (they are so even to this day) a stranger could mistake her for a native.</span><br>You can delete like 1/2 of that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She found an occupation by fixing broken electrical appliances and selling them. Apparently, she had a background in the electrics. She greatly reduced a great pile of broken machines that fostered vermins of all kinds so her value manifested sharply and was quickly appreciated. After saving enough money, she expanded her business by importing new electrical appliances from The Middle Kingdom. The town was only a couple miles from a popular trading route. They were mainly tools like saw machines and drills or conveniences such as lights and fans.</span><br>Pacing bro pacing. You&#039;re just listing exposition after exposition.

This makes the rhythm significantly faster. It also emphasizes &quot;closer and closer,&quot; whereas in the original all the alliterating repeating elements of the sentence feel equally flat.

A good analogue for an imaginary person is: a person in your dreams. You know they are a part of you and come from within, but you wouldn&#039;t think of them as yourself if you were talking to them; and you can tell they have somewhat separate wills from yours. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t much different from these dream people, except you can be aware of them while you are awake. In practice, imaginary friends can provide many benefits. They can provide companionship, motivation, love, understanding, or all these at once. It is up to each person to figure out why they are making an imaginary friend, and what void are they hoping to fill with them.<br><br>I also want to be abundantly clear about the following: there is nothing paranormal about this. There is no mysticism or magic here. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t demons or entities from another realm, and they certainly can&#039;t directly change the world around you.

Of the four pairs of examples offered<br>to show readers what to avoid and how to correct it, a staggering three out of the four are mistaken diagnoses. &quot;At<br>dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard&quot; is correctly identified as a passive clause, but the other three are all<br>errors:<br>&quot;There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground&quot; has no sign of the passive in it anywhere.<br>&quot;It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had&quot; also contains nothing that is<br>even reminiscent of the passive construction.<br>&quot;The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired&quot; is presumably fingered as passive<br>because of &quot;impaired,&quot; but that&#039;s a mistake. It&#039;s an adjective here. &quot;Become&quot; doesn&#039;t allow a following<br>passive clause. (Notice, for example, that &quot;A new edition became issued by the publishers&quot; is not<br>grammatical.)<br>These examples can be found all over the Web in study guides for freshman composition classes. (Try a Google<br>search on &quot;great number of dead leaves lying.&quot;) I have been told several times, by both students and<br>linguistics-faculty members, about writing instructors who think every occurrence of &quot;be&quot; is to be condemned for<br>being &quot;passive.&quot; No wonder, if Elements is their grammar bible. It is typical for college graduates today to be<br>unable to distinguish active from passive clauses. They often equate the grammatical notion of being passive with<br>the semantic one of not specifying the agent of an action. (They think &quot;a bus exploded&quot; is passive because it<br>doesn&#039;t say whether terrorists did it.)<br>The treatment of the passive is not an isolated slip. It is typical of Elements. The book&#039;s toxic mix of purism,<br>atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in English grammar. It is often so<br>misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules.

Jesus says: &quot;When you have done all that is commanded. . . .&quot; Jesus is not evading the problem of law and order. There is a divine law, which is a commandment, and which is addressed to us. Hence we have to fulfill it to the letter. We have to do all that is commanded. The sense or conviction of the utter futility of the work we do must not prevent us from doing it. The judgment of uselessness is no excuse for inaction. It is not before doing or praying or preaching that we are to proclaim their inutility. It is not before their work that Elisha, Jehu, and Hezekiah proclaim the uselessness of their work, which is only a fulfillment of God\u2019s action. Pronounced in advance, futility becomes justification of scorn of God and his word and work. It is after doing what is commanded, when everything has been done in the sphere of human decisions and means, when in terms of the relation to God every effort has been made to know the will of God and to obey it, when in the arena of life there has been full acceptance of all responsibilities and interpretations and commitments and conflicts, it is then and only then that the judgment takes on meaning: all this (that we had to do) is useless; all this we cast from us to put it in thy hands, O Lord; all this belongs no more to the human order but to the order of thy kingdom. Thou mayest use this or that work to build up the kingdom thou art preparing. In thy liberty thou mayest make as barren as the fig-tree any of the works which we have undertaken to thy glory. This is no longer our concern. It is no longer in our hands. What belonged to our sphere we have done. Now, 0 Lord, we may set it aside, having done all that was commanded.

It is we ourselves who must pronounce it on our work: &quot;We are unprofitable servants.&quot; God does not judge us thus. He does not reject either us or our works. Or rather, he does not echo the verdict if we have passed it ourselves. If (as Christ demands) we judge ourselves in this way when we have done all we could do and accepted all our responsibilities, if we are able to view our own works and most enthusiastic enterprises with the distance and detachment and humor that enable us to pronounce them useless, then we may be assured of hearing God say: &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant&quot; (Matthew 25:21). But if we pass in advance this bitter judgment of uselessness that paralyzes and discourages us, if we are thus completely lacking in love for God, or if on the other hand we magnify our works and regard them as important and successful (Jesus, little Jesus, I have so wonderfully exalted you, but if I had attacked you in your defenselessness your shame would have been as great as your glory. . . .), if we come before God decked out in the glory of these lofty, grandiose, and successful works, then . . . &quot;Woe to you that are rich&quot; (Luke 6:24), for the rich man today is the successful man. Everything is useless, and we are thus tempted to add: Everything, then, is vanity. We are tempted, for it is a temptation to do only what is useful and to assimilate the judgment of Ecclesiastes on vanity (1:2ff.) to the inutility which we have been briefly sketching. Now this spontaneous reaction raises a question. Why are we so concerned about utility? Why do we regard what is not useful as worthless? In reality, we are obsessed at this point by the views of our age and century and technology. Everything has to serve some purpose. If it does not, it is not worth doing.

As Ellul explains, humanity was once directed to tend to the garden for no apparent reason. Mankind rebelled by consuming the fruit that allowed us to judge, to leave the protection of God and supply those reasons for ourselves, and now we have no choice but to be enslaved to the necessity of work. And, in this way, faith in Christ&#039;s sacrifice is a way of abdicating this responsibility back to God and returning to the &quot;purposeless&quot; freedom found in the Garden of Eden. I can see why Ellul loves Ecclesiastes so much as well.

I would like to go back to what we discussed earlier, namely, the matter of declaring good and evil by saying: This is good and that is bad. What this really means is to put oneself in the place of God. Only God speaks the good. Either you say what God says or you say something else, and that is a problem. Putting yourself in God\u2019s place inevitably involves breaking the relationship with him; and since he is the living one (the totality of all being), any claim of replacing him involves cutting oneself off from life, which results in death. The text is commonly translated as: On (or from) the day you eat of it, you will die. However, the Hebrew text is in the imperfect tense; consequently, the future tense should not be used. It is not at all a punishment or penalty that is imposed. What the text is literally saying is that from the very day you ate of it you would be dead. It is not that you will die sometime in the future. What this means is that from the very moment you would wish to decree what is good and what is evil, it would mean that you are already dead. It is not a matter of a punishment, but of a process of breaking off with God by no longer listening to him, putting yourself in his place, from then on saying by yourself what is good and evil in his place; and you have begun to be dead. At this point, living in freedom is impossible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The situation is analogous to one in which a parent warns a child not to touch a hot stove because she will burn her hand. Burning her hand is not a punishment. There is only a punishment if the parent says: If you try to touch the stove, you must go to your room. The parent warns the child of the reality: to touch something hot is to burn your hand. We have hopelessly confused God\u2019s warnings with commandments. In the entire Old Testament, God only warns his people of what will happen if they do this or that.</span>", "time": 1671995211, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432643, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432639</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What our text reveals, therefore, is that the freedom of humanity exists only if they remain in communion with God, this communion being a relationship of love. All along we have seen the importance of love and sexual communion and so on, and all this is directed at the relationship of love between God and humanity, even in the most physical sense. Hence, what is commonly understood as a commandment is not at all a law imposed on humanity; it is not an imperative, a constraint, or something negative, but a condition for being alive. Humanity is told that in order to continue to live, it is not enough to eat from the tree of life, but you must remain in your relationship with God and receive the spirit, the spirit that comes and goes as an element of freedom; and because of this, you cannot claim the right of deciding what is good and evil in God\u2019s place, instead of listening to the Word of God. It is the very condition of freedom, because God reserves for humanity the possibility to do otherwise.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next comes the question of service. In the fifteenth verse we read that Yahweh takes humanity and puts them in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. It is rather amusing that many commentaries say something to the effect that this is ridiculous. Why work in a garden when it has already been explained that the soil produced all kinds of fruit by itself? Why did the garden have to be guarded? Father Chaine, in his commentary, concludes that the writer had a bad day and even a lapse of memory. I think, on the contrary, that this text is full of meaning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humanity is called to render a service, but one that is useless. Of course, the garden did not need to be cultivated since it was fruitful, and it did not need to be guarded since there were no external enemies. This is exactly the point: there is no necessity to work and there is no necessity to be productive. All there is, is the Word of God. God tells humanity that they are there to cultivate and keep the garden. What humanity is therefore faced with is: \u2018God says that I should do this, it serves no purpose, but I will do it.\u2019 What God says is the good. If, on the other hand, humanity begins to say, \u2018Of what use is it?\u2019 that is like the tree of knowledge of good and evil. \u2018Since the garden doesn\u2019t require cultivation, I do not need to work, and since there are no enemies, I do not need to guard it, so I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 That is the evil. This response may be morally legitimate: \u2018Since it serves no purpose, I will not do it.\u2019 But God said: \u2018Do it\u2019; and that is the trouble, to have confidence or not in the Word of God. This is the situation humanity had to face. In any case, it is clear that it is impossible to derive from these well-known texts the law of work. Work as such does not exist for humanity as a law of creation.</span>", "time": 1671995271, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432653, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432643</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That this text isn\u2019t about real work is confirmed by the use of the Hebrew word used for working the garden, namely, avoda, which means worship. In other words: \u2018You will worship God through working and guarding it, knowing very well that these actions are unnecessary; but it is simply a form of worship, and you honour and adore him by it. It is not in order to produce, but to honour in reciprocity.\u2019 All the early Jewish commentaries have strongly suggested that what this means is that God did not create humanity for nothing. He did not launch humanity into an emptiness. Humanity has a role to play. Leisure is not a life, and empty leisure is not good. This role, according to the Hebrew word avoda, is to bring the whole of the garden of Eden before God so that all of creation will adore God through this human service. When humanity serves God for nothing and without an objective, they bring the creation to worship God.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The above, I believe, is the meaning of verses 15 to 17. We begin to see where the story of good and evil comes from. Humanity could refuse to work, but this has consequences that we will soon examine. **The refusal to work for nothing led to the necessity of having to work for something. There no longer was any choice.**</span>", "time": 1671995344, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432684, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:17:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431886</a><br>Isnt lgbtsjwtfnpc just christianity with triple the slave morality and quintuple the child raping?

Not that I&#039;m against conservative morality, I live my life conservatively, but I want a better foundation for it that makes sense with both the OT and the NT. The problem is the fact that the NT is antinomian which makes it so easy for Christian churches to turn progressive in the name of &quot;love&quot;, especially when we try to consider the cosmological implications of the fact that some people are born attracted to the same sex. God has infinite love for these people, and yet made them the way they are. That raises the question: what is it about homosexuality (and not just the particular act of sodomy) that makes it reprehensible to all that is good? Is it all bad, or is only some of its tendencies (e.g. what we see peddled in LGBT pride parades, schools, and orgies) bad? We need better answers to this question or else we will continue to cede ground. <br><br>Here is what Ellul has to say about homosexuality in Freedom, Love, and Power, arguing that it homosexuality perverts the natural union that God created for humans to enjoy:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This brings me to the second question. When God says that \u2018it is not good,\u2019 it is the exact opposite of \u2018it is good,\u2019 which we find throughout the first creation account where everything is approved by the declaration that it is good. In other words, this is the first \u2018not good\u2019 in creation, \u2018it\u2019 being the solitude of man. Consequently, the evil is the break between man and woman; and this throughout the Bible remains absolutely fundamental. It is based on what could be considered as a kind of ontology or an overall conception of humanity. Because man does not know himself except by knowing the woman and vice versa, we can now understand why the Bible is so harsh with adultery and homosexuality \u2013 as flawed conceptions of what it is to be human. We have failed to understand this because we have made it into a simple question of morality; and once this is done we are lost, because neither morality nor nature can give us any firm guidance. In the Bible it is not a question of morality but a question of what humanity is, and this can only be discovered through the relationship isch\u2013ischah. Making a moral issue out of adultery or homosexuality continues to permit Christians to judge and condemn others, which is a double error. The text affirms monogamous relationships, which during the tenth century B.C. was highly unusual since there was not a single monogamous society in existence. Certainly the Jews were surrounded by completely polygamous societies. There is no question that this affirmation of monogamy on their part, as well as their establishment of cities of refuge, made them stand out. In the case of monogamy, the Jews were clear: it is a question of becoming human, and this complements what we have learned about humanity being in the image of God.</span>", "time": 1672066290, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436010, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435440</a><br>take that back based retard", "time": 1672073341, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436016, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:53:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431886</a><br>he was right about everything you christcuck faggot", "time": 1672073585, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436021, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:55:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21436016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21436016</a><br>Who was right about everything?

It&#039;s not that zoomers have no fight in them, it&#039;s that they cannot identify the sources of their discontent because they are so widely dispersed and integrated into the fabric of modern society. In some ways what zoomers face is more terrifying to me than what the silent generation faced, let&#039;s say, when they were carted off to WWI. At least the anxiety they experienced was concrete and had a definite cause: the war, the enemy. Zoomers seem to be going crazy because they cannot pinpoint what exactly is stressing them out because it is so ubiquitous as to be undetectable. So they&#039;re skittish, defenseless, on edge. <br><br>Culturally zoomers are the most destabilized generation in recent memory if not of all time. For most of history there could be a reasonable expectation that the birthing generation could transfer their way of life to the next generation relatively completely. Technological change was gradual and information reservoirs used to transmit the way of life was more manageable and controllable. These customs have been disrupted utterly. So older generations cannot guide the younger generations even if they wanted to. This leaves zoomers isolated and alienated from the cultural transmission of stabilizing traditions, customs, norms, and conventions. This would make anyone a bit crazy.<br><br>Add to this cultural disruption the cognitively damaging side effects of the new, disorderly digital culture with its declines in literacy, assaults on attention spans, and fragmentary , scattered impersonal milieus and it is not hard to understand zoomer&#039;s predicament. Many of them don&#039;t even know life without it.<br><br>To make matters of worse, the vast social experiments to which zoomers have been subjected include the covid shutdown during their pivotal years of development. With many recent college graduates shifted into a further dehumanized and alienating remote work culture where they essentially have minimal opportunties for the in-person social interactions which are fundamental to human nature. <br><br>Zoomers are also subject to personalized content feeds, which fragment and individualize the media they consume, making it hard for them to find common ground. They&#039;re used to everything being personalized for them and therefore have a difficult time conceiving of community or the common good. <br><br>More can be said.

To be clear I believe in the human powers for adaptation. What&#039;s troubling is that zoomers have been exposed to so much change across so many dimensions simultaneously, with no context or education to keep them up to pace with it. Indeed their ability to absorb this context is diminished by these technological changes even if it were up to date.<br><br>And up until now we haven&#039;t even gotten started with AI promising to possibly cause far more profound disruptions than anything that&#039;s come before. <br><br>Zoomers are cut out of time.

They are technologically encouraged to live in the present, which on its own has tremendous limitations for bearing the full psyche. And the future is a writhing mass of uncertainty and anxiety, with portents of doom and chaos being its only readable signs.<br><br>What zoomers need is some universal, collective focusing event which snaps them out of the tech induced hypnosis and allows them to find discover themselves unmediated by digital interlopings. Their problem is that their experience is too mediated, too indirect, and so they cannot connect with what&#039;s real and true to themselves. Instead they are adapted to being coupled to a digital interface which is tampering with their minds.

Is there any state where it&#039;s legal to do gender surgery at 12 or younger? I&#039;m not familiar with this</span><br>For one, sex change on children is already being normalized. It&#039;s now a fairly typical opinion that children can be trans and should have access to hormones; right now, it is legal in the US and many European countries to give puberty blocks- that have permanent and life-altering affects- to pre-pubertal children. A boy that takes puberty-blockers will permanently reduce his growth even if he stops taking them relatively early in his typical pubertal development, and a girl will see reduced breast function and hip development, the latter of which can complicate natural birth. There are other issues too.<br>Aside from the normalization(which is already a highly alarming issue) sex changes on anyone under the age of 21 is barbaric, and teenagers really are children. A seventeen year old girl does not have the mental faculties and sense of responsibility to know if she needs her breasts removed and chunks of her flesh carved into abominable appendages. Hormones are already permanently life altering and their prescription to minors is widespread; it would be better to tackle the issue before the butchery of pre-pubertal children is normalized to the point that that becomes widespread as well. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And I would support that bill</span><br>Then do it and it doesn&#039;t take any momentum away from the civil engineers that are working on the water in whatever bumfuck area.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Possibly yes, it could be less important than other things.

It was his explosive power which shattered the Victorian novel with its simpering maidens and ordered commonplaces; books which were without imagination or violence. I know that some people think he was fantastic, mad even, but the motives he employed in his work, violence and desire, are the very breath of literature. Much as we know has been made of his sentence to execution, which was commuted as he was waiting for his turn to be shot, and of his subsequent four years&#039; imprisonment in Siberia. But those events did not form his temperament though they may have intensified it, for he was always enamoured of violence, which makes him so modern. Also it made him distasteful to many of his contemporaries, Turgeniev for instance, who hated violence. Tolstoy admired him but he thought that he had little artistic accomplishment or mind. Yet, as he said, &#039;he admired his heart&#039;, a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... The Brothers Karamozov... made a deep impression on me... he created some unforgettable scenes [detail]... Madness you may call it, but therein may be the secret of his genius...
