I don\u2019t mean the greatest poet or the poet you enjoy the most, but the one whose display of skills like metrics, rhyme, rhythm, sonority, internal structure of the poem, etc, is the most rigorously complex and varied.<br><br>I don\u2019t know many poets outside the English tradition, although I know some Portuguese and some Spanish. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr: Yeats in English, Fernando Pessoa in Portuguese </span><br><br><br>In the English tradition I love Emily Dickinson above all other poets. To me her lyric poetry is the greatest of all. As for all kinds of poetry, the language of Shakespeare\u2019s plays is, to my mind, the greatest poetic language of all, and that makes Shakespeare the greatest poet. But Dickinson, even if some critics want to make us think she was greatly accomplished as a technical poet, is mostly at home with a single type of stanza and metrical pattern, and she doesn\u2019t care very much to break rules if the imagery and meaning of the poem would get diminished by following the constraints of the form. As for Shakespeare, he mostly used the sonnet and some fixed stanza forms for his longer poems (Venus and Adonis and Lucrece), and here and there used some different stanzas in the songs of the plays. But even Shakespeare seemed to be more interested in the sense and imagery than in experimentation with rhythms and more varied stanza forms. For him quatrains and variations of quatrains were good enough. His blank verse gradually became more relaxed and natural with time, and that means that it was starting to sound more and more like conversation and even prose, although his magnificent imagery never left him, and so he could write even plain prose and one would still feel he was presenting some of the greatest poetry of all time.<br><br>Now, when it comes down to technical skill and a constant willingness to challenge oneself and try to master several different forms of lyric poetry, I think Yeats it\u2019s the greatest of all poets in English. He\u2019s the poet whose work makes me think on things like The Art of Fugue. He uses all sorts of stanza forms and work hard to master all of them. His great poems are impeccable as verbal objects. I don\u2019t think he is a greater poet than Dickinson and Shakespeare, because poetry is more than form, but I think is just to call him the great master of fixed-form poetry in English, and even more so because he lived in an age where free-verse was becoming the dominant ruler of poetry writing.<br><br>1/2", "filename": "A292E4A7-3697-4917-9CB8-693DB6EABAC1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 739, "h": 415, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1675685926684938, "time": 1675685926, "md5": "BjgoqaT7KdHAS96HE1Gg2w==", "fsize": 32890, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "who-do-you-consider-to-be-the-most-technically", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21622650, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)07:21:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "In the Portuguese tradition the greatest poet I know when it comes down to technical skill is Fernando Pessoa, because he had a great mastery of rhythm, was at home with free verse, metrical verse, with rhyme and blank verse, with poems ion English and in Portuguese, and also tried a variety of different stanzas and fixed forms, even managing to write sonnets with strict rhyme and metrical structure that sounded as if they were free-verse (and he did it because the fictional poet in whose name the sonnet was written, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, was mostly a free-verse-writinf poet).

Perceived freedom is where you are bound to the laws, rules, and obligations of society but you are free to buy a house, start a family, drive a car etc providing that you meet the requirements to actually do so, that being have an income, have a good credit score, have the means to support and provide for the family, have a license and so on and so forth.

It offers nothing to political discourse but drawing a line between two sides and identifying who belongs to which, it does nothing for policy, for actions or any other means of political discourse.<br><br>You absolute fucking retard.", "filename": "lib-dem", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3249, "h": 2300, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1675660176292762, "time": 1675660176, "md5": "6ZvJEwoE11mqeC74IuGlSA==", "fsize": 1098437, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621852, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:28:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621753</a><br>I&#039;m monitoring this thread.

To put it simply, the ABSOLUTE left is that of absolute nihilism, subjectivity, egoism, and hedonism, and the ABSOLUTE right is that of a supernatural yet objective reality grounded by a higher principle, metaphysical truth, or higher power(s). An even more simple definition is simply this: Truth and relativity.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hierarchy.</span><br>One distinguishing feature of The Right is belief in an absolute power; power that does not radiate \u2018from below,\u2019 but which originates from above. This inevitably manifests itself as support for an absolute monarch (not beholden to the people), an objective hierarch that serves his own interests or that of the State (as a power greater than the simple desires of the people), or a form of theocracy (power from a god, God, or metaphysical Truth).<br>An argument against this might be that leftists have supported autocratic leaders in the past and continue, in some fashion or other, to support them. For example, Stalin was an indisputable leader of &quot;leftism&quot; yet an autocrat nonetheless. This discrepancy is fairly easy to explain; his power was justified not by a higher power (or by himself alone), but by his being a figurehead of the will of the proletariat. This is an emanation of power \u2018from below.&#039; His power was simply a representation of the base desires of the people, NOT that of a principle or of someone or something that is an OBJECTIVE HIERARCH.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truth</span><br>Another distinguishing feature of The Right is objectivity. The idea of reality, Truth, and Telos being OBJECTIVE in nature and not in any way relative to human beings. Leftism is diametrically opposed; there is not &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;reality&quot;, there is no &quot;fundamental purpose.&quot; A leftist MAY believe that there is an &quot;objective reality,&quot; but that this reality is ultimately indeterminable, unknown, uncertain, or even unimportant. In this regard, Protagoras sums up leftism: &quot;Man is the measure of all things.&quot;<br><br>Now for schizo-time: History is the proverbial Fall from the Garden of Eden. On the Right, Man governed by the most absolute of hierarchy, life at one with natural principles and truth and without &quot;philosophical mist&quot; over his eyes; everything is as it appears, and he lives out his telos with exactitude. On the Left, Man is purposeless, reality is in flux or unreal, truth is subjective, he cannot trust his own eyes. While it is unlikely for any specific movement to be &quot;purely&quot; right- or left-leaning, every political movement throughout history has had more or less of these qualities. The general trend is that of sprint towards the left, with minor &quot;re-adjustments&quot; back towards the Right. The Middle-Ages following the staunchly left-leaning Late Roman Empire is an example of a readjustment towards the Right.", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 1864, "h": 598, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 40, "tim": 1675662724221142, "time": 1675662724, "md5": "F2RkCEmnZ4pFClGR5z9QvA==", "fsize": 100161, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621902, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:53:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Damn, I used the draft image.", "time": 1675662800, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621909, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Another example of readjustment towards the objective Right is that of Classical Athens; Socrates and Plato were &quot;rightists&quot; steering the increasingly egalitarian and hedonistic Athenian society towards &quot;The Right.&quot;", "time": 1675662974, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621914, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:58:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621269</a><br>I recognize your shitty writing from other threads on this board.

Multiple posts now and you haven&#039;t given a conflicting context to what I have said. You&#039;re problem is that, and it&#039;s telling you repeatedly project this toward those with which you&#039;ve been arguing, you have a preset conclusion about something and isolate information that seems to confirm it. However, when a wider context is brought up you retreat from it and act as if the point you were making is an affirmed tautology that thereby allows you to monopolize the perameters by which things should be interpreted and dismissed. By this it&#039;s impossible to prove you wrong, in your own head at least, because you simply ignore what&#039;s inconvenient and assert your conclusion as if it&#039;s a fact.

I wish he looked like Casper instead. I do fine-to-good in social interactions, but the issue is getting to them in the first place, as i have resorted to never leaving the house out of shame. I&#039;ve convinced myself that I am worthless, that i have nothing to offer whatsover, through doing absolutely nothing out of the abundant time i had during the past 3 years. And i did nothing because i was terrified of not living to these incomprehensible standards that have been etched inside my head. The fact that i can make decisions is terrifying to me, as embarrassing and shameful it is to admit that, it nevertheless remains the truth of my condition. I fear the possible future where &#039;&#039;I fucked up&#039;&#039;. I can&#039;t even watch a movie without thinking that i&#039;m making the wrong choice! Despite having the sliver of lucidity that makes me realize how ridiculous this line of thinking is, I still haven&#039;t managed to make a single step forward. My actions during the day mostly consist of retreading the same old ground that i have trampled, to the point where i even on nostalgia for the most of the things i choose to interact with. The worst of it all is repeating my words like a dementia ridden fossil.

Humans like conformity and for most people it&#039;s natural to not just unconsciously mirror others but also to have a kind of social anxiety when they are failing to conform or when others do something socially unexpected. Someone who is unconcerned by those social smoothing exercises is considered odd and a potential danger to conformity, and conforming is linked to safety for most humans. It&#039;s the reason why people will say 2+2=5 if the five people before them have answered that way, even if they&#039;re sure the answer was 4. It&#039;s also why humans have developed social codes like active listening in Japanese (where you have to keep saying yes while the other people are talking to show you are listening), or talking about the weather to make polite small talk, or other codes of etiquette: so people know how to conform. In all societies you kind of have to actively show you are concerned about fitting in, or else as it&#039;s taken as an intentional fuck you guys, y&#039;all are lucky I&#039;m not armed right now.

The references and bibliography alone take up 144 pages. <br><br>Since I&#039;m just getting into philosophy and history, this book (alongside Mortimer J.

I feel so lucky to get to read about it. <br><br>My favorite part so far (I&#039;m just getting to the Scientific Revolution) has been about the revival of Stoicism in the early 17th century and how it countered the predominant view of Augustine&#039;s affirmations of Original Sin. I wonder if there is a parallel to the current rediscovery of Stoicism (i.e. Ryan Holliday) with the decline of organized religion. I get the sense that Stoicism, with its focus on practical self-control, is one of the more electrifying philosophies that appears when the theoretical, paralyzing philosophies become overwhelming or intolerable to people. The secular nihilism of today seems just as much a sedative as Original Sin; in both cases, it&#039;s like you&#039;re just waiting to die because either nothing you do in life matters, or because you&#039;re born so bad all you can do is spend your life repenting for a sliver of a chance to get into Heaven.<br><br>Anyway, it&#039;s a really good book so far and I would recommend to others (especially other Americans) who are interested in history. <br><br><a href=\"#p21619520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21619520</a><br>Nixon seems like one of the most secretly consequential presidents we&#039;ve had.

They feigned ignorance and then feigned distress, and sought other persons and other things to blame their actions upon. Indeed it is my view that they were fully aware and that their evasion of reality on such things is better understood as schizophrenia and psychopathy.

It is claimed that Europeans were Christians for perhaps 1,000 years yet the religion quickly lost its powers as soon as Men and Women fought and died for the right to read the contents of the Holy Book in their own language, no longer relying upon a slick pulpit reinterpretation, and quickly discovered it to be nonsense.<br><br>Much of the powers of this &#039;pseudo-elitism&#039; relies upon Men and Women being unlearned in the first place. To hold up a book and proclaim to have derived hidden wisdom from pages of nonsense, and this impresses only those of a disposition who believe themselves to &#039;be&#039; elite and who are poltoons in their intellect, as such people always are. This mystification of a Book which comes from being unable read that Book is no small matter; that particular school of academe has always seemed highly suspect to me, for: many of the authors they profess to read are simple minded upon actually reading them and the self-aggrandizement of such persons wound around that particular school of Academe is a pattern surely gleaned from when that school was an integral part of a Theocratic Institution. A complex subject and too much a diverge for this text to explore, but it suffices to say that perhaps not so intuitively that for a person to be trained in nonsense is for them to oppose wisdom whensoever they encounter it. This has shown itself to be true in my experiences as such persons, when going to any subject, are solely occupied with what a long dead Man had said of it and are unable to grasp the subject itself, being quite disinterested. This always did remind me of the Theocratic disposition as the manner of thought witnessed there among the venomous acolytes of the Late Prussian Muses mirrors, in the greatest possible maximal extent of their thoughts and actions, that of the Theocratic Dogmatist who, at least historically speaking, was a superfluous son sent away for preoccupation to ensure he would father no children and rationalize away his exit of the gene pool in favor of an elder brother&#039;s inheritance.<br><br>The matter of opposition to logic as consequence of being indoctrinated into nonsense is, I think, a statement that those far too drunk on their local variants of ethnos and pathos would be capable of wrapping their minds around.

But the soul found mercy at the hand of God; for such a most extraordinary interference of God&#039;s power and justice, and of Satan&#039;s influence, could not fail to bring the person to a state of the deepest humiliation and contrition; and thus, while the flesh was destroyed, the spirit was saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. No such power as this remains in the Church of God; none such should be assumed; the pretensions to it are as wicked as they are vain. It was the same power by which Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead, and Elymas the sorcerer struck blind.

Natural selection logically follows from three basic premises: <br>1: Traits are heritable, i.e. offspring resemble their parents <br>2: Individuals differ from one another, i.e. there is variation <br>3: Not every individual reproduces to the same extent, meaning that traits which facilitate reproduction is passed on to the next generation to a greater extent than traits that hinders reproduction. <br><br>The result is accumulation of beneficial traits over generations via a mechanical, unintentional process. Since what is beneficial depends on the environment, this in practice means that organisms becomes better adapted to their environments and since the environments differ - in combination with the creation of new variation via random mutations - gives rise to the great diversity of living nature. <br>Note that none of this requires a precise understanding of genetics; it merely require that traits are in fact heritable (which was well-known by then)<br><br>This is perfectly falsifiable in several ways, e.g. it postulates that complex adaptations cannot arise from one generation to the next, that no &quot;adaptations&quot; that harms the organism in its natural environment can arise, and that no adaptation in one species which has no other consequence but aiding another species at the expense of the carrier of the trait in question. <br><br>Regarding eugenics, you are most likely thinking of Darwin&#039;s cousin Francis Galton rather than his brother.

Does it cry? Does it commit suicide?&quot;<br>Obviously Walsh is trying to bait her to say something crazy in order to paint the picture that this faction of the new left is unreasonable, but my goal is to win hearts, not debates.<br>Forcier is concerned with the potential of children suffering emotionally to the point that they commit suicide. In order to rectify this scary possibility Forcier will go through any lengths to keep a child from experiencing negative emotion or outside pressure, we must &quot;affirm&quot; a child&#039;s desires and pacify negative emotion so that they&#039;re happy and non-suicidal.<br>While Forcier goes off the deep end of compassion to the point that she would overfeed the fish until its stomach ruptured, she still has the universal concern for the welfare of children. This is the ground to begin the &quot;discursive reasoning&quot; debate with your opponent, not in the fashion to prove them wrong, but to slowly coax them off the balcony ledge with small, reasonable, and shared assumptions.<br>Also notice how Forcier says &quot;it&quot;.

The other mistake they make lies in their axiomatic assumption in which everyone is a tabula rasa. They say that intersex people are free to express themselves in a new gender altogether free from societal constraints because obviously they&#039;re neither of the two, without realizing that intersex are NOT gender dysmorphic and are just aberrant male and females who (generally) still feel the sex instinct of their &quot;closest&quot; chromosomal/phenotypic counterpart.<br>Anyways a lefty said something along the lines of<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intersex people are wrong to go by rightoid sexual binary logic</span><br>Of course the hypocrisy of this individual lies in how he despises the right in taking away an individual&#039;s gender agency, but turns right back around and takes way the intersex&#039;s agency by saying that they&#039;re wrong to feel the way they do.

This is of course false, there are two genders but those two genders find EXPRESSION in a great many ways.

New Testament Greek was the same inelegant language of the marketplace, a \u201cpidgin language,\u201d according to Garry Wills, whose ideas about translating the Bible\u2014not to mention his translations themselves\u2014have been very important in bringing that language to life in these pages.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The detailed answer to the obvious question Why Greek? or Why koin\u0113? is a complicated one that would have to tell of Alexander the Great\u2019s overwhelming military and cultural conquests of the world, which, in fact, took place centuries before the seventy-five years we\u2019re dealing with in this book. For our purposes, suffice it to say that as Alexander conquered more lands and more people\u2014from Greece to Egypt and Israel, to India and beyond\u2014his language came with him, and if those people he conquered were to survive in the growing Empire, they would have to learn to communicate not just with those who took charge over them, but also those other foreign people Alexander defeated. And so they learned Greek\u2014and fast. As a result, the language they learned, or rather, fumbled to develop, was not the classical, literary Greek of Homer or Plato or Alexander\u2019s teacher Aristotle. It was a practical Greek used throughout Alexander\u2019s empire, and maintained under the Roman rule that followed, by diplomats and the military, merchants and their shoppers. In this new Greek, as Wills puts is, \u201cwords are strung together . . . to get across a basic meaning.\u201d</span>", "time": 1675669953, "resto": 21622074}, {"no": 21622121, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)02:53:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just run the text of your favourite book through gizoogle.net", "filename": "1662940653934", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 540, "h": 608, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1675670009534923, "time": 1675670009, "md5": "m7vsueiqN/VEdBmw6A6tww==", "fsize": 127147, "resto": 21622074}, {"no": 21622386, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)05:14:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21622074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21622074</a><br>Those chapters in Infinite Jest", "time": 1675678465, "resto": 21622074}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21621113, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)21:03:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;your MBTI personality type</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;recommend a book to /lit/</span><br><br>ENTP<br>pic related, havent even finished it but whatever really enjoying it so far..

The natural conclusion to Platonism, Catholicism, and Islam is that the majority of humanity are damned and will suffer eternal torments for having attached themselves to inferior perceived goods over the ultimate good (i.e., God). Massa damnata makes more logical sense than universalism otherwise why create a world with any pain or suffering unless to separate one&#039;s self from it as offer it as a taste for what is even worse in store. I genuinely believe most of my friends and parents will go to hell and rightfully so for having sin in them and refusing to repent and separate themselves from it. How can one ensure their child does not sin? This is a difficult task and even worse the consideration of all their progeny which if they have 3 children each after ten generations will number over 80,000. St. Augustine wrote on this and thought the singular extinction of humanity would bring more to the City of God. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I am aware of some that murmur: What, say they, if all men should abstain from all sexual intercourse, whence will the human race exist?

The only justification for their existence, temporal and eternal sufferings are to provide a sense of joy for the elect.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For the unhappy damned there is no compassion; there is no one to intercede with God to deliver them from the eternal death of Hell.

He has helped me understand (I think) some things about Chinese politics but on a very general and surface level. One feature of Confucianism is an extreme level of seriousness in politics where you will &quot;lose&quot; face if you show excessive emotions, which is just not like American politics, and there&#039;s also the emphasis on a centralized (and, in theory, meritocratic) bureaucracy running the government, which makes a big deal out of infrastructure projects and social order. <br><br>The Party is kinda selective about it though, they apparently prefer the classic Confucianism (pre-Eastern Han age) rather than Neo-Confucianism. Confucianism is apparently against elitism and distrustful of the merchant class and exercises that opposition through an army of test-taking civil servants (today these are the CPC cadres who take a national civil servant exam) who are empowered to boss around the rich elites, but it&#039;s also against public or the politics of the &quot;mob,&quot; which makes it fairly autocratic by Western standards. The emperor today is the Party (or Xi but he&#039;s produced by the Party). Here are some civil servants:<br><br>https://youtu.be/hkvilRPqX9A<br><br>There&#039;s a focus on &quot;harmony,&quot; so you don&#039;t produce extreme far-right nor extreme far-left such that the central-left and central-right as the majority in the country will just constructively agree or disagree on most of the issues, at least in theory, or without forming into tribal camps. This is why trying to project Western far-left/far-right politics onto China doesn&#039;t work I think... like it is a fairly autocratic state by our standards but it&#039;s paradoxically a rather &quot;moderate&quot; one.

While the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is not an enemy, it has developed into a powerful competitor worthy of closer examination. If we (the US) are to follow the advice of PLA analysts, and do what they are doing, then we should be using peacetime to contemplate how their strategic thought is developed and implemented. Keeping a finger on the pulse of the PLA\u2019s thought process as it proceeds with confidence (and some degree of arrogance) into the second decade of the 21st century will allow the US to assess the probable direction (or uncover purposeful misdirection) inherent in PLA strategy. Accordingly, any required adjustments to US military strategy can be formulated. The analysis merely suggests a way of considering or thinking about PLA strategy and not necessarily the way. The discussion and conclusions are almost solely based on the use of translated Chinese documents and, as such, attempt to offer a purely Chinese perspective on the content, goals, and implementation of strategy.</span>", "filename": "42489723947293432", "ext": ".png", "w": 350, "h": 523, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675664930853551, "time": 1675664930, "md5": "j2bJB1JMtVFJLPrY99Re0g==", "fsize": 149082, "resto": 21621762}, {"no": 21621985, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)01:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621762</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He gets a bad wrap in the west I think but I feel most of that is just the fact he preached adherence to the state.</span><br>Far as I understand, he lived in turmultious times.

The north is the symbol of the physical because of its relation to ice (crystallized water) and to the body (crystallized spirit). In man the light shines toward the north but never from it, because the body has no light of its own but shines with the reflected glory of the divine life-particles concealed within physical substance. For this reason the moon is accepted as the symbol of man&#039;s physical nature. CHiram is the mysterious fiery, airy water which must be raised through the three grand centers symbolized by the ladder with three rungs and the sunburst flowers mentioned in the description of the Hindu painting. It must also pass upward by means of the ladder of seven rungs-the seven plexuses proximate to the spine. The nine segments of the sacrum and coccyx are pierced by ten foramina, through which pass the roots of the Tree of Life. Nine is the sacred number of man, and in the symbolism of the sacrum and coccyx a great mystery is concealed. That part of the body from the kidneys downward was termed by the early Qabbalists the Land of Egypt into which the children of Israel were taken during the captivity. Out of Egypt, Moses (the illuminated mind, as his name implies) led the tribes of Israel (the twelve faculties) by raising the brazen serpent in the wilderness upon the symbol of the Tau cross. Not only CHiram but the god-men of nearly every pagan Mystery ritual are personifications of the Spirit Fire in the human spinal cord.</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/st<wbr>a/sta18.htm", "filename": "restorednewtesta00pry_0031", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 325, "h": 507, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675396538859919, "time": 1675396538, "md5": "1X6o8627UoZymhMloKMqJg==", "fsize": 43156, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607424, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:05:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;<br><br>You have to believe on Jesus and then you will have the indwelling of the holy spirit to guide and teach you.<br><br>bannedpreaching.com/videos/BIBLEWAY<wbr>TOHEAVEN.mp4", "time": 1675397155, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607450, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607424</a><br>fuck off protestant smoothbrain, this thread is not for you", "time": 1675398010, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607476, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here&#039;s the esoteric meaning of the Behemoth and Leviathan<br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg43.htm<br>Info on Moses<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MOSES AN INITIATE</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg45.htm", "time": 1675398771, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607521, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:51:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>Esoteric meaning just means you&#039;re coming up with your own thing.

The other ones you seem to be misinterpreting a bit because that&#039;s not quite technically what it said. Samson didn&#039;t literally gain strength simply from keeping his nazarite vows, after all there were other people who were also nazarites; rather it was God that did it. It was all done for a specific reason to show us some things, and there are many teachings that find their application here. The term dragon is used in the Bible interchangeably with serpent, so that&#039;s nothing out of the ordinary. And unicorns are the same as rhinocerous, according to the 1611 footnotes they even specifically told us that. Lastly, the &quot;serpent&quot; entity didn&#039;t become a full-on snake until after it was cursed. It may have looked like something else before the fall. But we also have a talking donkey in another place, so yes there are very unusual things that have happened, but they all did for a reason. Hope that helps anon. Something can literally happen and at the same time have important lessons for us in them. For instance, Sodom and Gomorrha were destroyed with physical fire and brimstone, but it served a purpose to teach us that God considers it an abomination.

Like the number 40 keeps popping up. <br><br> <s>Moses stays on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights. Before his temptation, Jesus fasted &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; in the Judean desert. Forty days was the period from the resurrection of Jesus to the ascension of Jesus. According to Stephen, Moses&#039; life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people. In modern Christian practice, Lent consists of the 40 days preceding Easter. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count, there are 46 days in total of Lent; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included. The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Kirk Kilisse, &quot;Forty Churches&quot; in Eastern Thrace. Rain fell for &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; during the deluge.</s> <br><br>And then there are all those bizarre parallels between classical Paganism and Christianity.<br><br><s>The virgin Persephone&#039;s son, who was conceived by her father Zeus, was Dionysus. Dionysus is the god of bread and wine, Jesus is the transformer of water into wine and the multiplier of loaves of bread, and his primary rite involves the consecration of bread and wine which are said to transmute into the literal presence of the Lord, like in the Eleusian mysteries where the stalk of grain was to represent the literal presence of Persephone. Jesus was the son of the Virgin Mary, just as Dionysus was the son of the virgin Persephone, and in both cases the father God of heaven conceived in the virgin to give birth to a god of bread and wine. In the Greek instance, it&#039;s the maiden mother who descended into the underworld; in the Christian, it&#039;s her son the culture hero. In the Greek, the mother is resurrected as the staple wheat crop; in the Christian, the son is resurrected as the physical bread of life. Even the primordial even that initiated the whole cycle in both stories was the lord of the underworld using a plant to tempt the maiden into his clutches. </s><br><br>So what do you make of all that, retard?", "filename": "Fm2uMIRaMAUWpkj", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3800, "h": 2500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1675408989905586, "time": 1675408989, "md5": "VA/5yQt+bIOVF0L4iF6u8Q==", "fsize": 617005, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607825, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:32:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>Neville Goddard (Law of Assumption [LOA]) did Biblical interpretation.", "time": 1675409560, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607855, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:48:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605980</a><br>Based post-modernist", "time": 1675410515, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607864, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:55:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607807</a><br>You might like this anon<br>https://pathofregeneration.org/sear<wbr>ch/The+return+of+persephone", "time": 1675410937, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607890, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:03:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Initiation in St. John\u2019s Gospel</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first eleven verses in the second chapter contain the allegorical representation of the last and final Initiation; herein we find mention of all the divine and human \u201cprinciples\u201d veiled in allegorical language, and personified, and of the purification wrought in them by Initiation; the incident ends abruptly and mysteriously, so much so, that we have reason to suspect that more was originally added.

I got to my hidden camp that I have in a gulch beyond what I call \u201cDiagonal Gulch.\u201d I stayed there through the following day, August 6. I felt the peace of the forest there. But there are few huckleberries there, and though there are deer, there is very little small game. Furthermore, it had been a long time since I had seen the beautiful and isolated plateau where the various branches of Trout Creek originate. So I decided to take off for that area on the 7th of August.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A little after crossing the roads in the neighborhood of Crater Mountain I began to hear chain saws; the sound seemed to be coming from the upper reaches of Rooster Bill Creek. I assumed they were cutting trees; I didn\u2019t like it but I thought I would be able to avoid such things when I got onto the plateau. Walking across the hillsides on my way there, I saw down below me a new road that had not been there previously, and that appeared to cross one of the ridges that close in Stemple Creek. This made me feel a little sick. Nevertheless, I went on to the plateau.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What I found there broke my heart. The plateau was criss-crossed with new roads, broad and well-made for roads of that kind. The plateau is ruined forever. The only thing that could save it now would be the collapse of the technological society. I couldn\u2019t bear it. That was the best and most beautiful and isolated place around here and I have wonderful memories of it. \u201cOne road passed within a couple of hundred feet of a lovely spot where I camped for a long time a few years ago and passed many happy hours. Full of grief and rage I went back and camped by South Fork Humbug Creek\u2026\u201d The next day I started for my home cabin.
