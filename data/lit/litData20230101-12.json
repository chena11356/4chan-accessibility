That\u2019s not to say that I can\u2019t trust them on a superficial level. If it\u2019s just a matter of something simple like asking a favour, then there\u2019s usually not a problem because the stakes aren\u2019t often very high.<br><br>But whenever strong emotions enter the picture, then, as a sheltered and guarded person, any true vulnerability feels like cracking my wall open and more or less inviting danger and risk to come flooding in.<br><br>I don\u2019t like taking risks or making mistakes. I like to plan ahead as much as is humanly possible, and learn from the mistakes other people make. That\u2019s the smart approach. It\u2019s not always safe, but it\u2019s the best way to avoid most trouble in life.<br><br>But it also means that you don\u2019t seem very approachable. In fact, you can very easily come across as being antisocial or even hateful towards others, while secretly on the inside, you\u2019re a boiler room of emotions waiting to cause a steam explosion.<br><br>As a rational man with guarded emotions, being vulnerable would put me in a position where I don\u2019t have full control if things go wrong. And although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an essential \u201ccomponent\u201d of intimacy, letting go of all inhibitions and allowing myself to just be in the moment, well, that\u2019s too scary for me because it seems like such an irresponsible thing to do.<br><br>How can I trust that my partner will know what to do if things go wrong? How can I be sure that she will accept this other side of my personality?<br><br>I suppose the answer is that I can\u2019t know that. Not until I\u2019ve put myself in a situation where complete openness is necessary. And by that point, it\u2019s too late to pull back.<br><br>People have never given me good enough reason to trust in them, so it\u2019s very hard to change my attitude towards them. But this also creates a heavy burden to live with. Especially when I\u2019m unable to receive compliments, gifts, cry at funerals or even express genuine happiness for others.<br><br>As a deeply insecure man, I instinctively feel that I\u2019m not needed anywhere. So if I show other people how I truly feel about them, I will only end up embarrassing them or make them feel annoyed with me. I don\u2019t feel as if I have anything of value to bring to their lives, so if I try to act like others do, then it ends up looking forced and insincere.<br><br>And this, in turn, makes me feel very guilty and like the most rotten person in the world. And because depression is the one emotion I\u2019m somehow able to express very well, a guilty look and a rotten personality is exactly what others see in those moments. So they feel saddened and offended by my apparent dislike of their happiness.<br><br>I \u201cdeal\u201d with all of this by \u201cfreezing up\u201d and trying to be as emotionless as possible, just to avoid as much confusion and misunderstanding as I can.", "time": 1672545882, "resto": 21462208}, {"no": 21462469, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:06:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462208</a>", "filename": "stoner", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 313, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672545987220450, "time": 1672545987, "md5": "37Qo+0EvXKTj0LIFnjmZPA==", "fsize": 16382, "resto": 21462208}, {"no": 21462472, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:10:39", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "9780811204811_p0_v3_s1200x630", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 630, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672546239441129, "time": 1672546239, "md5": "AxXIbxp291HA9P4otGMRhg==", "fsize": 22757, "resto": 21462208}, {"no": 21462493, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:18:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462464</a><br>Where did this copypasta come from?

Particularly, and ironically, about sexual matters they are neurotically fearful of anything which does not neatly fit their sensibilities. Though maybe everyone&#039;s like that to an extent if I&#039;m honest. There&#039;s probably some necessary social function to the creation of all these social standards of proper v.s improper behavior. The only difference is progressives are deceitful, pretending they don&#039;t have any standards so as to project a pretense of superiority.<br>To give a concrete example, in a literature class we were reading &quot;A Tale of Two Women&quot; by D.H Lawrence. In this novel there is a kind of skeevy character, an artist, who is described as drawing nude art of a 17 year old girl. <br>Most of the class seemed very offended and disgusted by this character, thought he was borderline &quot;pedophiliac&quot;. <br>He&#039;s definitely kind of creepy, but she&#039;s almost an adult, and if an adult wants to have their picture drawn nude, it&#039;s just a drawing.<br>This was one moment when I started to realize the disconnect between progressive rhetoric about sexuality &amp; actual beliefs, and it&#039;s quite possible the one stems from the other. <br>Though at another level, irregardless of political orientation regarding women many topics trigger this protective impulse in us.<br>Perhaps the open discussion of sex fuels a kind of paranoia underneath to compensate. Even the supposedly open rhetoric about sex on college campuses, the &quot;sex out loud&quot; groups I remember, were duplicitous. These groups make the realities of sex more obscure by trying to promote their fictitious vision of a perfectly clean, rational sexuality. Yet in trying to promote these standards they ironically end up recreating the same prudish standards they profess to hate. <br>These types very much resemble the Christian moralizing reformer of yesteryear. Think of the progressive Christian reformer of the early 20th century proselytizing against the uncouth behavior of new immigrants who did not hew to their protestant standards. They watch media with the same breathless moralizing hysteria, with the express purpose of encountering certain no-nos, which they secretly love (because if media were devoid of these no-nos, then there would be nothing for them to complain about). They wait excitedly to encounter whatever &quot;ism&quot; outrages their moral sensibilities the most: racism, classism, sexism ... so many isms.

They have the means to be educated about it, but they don&#039;t make it central to their lives and dictate what they do. This isn&#039;t to say they should only focus on their faith to thebpoint of monasticism, but we are called to live in the world not be of it, yet for most people, their main focus with Christianity is what happens in the here and now, the fate of their eternal soul be damned. The windfall prosperity from the post-WW2 era in the US might be the primary cause for this in my mind. I think there needs to be a back to basics Christian movement where the Western world worries more about moral matters and how we can truly sanctify the souls of all the people in their nation. I think this a lost cause for most Protestant nations, not necessarily due to them being Protestant, but more due to the conservstive and liberal factions deeply entrenching themselves in political squabbles here on Earth rather than teaching sound theology and giving people the means understand experientially the importance of God&#039;s graces like an Orthodox or Catholic could in the Sacraments of Eucharist, Confession, Confirmation, Baptism, etc. I think we should also welcome all sinners that truly want to repent and people are on the outskirts of society into our church communities as brothers and sisters, even if it means we feel slightly less comfortable about them (so long as they don&#039;t actively try to sabatoge the church).

And aside from the typical dissimulation all women do, about how it isn&#039;t that great to be desired etc. (the same way the aforementioned rich people always say &quot;I have just as many problems despite being rich, we&#039;re the same&quot;), I noticed that they were oddly skewed in their perceptions of a lot of things. <br><br>6&#039;s and 7&#039;s tended to overrate their hotness to overcompensate, 8&#039;s and 9&#039;s tended to have such an oversaturated &quot;local network&quot; of fellow beautiful but shallow people or such oversaturated success attracting gigachads on Tinder that they simply never had the opportunity to interact with the mass of schlubs and gain an awareness of &quot;I am a 10, you are a 2.&quot; They often had an almost sweetly naive egalitarianism. When they did accidentally interact with incels it&#039;s like they didn&#039;t know what to do with them, they really sincerely meant it when they said &quot;just get a haircut,&quot; they would actually strain their brain to see themselves dating the incel. It&#039;s naivete, and it leads to the classic funny outcome of &quot;just get a haircut bro,&quot; but at least it didn&#039;t come from seeing themselves as gods and incels as insects.<br><br>They also often saw their &quot;power&quot; as meaningless, for one simple reason: any woman who isn&#039;t tragically ugly can get a boyfriend, and all women know this. Also, women compete for QUALITY of boyfriend and almost viciously envy each other for high quality boyfriends. I&#039;ve almost never seen my girlfriends or their friend groups envying each other for fucking gigachad (a 5/10 can do that), unless they&#039;re trying too hard to be Sex in the City whores for a laugh, but I frequently see them have real bitterness and envy because one girl in the group has a stereotypically devoted husband who buys her flowers and stuff, and the others have stereotypical guys with porn addictions who just play vidya all day etc. <br><br>Women live in such a different world, I think it&#039;s important not to project male categories onto them.

Women are built to tune out men until they do something interesting that makes them worth considering, they see men as the background NPCs of life. Sometimes you can get on their radar by total accident and end up having relationships or sleeping with them despite them being way out of your league, but then they will ignore millions of guys in their own league because those guys are still dime a dozen in the big picture. <br><br>This is why dating apps were such a crushing blow to ordinary guys, because women used to have a lower threshold for putting a guy on the radar because their number of potential partners was smaller. They were much more open to giving guys in chance encounters or at work or in class a chance, because they were themselves unconsciously conscious of a slight scarcity problem. They could go weeks or months without a date if they didn&#039;t take a chance here and there. <br><br>Now they sit on apps, and their unconscious is trained to see the world as an infinite and inexhaustible supply of boring men interested in them by default. Even the dumpiest 5/10 now has a fundamental starting attitude of &quot;impress me, you&#039;re disposable.&quot; It&#039;s not hard to imagine the effects of this oversaturation, you can see an analogous process in porn. Why do you open 150 tabs and waste 2 hours instead of being happy to see a grainy titty like your dad was? Because you have infinite options. You naturally create a distribution of what&#039;s available and seek only the highest part of the bell curve. You&#039;re unconsciously always starting from a &quot;meh, I could do better&quot; assumption.<br><br>For average guys, all women starting from such an assumption is like a meatgrinder. It&#039;s impossible to get on a girl&#039;s radar in an incredibly gay dating app that forces you to either look like a boring feminized millennial tryhard or a low class meathead with nothing in between.", "time": 1672516628, "resto": 21457565}, {"no": 21460642, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)14:59:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21460622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21460622</a><br>why&#039;s that", "time": 1672516751, "resto": 21457565}, {"no": 21460658, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)15:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;21460626</span><br>It really is<br><br>And just imagine, most information out there is completely useless or purposeful deception.

In her you can see the battle between pragmatism vs romance. Werther could offer her a whirlwind romance that swept her off her feet but would ultimately leave her disgraced and in abject poverty, her siblings included. She refuses to self destruct alongside him despite her affection. Its why she doesnt say anything when Werther in his usual flamboyant fashion asks for the pistols in her presence and naturally it has to be from her husband. Werther is enamoured with the idea that those particular pistols are what ended his life.

If he wanted to hurt her he could have killed her lover, her loved ones, and shoot her toes off as a reminder. Anyway, Werther found it unacceptable that what was most important to him was denied. Consequentially, he offed himself. Faust, in that regard, is the anti-Werther. He gets as old as possible to attain what&#039;s most important to him and suffers through until God chooses his end.

Neiman groups thinkers around two basic distinctions: one between those who believe in a guiding order beyond appearances and those who think that sensory experience is all we have for orientation; and another between those who believe we must try to understand evil and those who maintain that doing so would be immoral on the grounds that any explanation of evil would be tantamount to its justification.", "time": 1672574619, "resto": 21463227}, {"no": 21463387, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)07:08:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463227</a><br>Hartmann", "time": 1672574904, "resto": 21463227}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21462868, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:03:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any books on life passing you by, failing to capture your youth, not taking advantage of good looks, etc.?", "filename": "1611878316223", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 612, "h": 472, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 192, "tim": 1672556604192404, "time": 1672556604, "md5": "hcEUC3Hm5hXOFXhaf9KtJQ==", "fsize": 61845, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "any-books-on-life-passing-you-by-failing-to", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 24, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 21462872, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462868</a><br>maybe a gardening book, to learn how to touch grass", "time": 1672556748, "resto": 21462868}, {"no": 21462874, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:06:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462868</a><br>Seize the Day is a black pill on this.", "time": 1672556797, "resto": 21462868}, {"no": 21462918, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:16:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462868</a><br>Just go outside, you dumb frogposter", "time": 1672557419, "resto": 21462868}, {"no": 21462924, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462868</a><br>get a girlfriend and fuck her pussy, it&#039;s literally that simple, always has been. regular sex is like an injection of bliss and retardation, you stop thinking and thus stop feeling bad.", "time": 1672557675, "resto": 21462868}, {"no": 21462925, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462868</a><br>If you did you&#039;d just have another set of depressing problems and be here posting anyway.

Apparently I didn&#039;t find anything notable about them at the time. I found the voice in this to be siren-like: calm, soothing, and entrapping. It was easy to forget what the frame story immediately tells you, and reminds the reader at each break, about how this will all end. Aside from its voice, I don&#039;t know that&#039;s much reason to read this unless you want a nice slice-of-life story, which it is, more than you know, and can either ignore or be unbothered by the overall situation. Not much of the world is shown, though it&#039;s known to take place many centuries after an apocalyptic event. It&#039;s an idyllic world satisfied with limitations of all sorts. Almost everyone is illiterate, because there&#039;s little need for any sort of knowledge except that which is necessary for day-to-day activities, and for most anyone life is simply a matter of whiling away the years. That may be just be what the novel wanted to present rather than necessarily how it is. Depending on your outlook the societies depicted could be dystopic, utopic, or ambiguous. I think they&#039;re the the lattermost.<br><br>The narrator begins their story at seven years old and roughly ends it at seventeen years old, so it&#039;s a story of childhood and adolescence. That&#039;s not only the case for the narrator, as arguably society has regressed to that state as well, or viewed the other way, it&#039;s in retirement. As with most children and teens, the narrator only vaguely knows who they are or what they want, but they know that it can&#039;t be found where or how they are. So, the narrator sets forth to become who they will be, whomever that may be. That&#039;s the entirety of this short novel. The narrator goes a few places, meets some people, and does what&#039;s needed at the time, all the while providing their observations and feelings from a first person perspective. They aren&#039;t much more than one ought to expect from an average youth. The narrator is involved with a bit of sexual material, mostly in passing, that may discomfort some readers. There&#039;s also a peculiar story about a transwoman, which is of its time.<br><br>While reading I came across a passage that led me to the idea that the one who prompts the narrator to tell their story was doing so with the hope that if the reader enjoyed the story enough then the prompter would be freed from the book. That wasn&#039;t the case, but I liked the idea. In the dedication Crowley writes about how ideas and discursions in a story that are dead ends can be the best part. Despite liking the aforementioned dead end idea, I don&#039;t know that I agree. Engine Summer be reductively summarized as a blind alley, but even so that doesn&#039;t mean that there won&#039;t be interesting sights along the way. I&#039;ll probably read more from Crowley, eventually.<br><br>Rating: 3.5/5", "filename": "EngineSummer", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 330, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672504819192659, "time": 1672504819, "md5": "L6fA8QyatXrFkh/WUBEK0g==", "fsize": 25853, "resto": 21459013, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21459885, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)11:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21459813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21459813</a><br>Those characters still tend to exist, but they&#039;re often side characters because as protagonists it&#039;s a lot trickier to write just a straightforward good guy.

This is also the empirical method.<br><br>-A question is an information-seeking act, our sense-perception of the world is influenced by the information-seeking acts of our nervous system, which continually mutates our consciousness with exposure to novel information. We can do more than be passively mutated by the present moment, we can actively seek out new information and experiences by questioning ourselves and our previous experiences, and follow the resulting lines of inquiry to apprehend new possibilities and perspectives previously beyond our reach.<br><br>-A choice eliminates or prioritizes possibilities according to one&#039;s selection criterion (one&#039;s will.) One can become free from the determination of their will by questioning it.<br><br>-An action is an attempt to manifest one&#039;s choice outside of themselves. Succeed or fail, it becomes an experimental result that is taken into account by future consciousness.<br><br>Creative Stagnation<br><br>When there is insufficient questioning (variation) in this process, the result is a progressive whittling-away of variation by the selective operation of choice, until a state of relative stagnation is reached, exhibiting only superficial novelty. This is a condition of slavery to one&#039;s existing beliefs, attitudes, and habits, and/or those of others. If the mind is enslaved, it doesn&#039;t matter how free the body is. Stagnation is socially reinforced by three processes:<br><br>-People with stagnation may seek out like-minded individuals and form communities that reinforces their shared commonalities (echo chambers.) They may deem any outside influences that contradicts their commonalities as a threat to what they see as the truth or good, further reinforcing their isolation.<br><br>-There is an arms race between powerful agents (corporations, leaders, governments, and other organizations and influencers) to manipulate the minds of the masses for personal gain by exploiting vulnerabilities in human psychology, perpetuating and reinforcing those vulnerabilities.<br><br>-Parasitic memeplexes evolve from echo-chambers and powerful self-interested agents with a blind reproductive imperative, crippling their host&#039;s self-awareness (ability to self-question) in order to prevent their host&#039;s from identifying them as parasitic memeplexes. They \u201ccheat\u201d by disguising themselves as quality information. In the worst case a parasitic memeplex becomes integrated with the host&#039;s identity, making any criticism of the memeplex feel like an attack on themselves.", "filename": "CCE-Cover", "ext": ".png", "w": 835, "h": 1073, "tn_w": 194, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672560020920555, "time": 1672560020, "md5": "KBkvhxnzYez1W9jwIGdSrA==", "fsize": 51216, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "cocreative-evolution", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 16, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 21462997, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)03:02:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A Global Civilization In Stagnation<br><br>With the power of communication technology and the internet, the above three processes are growing exponentially, creating a situation that can only be described as all-immersive, global psycho-social warfare. We are beginning to see the emergence of super-cults that are completely unable to compromise and find greater commonalities with the world around them. There is no significant movement strong enough to counteract the continuation of this trend, which will continue the breakdown of trust and cooperation globally and locally. We will see increased radicalization, violence, and civil unrest until it devolves into civil and global wars. This will result in the collapse of global civilization as we know it. A civilization that doesn&#039;t actively pursue new ideas will inevitably collapse due to its inability to solve its ever-changing problems.<br><br>Using Creativity to Co-Create More Creativity<br><br>The only way out of the death-spiral we are in is to address the root of the problem: insufficient questioning. This can only be done by organizing a mass movement dedicated to holistically nourishing curiosity and creativity, which can no longer be accessible only to a privileged few. There can&#039;t be freedom for one unless there&#039;s freedom for all. We need an army of educators, psychologists, mental health workers, community organizers, artists, philosophers, scientists, historians, writers, musicians, poets, and anyone else who is willing and able to help, all working together for this common cause. Ignorance and psycho-social dysfunction is fighting a war to end all wars with us, and we are currently losing.<br><br>This movement would be similar to a university without walls or boundaries. While it would incorporate the internet, it is essential that it be based in face-to-face relationships in concrete communities. The movement could include group discussions, lectures and debates, star parties, outdoor and exercise activities, participatory art events, libraries, and meditation groups. Also involved would be an investigation into the nature of creativity and creative experience.<br><br>If this creative movement were to reach a critical mass, it would become self-reinforcing and explosive, as the movement&#039;s collective creativity is used to develop cooperative strategies to resolve conflicts, further elevating the movement&#039;s collective creativity. The end result would be a global web of co-creative relationships that is so strong that it resolves any serious conflict with constructive means before it becomes a threat.

This is true when we create with nature, but is especially apparent when the creative act is a relationship between living beings. Moreover a creator always creates with a vast number of influences including other people and experiences. Human language and communication evolved to facilitate co-creativity between people. Love, friendship, and community are all highly co-creative processes. The ultimate context of creativity is the universe itself, which is a vast community of mutually influential creative events. All creativity is fundamentally co-creativity; it takes two or more to tango.<br><br>Auto-Evolutionary Self-Help<br><br>When we are in periods of deep stagnation, it may feel like every day is the same, and that we&#039;re stuck on autopilot. We may see a gap between our conscious intention and what we actually do; we may procrastinate, get stuck in unproductive habits, experience tangled messes of competing desires, or get caught in repetitive loops of negative thoughts. We may even give up completely, and feel hopeless.<br><br>A way to approach this problem is to make one&#039;s thought-processes concrete by using writing in either a digital or physical journal. We can apply the evolutionary model of consciousness as a journaling process that reinforces the strength of one&#039;s conscious intention in a self-reinforcing feedback loop. Become a friend with yourself, a self-co-creator, and it can&#039;t help but spread to others.<br><br>Start by asking questions about your immediate condition in your journal, such as \u201cwhat do I need to do?\u201d and \u201chow am I feeling and why?\u201d Try to reason and answer these questions the best you can, asking additional questions of your answers to explore different possibilities. You can also ask meta-questions such as \u201cwhat other questions can be explored?\u201d Weigh the pros and cons of each possibility, until you have 100% convinced yourself to perform an immediate task (or in the case of emotional self-analysis, a resolution.)

Plug this motivational energy back into the process to begin another cycle of question choice action. You have successfully completed a second task, therefore you should feel even more confident. Continue this process in an unbroken chain, setting cell phone timers if you cannot perform a chosen task immediately. If you get side-tracked and stop this process, go back to your notebook as soon as you can and question why you got side-tracked. You have now turned a \u201cfailure\u201d into a success, and so you should feel good about yourself.<br><br>Over time your confidence and happiness will improve as you become more and more effective at solving your problems. Eventually you will have burned the process of question choice action into your mind to such a degree that you no longer need to use it for every task. You can begin to ask larger questions such as \u201cwhat are the experiences in my life that I have found most meaningful, when I most grew and flourished, and felt the most alive?\u201d Those experiences mark the real truth of things, who you really are, amplify the importance of them over the endless examples of brokenness you have experienced, which in the end is just so much meaningless monkey madness. Let those experiences guide you.<br><br>This process should eventually grow together with others. When you are comfortable, seek out others who can help mutually question with you using this process. It could be a family member, a friend, a therapist, or someone else you have a connection with. You can form or join groups dedicated to mutual inquiry. Having initially reached inwards to help yourself, you are now reaching outwards to help each other, and you should feel really good about yourself for that.

It&#039;s a later creation that merges disparate events and characters into one character. The titular Satan is just a word for &quot;the adversary&quot; and is an angel given the task of playing that part in that story. There&#039;s no overarching &quot;renegade angel&quot; story in the Bible. <br><br>If Christians were serious about what Jesus taught they&#039;d have to remove half the doctrines they believe. The amount of fanfiction added over the years is astounding. Consider that the whole idea of Jesus being born to a &quot;virgin&quot; stems from a mistranslation of the OT from hebrew to greek, where young woman is changed into virgin.

If anything, Tolkien continues to puff up and suck off monarchy and purebreds in the name of a good story, because otherwise it would read too foreign in our sad, pathetic world of propaganda piled on the shoulders of ancient propaganda.<br><br>For fuck&#039;s sake, the Anglo-Saxons were invading Britons and Celts who were already lost cousins of the Phoenician merchant navy, who had been mining tin for thousands of fucking years to feed their bronze age armies. Why would they care to truly war with their cousins? Same with the Vikings too. The kings all knew each other and probably had gay pagan incest orgies behind the scenes like they do now, laughing at the dupes they taxed to death.<br><a href=\"#p21455610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455610</a><br>Conflict, as we all know it, is fake and gay. It currently is, and always has been, two puppets play-fighting over some treasure or kingdom. The puppetmaster is the eternal Phoenix. It ritualistically commits suicide, at least in the eyes of peasants who don&#039;t realize their slain king actually lives in some chateau or villa drinking wine and fucking boys (Julius Caesar faked his death, same as his descendent John F Kennedy), then the Phoenix rises from the ashes. The symbolism is everywhere.<br><br>Economics and power are a facade. They have owned (most of) the world for thousands of years. The Bible, at least The Old Testament, is a manual for retaining their grasp and successfully duping us all; every major religion is the same (no, I&#039;m not an atheist; atheism is actually promoted by the Phoenicians now because they make better consoomers).<br><br>http://ancient-spooks.de/texts/gene<wbr>sis-interlinear.html", "time": 1672469445, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21458438, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:56:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21458418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21458418</a><br>source?", "time": 1672469767, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21458440, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:56:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21454428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21454428</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some stupid reddit comics crudely drawn by a twelve year old.</span><br>Thats the point though.

It was economically far more left wing than Fascism was with many National Socialist including Hitler not even fully acknowledging private property but instead only private management of that property (which was implemented in various forms). National Socialism also just saw the role of the government and the nature of the state completely different with the state only being there as a means to an end to ensure the existence and thriving of the people and the nation not really having anything to do with the actual borders.

The rest he spent for his own personal consumption or investment. <br><br>Government employment rarely exceeded 3% of the total labour force, even at the end of the 19th century. Royal ministers and parliamentarians generally did not receive tax-funded salaries but were expected to support themselves out of their own private income. <br><br>Legislation and regulation of the economy was rare. The King was seen as the enforcer of a law that existed prior to him, not the creator of arbitrary laws. <br><br>War was seen as the King&#039;s personal business. Until the French Revolution, there was no conscription. Territory could be gained through purchase or marriage. Armies met in battlefields; targeting of civilian areas was rare. Often treaties would be quickly negotiated. Total war, as seen in WW2, was completely unheard of.<br><br>Money-printing was unheard of. Although Kings tried to establish fiat currencies these attempts met with fierce resistance. The currency of the ancien regime was precious metal. They could not inflate the currency at will. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how retarded must you be to postulate that only if you own the country itself you can take care of it</span><br>That is not what I said.

Or is it just the fanciness that ranks them above EL?</span><br>Honestly, any hardback with a sewn binding and acid-free paper is going to pretty much last forever if they&#039;re not handled carelessly or stored in poor conditions. The biggest difference I would say is that FS books come with slipcases, which are extremely good for keeping books which would already last a long time in pristine condition. If you want your books to last an exceptionally long time (meaning long after you&#039;re dead), you will want slipcases.

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&#039;s greatest dramatist. He is often called England&#039;s national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. He remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shakespeare&#039;s influence extends from theater and literatures to present-day movies, Western philosophy, and the English language itself. William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world&#039;s pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare&#039;s writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world\u2019s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.</span>", "filename": "William Shakespeare", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2220, "h": 1248, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672489355161670, "time": 1672489355, "md5": "kwq3VFue65p0SA/J6odwCQ==", "fsize": 243362, "resto": 21459144}, {"no": 21459357, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)08:37:35", "name": "KapsicumD0nkeyD34th", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Last Poem</span><br>;_;", "time": 1672493855, "resto": 21459144}, {"no": 21459366, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)08:40:25", "name": "Kapsicum", "com": "test comments", "time": 1672494025, "resto": 21459144, "trip": "!!NYhJqvYw2Nv"}, {"no": 21459371, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)08:42:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Compared to music or even to a good movie this seems so trite and useless.

In addition to referencing numerous literary works and thinkers, Blood Meridian repeatedly alludes to itself. More than one hundred carefully placed mirrors\u2014words, phrases, themes, and structures\u2014occur throughout the book. These mirrors form a \u2018vicious circle\u2019 as an expression of Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s August 1881 realization of the Eternal Return, that \u201ceverything becomes and recurs eternally.\u201d Though the bulk of the novel is a \u201cmeditation on a Nietzschean world where God has died,\u201d the epilogue, viewed through a Gnostic lens, provides a glimmer of hope opposing this nihilism.<br><br>In his essay, \u201cOf Judge Holden\u2019s Hats; or The Palindrome in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian,\u201d Christopher Forbis cites more than sixty mirrors throughout the book to convincingly argue that Blood Meridian is a palindrome. \u201cBy way of method,\u201d Forbis explains, \u201cI ball-point pen numbered a copy of Blood Meridian\u2019s last page, the Epilogue at 337, with a zero, until on the novel\u2019s earliest page, of epigraphs, I wrote 337. All page-pairs that sum to 337 are exact mirrors.\u201d Forbis then searched through the book marking dozens of mirrors he found, allowing for a two-page margin of error. Some mirrors Forbis cites are as follows:<br><br>The Leonid meteors (3) are described as the story opens, and on the mirror page at the book\u2019s close, stars are \u201cfalling across the sky myriad and random\u201d (333).<br><br>Several words appear on mirror pages: \u201cchildlike\u201d (6, 332), \u201copinion\u201d (6, 330), \u201cdestination\u201d (112, 225).<br><br>One of the most striking mirrors concerns hats. After he has disrupted the Reverend Green\u2019s sermon, the judge stands at the bar with two hats and a double handful of coins in front of him, one of the hats likely the Reverend Green\u2019s former collection plate (8). On the mirror page at the book\u2019s end, the showman in a tyrolean costume moves among the crowd shaking coins in his hat, while the judge wears a \u201cround hat with a narrow brim\u201d (325). At the book\u2019s meridian, at a peak moment for the gang, the judge appears last of all at the governor\u2019s ball, clad in a freshly tailored suit complete with a Panama hat joined from \u201ctwo such lesser hats\u201d with such skill that \u201cthe joinery did scarcely show at all\u201d (169).

I copied Forbis\u2019s technique of numbering the book\u2019s pages backward. As Forbis had focused on the judge\u2019s spliced hat at the book\u2019s center, it was there that I began my search, taking the number of pages in my copy and dividing by two to find the middle, or meridian, of the novel at pages 168-169. This line nearly leapt off the page at me: \u201cCigars were presented and glasses of sherry poured and the governor standing at the head of the table made them welcome and issued orders to his chamberlain that every need be seen to\u201d (169). In his Notes on Blood Meridian, John Sepich reveals that Samuel Chamberlain\u2019s My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue provides the historical framework for McCarthy\u2019s tale. Here on the book\u2019s meridian page, McCarthy slyly confesses to lifting the backbone of the story from My Confession by having the governor issue \u201corders to his chamberlain.\u201d<br><br>Upon discovering what I believe to be a secret clue to the book\u2019s origin, I began an ongoing treasure hunt to find more mirrors and hidden details in Blood Meridian. In addition to the pairings from mirror pages that Christopher Forbis relates, another set of mirrors exists throughout the book. There are marks that separate scenes in chapters, the first appearing after the kid rides \u201cthrough the latter-day republic of Fredonia into the town of Nacogdoches\u201d (5). The next mark appears after someone buys him a drink after the judge has disrupted the Reverend Green\u2019s sermon (8).<br><br>Using these marks to separate sections, beginning at the epigraphs on Page 1 through \u201cNacogdoches\u201d on Page 5 as the first section, I found sixty-one such sections in the book. By way of method, I numbered these sections in a paperback version one through thirty-one, then I numbered back down thirty to one. In addition to the sixty mirrors on mirror pages that Forbis relates, I found more than fifty additional mirroring instances in these mirror sections.

In descending section five, the kid, now twenty-eight years old, speaks to the eldress in the rocks, telling her \u201cthat he had traveled much and seen many things and been at war and endured hardships\u201d (315). The kid\u2019s \u201cbaptism\u201d is mirrored with the man\u2019s \u201cconfession.\u201d McCarthy uses the mirroring of these two Christian practices, baptism and confession, to strengthen the Messianic allusions surrounding the kid throughout the book.<br><br>In ascending section nineteen, fire is described as a living being. \u201cWhen the company turned in to sleep and the low fire was roaring in the blast like a thing alive these four yet crouched at the edge of the firelight\u201d (96). In the mirror descending section nineteen, fire is once again described as if alive: \u201cThe flames sawed in the wind and the embers paled and deepened and paled and deepened like the bloodbeat of some living thing eviscerate upon the ground before them\u201d (244).<br><br>In ascending section twenty-six, when speaking of the proper manner of raising a child, the judge says, \u201cThe way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die\u201d (146). In the mirror descending section twenty-six, McCarthy again links flowering with death. After the judge throws the puppies into the river, Bathcat fires his huge pistol a \u201cthird time and the other dog also blossomed and sank\u201d (193).<br><br>There also exist numerous mirrors throughout the story that do not quite fit into either of the afore-mentioned mirror page or mirror section structures but are nevertheless obvious mirrors. For example, Tobin describes finding the skinned lost deserters (128) a little over a hundred pages before the party finds the second set of lost scouts (226), tortured to death in much the same fashion as the first unfortunate pair. Also, one of the stallions from the remuda biting the snake-bit horse (115) mirrors Glanton\u2019s mount seizing the Apache pony by the ear (228).<br><br>There are echoes all through Blood Meridian that begin in the first paragraph. In the first paragraph, the words \u201cchild, pale, child, pale, child\u201d (3), mirror the last paragraph \u201cJudge, pale, judge, pale, judge\u201d (337).

They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again. . . .\u201d In this ecstatic moment, Nietzsche realized the \u201cEternal Recurrence of All Things,\u201d or the \u201cEternal Return.\u201d<br><br>Nietzsche first attempted to express this realization in his work The Gay Science, exploring whether the realization was a blessing or a curse. He proposed a hypothetical question: \u201cWhat if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence. . . .

In The Will to Power, Nietzsche asks, \u201cSupposing we could judge value, what follows? The idea of recurrence as a selective principle, in the service of strength and barbarism! . . . To endure the idea of recurrence,\u201d he cautions, \u201cone needs freedom from morality.\u201d<br><br>This advice to abandon traditional morality could have emanated from the mouth of the judge, whom Eric Miles Williamson describes as the seeming \u201cembodiment of Nietzschean philosophic and aesthetic principles, a working out of Nietzsche\u2019s concern with moral values and the value of these values themselves.\u201d. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche analyzes traditional morals, asking, \u201cSuppose the abused, oppressed, suffering, unfree, those uncertain of themselves and weary should moralize; what would their moral evaluations have in common?\u201d McCarthy\u2019s judge answers, \u201cMoral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favor of the weak. Historical law subverts it at every turn. A moral view can never be proven right or wrong by any ultimate test\u201d (250).<br><br>The realization that everything would recur eternally, that there would be no final reckoning, allowed Nietzsche to embrace \u201cactive nihilism,\u201d or nihilism as a force to achieve these \u201ctremendous moments,\u201d to produce what he called the \u201chighest spirit.\u201d Nietzsche proposed that in the absence of a God, man can achieve the same feeling of fulfillment and achievement, the \u201cwill to power,\u201d by belonging to a team, by participating in a work, even, or especially, if that work is war.

His spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement. His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day\u201d (146). In addition, the judge embraces the recurrence of all things, lecturing to the ruthless gang members about the remains of the Anasazi, \u201cThis you see here, these ruins wondered at by tribes of savages, do you not think that this will be again? Aye. And again. With other people, with other sons\u201d (147). <br><br>Nietzsche had his moment of realization while looking at a giant rock near Surlai, and the judge hints at this moment of realization when he also recognizes rock as the source of truth. \u201cBooks lie,\u201d says the judge. \u201cGod don\u2019t lie,\u201d replies a gang member. \u201cNo he does not.

For example, when Tobin recounts his first encounter with the judge, the ex-priest describes the judge as being \u201cbald as a stone\u201d (6). On the mirror page, the judge says, \u201cthis desert upon which so many have been broken is vast and calls for largeness of heart but it is also ultimately empty. It is hard, it is barren, its very nature is stone\u201d (330). Similarly, Tobin says, \u201cAbout the meridian of that day we come upon the judge on his rock there in that wilderness by his single self\u201d (125). On the mirror page, the \u201crising sun\u201d finds the kid \u201ccrouched under a rocky promontory watching the country to the south\u201d (212).

On the mirror page, when Glanton has taken a fit, McCarthy writes, \u201cAs he turned a shot rang out and the mule fell stone dead under him with a musket ball lodged in its brain\u201d (193).

Blood Meridian opens and closes in the present tense, extending beyond the spatiotemporal world of the nineteenth century borderlands. The book begins, \u201cSee the child\u201d (3), a phrase reminiscent of both the title of Nietzsche\u2019s book and Pontius Pilate\u2019s command of \u201cEcce homo,\u201d or \u201cBehold the man,\u201d placing the reader in the position to judge. Blood Meridian closes with the judge, the embodiment of the Nietzschean worldview, towering over the dance of war as the drunken brutes \u201cstomp and hoot and lurch against one another\u201d (334). In the anteroom the tobacco smoke circles the lamps \u201clike an evil fog,\u201d and within the ring of dancers pirouettes the judge; the smoke, the dancers, and the judge all circling to represent the Eternal Return (334). For all we know the kid lies murdered and mutilated in the outhouse; the victorious judge is dancing, dancing; and it seems the vicious circle does not end.<br><br>But wait now, for there\u2019s a rider to the tale.<br><br>Although the story concludes with the judge declaring he will never die, McCarthy does not give him the final word. McCarthy presents us with an italicized epilogue, marking a change into a \u201cheightened, poetic register, signified not only by the italicized font, but also by the esoteric symbolism that abounds within the strange scene.\u201d20 The only other word that is italicized in the book is him, when the Reverend Green refers to the son of God (6). I argue that the italicized font of the epilogue mirrors the italicized reference to Jesus, and therefore offers us a hint at its meaning. While many of the preceding novel\u2019s puzzles can be solved by viewing the text through a Nietzschean lens, to decipher the mysterious epilogue one needs to view it through a Gnostic lens. Gnostic allusions abound throughout Blood Meridian, with the kid as the Salvator Salvatus, or a Savior in need of salvation; and nowhere are these allusions more evident than in the epilogue. The dark of the preceding pages of the novel belongs to the judge, the embodiment of Nietzschean nihilism, but in the dawn of the epilogue a new figure emerges:<br><br>\u201cIn the dawn there is a man progressing over the plain by means of holes which he is making in the ground.

For example, John Sepich argues that the novel\u2019s epilogue is literally a description of digging postholes using a throw-down tool and this serves as a description of a historically significant \u2018step toward the fencing of open range.\u2019\u201d However, as McCarthy wrote to his editor, Albert Erskine, in 1979, \u201cThe truth is that the historical material is really \u2013 to me \u2013 little more than a framework upon which to hang a dramatic inquiry into the nature of destiny and history and the uses of reason and knowledge and the nature of evil and all these sorts of things which have plagued folks since there were folks.\u201d<br><br>McCarthy perhaps provides another oblique clue to the meaning of the epilogue in the novel\u2019s second epigraph from Six Theosophic Points by German mystic Jacob Boehme: \u201cIt is not to be thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of the darkness.\u201d In the introduction to Boehme\u2019s Six Theosophic Points, Nicolas Berdyaev relates that Boehme\u2019s soul \u201cwas a pure soul and good and full of compassion. But his feeling for the life of the world was hard and far from sentimental.\u201d Additionally, Boehme perceived \u201cGod not only as love but also as wrath.\u201d In 1600, Boehme had his first of several mystical experiences. \u201cSitting one day in his room his eyes fell upon a burnished pewter dish, which reflected the sunshine with such marvelous splendor that he fell into an inward ecstasy, and it seemed to him as if he could now look into the principles and deepest foundations of things.\u201d \u201cIn this moment was revealed to him the concept of the Unground or the Abyss; essentially, an undifferentiated entity that was defined as the absence of everything.\u201d McCarthy references Boehme\u2019s recognition of God\u2019s wrath or the Unground during the Comanche attack on Captain White\u2019s company when up from the offside of the ponies rises \u201ca fabled horde of mounted lancers and archers bearing shields bedight with bits of broken mirrorglass that cast a thousand unpieced suns against the eyes of their enemies\u201d (52). The sergeant speaks truer than he knows when he exclaims, \u201cOh my god\u201d (53). Berdyaev explains:<br><br>\u201cThe Unground, thus, is nothingness, the unfathomable eye of eternity and at the same time a will, a will without bottom, abysmal, indeterminate. But it is a nothingness which is the hunger for \u2018something.\u2019 At the same time, the Unground is \u2018freedom.\u2019 In the darkness of the Unground blaze the flames signifying freedom, meontic, potential freedom.\u201d Meontic means \u201cthat aspect of artistic creativity seeking to depict what has not been seen or experienced in reality.\u201d", "filename": "caawbuoy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 404, "h": 464, "tn_w": 108, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672549263774096, "time": 1672549263, "md5": "VEm4YFrhOXG+669uNYuUtw==", "fsize": 30038, "resto": 21462555}, {"no": 21462606, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:03:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462602</a><br>According to the Gnostic worldview, humans are composed of \u201cflesh, soul and spirit.\u201d Of these, \u201cflesh\u201d and \u201csoul\u201d are from the archons, servants of the demiurge, the creator god who stands between man and a transcendent God who can only be reached through gnosis, or spiritual knowledge, and \u201cspirit\u201d is from that transcendent God.

Second, ten years after his ecstatic vision in the sun\u2019s shine off a pewter dish, Jacob Boehme wrote down his revelation of the Unground in Aurora the Day-Spring, or Dawning of the Day in the East, or Morning-Redness in the Rising of the Sun. \u201cEvening Redness\u201d is an inversion of Jacob Boehme\u2019s vision, a reference to the world of light. \u201cIn the West\u201d refers to the West of Samuel Chamberlain\u2019s My Confession. To represent these \u201cthree worlds standing,\u201d McCarthy selects three specific moments of reflection: Nietzsche\u2019s Sils-Maria realization of the Eternal Return, Jacob Boehme\u2019s recognition of the Unground in the sun\u2019s shine off a pewter dish, and Samuel Chamberlain\u2019s dream. In addition to handwritten tales of his adventures in Texas and Mexico, Samuel Chamberlain included dozens of his watercolor paintings in his Confession, including a painting of himself as an old man dreaming of his past scalp-hunting adventures. I speculate that this painting, \u201cOld Sam Dreaming,\u201d serves as the third vision in McCarthy\u2019s layering of three moments of reflection. McCarthy weaves his expressions of these three moments of reflection with such skill that \u201cthe joinery does scarcely show at all.\u201d The book can be viewed as a Nietzschean meditation on peak violence or a Gnostic tragedy, both laid over a nightmarish vision of American expansion: Vicious Circle or the Unground in the West.<br><br>While the bulk of the novel, with its circular mirrors and violence, is an expression of Nietzschean nihilism, the novel concludes with a glimmer of hope. The fire the man is striking out of the rock represents the gnosis, the spirit from the true God, meontic potential. As Petra Mundik explains, the epilogue \u201cseems to be suggesting that the ordinary worldlings are incapable of recognizing the miracle of the saints, saviours, and Bodhisattvas, even if the works lie right before their eyes.\u201d The preceding vicious circle of the novel proper would seem to suggest that Blood Meridian is a novel bereft of hope, but here in the mysterious epilogue, hope is to be found, brief as flintspark.", "filename": "1623538856325", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1400, "h": 1750, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672549508188146, "time": 1672549508, "md5": "h4ZDLPqnh9PspbQQ+NceSw==", "fsize": 469401, "resto": 21462555}, {"no": 21462850, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)01:55:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Interesting.", "time": 1672556102, "resto": 21462555}, {"no": 21462876, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)02:07:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21462555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21462555</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After more than thirty years, Blood Meridian Or the Evening Redness in the West remains \u201cone of the most elusive and allusive novels in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s canon.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;remains</span><br>Literally why wouldn&#039;t it?

Stilted, shallow Shakespearean romance and violent, angry ancient romance feel less authentic and resonant than your average sitcom romance today. It&#039;s just that Austen has been the only author of note recently to really give a shit about it, and developed most of the narrative technology we now use to describe it singlehandedly. Hopefully somebody in the next couple centuries will come along with enough talent to better her work. It&#039;s a shame that all the great authors of the 19th and 20th centuries were cuckoldry obsessed narcissists who could only use romantic interests as props for their self-insert main characters.

Romance in its purest form is Dionysian, it&#039;s about a couple finding some form of salvation in each other. Shakespearean comedies always end in marriages for this reason. A romantic tragedy is about anything BUT the couple involved\u2013 the parents get in the way, or society, or religion, so the story is really about parenting, or society, or<br>religion. Whereas a real romance is about love and how love changes you; love is the motive force, and has to win in the end, which all the great authors since Austen have been too cynical to believe. Even Hemingway, the most optimistic author of the 20th century, kills Catherine at the end of A Farewell to Arms, because that novel wasn&#039;t about how love made Ernesto realize that his life had value, it was about how war and death didn&#039;t care whether he realized it or not. Which is why Catherine is such a hollow archetypal figure in that book. Neither Bronte nor anyone else who&#039;s addressed love in an intellectual way since Austen has had the composure to let it stand on its own.

This matter is of essential concern: prior to the discovery of the godswheel the gathering of life-energy was only possible through blackest magics or demonic pacts. However, the godswheel has not solved all problems. Life-energy woven in the wheel is limited in quantity and ephemeral in nature. This treatise discusses a way to construct and use a false heart of childsbane to grasp these threads of fate.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Firstly, obtain childsbane, brimstone, and cave ash. Using a sin chest, induce breath to liquor. Burn the brimstone and cave ash within the breath. The miasma will produce cursewater within a turn of the glass.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secondly, place two pieces of childsbane in a vessel of alchemical quality and then add the cursewater. The childsbane plates should not be fully immersed. The arrangement of these items in this way forms a false heart, but it must be given life using a godswheel. Place the left hand of the godswheel on one piece of childsbane and the right hand of the godswheel on the other. Upon spinning the godswheel, life is introduced to the vessel. Any drive howsoever driven will suffice, but for the creation of life-energy at scale a spit drive (e.g. a Nyctimite mover) is practical. As the false heart is innervated it will take on a healthy pallor.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the pallor is set the false heart is complete. The false heart can now be used in place of a godswheel at the sorceror&#039;s leisure, with no need to spin, by the same method as the laying of hands of the godswheel. As the false heart is used its life will diminish and it will grow pallid in the fasion of a corpse. By reintroducing life through the further application of a godswheel the false heart can again be returned.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By these methods have I conducted many contemplations on the nature and use of life-energy, and I share them here for my colleagues.</span><br><br><s>it&#039;s a lead acid battery</s>", "time": 1672447371, "resto": 21445170}, {"no": 21456982, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;write scene months ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;queue up chapter</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;realize right now that I accidentally referenced the Dark Knight (very slightly) even though I didn&#039;t intend to because I haven&#039;t seen that movie in close to ten years and forgot the dialogue</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15 minutes before chapter releases</span><br>Fuck it, it&#039;s going live.

Nubs of pickled turnip, tomato, shaved lamb, and a generous slathering of garlic aioli leaked from the rear of the pita and landed on his keg-like gut, forming a miniature Mediterranean chicken salad. He scooped the jettisoned material into his mouth with a satisfied grunt. \u201cThis is delicious nigger meat,\u201d the man muttered between huffs.<br>Bruno couldn\u2019t believe it and stared at Charlotte, who was out of her mind with fear, while $;;3-+ggs08 continually clutched his face in possession, God-knows-what inside his brain, muttering something like, \u201cHow could someone climax being pushed down the stairs?\u201d<br>\u201cDid you hear what he said?\u201d Bruno remained incredulous. \u201cHe said his kebab was full of nigger meat.

She had dipped her hand into the water when the sun was shining on the pond and on the prairie that looked like a lawn.

Winefride began to run towards the church, but Caradoc chased her and caught her and drew his sword and beheaded her.<br>At the place where Winefride\u2019s head struck the soil, a crack opened and water flowed out. The flow increased, and the stream of water met the congregation as they were leaving the church. The priest and the people followed the stream towards its source and found Winefride\u2019s body with the head lying beside it; near by they found Caradoc, who was rooted to the spot.<br>The priest placed the head against the neck, the people knelt and prayed, and Winefride was brought back to life.

S. J. D. Green has recently made the case for back-dating secularisation by several decades, but even he is still setting the change in the twentieth century (Green, 2011). This scholarly consensus is in marked contrast with an older one which assumed that secularisation could be witnessed in Victorian Britain. The \u201cevidence\u201d for that older view was largely based on the concerns voiced by contemporaries. For example, when a unique Religious Census was held in 1851 in England and Wales, Christian leaders expressed dismay that apparently around 40 % of the eligible population did not attend corporate worship anywhere on the census Sunday. This was widely assumed at the time to reveal the emergence of modern godlessness and for much of the twentieth century scholars also accepted this interpretation. In reality, however, there was no reason not to posit the exact opposite: that the Victorian period represented a historic high in church attendance and that\u2014far from documenting secularisation\u2014the religious census put on display a level of Christian commitment across the populace far surpassing medieval patterns.</span>", "time": 1672520855, "resto": 21459620}, {"no": 21460942, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21460368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21460368</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here&#039;s a secret: Christianity has literally never been very popular in Europe</span><br><br>Only someone who has not read their history could even possibly say this.

Due to atheists&#039; profileration in academia, there is an idea that Christians in America are reactionary against science. In fact, one the most important things to acheive would be for Christians to be domibate in science. There is also a link between Christians and economic liberalism. Stop that, make it more a commutarian rather than individualist practice (which is how it would actually take root). This may just be a personal bias against Americans generally but make it less loud--im sure others, like me, find it obnoxious fast.

If he wrote in the world of Joyce, he had to be all right. However, Faulkner wrote in another world as well, in the world of the old-fashioned (as well as the newfangled) epic, and his work has that sort of sweep: it is multitudinously peopled, as foreordained as film, as rhetorical as the circuit rider or the tent-pole reformer. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faulkner\u2019s career illustrates another thought for the dark: you can take yourself seriously about only one thing at a time.

To use another Gass quote:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The funny, comical, side-splitting thing about Nabokovian thing is that Nabokov&#039;s novels are frequently formless, or when form presides it&#039;s mechanical, lacking instinct, desire, feeling, life (nostalgia is the honest bloodstream of his books, their skin his witty and wonderful eye); ... Nabokov&#039;s novels often, especially as described by Proffer and by Dembo&#039;s dozen, seem like those Renaissance designs of flying machines\u2014dreams enclosed in finely drawn lines\u2014which are intended to intrigue, to dazzle, but not to fly.</span><br>This perfectly (almost to an alarming degree) sums up my experience with Nabokov as a whole, and this experience was solidified when I dug into his series of lectures on other novels. Nabokov is too damn artificial; I read the books he lectured on and then read them a second time with his lecture as a guide, and he reduces all of it, every single book, to patterns. It&#039;s all patterns and designs to him. It&#039;s hard to describe but there&#039;s no life in him.

I simply cannot believe that you, with all your knowledge and taste, are not made to squirm by such things as the dialogues between the \u201cpositive\u201d characters in Faulkner (and especially those absolutely ghastly italics). Do you not see that despite the difference in landscape, etc., it is essentially Jean Valjean stealing the candlesticks from the good man of God all over again? The villain is definitely Byronic. The book\u2019s pseudo-religious rhythm I simply cannot stand - a phoney gloom which also spoils Mauriac\u2019s work. Has la grace descended upon Faulkner too?

I&#039;ll be the first to admit that Faulkner was a much better prose stylist by the time he wrote Absalom, and there are some beautiful passages in it, but what makes Faulkner great isn&#039;t his prose. <br><br>The Sound and the Fury has a huge thematic overlap with Absalom, but it&#039;s more personal, more focused, and more profound. It is Faulkner&#039;s attempt (and failure) to reckon with his cultural heritage which, after the desolation of the South in and after the Civil War, has become not only obsolete and deprecated but universally hated and offensive to the point that it is perceived as a black mark on all of humanity. Faulkner tries and finds himself almost completely unable to reject the values that have caused him so much psychological pain and suffering, even knowing that they are essentially arbitrary and contingent and doomed to cease to exist. In the attempt he hits up against something profoundly human, which is common in one form or another to all men. It is an extended exploration into the Shakespeare &quot;tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow&quot; soliloquy that Faulkner gets the novel&#039;s name from. In my humble and worthless opinion, the novel is the closest the English language has come to Shakespeare, since Shakespeare. <br><br>Thomas Sutpen is explored as (and pretty much is) a mythical character who typifies Southern values and suffers from tragic flaws like a hero in classical mythology. Because we experience the story of Sutpen not from Sutpen himself but from others who betray their own thoughts and values in their recollections we cannot reach that same personal level in the story that we get from Quentin and Benjy in The Sound and the Fury. Yes Quentin returns and fights the same battle that he was fighting in The Sound and the Fury, as does Faulkner (I think this is the primary motif throughout his major works), and he does so in a very similar way to The Sound and the Fury, but it doesn&#039;t reach the same personal level as it does when we listen to Quentin&#039;s thoughts as he wanders around Cambridge thinking about Caddy and his conversations with his father, and so for me it was not nearly as relatable. Absalom has Quentin dealing mainly with the Southern mythos as such, aware of it, whereas The Sound and the Fury has him dealing more with the power the mythos has over him. <br><br>That&#039;s the major difference to me. I found Absalom deeply moving. But there are moments in The Sound and the Fury that hit me like a train and blow me away, that make me stop and feel exactly the same visceral feeling that Faulkner must&#039;ve felt as he agonized over the South, or that Shakespeare had Macbeth feel as gives the soliloquy, and I know that because in some of the lowest moments in my life I&#039;ve felt it too. That&#039;s why Faulkner is so celebrated, and I think across his major works he does it best in The Sound and the Fury.", "filename": "faulkner", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1400, "h": 1882, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672522377821110, "time": 1672522377, "md5": "5Cj75FKgcYAsq5KysGU1sw==", "fsize": 616823, "resto": 21456465}, {"no": 21461037, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:41:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21461005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21461005</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faulkner tries and finds himself almost completely unable to reject the values that have caused him so much psychological pain and suffering, even knowing that they are essentially arbitrary and contingent and doomed to cease to exist.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;contingent</span><br>Why do so many people insist on using this word wrong?

One looks at them from above, like God. The other inhabits each and every one of them. In Madame Bovary, Flaubert paints a very precise, a very masterfully rendered picture of human mediocrity. It is so precise that it is at once cringing painful to behold, in the greatest, most aesthetic sense. <br>But Flaubert does not pierce his characters&#039; vulgar hearts. You remember them with condescension, scorn, and humour.<br>Tolstoy knows what drives his characters, in their depraved moments and in their loftier ones. He can render a convincing Rodolphe, but Flaubert can&#039;t render a convincing Oblonsky. He doesn&#039;t care to swoop to his level, to uncover his inwards character and to scoop out his more likeable traits, to understand him in other words. He is a greater, maybe the greatest observer of the &#039;exterior&#039;.<br>I will say it again, Tolstoy grasps the essence of both realism and romanticism.

Well and truly captures everything I love about reading novels. It had an incredibly strong, imagistic style which was simple enough to feel fable-like/mythical, yet ambiguous and unintrusive enough to let my mind run wild with the possibilities the story opened up. Although it does not have a super definite resolution or immensely detailed character and world history, it seems to value the pure sensuality of reading over everything else, feeling more akin to music or film than most other novels. It also takes place in a setting, and exudes a tone which very much aligns with my own aesthetic fancy\u2014dreary nights capes, snowy mountains and forests, the loneliness of dusk bayed back by torchlight, castles and bureaucratic halls. I often read it while listening to Godspeed You Black Emperor, Burzum, or some other dark ambience. And it was also one of the first full-length novels I read on an electronic device. This was actually really helpful because I would turn off all the lights in my room, put the ereader on dark mode, and seep into the nightscapes.<br><br>Didn\u2019t read as many books as I wanted to, but I finished around 20 and read a wealth of short stories, essays, and fragments of non-fiction books.

I need to hear this ! Its doing me good! Its making me perk up and slash the Satan to peices if he should come upon me as i mediate and start talking about cool porn websites . i mean really I have fear of God and this satan (who is the personification of everything that God will punish me for ) comes before me and starts saying how cool it would do this or that taboo online cause &quot;nobody&#039;s gonna know &quot; But right there the Quran jumps to my aid and says &quot; God sees all and will send a terrible torment upon those who disobey his commands so I follow the Qurans advise and rush forward( like a jihad ) and kill Satan who is barring my God ward path and trying to make me take a porno detour and i slash that MF to bits and continue on my path back to God --so The Quran is exactly the kind of n book i need . and when ever it talks about killing the non believers and evil doers i just apply that to Satan and other evil spirits (lust , anger , greed ,infatuation with chicks in my path .

But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "filename": "PaulTheApostle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672453480295577, "time": 1672453480, "md5": "dFHTxDSoXDfSCWT7xazvfQ==", "fsize": 22769, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457444, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457437</a><br><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

He was a product of American (and thus Western) intellectualism, and could never shake its influence, but he was also Black, and saw himself as being inherently alienated from it - his exodus to Europe is very interesting to think about, and his writings reflect his rejection of many American cultural assumptions (of his time). He&#039;s got a Dick Cavett interview that demonstrates this. At the same time, he was gay, and a writer, and wasn&#039;t really comfortable in the black community he came from. More than that, though, he was a &quot;poet&quot; in the modernist sense, and saw himself as being isolated from everybody, really. A lot of his personal essays get at his inability to connect with any particular group.

I realized when I read this that the way Baldwin intertwines curse and blessing can\u2019t be understood without turning back to his Biblical precursor. Bloom says that he hears in both prophets, Baldwin and Jeremiah, \u201cthe terrible pathos of origins.\u201d That pathos uncovers a dark side of the American dream, and stands against Emerson\u2019s trust that we can make ourselves anew. Yet Baldwin too has his hopes for America, and it\u2019s this ambivalence that helps make him our greatest essayist after Emerson. Bloom shows how, for Baldwin, the racial trauma at the core of American life intersects with Biblical anxiety of influence. Here as elsewhere, Harold was multifaceted about the meaning of America, its promise as well as its burden.</span><br>https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/<wbr>1568-harold-blooms-_the-american-ca<wbr>non_-he-is-speaking-directly-to-you<wbr>-about-his-passions", "time": 1672545600, "resto": 21452213}, {"no": 21462516, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)23:28:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Happy new year anons!", "filename": "IMG-20230101-WA0004", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 828, "h": 807, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1672547336174891, "time": 1672547336, "md5": "F4TZOXkFyQgMpAncAki8Dw==", "fsize": 63085, "resto": 21452213}, {"no": 21462693, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21454131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21454131</a><br><a href=\"#p21452351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452351</a>", "filename": "1666798444586409", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 530, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 61, "tim": 1672551834230081, "time": 1672551834, "md5": "/J2D/SLoY+iH+3sz+OjP4Q==", "fsize": 70882, "resto": 21452213}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21461636, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:20:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "thoughts on joshua cohen? i heard his latest book is pretty good", "filename": "Ghitis-Cohen-015", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 750, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672532405617790, "time": 1672532405, "md5": "UMcmObn9pcnExoRGck0y8Q==", "fsize": 216577, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "thoughts-on-joshua-cohen-i-heard-his-latest-book", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 33, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 21461653, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)19:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21461636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21461636</a><br>The Netanyahus was immensely disappointing.

As such we have new substitute myths for people with better diets over the last three generations than ourselves.

Generally speaking when they cut things I like, there isn&#039;t really an issue. The hobbit movie cut 15 Birds because it didn&#039;t thematically go with the aesthetic they were going for, I get it, the movies were shit, but I get it. <br><br>Them cutting the barn scene is indicative of them not quite getting it. Like they spent too much time figuring out how to adapt each individual element of the plot into a movie they killed the bits that made the book so unique. Each part that was supposed to be the awkward and uncomfortable self realizations were framed as serous discussion scenes, they made the purposely awkward dialogue of the book into unironic straight forward scenes, which makes the awkwardness of the whole bit lose it&#039;s luster. The introduction, the scenes at the school, the scenes at the supermarket, those were the one&#039;s as close to the book as they could get. I think the problem is that the two main actors weren&#039;t ugly enough and didn&#039;t portray being truly in middle class love like the book does. It&#039;s suppose to be this strange and cringe lovey dovey 1950s TV kinda chemistry, but the actors and the script writer wrote the dialogue, again, as if it was a normal movie. <br><br>The middle section with the toxic airborne event was great, I enjoyed the dramatic shift in color, composure, etc. But they again didn&#039;t get it all correct. It was like half the movie was directed by Edgar Wright and when it worked it worked for that overwhelming quick and snappy consumerism. The other chunk of the movie, the part that actually made the plot move forward, felt like they were superficially trying to pull what James Ponsoldt did at The End of the Tour or even fucking MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, but it just didn&#039;t work. I didn&#039;t feel they were truly in Xanax love enough to be able to be that flat for so long of the movie. Because of that the meandering murder third act just didn&#039;t work as well as it did in the book, they shoe horned it into an actual plot and not just a &#039;I don&#039;t know how to end the book, here&#039;s some nuns.&#039;. <br><br>Thank god for that dance number at the end.", "filename": "2b6", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2256, "h": 3922, "tn_w": 71, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672520038620116, "time": 1672520038, "md5": "o+7VrgL8SmKXwNu03g7GZw==", "fsize": 684805, "resto": 21454669}, {"no": 21460910, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)16:07:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455545</a><br>He\u2019s so annoying and ugly.

They kept the interactions with the other teachers to these quick round table disassociate discussions and the super market. They wanted to get all the major plot points across in the time allotted so quite a bit of the side content of the book was cut, which is, of course, the parts of the book that make it all pomo. One of the reasons I think they did it is because they cut most all of the narration from it except for one or two spots where they just mechanically didn&#039;t have any other way to get across the point or bridging between scenes. It was very out of the blue when he did narrate. The barn scene, without narration or meta commentary, would have been a long shot and a quick back and forth.

Taken from Aristotle\u2019s poetics, this rule is that every event in the story should logically follow from the preceding one, as opposed to just random things happening. The exception is if you are actually trying to convey absurdity or irrationality as a theme<br><br>2. Rhythm and sound. Prose might not be poetry, but nonetheless what defines good prose is that sounds excellent when spoken. Kafka believed this and checked his writing by reading it aloud for feedback. Ralph Ellison would record himself reading his writing, then listen to the recording in order to determine what was stylistically poor.<br><br>3. Consume better media. Most movies will make you a worse writer both in terms of style and characterization\u2014they might make you better at making movies but not at at writing.

They are the single most banal people you can imagine, often belonging to the managerial class or the academic class - the kinds you&#039;d see hiding in the corner of a public / news office seeking the bare minimum and never once thinking greatness in life as an achievable. They are children of an existence without risk, depressed journalists or lawyers acting as hobbyists and distracting themselves from an expendable overpaid profession. As one writes what they know, these people know nothing of love, life, of great voyages or risks, so they will write tales so cynical, introspective and skeptical of life that Murakami would cry (see Machado de Assis, who is referred to many times in this thread). <br><br>Nowadays, those same depressed and detached brazilians are still at work. All they know of the world comes through ideological lenses, knowledge which will incarnate as characters. Thus the writers proselytise nothing besides ideology. They will write the &#039;gay man&#039; whose only trait is being &#039;gay&#039; (see any soap opera), as well as the &#039;union man&#039; whose life is ruled by the &#039;union&#039; (see Black Tie or modern theater). They will even revel in making art that no one understand at all, confusing literary for useless.
