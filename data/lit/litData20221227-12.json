I stand at the stop on my morning route to work, watching the approaching bus. Will she notice? Will she remember me? I step through it&#039;s automatic door. She&#039;s there, as always; long brunette hair and a beautiful somber face peering down at her phone. I quickly pass her by and take a seat near the back. This is the second year since I began taking this bus and, aside from the brief occasion here and there, it feels as though we have always been together. Though she doesn&#039;t know my name, I know hers; May. I thought that name fitting-- today is the thirty-first of April, and tomorrow-- it will be May. I lean my head on the seat in front of me. The day goes by as usual; she gets off after two stops at K. S. Library on E.M. Street, and I get off the next stop over to work at M. Automotives. After work I take the bus back home, alone.<br><br>The time is ten-forty P.M. I pull the journal from under my mattress and set it on the desk. Sixty-seven pages, all addressed to May. I begin writing.<br>&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve become quite bored if you&#039;ve made it this far. The good news is that this will be the last entry. I want to speak with you tomorrow, but, as usual, I am afraid. It dawns on me just how creepy I was, how disgusting I have been observing you in this one-sided relationship. Tomorrow will be my lowest point yet, perhaps, but also my highest. Will it hurt you? I tried to think of any other way. I didn&#039;t want to become what I am now. Every day hurts me, every moment that I am alone throws me into painful conniptions. I&#039;m being melodramatic, I suppose. The truth is that I know what I&#039;m doing now and what I am soon to do is inexcusable. I cannot escape the simple fact that I am alone for no other reason than this: that I am a monster. You did well to avoid me, as everyone else has. Even now, in this very written letter, I demonstrate how wrong I am.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So many times I resolved to ask your name, to introduce myself; each time I simply passed you by. I always knew that even if we were to have a simple friendship, you would sense my inner wrongness and turn away in disgust. I don&#039;t blame you. This letter is proof enough that as dignified as I attempt to appear, I am little more than a stalker. But even if you were to put up with me, I understand that there is a problem more fundamental to my being. I could never make you happy. I wouldn&#039;t be able to bear slowly corrupting your innocent joy with my sadistic melancholy. This is why I have resolved to acknowledge what I am; A creep. A stalker. A monster.

He&#039;s getting annoyed with having to be her handyman for her ever since grandpa died, having to handle all her taxes and maintaining the property. It&#039;s super awkward, though, cause the entire gathering is just her asking my dad to fix various things and my Dad seems on the edge of boiling over.<br>I get it but he should have more patience, like you are going to be old and forgetful someday too so be respectful.

I&#039;m not saying you should have a bunch of male or female friends (if you are woman or man respectively), but definitely understanding where thr other sex is coming from and understanding them as people rather than just sexual objects (which most people recognize their spouse to be) is the completion of human knowledge abd the fulfilment of true love. You can&#039;t really love whoever you don&#039;t know and likewise I can&#039;t love a woman unless I know her deeply, past the masks she presents to the world and she is subject to the same in regards for her love for me. To that end, friendship is a necessary prerequisite of a dolid romantic relationship sonce there has to be commonality of purpose and an understanding of the other as a human being just like you (which is why having common interests, values, religions, etc is important in a relationship. Nor everything has to be the same, but enough so that the romantic relationship can flourish). Now, yiu shoukd make your intentions clear that you want a romantic friendship rather than a purely Platonic friendship as time goes on, but there is no conflict between eros and phillia. They build upon one another and strengthen one another in a good relationship. A lot of this I&#039;m getting from Aristotle&#039;s Nichomachaen Ethics and Musonius Rufus&#039; treatise on marriage, but they are right on the money; only two types of marriages survive: ones based purelt on mutual survival/familial bonds and ones that are aimed toward the eudaimoniac ends of both the man and woman (or otherwise, romantic friendships that are aomed at the man and woman being better people for themselves, their spouses, their children, families, the state/world, etc). I think the breakdown and overanalysis of true friendship has led up to this point in time. Also the nebulous marrying someone out of &quot;love&quot;, which often means marrying someone for what they appear to be, not what they are. The only thing stopping men and women from attaining this ideal.os themselves and their inability to see the truth of the matter really, not an underlying truth of human existence.", "filename": "1671579637374939", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672087862728306, "time": 1672087862, "md5": "WWnXudenVEzMiMM2OjXOtA==", "fsize": 1860579, "resto": 21432641}, {"no": 21436759, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)15:52:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21436738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21436738</a><br>Exactly.

It was painful to look at. I used to see these people every day, now they&#039;re busy traveling around the world, working stupid jobs, studying dull courses at Uni. Seeming content, and so very well-connected. I&#039;m very aware that none of them are actually that happy. Even if they were, the joy they experience isn&#039;t necessarily to be envied.<br>Yet, despite the fact that a good part of their persona is in some sense fake, their lives are almost certainly much more real than mine. They&#039;re still actually traveling around, meeting friends, enjoying their lives; they might not be sincere people, but their experiences are sincere. The life of the average modern eremite is much more drowned in virtuality. At least mine is. <br>I&#039;ve never known any of these people very well. I wasn&#039;t involved with anybody. Was always a tiny bit too autistic, too weird, too hesitant to experience proper social interaction. But I know these people&#039;s game. It&#039;s all about recognition, and that is what I hate. So much that I couldn&#039;t play this game even if I was able to do so. Of course, I&#039;m still guilty myself: Every goal I want to achieve is in some way linked to recognition. And all of these goals are nothing more than unjustified dreams. I failed at the simplest things already, I didn&#039;t even manage to find one friend who is real in every sense of the word, I have no right to dream so much. But what else should I do? It would be easier for me to live without clothes than without dreams.<br>All that this Instagram visit did for me was make me more misanthropic and tear open old and new wounds.

I would say that when the person you love dies and everything on Earth is anything but her, I would say that hell has arrived, the misery you are thrown in puts life in perspective, it makes you understand it. It makes you see that the real world is just an illusion and when the walls come breaking down what\u2019s left is just the chase of dopamine and nothing else. I try to find a reason a live but the only thing I can find are reasons not to kill myself. Reason number one being that my mother would be devastated and she has done so much for me that she deserves for me to carry on with life and live this painful horror just so that I could make her proud and make her see that maybe life wasn\\t so bad because her son is happy and successful and is sharing his wealth with her. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned now, and that\u2019s to never put your mother second for a woman ever again. Because your mother will say that she loves you and that feeling won\u2019t go away like it does for a woman who says she loves you. A stranger\u2019s love is temporary and bipolar, coming in and out. A mother loves you until she dies, maybe its just a motherly chip in her brain and that makes them love you unconditionally (thank you evolution for once again protecting our species) but a strange woman who gets to know you for years on end and claims to love you can have that love particle within her removed and see you for nothing more than a man who she used to know. Darkness truly grinds you and sharpens you to understand the human the condition, one of loneliness and dispair, but your mother, your mother always loves you. So while my mother lives I\u2019ll try to give her the best life I can and then when she dies I can go ahead and move on with my life and finally remove the existence that cancer is from myself and rid myself of everything and anything, joining my mother in the next chapter of whatever comes after life. I truly hate life but I can hide my despair as much as I can in front of my mother in order to make her existence a little less miserable. I can live for my mother and once she\u2019s gone I can go too. Go either with a fresh new family of my own or maybe with a bullet in my head. Whichever way I decide to end my nihilistic and cynical life cycle would only be known when the moment arrives. Till then, I will carry on, every waking morning pushing the boulder up the mountain only to wake the next day next to a new boulder at the bottom of the mountain and for the days struggle to start anew.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it.

Eventually, a tall and handsome doctor with broad shoulders invites her to his office for obvious reasons, where they immediately fuck. However, in the middle of the coitus the man turns into a big monster. She doesn&#039;t mind much, which leads for her being invited to work in a Rooksgrave Manor, place where adventurous young women &#039;service&#039; monster men. <br><br>[Review]<br>This book is almost exclusively porn. Seriously, there is very little plot, if at all. Majority of it is just the main character being fucked in different positions or combination of partners. Despite how well-written the book is (on a technical level), it did raise my opinion of typical male Harem Erotica. In a typical male erotica book the protagonist has adventure, rivarly, fights for what he believes, etc. Fucking is an addition to that, the girls have to be given at least symbolic courting. In this book the protagonist is wanted and desired from the get-go.<br><br>Female sexuality is different from male, that is obvious for everyone with three brain cells. However, the protagonist in this book has no real character traits or personality aside of being a whore. Her character starts and ends with wanting to fuck handsome men, multiple at times, especially monster men. There is nothing more to say about her. Every handsome, powerful man metaphorically falls to his knees in front of her due to her being so fuckable; it&#039;s not even about beauty, I don&#039;t think the author called the protagonist beautiful or pretty even once. Still, she is extremely desired by everyone, all men care about is spoiling her and talking how her constant urge to fuck makes her special. <br><br>This might be the most radical Female Fantasy you will ever read - woman just has to exist and want to fuck, and everyone calls her queen and love of their life. Maybe it&#039;s because lately I&#039;ve taken significant amount of mental damage due to loneliness and going into the Blackpill rabbithole, but reading this book literally drained life from me. There are male equivalents of this book, but they are extremely niche. Meanwhile this is the most popular female erotica book I&#039;ve seen.<br><br>4/10", "filename": "a lady of rooksgrave manor", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 297, "h": 475, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672047638429897, "time": 1672047638, "md5": "EqoCZMaTX6DPQAo1rNMJag==", "fsize": 29392, "resto": 21431659}, {"no": 21435195, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)05:07:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are some other authors apart from PKD who draw you into a Schizo paranoid mindset where you are not sure the narrator just got caught up in his own imagination or stuff is really happening?

He had a simple explanation of when and why this surge had started. It was all because of the Protestant Reformation: &#039;Whereas thirty years ago religion was flourishing everywhere, and we were all in agreement about the common and customary worship of God, without any controversy, now ungodliness and contempt for God are breaking out on all sides.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An awkward admission for a Protestant leader to make; but Calvin could explain it. Before the Reformation the devil had kept Christendom in darkness, &#039;benumbed in conscience. The dawn of the true gospel had merely exposed the unbelief that had always been there. Calvin was forced to concede, however, that these unbelievers were not simply Catholics revealed in their true colours. They were people who had &#039;sampled the gospel, even if it were only a contemptuous nibble&#039;. Protestantism had taught them to &#039;make witty mockery of the absurdities of the papists, which in itself was a good thing, but they then proceeded to &#039;pour out the poison of their ungodliness in all directions, so that they fill the world with atheism&#039;. In particular, Calvin believed, they had drunk too deeply from one intoxicating Protestant doctrine: gospel freedom, the heady claim that Christians ought to be liberated from the laws and regulations of formal piety. A great many people&#039;, Calvin feared, were using that principle to &#039;emancipate themselves from obeying God himself.&quot;</span>", "time": 1672070466, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21435892, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:07:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435874</a><br>The original Reformation was understood to be magisterial in nature, which is to say that it was understood as being national.

Here&#039;s a full quote from Basil, with the context needed to actually understand what it&#039;s about:<br><br>&quot;... we have never, even at the present time, heard of a second God. Worshipping as we do God of God, we both confess the distinction of the Persons, and at the same time abide by the Monarchy. We do not fritter away the theology in a divided plurality, because one Form, so to say, united in the invariableness of the Godhead, is beheld in God the Father, and in God the Only begotten. For the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; since such as is the latter, such is the former, and such as is the former, such is the latter; and herein is the Unity. So that according to the distinction of Persons, both are one and one, and according to the community of Nature, one. How, then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a king, and of the king&#039;s image, and not of two kings. The majesty is not cloven in two, nor the glory divided. The sovereignty and authority over us is one, and so the doxology ascribed by us is not plural but one; because the honour paid to the image passes on to the prototype. Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the other case the Son is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is dependent on the form, so in the case of the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in the communion of the Godhead. One, moreover, is the Holy Spirit, and we speak of Him singly, conjoined as He is to the one Father through the one Son, and through Himself completing the adorable and blessed Trinity. Of Him the intimate relationship to the Father and the Son is sufficiently declared by the fact of His not being ranked in the plurality of the creation, but being spoken of singly; for he is not one of many, but One. For as there is one Father and one Son, so is there one Holy Ghost. ... &quot;<br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3<wbr>203.htm", "time": 1672073863, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21436039, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:00:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Epiphanius (d. 403), Bishop of Salamis, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem<br><br>&quot;I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ&#039;s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. ... I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort \u2014 opposed as they are to our religion \u2014 shall not be hung up in any church of Christ.

Surely then, you are seeking His image as a servant, that of the flesh which He put on for our sake. But that, too, we have been taught, was mingled with the glory of His divinity ... He showed on the mount that nature which surpasses the human one\u2014when His face shone like the sun and His garments like light. Who, then, would be able to represent by means of dead colors and inanimate delineations the glistening, flashing radiance of such dignity and glory, when even His superhuman disciples could not bear to behold Him in this guise and fell on their faces, thus admitting that they could not withstand the sight? If, therefore, His incarnate form possessed such power at the time, altered as it was by the divinity dwelling within Him, what need I say of the time when He put off mortality and washed off corruption, when He changed the form of the servant into the glory of the Lord God ...

However other parts of historical puritanism, like nonconformist baptists, obviously weren&#039;t part of that issue, as they had purely congregational church polity, and many of them wanted to establish a separation of church and state (which they eventually did, pic related).", "filename": "7e09efd91", "ext": ".png", "w": 1417, "h": 2695, "tn_w": 65, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672127746789148, "time": 1672127746, "md5": "iIeFzN4R8/NZ2HdNQoSBkQ==", "fsize": 627439, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21438630, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)03:12:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21438595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21438595</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Historically speaking, the Bible.</span><br>Incredibly stupid, stop doing shit like this.

The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil.

Barbara, on the other hand, was busy preparing a big Christmas dinner for all the animals on the farm.<br><br>Meanwhile, the reindeer were busy resting after their long journey through the sky. Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, was delighted to be on the farm and was enjoying the fresh air and snow. The other reindeer were also enjoying the opportunity to rest a little before starting their big journey across the whole world to deliver gifts to all the good boys and girls.<br><br>Finally, it was time for the Christmas dinner and everyone gathered around the table to enjoy the delicious food prepared by Barbara. There was a great variety of dishes, from eggplant parmesan to vegetables and apple pie. Everyone was very grateful for Barbara&#039;s generous hospitality and thanked her for her effort.<br><br>After dinner, everyone gathered around the Christmas tree to sing carols and tell Christmas stories. Leggy lamb was delighted to be surrounded by her friends and family, and was very grateful for all the blessings she had received that year. Peggy and Barbara were also very happy and grateful, and promised themselves that they would do their best to make the next Christmas even better.<br><br>With a big heart full of love and gratitude, everyone went to bed that night grateful for the wonderful Christmas they had shared together on the farm.", "filename": "1b3737850f5a1f0a173100b3a6bcfbd460cb1561", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1387, "h": 994, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1671988877378089, "time": 1671988877, "md5": "jaLYCPIqQiRXF3S/Rw+liQ==", "fsize": 820750, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21432350, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)12:31:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432322</a><br>AI text-sludge", "time": 1671989501, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21432353, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)12:32:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432223</a><br>Subtlety", "time": 1671989531, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21432389, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)12:48:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432350</a><br>As if there wasn\u2019t enough disincentive to give earnest sample feedback we now have booger eaters that think it&#039;s funny to post AI slop each thread just to see if anyone is complimentary enough they can yell &quot;gotcha&quot;.", "time": 1671990485, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21432417, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)12:56:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21425594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21425594</a><br>Hello guys, not sure if you help people out with non-fiction as well, but I have a little writeup on imaginary friends I&#039;ve been working on for a while now, and I wanted some feedback on the writing.<br><br>My main goal is to keep it as concise as possible, and to remove any sort of flowery prose that may accidentally creep in.

A good analogue for an imaginary person is: a person in your dreams. You know they are a part of you and come from within, but you wouldn&#039;t think of them as yourself if you were talking to them; and you can tell they have somewhat separate wills from yours. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t much different from these dream people, except you can be aware of them while you are awake. In practice, imaginary friends can provide many benefits. They can provide companionship, motivation, love, understanding, or all these at once. It is up to each person to figure out why they are making an imaginary friend, and what void are they hoping to fill with them.<br><br>I also want to be abundantly clear about the following: there is nothing paranormal about this. There is no mysticism or magic here. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t demons or entities from another realm, and they certainly can&#039;t directly change the world around you. That being said, some of these interpretations can be fun\u2014even useful\u2014to play with, when you consider anything is possible within your inner realm; just as long as you remember that this is the only realm where these things are true.<br><br>To summarize the process: our goal is to create a character and get to know them, and play with them in our heads well enough that eventually our subconscious begins taking the lead. In the meantime, we will also be using concentration techniques to help us tune in to our imagined senses, so we can interact with our friend in a richer way within our mind. This will seem odd at first, but it utilizes brain phenomena you have been using since you were born: remembrance, and habit.

I stand at the stop on my morning route to work, watching the approaching bus. Will she notice? Will she remember me? I step through it&#039;s automatic door. She&#039;s there, as always; long brunette hair and a beautiful somber face peering down at her phone. I quickly pass her by and take a seat near the back. This is the second year since I began taking this bus and, aside from the brief occasion here and there, it feels as though we have always been together. Though she doesn&#039;t know my name, I know hers; May. I thought that name fitting-- today is the thirty-first of April, and tomorrow-- it will be May. I lean my head on the seat in front of me. The day goes by as usual; she gets off after two stops at K. S. Library on E.M. Street, and I get off the next stop over to work at M. Automotives. After work I take the bus back home, alone.<br><br>The time is ten-forty P.M. I pull the journal from under my mattress and set it on the desk. Sixty-seven pages, all addressed to May. I open the journal and begin writing.<br>&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve become quite bored if you&#039;ve made it this far. The good news is that this will be the last entry. I want to speak with you tomorrow, but, as usual, I am afraid. It dawns on me just how creepy I was, how disgusting I have been observing you in this one-sided relationship. Tomorrow will be my lowest point yet, perhaps, but also my highest. Will it hurt you? I tried to think of any other way. I didn&#039;t want to become what I am now. Every day hurts me, every moment that I am alone sends me into conniptions of pain and sorrow. I&#039;m being melodramatic, I suppose. The truth is that I know what I&#039;m doing now and what I am soon to do is inexcusable. I cannot escape the simple fact that I am alone for no other reason than this: that I am a monster.

Of the four pairs of examples offered<br>to show readers what to avoid and how to correct it, a staggering three out of the four are mistaken diagnoses. &quot;At<br>dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard&quot; is correctly identified as a passive clause, but the other three are all<br>errors:<br>&quot;There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground&quot; has no sign of the passive in it anywhere.<br>&quot;It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had&quot; also contains nothing that is<br>even reminiscent of the passive construction.<br>&quot;The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired&quot; is presumably fingered as passive<br>because of &quot;impaired,&quot; but that&#039;s a mistake. It&#039;s an adjective here. &quot;Become&quot; doesn&#039;t allow a following<br>passive clause. (Notice, for example, that &quot;A new edition became issued by the publishers&quot; is not<br>grammatical.)<br>These examples can be found all over the Web in study guides for freshman composition classes. (Try a Google<br>search on &quot;great number of dead leaves lying.&quot;) I have been told several times, by both students and<br>linguistics-faculty members, about writing instructors who think every occurrence of &quot;be&quot; is to be condemned for<br>being &quot;passive.&quot; No wonder, if Elements is their grammar bible. It is typical for college graduates today to be<br>unable to distinguish active from passive clauses. They often equate the grammatical notion of being passive with<br>the semantic one of not specifying the agent of an action. (They think &quot;a bus exploded&quot; is passive because it<br>doesn&#039;t say whether terrorists did it.)<br>The treatment of the passive is not an isolated slip. It is typical of Elements. The book&#039;s toxic mix of purism,<br>atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in English grammar. It is often so<br>misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules.

It happened by chance that a woman who was of the highest rank but very elderly had explained to her fellow citizens why she had to leave this life, so she decided to end it now with poison. She considered it very important that Pompeius was there since his presence would make her death more glorious. Being blessed with every virtue and renowned for his kindness, that great man could not reject her pleas. He went up to her and made a lovely speech that flowed from his mouth as if it were a rich fountain of eloquence. For a long time he tried in vain to dissuade her from the plan she had formed, but in the end he allowed her to carry out her objective.

People&#039;s functions start leaping out at you all the time, and sometimes you&#039;ll recognize correlation between persons you wouldn&#039;t necessarily want mentally associated, and it can have emotional effect.

Jung would be excited. Personality Types was a major part of his work, yet most of it was relegated to the past, and he was largely eclipsed by Freud in mainstream psychology. It&#039;s only with advanced development of his theories that the correlations to modern neurology will become fully clear. Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences.

At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.

Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep.

R\u00e9gis and Anne-Marie are two young people who are madly in love.

It is easy to confuse order of precedence (both in time and in dependency) when you have not isolated the entities you are dealing with intellectually. As a rule of thumb, you should consider a statement problematic whenever it goes something like this: &quot;X comes from [negation of X]&quot;, as this directly violates one of the most fundamental principles of reality, which, in very simple terms, is that nothing comes from nothing, and the contrapositive that something comes from something (where these two somethings are related in their quiddity). There are at least two methods for dealing with this dilemma, however, neither of which you have admitted: Either we say that consciousness is caused by consciousness, thereby erasing the negation, or we say that consciousness is caused by something which is superior to consciousness (known as a &quot;virtual cause&quot;), in other words, &quot;supra-consciousness&quot;, in that it is not the same as consciousness (thereby is a negation of consciousness) yet possesses the power to actualize it and is superior in that it has this power, whereas consciousness itself does not. In other words, the &quot;unconscious&quot; only comes first when considered relatively, in isolation from reality as a whole. This is equivalent to a &quot;chicken-and-the-egg&quot; dilemma which cannot be resolved unless there is recourse to principles, which would clearly affirm the primacy of the chicken, at the very least in contingency.<br><br>Also, riddle me this: What is the difference between an unconscious mind and a computer, or any other mechanical contraption which performs computations?

However, it seems many people misinterpret this to mean that being a violent sociopath or a warrior archetype is the natural consequence of applying this philosophy. The reality is that the dynamics of power are much more complicated in modern society, and that social success is the most direct pathways to power for the average person. In any situation where it seems that exerting a primal sort of power would actually make one lose power, this is because it violates the social collective\u2019s rules of value. It seems to me that it\u2019s in the complicated dynamics by which value is assigned by the social collective where the profundity of this Nietzsche quote really starts to blossom. <br><br>Perhaps it\u2019s true that if you are in the social position to be a violent sociopath you may feel transcendent in terms of power and happiness, but of course history shows us this is wrought with unique pitfalls that may correct power, such as the failing of one\u2019s psyche.

A girl came walking up, wearing those tight black jeans and a thin green top, the rolled up sleeves exposing her alabaster white skin and her long smooth brown hair falling down to her back. She wasn\u2019t voluptuous or anything but certainly had a nice shape to her. As she walked up to the shelf directly behind me she stopped for a moment and glanced towards me, as if appraising this odd creature sitting there. I ignored her as I ignore all women. What came next is still inexplicable to me. In one smooth motion she tucks her hair behind her ear, bends over and slightly swivels her body so that her bottom is directly aligned with the side of my head, not even a full ten centimeters away. Seeing that wonderful heart shaped peach even more accentuated by those dark pants so close to me was a very pleasant surprise at first. But then it hit me. The smell. The stench. Her bottom half had a truly rank, powerful stink to it and I was shocked, I had never experienced anything like it before, how can such a beautiful girl carry this smell with her? I always thought they clean themselves very thoroughly. In the first moment I was taken aback but in the second I had to force myself not to inhale deeply because I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I loved her stink. My nethers were throbbing and I feared that she might hear the sound of my flesh pulsing and rubbing against the fabric of my clothes. I quickly checked the room, which was empty, and tried to guess if there were any cameras set up in a library, I even thought that perhaps getting kicked out of university and maybe even getting a minor conviction might not be so bad, I was still young after all. I had never gotten so close to\u2026well, you know. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity both pleasurable and torturous, pleasurable for my eyes and nose and torturous for the inability to indulge, she picked her book, stood straight again and danced off, leaving me aching and yearning for her dark smell. I had to remain sitting down for a few minutes until I was finally able to get up and walk off to clear my thoughts.

In the dimming light and against the last pastel vestiges of sunset came belching an unbroken stream of incendiary rounds from the nose of the plane, appearing as one solid, unbroken beam of light. The sound that followed, seconds after, set my ears to ringing. The plane climbed steeply, came back on station.

It put me in a funk for a week, the picture he paints of growing up blows. I also think it&#039;s better written than his more popular Atomism, because he doesn&#039;t try as hard to shock you. Atomism really beats you over the head with how disgusting some people are. Which says a lot given that Serotonin begins with the protagonist finding a video of his wife engaging in adulterous relations with a dog. The diff between the two is that someone does something heinous in Serotonon and then its over. In atomism he drones on and on and on, describing depravity across several pages. It goes from unsettling to boring very fast. <br><br>As for the schoppy book, it&#039;s only worthwhile if you&#039;re interested in whalebeck as an author. You won&#039;t learn much about Schop from him, the whole book is Houellebeqc showing his reflections on extracts he found particularly evocative from Schop. They tend to amount to little more than rewording the originals. It&#039;s fine, it isnt bad, but I could see someone being disappointed. The main benefit is in how clearly you can see where Houellebeqc is deriving something from Schop in all his books, after reading what he found interesting about him. <br><br>Sorry if my thoughts are unclear or disjointed. Papa is on the rum again. If you want me to clarify anything just ask. I like Houellebeqc, but I wouldn&#039;t reccomend him to just anyone honestly. He applies to very specific people, and I wasn&#039;t one of those people.

This confusion moreover appears in two contrary forms: in the first, the spiritual is brought down to the level of the psychic, and this is what happens more particularly in the kind of psychological explanations already referred to; in the second, the psychic is on the other hand ~ mistaken for the spiritual; of this the most popular example is spiritualism, though the other more complex forms of \u2018neo-spiritualism\u2019 all proceed from the very same error. In either case it is clearly the spiritual that is misconceived; but the first case concerns those who simply deny it, at least in practice if not always explicitly, whereas the second concerns those who are subject to the delusion of a false spirituality; and it is this second case that is now more particularly in view. The reason why so many people allow themselves to be led astray by this delusion is fundamentally quite simple: some of them seek above all for imagined \u2018powers\u2019, or broadly speaking and in one form or another, for the production of more or less extraordinary \u2018phenomena\u2019; others constrain themselves to \u2018centralize\u2019 their consciousness on inferior \u2018prolongations\u2019 of the human individuality, mistaking them for superior states simply because they are outside the limits within which the activities of the \u2018average\u2019 man are generally enclosed, the limits in question being, in the state corresponding to the profane point of view of the present period, those of what is commonly called \u2018ordinary life\u2019, into which no possibility of an extra-corporeal order can enter. Even within the latter group it is the lure of the \u2018phenomenon\u2019, that is to say in the final analysis the \u2018experimental\u2019 tendency in the modern spirit, which is most frequently at the root of the error; what these people are in fact trying to obtain is always results that are in some way \u2018sensational\u2019, and they mistake such results for \u2018realization\u2019; but this again amounts to saying that everything belonging to the spiritual order escapes them completely, that they are unable even to conceive of anything of the kind, however remotely; and it would be very much better for them, since they are entirely lacking in spiritual \u2018qualification\u2019, if they were content to remain enclosed in the commonplace and mediocre security of \u2018ordinary life\u2019. Of course there can be no question of denying the reality as such of the \u2018phenomena\u2019 concerned; in fact they can be said to be only too real, and for that reason all the more dangerous. What is now being formally contested is their value and their interest, particularly from the point of view of spiritual development, and the delusion itself concerns the very nature of spiritual development.

But there is still something more, for a sort of \u2018inverted\u2019 development can take place, not only conferring no useful advantage, but taking the being ever further away from spiritual \u2018realization\u2019, until it is irretrievably astray in the inferior \u2018prolongations\u2019 of its individuality recently mentioned, and through these it can only come into contact with the \u2018infra-human\u2019. There is then no escape from its situation, or at least there is only one, and that is the total disintegration of the conscious being; such a disintegration is strictly equivalent in the case of the individual to final dissolution in the case of the totality of the manifested &#039;cosmos&#039;.</span>", "time": 1672139829, "resto": 21438922}, {"no": 21438955, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)06:18:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21438954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21438954</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For this reason, perhaps more than for any other, it is impossible to be too mistrustful of every appeal to the \u2018subconscious\u2019, to \u2018instinct\u2019, and to sub-rational \u2018intuition\u2019, no less than to a more or less ill-defined \u2018vital force\u2019\u2014in a word to all those vague and obscure things that tend to exalt the new philosophy and psychology, yet lead more or less directly to a contact with inferior states. There is therefore all the more reason to exercise extreme vigilance (for the enemy knows only too well how to take on the most insidious disguises) against anything that may lead the being to become \u2018fused\u2019 or preferably and more accurately \u2018confused\u2019 or even \u2018dissolved\u2019 in a sort of \u2018cosmic consciousness\u2019 that shuts out all \u2018transcendence\u2019 and so also shuts out all effective spirituality. This is the ultimate consequence of all the anti-metaphysical errors known more especially in their philosophical aspect by such names as \u2018pantheism\u2019, \u2018immanentism\u2019, and \u2018naturalism\u2019, all of which are closely interrelated, and many people would doubtless recoil before such a consequence if they could know what it is that they are really talking about. These things do indeed quite literally amount to an \u2018inversion\u2019 of spirituality, to a substitution for it of what is truly its opposite, since they inevitably lead to its final loss, and this constitutes \u2018satanism\u2019 properly so called.

Many people speak of it. I think another term is the Eureka principle. This led to finally understand &#039;the leap of faith&#039; in a deeper way, as I grew to understand that understanding is not discursive and cannot be tiptoed to, but is leapt into, from a place of ignorance to a place of knowing. Put differently: the mind that asks the question cannot solve the question. The mind that answers the question is an entirely different mind. This led in all sorts of strange and wonderful directions for me. <br>I also found it interesting to understand how understanding is blocked to so many people, and of course to myself. I literally cannot see the solution to my problem from my current vantage point. It requires a shift in what I am in order to understand (and this shift requires experience. The intent is set and then we go on our way navigating life in a way that gathers the experience necessary for the shift to the answer/solution. This also led me to understand the difference between intellectual knowing and &#039;knowing&#039;. That in turn led me to understand the deep significance of &#039;feeling&#039; in understanding). This process is largely unconscious, and follows intent. Lives follow intent.<br>Intention itself is another area that opened to me, though it is related to this process I mentioned of insight. With insight you set a conscious intent and the solution is worked on unconsciously. The thing is that there are also unconscious intents, and intents from outside of ourselves that we take on. All of these intentions shape our lives and our minds. One must make them all conscious. Why do we do what we do? Where do we go?

His life\u2019s work, The Cantos, remains a signal modernist epic. Its mix of history, politics, and what Pound called \u201cthe periplum,\u201d that is a point of view of one in the middle of a journey, have given countless poets permission to develop a range of poetic techniques that capture life in the midst of experience. In an introduction to the Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot declared that Pound \u201cis more responsible for the 20th-century revolution in poetry than is any other individual.\u201d Four decades later, Donald Hall reaffirmed in remarks collected in Remembering Poets that \u201cEzra Pound is the poet who, a thousand times more than any other man, has made modern poetry possible in English.\u201d Pound never sought, nor had, a wide reading audience during his lifetime; his technical innovations and use of unconventional poetic materials often baffled even sympathetic readers. Early in his career, Pound aroused controversy because of his aesthetic views; later, because of his political views, including his support for the Fascist government in Italy.

One is that, despite his purported aristocratic tendencies, his thought is rooted in very surface-level common-sense rebuttals of previous philosophical ideas (which had sophisticated reasoning backing them), which are generally the first to come to mind to any layperson when they are presented with these kinds of ideas (hence why Nietzsche catches on well with so many who are either first entering philosophy, or who just lack intellectual sophistication in general).

This is how the pre socratics would prepare for writing their works (and it is rumoured to be how BAP prepares for Caribbean Rythmes). The third preparatory option, and the most potent, is to have your Jewish academic advisor inseminate your with his Kaballic load. One shot of that greasy Jew juice and you will be ready to fully absorb the teachings of Nietzsche (this is how BAP wrote BAM, one load empowered him to write one page.

So slow, bloated and overcomplicated. So interconnected and destructive to personal privacy - Google alone knows virtually everything about you. There are so many little buttons and symbols and popups and images and gifs, it is all too much and I can never get anything out of it. People say there is so much to learn on the internet, but when you consider how bloated and complex modern sites are - not simple things like online PDFs, which are alright, but learning on say Youtube, or Brilliant, or whatever, it&#039;s just too much first you have to wait for all the shit to load and hope your hardware is even working correctly, then you have to navigate a set of pages that are complex just for the sake of being complex, then once you&#039;re even there good look focusing on the material when there are so many distractions on the computer + internet. So much competing for your attention. So you &#039;study&#039; for 5 minutes, and then you reward yourself with half an hour spread over tiktok, snapchat, instagram, facebook, and youtube. Then &#039;study&#039; again, then play some game on your phone. But you tell yourself and others, So much to learn on the internet! What are you, a Luddite? Books are obsolete, you can get everything a book provides and more on the internet!<br><br>And here&#039;s the irony. Yes, you actually can get more than a book provides on the internet - well except the feel of the book, but that aside. You can read in a web browser. And more. And more. And more. That is, in fact, the problem here. There is so much more - there is too much - the mind isn&#039;t developed for that, at least not at our stage in development. And so what happens, is a kid starts using the internet at 5 - maybe he&#039;s just using it to study, at least at the start, but with so many distractions, he&#039;s no doubt using it for more at the age of 10 - and by 20 his brain is a pile of mush unable to focus on anything for longer than 30 seconds, if even that, and unable to retain anything in his memory because he knows he can always just bring it up on the net. Fucking hell. Computer technology is fucked. And no, I don&#039;t want 1000 different accounts for 1000 different websites, all of which can be hacked if I use the same password and email - I don&#039;t want my computer, phone and all my speakers syncing everything to each other. It all gives me so much sensory overload. The more I use computer technology in my lives, the more miserable I get.

Otherwise, you might as well stick to a prose translation. The best one can do is get an &quot;approxmimation&quot;. In other words, the verse needs to be tweaked such that the poem can still be a poem, as metrical arrangements that work in one language don&#039;t work in others. For example, the closest approximation one can get to Dactylic Hexameter in English poetry is Iambic Pentameter, as dactyls more often than not sound awkward. Sometimes blank verse isn&#039;t even enough to capture the poetic essence, so poets will include rhyme.

C\u00e9line transformed this into his protest against the cruelties of human nature.

Only the fascists and weirdos wanted anything to do with him (not a bad thing of course!). The \u201crehabilitation\u201d of a writer is different in France, as the idea of greatness still exists there, unlike in the US of A.

He is part of the old European tradition of literature, one that dates back to Rabelais in France (and even earlier if we look at the medieval chroniclers he read late in life)... but he is distinctively apart from the classical, mannerly, pretty writers that were in vogue in the early 1900s. As such a lot of modern artists, like Dubuffet, and leftish types, like Sartre and Debord, came to love his spirit, whereas I do not think Brasillach&#039;s writing really lends itself to such a thing. Brasillach is not as good as Celine... that is one thing you have to understand. Celine is at the level of Dante in terms of what he can evoke with words, how it flows, the drama he can build in a single sentence, the severity of his statements. So naturally it would have been hard to ignore him, even without the non-fascists who came to like him. Celine was not a fascist himself, but that is another story...<br><br>France, as I&#039;ve said, has a reverence for greatness in a way that is unheard of in America and I assume the UK. To a Frenchman, literature is number one, and you can get away with a great deal of things as a writer... countless French writers were pederasts who went to Algeria to have their way with the local boys, but their names adorn the streets of Paris. Yet Americans won&#039;t read Lolita simply because it is ABOUT something they find disturbing.

Celine is closest to Proust in his pessimism toward &quot;the good life,&quot; only instead of attacking the aristocrats and the nouveau riche he tore down the dignity of war and the mechanistic world that has entirely destroyed the human spirit.

I will say that Mannheim&#039;s translations of the WW2 trilogy do indeed have the &quot;hateful whispering&quot; that you get from late Celine in French, but naturally some things were changed. The essence of Celine (as he himself said) was emotion via distortion, you have to distort with words to achieve the real feeling. Gide said something to the effect of &quot;Celine is not reality, but the residue of reality.&quot; If so, then yes, it works with Mannheim.

Tropic of Cancer is all over the place, some chapters like Proust, others like Dos Passos, others like Celine, others like Joyce, others like Nietzsche... but somehow he placed some of Journey&#039;s style in English by 1934 or whenever.

It is the most grand of his works, his epic, the adventure gone wrong! Swift\u2019s cynicism upgraded with Dostoyevsky\u2019s deep investigations of the soul. But every era has its own merits. The German novels are the iconic C\u00e9line, the really fed-up C\u00e9line who is ready to insult every last man on earth for his gluttony. They are the funniest of his works, and I know many who find them to be the peak of his style (I somewhat agree with this). The pamphlets are also essential reading if you know French or want to try the quite good English rendition of Bagatelles. The whole Jew hate thing is unimportant, what matters is the message: the critiques of C\u00e9zanne, the love of dance, the standardization of life\u2026 his whole philosophy comes to being there, but it has been obscured by the sensitive types who menstruate whenever someone says anything about the Jews. And besides, the pamphlets themselves are not these hysterical rants of genocide-advocacy\u2026 the average /pol/ user is far more brutal than C\u00e9line in this regard (but with none of his elegant aggression!). If you know/are learning French, his interviews are also essential. He speaks with a great musical sense and comedic brilliance\u2026 they are like his later novels, full of cynicism yet simultaneously you find the doctor, the vegetarian, the mystic, the defeated humanist\u2026 in short, C\u00e9line.<br><br>Don\u2019t expect a translation of his \u201cnew\u201d work into English anytime soon. New Directions have milked C\u00e9line only thanks to Laughlin having supported/published him back in the day. I can\u2019t imagine the smaller presses wanting anything to do with him. I could be wrong of course\u2026 but unlike Pound, C\u00e9line isn\u2019t exactly iconic in American literature. He influenced a lot of people, but not in a way you can really dissect in a $200,000 \u201cliterature\u201d undergrad\u2026 so who is going to read him besides us? They\u2019d rather publish the latest Ashbery clones and homoerotic auto fiction than C\u00e9line. And in an age of Bola\u00f1o (and new Latin American fiction in general) and the countless Japanese translations, the idea of a French author just isn\u2019t exotic enough to appeal to the intelligentsia who crave to prove their worldliness by the books they pose next to their matcha lattes.

Certainly any intelligent reader can read and understand it, if he returns to the text again and again. He is setting out on an adventure with words. &#039;Work in Progress&#039; can satisfy more readers than any other book because it gives them the opportunity to use their own ideas in the reading. Some readers will be interested in the exploration of words, the play of technique, the philological experiment in each poetic unit.

That is &#039;Work in Progress&#039;. The important thing is not what we write, but how we write, and in my opinion the modern writer must be an adventurer above all, willing to take every risk, and be prepared to founder in his effort if need be. in other words we must write dangerously: everything is inclined to flux and change nowadays and modern literature, to be valid, must express that flux....A book, in my opinion, should not be planned out beforehand, but as one writes it will form itself, subject, as I say, to the constant emotional promptings of one&#039;s personality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, it doesn&#039;t have a title yet.

I have many ideas to write down, many of which I think are close to genius. I am not a genius but if you walk around in a daze for long enough, you might just happen to strike some linguistic gold. This is to say, my novels are philosophical and conceptual more than aesthetic and emotive storytelling. Although my vocabulary has suffered from my screen induced ADHD, which has led me to neglecting my reading, I&#039;m still more than capable of explaining very complicated and laborious concepts with my current vocabulary. A lot of brilliant writers of the past with wonderful minds have had a ton of technical words or extremely poetic words. These words, while neat and beautiful if one appreciates prose for the sake of prose, are not so important for the ability for the devote writer to make observations about their culture.

These past few generstions are different, and I&#039;m going to lay out why these changes cannot be explained away so easily. For one, we are experiencing a revolution which is similar to the inventions of written languages and the printing press with the outgrowth of this distributed network we call the internet. This is going to change how we view the world on a metaphysical level. For instance, I personally don&#039;t even see myself as an individual in a Cartesian sense. There is no stable subjectivity, which is fully distinct from the world around it. To put it in more schizo terms, its like I am a temporary grounding point where millions of minute electrical signals compose flows that are redirected through this point in every which way. Identity for me consists of something entirely different than identity for previous generations. It&#039;s more amorphous, and detached. You could say that this is just my personal mental illness or something, but there&#039;s also been an explosion in mental health issues the past few decades among the entire population - and especially the younger you get. This notion of, &quot;oh, it&#039;s just a phase, every generation complains about the next generation!&quot; is reddit tier melodrama that is analogous to putting your head in the sand. No, you can quite clearly see that there is nothing normal about my generation. Even if society would like to think it is business as usual, it just isn&#039;t true. There was no end of history. The prior generations have this weird conservatism where they genuinely believe in this clap trap. Peak oil alone should demonstrate to you the poverty of this facile conservatism, where you just explain away intergenerational differences.

Zoomers are pretty much taught to write things in rigid coherence to structure on the level of the essay taken as a whole, but with practically no attention paid to sentence structure itself. I was told as a child that you should never use a particular conjuction at the beginning of a sentence more than once throughout any given paragraph. I was taught as a child to follow an outline that goes something like this: introductory paragraph: hook --&gt; introduction/contextualization --&gt; thesis; Body paragraph 1, 2, and possibly 3: Hook --&gt; contextualization --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Counterargument paragraph: Hook --&gt; statement of antithesis --&gt; statement of refutation of antithesis --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Conclusion: hook --&gt; restatement of thesis --&gt; summary of evidence --&gt; closing statement/call to action. I realized early on how systematic it was, and played into it. And lo and behold, I had the highest scores in the reading and writing sections of the ACT out of everyone in my grade. And this is despite the fact that my writing was not anything particularly impressive. Not that I blame English teachers alone, this is a problem endemic to the entire education system in America. Teachers don&#039;t have any incentive to actually teach kids. I remember in 4th grade I had a rather queer way of holding my pencil - between my middle and ring finger at the second knuckle of my fingers - which made it more difficult for me to write cursive. Naturally, my teacher simply gave up and just passed me along. He&#039;s now a principal. The kids don&#039;t make it easy anyhow. I know how it is. When I was in high-school my Chinese teacher (who is from Taiwan) nearly broke down daily trying to get the Mexican kids to pay attention and do their work.", "time": 1671916960, "resto": 21415720}, {"no": 21429363, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)16:47:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422291</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t want to become the next Joyce</span><br>Nothing to worry about there.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just want to write stuff that sells</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that screenshot full of cliche and trite turns of phrase</span><br>Now you can worry", "time": 1671918438, "resto": 21415720}, {"no": 21429625, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:52:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429241</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also a zoomer and I honestly believe that ours and future generations are going to bifurcate completely into spiritual trannies like you who entirely lose their mind/self to the matrix and people like me who completely unplug and ascend.</span><br>Have you really ascended?

If the Holy Spirit only precedes from the Father, so what? These debates have been happening so long that they&#039;ve outlived the languages which once spawned the vocabulary for them. Who knows what it means. There&#039;s been so many iterations of telephone when it comes to Greek philosophical terms being passed around from tradition to tradition, translated from language to language, etc., that they can mean whatever the fuck anybody wants. Oftentimes they just mean &quot;here is one abstract category, and here is another abstract category, but we forgot that these are nested, arbitrary placeholder categories like the ones people use in biology with the phylogenetic tree.&quot; Now, we have this convoluted grab-bag of theological vocabulary that, genealogically, all originated from the same text (Aristotle) and should refer to a much smaller metaphysical objects but have since become divorced from intelligibility thanks to arcane legalistic theological debates.<br><br>Here&#039;s a few good examples, to illustrate what I mean. Physis means nature in ancient Greek. Often physis is pitted against nomos (custom, law, habit, etc.). But what is nature? What do we mean by referring to the nature of some particular thing? Their being? Well, ousia means being. Homoousion means &quot;of same being&quot;. Essence is the Latin translation of being by Cicero when he was introducing ancient Rome to Aristotle. I also believe that substance was coined by Cicero to describe the underlying &quot;what&quot; that beings are made of. Hypostasis is substance but having returned into Greek, i.e. &quot;underneath being.&quot; Finally, you have things like essence-energies distinction which, ironically, is haphazardly mixing Latin and Greek philosophical terms together (that all originated from Aristotlean neologisms referring to being and becoming). Which, to me, is hilarious, considering that essence is closely linked to potentiality (Latin) and energy (from the Greek word ergon, meaning, work) is closely linked to actuality.

People at least try to do an accent when they speak Spanish, even a bad one. Anglos don&#039;t even attempt an Italic accent when speaking Latin. They just pronounce it like it&#039;s English rearranged in some kind of code.

We could go in the weeds a little deeper, especially since you think Mary refers to Jesus&#039; mother, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the olive tree thing.<br>I&#039;m interested in buying rather old things. I almost bid on a lot containing a couple Ethiopian texts and some metal objects this week. I never bid, and it went out of my price range. But in that same auction, there were a bunch of signet rings and cylinder seals. I really like the look of that stuff and cameos too. It looks like you might know a thing or two about them. What do you look for in terms of provenance and authenticity? Can you give any further information about your collecting? All the people that I know from university hate privately held antiquities and such, meaning they won&#039;t give advice. I&#039;m very much of the opposite position. Several years ago, before even studying Classics, I think I looked at the online store of one of the most prolific and shitty forgery factories before some people at my university exposed it and the FBI shut them down. Thus, I&#039;m quite concerned about provenance and doing my due diligence when a bunch of an item&#039;s value is wrapped up in it being really old or made by a particular person.", "time": 1671785081, "resto": 21409393}, {"no": 21422248, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21421931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21421931</a><br>Because it basically died out in favor of reconstructed pronunciation.

Jesus says: &quot;When you have done all that is commanded. . . .&quot; Jesus is not evading the problem of law and order. There is a divine law, which is a commandment, and which is addressed to us. Hence we have to fulfill it to the letter. We have to do all that is commanded. The sense or conviction of the utter futility of the work we do must not prevent us from doing it. The judgment of uselessness is no excuse for inaction. It is not before doing or praying or preaching that we are to proclaim their inutility. It is not before their work that Elisha, Jehu, and Hezekiah proclaim the uselessness of their work, which is only a fulfillment of God\u2019s action. Pronounced in advance, futility becomes justification of scorn of God and his word and work. It is after doing what is commanded, when everything has been done in the sphere of human decisions and means, when in terms of the relation to God every effort has been made to know the will of God and to obey it, when in the arena of life there has been full acceptance of all responsibilities and interpretations and commitments and conflicts, it is then and only then that the judgment takes on meaning: all this (that we had to do) is useless; all this we cast from us to put it in thy hands, O Lord; all this belongs no more to the human order but to the order of thy kingdom. Thou mayest use this or that work to build up the kingdom thou art preparing. In thy liberty thou mayest make as barren as the fig-tree any of the works which we have undertaken to thy glory. This is no longer our concern. It is no longer in our hands. What belonged to our sphere we have done. Now, 0 Lord, we may set it aside, having done all that was commanded.

It is we ourselves who must pronounce it on our work: &quot;We are unprofitable servants.&quot; God does not judge us thus. He does not reject either us or our works. Or rather, he does not echo the verdict if we have passed it ourselves. If (as Christ demands) we judge ourselves in this way when we have done all we could do and accepted all our responsibilities, if we are able to view our own works and most enthusiastic enterprises with the distance and detachment and humor that enable us to pronounce them useless, then we may be assured of hearing God say: &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant&quot; (Matthew 25:21). But if we pass in advance this bitter judgment of uselessness that paralyzes and discourages us, if we are thus completely lacking in love for God, or if on the other hand we magnify our works and regard them as important and successful (Jesus, little Jesus, I have so wonderfully exalted you, but if I had attacked you in your defenselessness your shame would have been as great as your glory. . . .), if we come before God decked out in the glory of these lofty, grandiose, and successful works, then . . . &quot;Woe to you that are rich&quot; (Luke 6:24), for the rich man today is the successful man. Everything is useless, and we are thus tempted to add: Everything, then, is vanity. We are tempted, for it is a temptation to do only what is useful and to assimilate the judgment of Ecclesiastes on vanity (1:2ff.) to the inutility which we have been briefly sketching. Now this spontaneous reaction raises a question. Why are we so concerned about utility? Why do we regard what is not useful as worthless? In reality, we are obsessed at this point by the views of our age and century and technology. Everything has to serve some purpose. If it does not, it is not worth doing.

As Ellul explains, humanity was once directed to tend to the garden for no apparent reason. Mankind rebelled by consuming the fruit that allowed us to judge, to leave the protection of God and supply those reasons for ourselves, and now we have no choice but to be enslaved to the necessity of work. And, in this way, faith in Christ&#039;s sacrifice is a way of abdicating this responsibility back to God and returning to the &quot;purposeless&quot; freedom found in the Garden of Eden. I can see why Ellul loves Ecclesiastes so much as well.

I would like to go back to what we discussed earlier, namely, the matter of declaring good and evil by saying: This is good and that is bad. What this really means is to put oneself in the place of God. Only God speaks the good. Either you say what God says or you say something else, and that is a problem. Putting yourself in God\u2019s place inevitably involves breaking the relationship with him; and since he is the living one (the totality of all being), any claim of replacing him involves cutting oneself off from life, which results in death. The text is commonly translated as: On (or from) the day you eat of it, you will die. However, the Hebrew text is in the imperfect tense; consequently, the future tense should not be used. It is not at all a punishment or penalty that is imposed. What the text is literally saying is that from the very day you ate of it you would be dead. It is not that you will die sometime in the future. What this means is that from the very moment you would wish to decree what is good and what is evil, it would mean that you are already dead. It is not a matter of a punishment, but of a process of breaking off with God by no longer listening to him, putting yourself in his place, from then on saying by yourself what is good and evil in his place; and you have begun to be dead. At this point, living in freedom is impossible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The situation is analogous to one in which a parent warns a child not to touch a hot stove because she will burn her hand. Burning her hand is not a punishment. There is only a punishment if the parent says: If you try to touch the stove, you must go to your room. The parent warns the child of the reality: to touch something hot is to burn your hand. We have hopelessly confused God\u2019s warnings with commandments. In the entire Old Testament, God only warns his people of what will happen if they do this or that.</span>", "time": 1671995211, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432643, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432639</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What our text reveals, therefore, is that the freedom of humanity exists only if they remain in communion with God, this communion being a relationship of love. All along we have seen the importance of love and sexual communion and so on, and all this is directed at the relationship of love between God and humanity, even in the most physical sense. Hence, what is commonly understood as a commandment is not at all a law imposed on humanity; it is not an imperative, a constraint, or something negative, but a condition for being alive. Humanity is told that in order to continue to live, it is not enough to eat from the tree of life, but you must remain in your relationship with God and receive the spirit, the spirit that comes and goes as an element of freedom; and because of this, you cannot claim the right of deciding what is good and evil in God\u2019s place, instead of listening to the Word of God. It is the very condition of freedom, because God reserves for humanity the possibility to do otherwise.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next comes the question of service. In the fifteenth verse we read that Yahweh takes humanity and puts them in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. It is rather amusing that many commentaries say something to the effect that this is ridiculous. Why work in a garden when it has already been explained that the soil produced all kinds of fruit by itself? Why did the garden have to be guarded? Father Chaine, in his commentary, concludes that the writer had a bad day and even a lapse of memory. I think, on the contrary, that this text is full of meaning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humanity is called to render a service, but one that is useless. Of course, the garden did not need to be cultivated since it was fruitful, and it did not need to be guarded since there were no external enemies. This is exactly the point: there is no necessity to work and there is no necessity to be productive. All there is, is the Word of God. God tells humanity that they are there to cultivate and keep the garden. What humanity is therefore faced with is: \u2018God says that I should do this, it serves no purpose, but I will do it.\u2019 What God says is the good. If, on the other hand, humanity begins to say, \u2018Of what use is it?\u2019 that is like the tree of knowledge of good and evil. \u2018Since the garden doesn\u2019t require cultivation, I do not need to work, and since there are no enemies, I do not need to guard it, so I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 That is the evil. This response may be morally legitimate: \u2018Since it serves no purpose, I will not do it.\u2019 But God said: \u2018Do it\u2019; and that is the trouble, to have confidence or not in the Word of God. This is the situation humanity had to face. In any case, it is clear that it is impossible to derive from these well-known texts the law of work. Work as such does not exist for humanity as a law of creation.</span>", "time": 1671995271, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432653, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432643</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That this text isn\u2019t about real work is confirmed by the use of the Hebrew word used for working the garden, namely, avoda, which means worship. In other words: \u2018You will worship God through working and guarding it, knowing very well that these actions are unnecessary; but it is simply a form of worship, and you honour and adore him by it. It is not in order to produce, but to honour in reciprocity.\u2019 All the early Jewish commentaries have strongly suggested that what this means is that God did not create humanity for nothing. He did not launch humanity into an emptiness. Humanity has a role to play. Leisure is not a life, and empty leisure is not good. This role, according to the Hebrew word avoda, is to bring the whole of the garden of Eden before God so that all of creation will adore God through this human service. When humanity serves God for nothing and without an objective, they bring the creation to worship God.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The above, I believe, is the meaning of verses 15 to 17.

Not that I&#039;m against conservative morality, I live my life conservatively, but I want a better foundation for it that makes sense with both the OT and the NT. The problem is the fact that the NT is antinomian which makes it so easy for Christian churches to turn progressive in the name of &quot;love&quot;, especially when we try to consider the cosmological implications of the fact that some people are born attracted to the same sex. God has infinite love for these people, and yet made them the way they are. That raises the question: what is it about homosexuality (and not just the particular act of sodomy) that makes it reprehensible to all that is good? Is it all bad, or is only some of its tendencies (e.g. what we see peddled in LGBT pride parades, schools, and orgies) bad? We need better answers to this question or else we will continue to cede ground. <br><br>Here is what Ellul has to say about homosexuality in Freedom, Love, and Power, arguing that it homosexuality perverts the natural union that God created for humans to enjoy:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This brings me to the second question. When God says that \u2018it is not good,\u2019 it is the exact opposite of \u2018it is good,\u2019 which we find throughout the first creation account where everything is approved by the declaration that it is good. In other words, this is the first \u2018not good\u2019 in creation, \u2018it\u2019 being the solitude of man. Consequently, the evil is the break between man and woman; and this throughout the Bible remains absolutely fundamental. It is based on what could be considered as a kind of ontology or an overall conception of humanity. Because man does not know himself except by knowing the woman and vice versa, we can now understand why the Bible is so harsh with adultery and homosexuality \u2013 as flawed conceptions of what it is to be human. We have failed to understand this because we have made it into a simple question of morality; and once this is done we are lost, because neither morality nor nature can give us any firm guidance. In the Bible it is not a question of morality but a question of what humanity is, and this can only be discovered through the relationship isch\u2013ischah. Making a moral issue out of adultery or homosexuality continues to permit Christians to judge and condemn others, which is a double error. The text affirms monogamous relationships, which during the tenth century B.C. was highly unusual since there was not a single monogamous society in existence. Certainly the Jews were surrounded by completely polygamous societies. There is no question that this affirmation of monogamy on their part, as well as their establishment of cities of refuge, made them stand out. In the case of monogamy, the Jews were clear: it is a question of becoming human, and this complements what we have learned about humanity being in the image of God.</span>", "time": 1672066290, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436010, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435440</a><br>take that back based retard", "time": 1672073341, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436016, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:53:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431886</a><br>he was right about everything you christcuck faggot", "time": 1672073585, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436021, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:55:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21436016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21436016</a><br>Who was right about everything?

Poor nutrition, xenoestrogens everywhere, secular nihilism rampant, freedom and desire worshiped to a fault, traditional gender roles undermined, masculinity under assault everywhere, etc. There&#039;s tons of trannies today who would probably have been fine if they lived a century ago, or at least would have been forced to (and maybe have been satisfied with) express themselves by lesser means like cross-dressing and thus avoid the worst of transgenderism. I feel bad for people who thought that they would finally have purpose and meaning by transitioning, only to find nothing and thus must live life coping as a Frankenstein experiment. They were duped hard, just like all of us. <br><br>Because really, if we try too hard to dig deep into what is purposeful and meaningful from a secular perspective, what will we find? Assume that we&#039;re being intellectually honest, tracing back every possible route, uncovering every possible assumption. We&#039;ll be met with that unfathomable nothingness at the end of the road, something that can&#039;t be filled with anything. Nihilism is the natural state of disenfranchised man. Hell, even religion carries a bit of inverted nihilism to it as Ellul explains here: <a href=\"#p21432639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432639</a> <a href=\"#p21432643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432643</a> <a href=\"#p21432653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432653</a>. There is no instrumental use of humanity by God, so in a way it&#039;s nihilistic. The only difference between that and our secular nihilism is that the nihilism was sanctioned by God, like a playground for his children to play in as long as they remained in communion, and thus all was good. There&#039;s something kabbalistic about this kind of interpretation of the meaning of life. <br><br>I&#039;m rambling on now, but I hope that I gave some food for thought.

It is the polymerization of units linked end-to-end that forms the characteristic chains of mac- romolecules. . . . The two stages of cellular chemistry, therefore, differ in their function, products and nature. The first carves out chemical motifs; the second assembles them. The first forms compounds that exist only temporarily, for they are intermediaries on the path of biosynthesis; the second constructs stable products. The first operates by a series of different reactions; the second by repeating the same reaction.&quot; There is, moreover, a third level, upon which cellular chemistry itself depends. It is the genetic code, which is in turn inseparable from a double segmentarity or a double articulation, this time between two types of independent molecules: the sequence of protein units and the sequence of nucleic units, with binary relations between units of the same type and biunivocal relationships between units of different types. Thus there are always two articulations, two segmentarities, two kinds of multiplicity, each of which brings into play both forms and substances. But the distribution of these two articula- tions is not constant, even within the same stratum.</span>", "filename": "107A751A-3A6F-4A69-9BA6-86178ABF8239", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 179, "h": 282, "tn_w": 158, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1672111448683660, "time": 1672111448, "md5": "sJnl21to/EK1ebQBbSdhQg==", "fsize": 6448, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "deleuze-has-nothing-of-value-to-sa", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21435388, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)07:08:22", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Christmas reading", "com": "What are you reading?<br>Am reading pic related having put it off for many years.

Today I stopped short often in the street with an exclamation whenever I thought of the letters I wrote you last night and the night before. They must read awful in the cold light of day. Perhaps their coarseness has disgusted you. I know you are a much finer nature than your extraordinary lover and though it was you yourself, you hot little girl, who first wrote to me saying that you were longing to be fucked by me yet I suppose the wild filth and obscenity of my reply went beyond all bounds of modesty. When I got your express letter this morning and saw how careful you are of your worthless Jim I felt ashamed of what I had written. Yet now, night, secret sinful night, has come down again on the world and I am alone again writing to you and your letter is again folded before me on the table. Do not ask me to go to bed, dear. Let me write to you, dear.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As you know, dearest, I never use obscene phrases in speaking. You have never heard me, have you, utter an unfit word before others. When men tell in my presence here filthy or lecherous stories I hardly smile. Yet you seem to turn me into a beast. It was you yourself, you naughty shameless girl who first led the way. It was not I who first touched you long ago down at Ringsend. It was you who slid your hand down inside my trousers and pulled my shirt softly aside and touched my prick with your long tickling fingers, and gradually took it all, fat and stiff as it was, into your hand and frigged me slowly until I came off through your fingers, all the time bending over me and gazing at me out of your quiet saintlike eyes. It was your lips too which first uttered an obscene word. I remember well that night in bed in Pola. Tired of lying under a man one night you tore off your chemise violently and began to ride me up and down. Perhaps the horn I had was not big enough for you for I remember that you bent down to my face and murmured tenderly \u2018Fuck up, love! fuck up, love!\u2019</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nora dear, I am dying all day to ask you one or two questions. Let me, dear, for I have told you everything I ever did and so I can ask you in turn. I wonder will you answer them. When that person whose heart I long to stop with the click of a revolver put his hand or hands under your skirts did he only tickle you outside or did he put his finger or fingers up into you? If he did, did they go far enough to touch that little cock at the end of your cunt? Did he touch you behind? Was he a long time tickling you and did you come? Did he ask you to touch him and did you do so?

Fuck me naked with your hat and stockings on only flat on the floor with a crimson flower in your hole behind, riding me like a man with your thighs between mine and your rump very fat. Fuck me in your dressing gown (I hope you have that nice one) with nothing on under it, opening it suddenly and showing me your belly and thighs and back and pulling me on top of you on the kitchen table. Fuck me into you arseways, lying on your face on the bed, your hair flying loose naked but with a lovely scented pair of pink drawers opened shamelessly behind and half slipping down over your peeping bum. Fuck me if you can squatting in the closet, with your clothes up, grunting like a young sow doing her dung, and a big fat dirty snaking thing coming slowly out of your backside. Fuck me on the stairs in the dark, like a nursery-maid fucking her soldier, unbuttoning his trousers gently and slipping her hand into his fly and fiddling with his shirt and feeling it getting wet and then pulling it gently up and fiddling with his two bursting balls and at last pulling out boldly the mickey she loves to handle and frigging it for him softly, murmuring into his ear dirty words and dirty stories that other girls told her and dirty things she said, and all the time pissing her drawers with pleasure and letting off soft warm quiet little farts behind until her own girlish cockey is as stiff as his and suddenly sticking him up in her and riding him.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basta!

Marx recognized that fact, but as his society had not yet become global, a good many of his observations on the subject were purely philosophic conjectures. Philosophy always has tended to totalize in its search for an intellectual system, a master key to universal reality. Today the same tendency prevails, not in the intellectual sphere (which, on the contrary, is almost hopelessly fragmented), but in the sphere of reality, all parts of the social body being so conjoined and interconnected as to make that organism all-encompassing and uniform. I do not share Lefebvre\u2019s view of current society as a cluster of practically incoherent subsystems, studded with chinks and gaps, destined to falter and come to a halt. The system, on the contrary, continues to assert and to consolidate itself. The subdivisions operate as one, forming a network of interrelations. The globality is not artificial, forced, or haphazard; it is a systematic development that gradually has absorbed all the social components.</span>", "filename": "59700", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 403, "h": 600, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672108238087225, "time": 1672108238, "md5": "sUuDfo2s7MR9wSMsM9FryA==", "fsize": 57827, "resto": 21437404}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21436777, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)15:55:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What would he have to say about our modern age?", "filename": "81A7C6E1-C2C5-44B4-AFC3-DE8105CF4DB4", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1243, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 194, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672088150741355, "time": 1672088150, "md5": "BEuGM55fJx+oVj0EGb2FzQ==", "fsize": 245796, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-would-he-have-to-say-about-our-modern-age", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 6, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21436787, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)15:56:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21436777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21436777</a><br>He wrote multiple books about it.
