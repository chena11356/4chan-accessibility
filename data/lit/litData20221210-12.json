I haven&#039;t figured out any of the story, characters, themes, or message yet, but my worldbuilding and magic system have been coming along for a while (I have a full three pages in Word).<br><br>In my world, your magic meter is based on how much urine is in your bladder. The power of magic comes from urine, so the more you can retain in your body the more magic you can perform and the more powerful the magic is. This means that characters need to train their bladders to hold more and more urine, and before a big fight they drink lots of water to stock up on magic meter. The balance to this is that the more powerful a magic user you are, the more urgently you need to finish a battle and use your magic, because you really need to pee. Most battles involve characters dancing around and holding in their pee excruciatingly.<br><br>I&#039;m hoping this can really grip readers and be a relatable system for magic use that gives tangible stakes. I&#039;ve spent a long time on this, so I think people will really like it. I&#039;ve got a sample below to show it:<br><br>Yorindu had to pee really bad, and that was good because his magic comes from pee. The more pee he could hold in, the greater his sorcery would grow. He was practicing his magic by sitting in one place and squirming. In the land of Per&#039;du&#039;mahyo&#039;wank&#039;do the only way to do magic was not peeing. An empty bladder was a death sentence. Today his piss magic was overflowing and his kidneys were at a dangerous risk, his bladder was almost bursting. He was ready for battle with the dark lord, who had the biggest bladder in the land. It would be an almost impossible battle, as his bladder could hold only 3 cups of urine, which for a human was quite a lot, but the dark lord&#039;s bladder could hold over 20 cups of urine! His magic level was far higher, but the power of friendship could perhaps unite the urine of he and his friends.<br><br>What do you think?", "time": 1670673706, "resto": 21364715}, {"no": 21366170, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:04:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366166</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think?</span><br>What&#039;s there to think?

This was my first post, and I didn&#039;t respond to anything posted here. But since you&#039;re asking me directly, I&#039;ve heard that some people say BoTNS was heavily influenced by Wolfe&#039;s Catholicism, but it&#039;s difficult for me to properly judge that since I\u2019m Orthodox (not a convert), and not very well versed in Catholic theology. From my own limited understanding of religious themes, I recognized that Severian is revealed to be a Christophany of himself in the end, and I guess that\u2019s pretty Catholic. I think that Catholicism is sort of grandfathered into his works through R.A. Lafferty also, whom Wolfe considered to be his inspiration, as I recall. I\u2019ve never read Proust, so I can\u2019t comment on how Wolfe\u2019s prose is like his, but I enjoyed reading Wolfe very much. He\u2019s very evocative and good at describing particular emotional states that I could identify with. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;amongst the endless barrage of half-baked concepts that go nowhere and serve no purpose </span><br>Like what? I think everything is rounded off pretty well in the end of BoTNS, even if you don\u2019t take UoTNS into consideration. It\u2019s a diary of Severian\u2019s journey from his POV, and doesn\u2019t switch narratives, so it doesn\u2019t need to follow up on literally every bit of implied lore or concept he comes across. Your post is just giving me the impression you\u2019re actively looking to take a stance against Wolfe (who\u2019s written a number of great things besides BoTNS) just because more and more people are getting into his books because of Landshark. <br><br>I just think he&#039;s neat", "time": 1670674073, "resto": 21359681}], "last_modified": 1670674073}, {"no": 21344462, "now": "12/05/22(Mon)03:34:25", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ITT Show Off Your Shelves!", "com": "Acknowledge, share, mock, or praise each other&#039;s bookshelves! <br><br>Here&#039;s 1/4", "filename": "317496617_513408837210621_7085934008018975264_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1536, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670229265088063, "time": 1670229265, "md5": "k8f2KvvJmZvLrrzX9w+4ow==", "fsize": 457304, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "itt-show-off-your-shelves", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 252, "images": 61, "omitted_posts": 247, "omitted_images": 61, "last_replies": [{"no": 21366165, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:00:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366128</a><br>most people ITT just hoard books they never read. look how most of the bindings are in pristine condition, without any wear. if a sizeable book gets red once it should have streaks along its spine.", "time": 1670673608, "resto": 21344462}, {"no": 21366167, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:03:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366128</a><br>Be in your 30\u2019s and consistently read everyday for 15 years", "time": 1670673790, "resto": 21344462}, {"no": 21366169, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:03:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366165</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw reading a 180 yo book that no one had read before me</span><br>rare feeling", "time": 1670673828, "resto": 21344462}, {"no": 21366172, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)07:05:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366165</a><br>Don\u2019t open a book more than 90 degrees and tilt it accordingly.

Postone saw antisemitism as a major element in the development of a socio-historical theory of consciousness determined by social forms that are subjected to socialization under capitalism. What is said about modern antisemitism may also describe a trend of vulgar anti-capitalism that seeks the personification of the elements of capitalism that are so hated. Postone showed that modern antisemitism is very different from most forms of racism and Christian antisemitism; it differs from them because it casts a huge global invisible power of international Jewry, the idea of a global conspiracy that is intrinsic to modern antisemitism.<br><br>Postone analyzed antisemitism against the Marxian notion of the dual character of the commodity category. And he observed that the characteristics that antisemitism attributes to Jews are the same as for value: abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination. Postone argued that the form of socialization under capitalism (the historically specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism) makes it possible to separate the concrete (as socially &quot;natural&quot; sound, true, etc.) and the abstract (as socially constructed, historically specific and contingent). This opposition between the concrete and the abstract, determined by social forms, pervades all forms of subjectivity, and thus helps to understand a central feature of the National Socialist ideology, because this ideology was not fundamentally anti-modern and it would be wrong to label it as such. It is true, Postone argued, that Nazism claimed to defend the peasantry and craftsmanship, but it also valued modern technological and industrial production. Nazism was rather a vulgar form of anti-capitalism. The rejection of the bourgeoisie and its values is present in Nazism, but Postone saw Nazi ideology as the affirmation of the concrete dimension of capitalism - which includes technology and industrial production, as well as the peasantry and manual labour - as the heart of a healthy, organic social life. This stood in contrast with the abstract dimension represented by finance capital. The abstract is instead rejected - and it is personified by the Jews. Postone analyzed the figure of the Jew in modern antisemitism as the embodiment of abstract value, and extermination camps as a misbegotten notion of a &quot;factory&quot; to destroy value.&#039;<br><br>What do you guys think of this?", "filename": "1651321392615", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 251, "h": 260, "tn_w": 241, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670591720896088, "time": 1670591720, "md5": "qsvdRKD/+hdnGV1zGF1WFA==", "fsize": 5614, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-his-1986-article-antisemitism-and-national", "trip": "!pSkjEcB9sQ", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 9, "images": 0, "omitted_posts": 4, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21364204, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:10:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21362062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21362062</a><br>hey d&amp;e, how&#039;s it going", "time": 1670631038, "resto": 21362062}, {"no": 21364224, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:16:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21362062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21362062</a><br>Sounds like what Bordiga said, which may or may not be construed as Holocaust denial.", "time": 1670631380, "resto": 21362062}, {"no": 21364270, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:29:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21364224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21364224</a><br>If you mean the article on the holocaust, &quot;Bordiga&quot; (actually a Jewish guy wrote the Auschwitz or the Great Alibi article) didn&#039;t argue anything ideological, he essentially just argued the holocaust was economically pragmatic given war time conditions.<br>If you mean his general theory of fascism, I don&#039;t remember.

He could understand and speak Gaelic in its contemporary Highland form; but he was no scholar in the language. It was not he who, in 1760, had taken down the recitations.109 Even for that he had relied on others: on Strathmashie, Morrison or Ewan Macpherson. And before an ancient manuscript he was helpless. A little over a decade later, in 1773 or 1774, he was humiliated by being shown, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, a fourteenth-century Gaelic manuscript of a dialogue between Ossian and St Patrick, of which, he had to admit, he could not read a word.110 Although he possessed Clanranald&#039;s manuscripts, he never referred to their contents. His recoverable references to the Book of the Dean of Lismore are solely to the mutilated and obscure state of the manuscript, written in a peculiar script unknown to all Highlanders. Twice he exhibited \u2013 or claimed to have exhibited \u2013 his ancient manuscripts; but always he saw to it either that they were not seen, or that their identity was wrapped in protective ambiguity. The inference is clear: he did not himself truly know what was in those manuscripts and was terrified lest a real Gaelic scholar should read them and cause trouble. It was safe to invite a visit of inspection from Dr Johnson, who could not read Gaelic; but when the visitor turned out to be William Shaw, who could, up went the smokescreen.<br><br>Similarly, in 1793, Macpherson was forced to admit the irrelevance of the manuscripts to Ferguson, who knew Gaelic. If we assume that Macpherson had based his Ossian not on the old manuscripts, which he could not read, but on an intermediate Gaelic text, whose relationship to those old manuscripts was unverifiable by him, then his difficulty becomes clear. His Gaelic manuscript containing Fingal was the modern manuscript cooked up imaginatively at Ruthven or Strathmashie, mostly out of a series of contemporary oral recitations. That would convince no one of its authenticity. On the other hand, his genuine old manuscripts \u2013 those manuscripts which had been silently accumulated in Badenoch, or fetched with such triumph from the Hebrides \u2013 were dynamite. He could have used them to blow up Dr Johnson (who had denied the existence of any ancient Gaelic manuscripts) \u2013 but only at the risk of blowing himself up too. The safest course was to lock them away, even to deny their existence. At all costs, they must not be submitted to scholars as the Gaelic originals of Ossian", "time": 1670670393, "resto": 21366053}, {"no": 21366084, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366066</a><br>Coal, Fingal is fun", "time": 1670670776, "resto": 21366053}, {"no": 21366111, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:27:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366053</a><br><a href=\"#p21366058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366058</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one minute</span><br>Holy shit its bad enough to try and raid but that&#039;s just sad.", "time": 1670671650, "resto": 21366053}, {"no": 21366118, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:34:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21366084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21366084</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fun</span><br>Good but fun ain&#039;t the right word", "time": 1670672042, "resto": 21366053}], "last_modified": 1670672042}, {"no": 21356820, "now": "12/08/22(Thu)00:13:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this the ultimate example of pseudo-intellectual literary masturbation?", "filename": "B1DCB20C-9771-4CDF-9141-E06DBDA6C399", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2048, "h": 2762, "tn_w": 185, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670476432311357, "time": 1670476432, "md5": "ReJqBblbSyCSLp2PMXzHGA==", "fsize": 256311, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-this-the-ultimate-example-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 41, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 36, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 21365395, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)02:21:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21361174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21361174</a><br>He is pseudo without the intellectual.", "time": 1670656875, "resto": 21356820}, {"no": 21365751, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)04:08:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21356820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21356820</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a book is literally a house of leaves</span>", "time": 1670663333, "resto": 21356820}, {"no": 21365786, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)04:22:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21365351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21365351</a><br>I have to disagree the book starts out with telling you you are going to be obsessed with the book.

Active in the wake of the French Revolution as a dissenting pamphleteer and lay preacher, he inspired a brilliant generation of writers and attracted the patronage of progressive men of the rising middle class. As William Wordsworth\u2019s collaborator and constant companion in the formative period of their careers as poets, Coleridge participated in the sea change in English verse associated with Lyrical Ballads (1798). His poems of this period, speculative, meditative, and strangely oracular, put off early readers but survived the doubts of Wordsworth and Robert Southey to become recognized classics of the romantic idiom.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coleridge renounced poetic vocation in his thirtieth year and set out to define and defend the art as a practicing critic. His promotion of Wordsworth\u2019s verse, a landmark of English literary response, proceeded in tandem with a general investigation of epistemology and metaphysics. Coleridge was preeminently responsible for importing the new German critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich von Schelling; his associated discussion of imagination remains a fixture of institutional criticism while his occasional notations on language proved seminal for the foundation and development of Cambridge English in the 1920s. In his distinction between culture and civilization Coleridge supplied means for a critique of the utilitarian state, which has been continued in our own time. And in his late theological writing he provided principles for reform in the Church of England. Coleridge\u2019s various and imposing achievement, a cornerstone of modern English culture, remains an incomparable source of informed reflection on the brave new world whose birth pangs he attended.</span>", "filename": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 474, "h": 306, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 80, "tim": 1670612795460077, "time": 1670612795, "md5": "jTeUZ1N8NeKQzfJdBKiUkQ==", "fsize": 19490, "resto": 21363179}, {"no": 21363372, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)15:01:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1670616063, "resto": 21363179}, {"no": 21364190, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)19:08:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1670630936, "resto": 21363179}, {"no": 21366112, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)06:28:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21363179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21363179</a><br>Didn&#039;t get it", "time": 1670671723, "resto": 21363179}], "last_modified": 1670671723}, {"no": 21365081, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)00:13:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There once was a boy named bob.

The houses are blind as moles (though moles see fine to-night in the snouting, velvet dingles) or blind as Captain Cat there in the muffled middle by the pump and the town clock, the shops in mourning, the Welfare Hall in widows&#039; weeds. And all the people of the lulled and dumbfound town are sleeping now.<br><br>Hush, the babies are sleeping, the farmers, the fishers, the tradesmen and pensioners, cobbler, schoolteacher, postman and publican, the undertaker and the fancy woman, drunkard, dressmaker, preacher, policeman, the webfoot cocklewomen and the tidy wives. Young girls lie bedded soft or glide in their dreams, with rings and trousseaux, bridesmaided by glowworms down the aisles of the organplaying wood. The boys are dreaming wicked or of the bucking ranches of the night and the jollyrodgered sea. And the anthracite statues of the horses sleep in the fields, and the cows in the byres, and the dogs in the wetnosed yards; and the cats nap in the slant corners or lope sly, streaking and needling, on the one cloud of the roofs.<br><br>You can hear the dew falling, and the hushed town breathing. Only your eyes are unclosed to see the black and folded town fast, and slow, asleep. And you alone can hear the invisible starfall, the darkest-beforedawn minutely dewgrazed stir of the black, dab-filled sea where the Arethusa, the Curlew and the Skylark, Zanzibar, Rhiannon, the Rover, the Cormorant, and the Star of Wales tilt and ride.<br><br>Listen.

It is to-night in Donkey Street, trotting silent, with seaweed on its hooves, along the cockled cobbles, past curtained fernpot, text and trinket, harmonium, holy dresser, watercolours done by hand, china dog and rosy tin teacaddy. It is night neddying among the snuggeries of babies.<br><br>Look.

Like great primitive birds welded up out of iron by hearsay in a land perhaps where such birds once had been. At that time there were still indians camped on the western plains and late in the day he passed in his riding a scattered group of their wickiups propped upon that scoured and trembling waste. They were perhaps a quarter mile to the north, just huts made from poles and brush with a few goathides draped across them. The indians stood watching him. He could see that none of them spoke among themselves or commented on his riding there nor did they raise a hand in greeting or call out to him. They had no curiosity about him at all. As if they knew all that they needed to know. They stood and watched him pass and watched him vanish upon that landscape solely because he was passing. Solely because he would vanish.<br><br>The desert he rode was red and red the dust he raised, the small dust that powdered the legs of the horse he rode, the horse he led. In the evening a wind came up and reddened all the sky before him. There were few cattle in that country because it was barren country indeed yet he came at evening upon a solitary bull rolling in the dust against the bloodred sunset like an animal in sacrificial torment. The bloodred dust blew down out of the sun. He touched the horse with his heels and rode on. He rode with the sun coppering his face and the red wind blowing out of the west across the evening land and the small desert birds flew chittering among the dry bracken and horse and rider and horse passed on and their long shadows passed in tandem like the shadow of a single being.

While its not a complicated book there is a certain something to &quot;get&quot; about it and reading what someone who cant see it as more than a confessional tragedy has to say about it will always be frustrating to you. However a part of that something to get is that Yozo from the very first page considers himself &quot;not human&quot;, meaning its not a story of becoming inhuman, but what someones life story would sound like if they were always convinced they were inhuman (to put it very simply, no one event is behind his mindset). His unshakeable conviction that hes not &quot;human&quot; is just as much the cause of his traumatic life as anything done to him by others, if not moreso.</span><br><br>The problem with everything youre saying is that you are retroactively applying your current understanding of the book to a situation thats more or less clear cut because is doesnt fit into your understanding of what Yozo getting molested means to the story.

This just furthers tells me that the sexual abuse of Yozo didn&#039;t take place, it wasn&#039;t the crime. </span><br>Again youre just ignoring the premise of the book and interpreting Yozo as a regular guy while simultaneously answering your own question. The Yoshiko incident has a lot of symbolic/plot significance, the rape itself is not the point.

The operation commenced by putting an iron collar round his neck, and a ring to each foot, which fastened him to the stand. His limbs being thus stretched out, they wound two ropes round each thigh; which ropes being passed under the scaffold, through holes made for that purpose, were all drawn tight at the same instant of time, by four of the men, on a given signal.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is easy to conceive that the pains which immediately succeeded were intolerable; the ropes, which were of a small size, cut through the prisoner&#039;s flesh to the bone, making the blood to gush out at eight different places thus bound at a time. As the prisoner persisted in not making any confession of what the inquisitors required, the ropes were drawn in this manner four times successively.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The manner of inflicting the second torture was as follows: they forced his arms backwards so that the palms of his hands were turned outward behind him; when, by means of a rope that fastened them together at the wrists, and which was turned by an engine, they drew them by degrees nearer each other, in such a manner that the back of each hand touched, and stood exactly parallel to each other. In consequence of this violent contortion, both his shoulders became dislocated, and a considerable quantity of blood issued from his mouth. This torture was repeated thrice; after which he was again taken to the dungeon, and the surgeon set the dislocated bones.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two months after the second torture, the prisoner being a little recovered, was again ordered to the torture-room, and there, for the last time, made to undergo another kind of punishment, which wasinflictedtwice without any intermission. The executioners fastened a thick iron chain round his body, which crossing at the breast, terminated at the wrists. They then placed him with his back against a thick board, at each extremity whereof was a pulley, through which there ran a rope that caught the end of the chain at his wrists. The executioner then, stretching the end of this rope by means of a roller, placed at a distance behind him, pressed or bruised his stomach in proportion as the ends of the chains were drawn tighter. They tortured him in this manner to such a degree, that his wrists, as well as his shoulders, were quite dislocated. &gt;They were, however, soon set by the surgeons; but the barbarians, not yet satisfied with this species of cruelty, made him immediately undergo the like torture a second time, which he sustained (though, if possible, attended with keener pains,) with equal constancy and resolution. After this, he was again remanded to his dungeon, attended by the surgeon to dress his bruises and adjust the part dislocated, and here he continued till their Auto de Fe, or jail delivery, when he was discharged, crippled and diseased for life.</span>", "filename": "inquisition", "ext": ".gif", "w": 549, "h": 367, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 167, "tim": 1670640657679074, "time": 1670640657, "md5": "TG2o4ZvZrbdS0Qy1jmmI2w==", "fsize": 72430, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "foxes-book-of-martyrs", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21364781, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)22:22:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21364677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21364677</a><br>What was his name bro.", "time": 1670642523, "resto": 21364677}], "last_modified": 1670642523}, {"no": 21364659, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)21:44:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the next great book seriously going to come from some random person on tiktok?", "filename": "60310757", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1000, "h": 1500, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670640245141861, "time": 1670640245, "md5": "mI7sQ+ghi27/mLGSxC9TgQ==", "fsize": 168218, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-the-next-great-book-seriously-going-to-come", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21364720, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)22:06:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21364659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21364659</a><br>No. Notice how none of these TikTok books are very good, despite being super popular.

She had never heard tell of any man, however brave or handsome or mighty or noble, whom she would deign to love. Yet in spite of this the maiden was so comely and attractive that she should have learned Love&#039;s lessons, had she been pleased to hear them. But she refused to pay them any mind. Now Love would cause her suffering and and try to take revenge for the haughtiness and scorn she had always shown towards him. Love aimed well when he shot his arrow into her heart. Frequently she grew pale and often broke into a sweat; in spite of herself, she had to love. Only with great difficulty could she avoid looking at Alexander; but she had to be constantly on her guard against her brother, my lord Gawain. She paid dearly for her great haughtiness and scorn. Love has heated her a bath that greatly burns and scalds her.

If his beauty tempts my eyes and my eyes heed their call, is that reason enough to say I love him? Indeed not, for that would be a lie. So he has no hold upon me and cannot lay claim against me; one cannot love with the eyes alone. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this way she quarrelled with herself. One moment she loved and the next she hated. She was so confused that she did not know what was best to do. She thought she was defending herself against Love, but any defence was useless. God!

The whole point and purpose behind Plato\u2019s explicit violation of this law was to restore the possibility that what is not also \u201cin one sense\u201d (kata ti) is and that what is also, \u201cin a certain respect\u201d (p\u00e9z), is not. By violating Parmenides\u2019 laws with his patricidal little \u201cin one sense\u201d and innocent-sounding \u201cin a certain respect\u201d, with his endless need to qualify, his constant ifs and buts, Plato was able to lay the ground for all the complicated theorizing of later western thought.

This was Parmenides&#039; home in Southern Italy.

The murder was done, only to be repeated time after time by scholars whose sole purpose and comfort lie in the world created by that murder. And not many things in our culture are more important than to understand just what it is that Plato killed; how he killed it; why he killed it. <br>As the founder and father of his lineage in Velia, Parmenides had allowed himself to be taken on the most terrifying journey imaginable\u2014straight down into the underworld, the bowels of all existence, to meet the queen of death.&quot;<br><br>--Peter Kingsley: Catafalque", "time": 1670616154, "resto": 21359245}, {"no": 21363496, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)15:42:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21359245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21359245</a><br>- The dialogue isn&#039;t only about metaphysics. Politics looms large in the background. Pythodorus, the man present at the conversation who shared it with Plato&#039;s younger brother, was a general in the Peloponnesian War, discussed in Thucydides&#039; history, and he ended up banished, if I remember right. The young man Aristoteles who Parmenides speaks with for the whole second half is explicitly pointed out to have been a member of the Thirty, a Spartan installed Oligarchy at the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War that brutally killed people like Polemarchus and Niceratus (and possibly Cleitophon) who appear in the Republic. The dialogue takes place during the Great Panatheneia festival, celebrating the unity of Athens (a &quot;Many-One&quot; joke, but also serious thought if one analyzes cities or nations with the approach used in the second half of the dialogue).<br><br>- There may be some observation of the differences between philosophers and non-philosophers. Consider what the Republic says about the danger in teaching the young dialectic, and figure whether the dialogue is maybe inclining us to acknowledge this danger when the person subjected to dialectic becomes a tyrannic oligarch later in life. Also note the lack of understanding in non-philosophers. Aristoteles, Pythodorus, Antiphon, none of them become philosophers; Pythodorus thinks Parmenides and Zeno will become angry at Socrates, which is a misjudgement.<br><br>- Eros and Thumos (love and spiritedness) are in the background. Socrates thinks Zeno wrote because of eros for Parmenides, but Zeno admits he wrote more out of youthful love of victory (= thumos). Parmenides recites a poem about eros before he gives his demonstration.<br><br>- It&#039;s worth noting that Parmenides is part of three dialogues showing Socrates&#039; philosophical development. Phaedo shows him, around stephanus page 97 on, as beginning with natural philosophy, hearing about Anaxagoras, and becoming disenchanted with him and moving on to learn about the beings in spoken opinions that he hypothesizes over. Parmenides shows that last move. Symposium follows with Socrates as a young adult learning about eros and how it relates to philosophy.<br><br>- Note that Parmenides doesn&#039;t see the special importance of the One as later Platonists like Plotinus would. For him, he hypothesizes about the One *as an example of how to work out hypotheses of anything.* <br><br>- I can&#039;t emphasize this point enough, but really pay attention to how Parmenides describes doing hypotheses and try to work them out using the examples Socrates thinks about (a form of Same, Other, Man, Water, Hair, etc.). Everyone is quick to assert that there aren&#039;t any Forms of Hair, Mud, Dirt, etc., but overlook Parmenides&#039; warning not to assert there are no such forms without working out hypotheses of such.", "time": 1670618544, "resto": 21359245}, {"no": 21363514, "now": "12/09/22(Fri)15:48:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21363377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21363377</a><br>Oh I see now, you literally just repeat Kingsley&#039;s opinions about Plato verbatim, don&#039;t you, Tweetophon?
