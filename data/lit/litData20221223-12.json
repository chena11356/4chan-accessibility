Buddhists find spiritual meaning in escaping and help others escape the all-encompassing suffering brought upon by the Will. Christians too, place great emotional significance to suffering: they view the world as a decayed place and humans as hopeless and brutish beings, blind to universal brotherhood and destined to suffer by Sin. But Christ, God himself, made his descent into this doomed Planet and lived the life of one of us, and suffered with us and like us, all to offer forgiveness, hope and life to us. Suffering is central to the Christian mind, it&#039;s a humbling, moving and enlightening experience, though we wish all suffering to end someday.

People at least try to do an accent when they speak Spanish, even a bad one. Anglos don&#039;t even attempt an Italic accent when speaking Latin. They just pronounce it like it&#039;s English rearranged in some kind of code.

We could go in the weeds a little deeper, especially since you think Mary refers to Jesus&#039; mother, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the olive tree thing.<br>I&#039;m interested in buying rather old things. I almost bid on a lot containing a couple Ethiopian texts and some metal objects this week. I never bid, and it went out of my price range.

What do you look for in terms of provenance and authenticity? Can you give any further information about your collecting? All the people that I know from university hate privately held antiquities and such, meaning they won&#039;t give advice. I&#039;m very much of the opposite position. Several years ago, before even studying Classics, I think I looked at the online store of one of the most prolific and shitty forgery factories before some people at my university exposed it and the FBI shut them down.

I&#039;ve said this here once before, but at the end of the famous debate video, Chomsky and Foucault are still talking about the same thing, but it is Chomsky who is unable to see it. I dislike Foucault and admire Chomsky in certain regards, but that is the truth of it. From an MBTI (derived) perspective, while both Foucault (ENTP) and Chomsky (INFJ) are Intuitive Dominant types, and both are Introverted Thinking types, their respective functional links repress different functions, and strengthen different bonds between functions. At the end, both Foucault and Chomsky have been having a Ti-Ni battle, which for Chomsky, is natural, and for Foucault, synthetic, but manageable as he is an Ne dominant. However, unlike Foucault, who has Extroverted Thinking as an augmentative relationship to his tertiary Extroverted Feeling, Chomsky&#039;s is fully repressed, so when Foucault takes the debate into the macroscopic picture of a Ne-Fe(Te) framework, Chomsky, who is attempting to do deal with this using Ne-Fe only, gets eclipsed, and is unable to see they are still talking about the same thing. <br><br>Fascinatingly, this phenomena can probably happen between any two types, and will occur in different conversational areas depending on which functional relationships are repressed. <br><br>I&#039;m an INTJ - same dominant axis as Chomsky, but same functional group as an ENTP, and this most often occurs for me (in the place of Foucault) with ISFP and ISTP.

You can find tests and articles on idrlabs (formerly CelebrityTypes), as well as on humanmetrics. Mbtinotes blog has excellent articles as well, but the most important thing, in my opinion, is to learn the 16 types and the order of their cognitive functions. Learn what the functions are and what they more or less govern, and think abou these things hypocthetically and abstractedly on your own as much as you can. Once you feel like you understand how the functional preferences of each type create the stereotypes surrounding each type, you will start to be able to try and type people. Whenever possible, type someone yourself, but get them to test as well. If you understand the types well enough, you will be able to tell if they mistyped, which will mean one of a few possibilities: either the test was poorly written, they didn&#039;t understand the questions well, their type and the type of the test writer are not well aligned creating difficulties in communication, etc.,. and you can always have them take another test elsewhere. However, in the event that someone types correctly, but is NOT the type you thought they were - this is the best situation.

Renowned for its postmodern complexity and opacity, his work still proves controversial. Ashbery said he wished his work to be accessible to as many people as possible, not a private dialogue with himself.

Perhaps \u2018the problem\u2019 particular to Jews is their adoption of fundamentalist doctrine, but you yourselves have adopted a fundamentalist doctrine in advocating for hate because your hate is ultimately based on dogma, so the problem cant be that, so perhaps the problem is the fundamentalist doctrine particular to Jews, Judaism or supposed zionism, and not fundamentalist doctrine in general, the problem specifically being that Jews will, as to be expected from any human, act in their own self interest if given the opportunity and that this threatens the national interest of nation states because they\u2019re a transnational group, and that this is evil and wrong, but that\u2019s clearing begging the question, all you\u2019ve said is that the fundamentalist doctrine particular to the jews is evil because it threatens the nation state, and it threatens the nation state precisely because it promotes self interested behaviour of a transnational entity, and that is le evil !! We have other transnational groups too, called corporations, but since they\u2019re led by Christians and masons you CHOOSE to believe that they\u2019re the \u2018good\u2019 guys, right, or perhaps your flavour is a little more.. discordian ? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there is only extremism </span><br><br>Since you failed to give a formal definition of the term i\u2019ll use the tacit understanding of the term.

They do not join forces. Their wandering journeys across the stony plains and among the low, bare hills might sometimes suggest a coming marriage, or at least a friendly meeting, but they follow their separate ways to the end \u2013 the Merri through ever-deeper gorges to mingle with the Yarra above its falls, and the Moonee Ponds through a widening valley into the same swamp where the Maribyrnong and the Yarra also lose themselves just short of the sea. This is my part of the world.<br><br>I became in time, and I am still today, a scientist of grasslands, but I have been a scientist of many things. I was once a scientist of soils. I wanted to know why I had walked with ease as a child on the soil between the Moonee Ponds and the Merri but afterwards I had stepped warily wherever I lived or travelled in other districts of Melbourne County.<br><br>As a scientist of soils I first read the words of other soil-scientists. I learned that the thing I had called simply soil was in fact hundreds of things \u2013 or many more than hundreds of things, according to the scientists of things. I read about the hundreds of things that I had once called soil, and I learned what I had been hoping to learn: when I had walked as a child between the Moonee Ponds and the Merri, my feet had pressed against an assortment of things a little different from the assortments of things in other districts of Melbourne County.<br><br>I had hoped to learn that this difference came from perhaps ten things: that perhaps ten of the hundreds of things in the soil of my native district were in no other soil of Melbourne County. If I could have read about ten such things I would have gone no further in my studies as a scientist of soils. I would have become a scientist of particular things. I would have called the ten things found only in my native soil my own particular things, and I would have studied nothing but them. I would have tried to learn the peculiar qualities that distinguished my own particular things from other things of other districts. I would have tried to learn from these peculiar qualities how a native of the district between the Moonee Ponds and the Merri ought to live his life. This would have been the hardest part of my studies. I might have had to learn, for example, how a man ought to live if one of the peculiar qualities of one of the particular things in the soil of his native district was that it seemed its rightful shape in darkness equal to the darkness of underground, but that it seemed less truly shaped in daylight or even in the light of a dim room. Or I might have had to learn what a man ought to do as a result of his learning that the smoothest to touch of the same particular things kept its smoothness only while it was damp from the water of underground \u2013 the invisible streams flowing through dry-seeming soils.", "filename": "86753689943", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 318, "h": 500, "tn_w": 159, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671797180477786, "time": 1671797180, "md5": "n5ZyPGFynR4m751JEtrHcA==", "fsize": 19568, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-was-born-where-the-moonee-ponds-creek-trickling", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 1, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 21422796, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)07:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422775</a><br>I once read the first page of one of his books and I found it dull.

Perhaps it is possible that for many people, without God, nothing is permitted; whereas you retain a sort of supranatural freedom when you believe in the transcendental which might push you beyond basic ethical concerns. Though, I think most &quot;atheists&quot; are implicitly theological - in the worst sense - insofar as they naively take positivism and physicalism for granted.

The Greek logos and the Latin ratio both have another sense of an &quot;account&quot;, as in a financial sense of an account. While logos is often rendered as &quot;word&quot; by most people, the sense of an &quot;account&quot; is very fundamental. Heraclitus is traditionally the first to use logos in the philosophical sense, though Pythagoras used it in a similar time frame, and both used it as a thing that commensurated opposites or unified multiplicity. But Heraclitus famously gave even more hints of what he was considering, since he compared his primary idea of all things being in some way unified and exchangeable with another through logos with the manner in which all objects are exchanged with gold. They were talking about this stuff in likely the mid to late 6th century bc, whereas coinage had entered the Greek world (and arguably started very approximate to it) in the 7th century bc. While commerce using precious metals was known well before coinage, for the Ancient Greeks (going off of Homeric depictions) commerce was generally seen as ignoble compared to engaging in the aristocratic gift economy and warring. And as coinage came into Greece there was much controversy. Some city-states like Sparta banned coins for a time. <br><br>But anyways, I point that out because financial accounts as a means to commensurate inequivalent things are a social construction, there is no deep &quot;truth&quot; to the balance sheet and the gold coin isn&#039;t actually commensurating unequals. That is why Aristotle ironically considered the irrationality of monetary economies, because he noted the manner in which accounts of monetary value technically have no upper bound, and so the desirable quality of money as commensurating equals is broken in the process of capitalizing assets, of writing down &quot;what they&#039;re worth&quot; and trading against it. Plato&#039;s Republic also starts indirectly with this problem, when the wealthy Cephalus (meaning &quot;head&quot;) begins their discussion of justice by saying it is what is owed, and Socrates starts posing the dilemma of properly evaluating what is owed, and what injustice may happen if the evaluation doesn&#039;t transcend the letter of an implied contract and take account of the consequences of a debt. He begins the discourse on justice by returning to the ontological status of money, because the concept of money is nearly as important as the triangle to western philosophical development. It is what is &quot;rational&quot;, it is the thing we witness commensurating unequals, it is taken to stand for the &quot;truth&quot; underlying the appearance of multiplicity.", "time": 1671746640, "resto": 21419532}, {"no": 21420030, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:19:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419959</a><br>Though should also be pointed out, in case someone were to read and simply think they were critiquing usury, that isn&#039;t the fundamental issue with money for the Greek philosophers. Aristotle DID critique usury because he thought it fucked up the monetary economy, but the deeper issue with coinage that made it unique from just trading in raw metal is that it had a nominal value, which was made up by the sovereign in the standard of minting the coins. The nominal unit of account was associated with a coin of certain physical properties, and the nominal &quot;value&quot; of the coin could diverge arbitrarily from the metal content. The association of coinage with the state made this a more fraught dilemma, because the question of who was allowed to mint the coins or set the nominal value was important. In Rome the mint was on the Capitoline Hill near the Temple of Jupiter, and was actually only erected there (so tradition says) when Manlius Capitolinus was executed after being accused of attempting to raise himself to tyrant. The accusation was leveled based on him relieving the debts of poor soldiers and accusing the senators of hiding spoils of war from the public. When he was killed, Livy said his house on the Capitoline was destroyed and the mint was built on top of it, and nobody was allowed to live on the Capitoline after. Clearly a symbolic gesture, especially since the truth of this story is unknown, so it is even further symbolic of the manner in which the sacredness of the power to mint (and control of that power) was integral to the classical state. Otherwise unequals could not he made commensurate, ie the social distinctions between people could not be maintained. It serves a double purpose, to help construct a &quot;reality&quot; of social inequality while also asserting the deeper reality of that inequality.

I bring up what I think are the origins of words like &quot;rational&quot; because it seems apparent that the western philosophical concept of rationality is heavily tied to finding the underlying unity of things in the same sense that accounts of money reveal a unity of apparent differences. When that unity is being claimed it is usually called a &quot;truth&quot;. But the ontological status of the &quot;truth&quot; has more often than not been later revealed as flimsy. I referenced triangles before because for a long time THAT was the gold standard for knowledge. We can know the characteristics of the triangle by reason. But Einstein effectively critiqued it. He showed that there was something the geometers and philosophers kept refusing to acknowledge, which is the geometers constructed their theorems about triangles by using tools on tables or other flat surfaces. Their construction of the laws of geometry with only &quot;reason&quot; was actually using a table, and when you take the table away suddenly you have non-Euclidean geometry. In the same sense, I think the old metaphor of logos and ratio for the unifying thing is based on a repression of the early Greek experience of coinage. The philosophizing of the true nature of the unifying thing was partially motivated by anxieties about the growth of the state and the growth of commerce with it, and the state&#039;s central role in dictating economic value through coins. This created anxiety because it appeared as though the state, by fiat, could upset the traditional social distributions of power by simply writing down the value of the monetary assets people were increasingly transacting with. But at the same time the political power of the polis was essential to Greek security, as more stately eastern empires were coming up through Anatolia and threatening Greece. <br><br>Which is also why I think Plato starting the republic with the question of the &quot;true value&quot; or the &quot;justice&quot; of a debt is important, and even why so much of Plato was concerned with the nature of the state and its power. He was trying to ground the naturalness of the form of social inequality that the polis was meant to protect, namely from foreign threats. It ignites anxiety to think that the state is unmoored in its sovereign authority, so there has to be a way to distinguish the just state from the unjust so we can know what things are worth and no tyrants can come in and fuck up the natural manner of commensurating unequals. But there is no such solution, money and monetary accounting is made up. The fundamentally rational is &quot;irrational&quot;. It is the grand example of the post-hoc rationalization, that when we keep accounts of what we are owed in monetary units that there is a &quot;true value&quot; to those units, that the mind of God actually knows exactly what I&#039;m owed by society and only criminals against God can take it from me by their unjust, unnatural political tricks.", "time": 1671753880, "resto": 21419532}, {"no": 21420516, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:08:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419578</a><br>What does it mean when you&#039;re both low empathizer and low systemizer?

It was generally believed that man wasn&#039;t that special, in many cultures even not much more valuable than animals because the world was often believed to be suffused with divinity and will, with deities acting through otherwise ignoble things with no words like animals or the natural environment. The classical greeks still lived in a polytheistic world, but the classical greek philosophers themselves were interestingly often veering into forms of monotheism and generally doubting the reality of the many deities, often because it caused trouble when trying to commensurate everything since the deities of the mythological stories don&#039;t seem to agree on anything so how can we know when the political state is unjust? But with the rise of coinage for the Greeks, there was a lot more theorizing and conceptualizing of what the nature of the money and the state was.

Based?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it that some persons find pleasure in submitting to sexual intercourse, and some take pleasure in performing the active part, and others do not? Is it because each form of excretion has a region in which it is naturally secreted and, when an effort is made, the breath in finding its way out causes the excretion to swell and expels it; for example, urine collects in the bladder, food from which the moisture has been extracted in the bowels, tears in the eyes, mucous matter in the nostrils, and blood in the veins? Similarly the semen collects in the testicles and penis. In those whose ducts are not in a natural condition, owing either to the blocking up of the ducts leading to the sexual organs (as in the case of eunuchs or other victims of sexual disablement) or to some other cause, all such moisture collects in the region of the fundament(rectum); for it is by this way that it passes out of the body. That this is so is proved by the contraction of that part in sexual intercourse and the wasting of that region of the body. If therefore through wantonness a man has a superfluity of semen, it all collects there; and so, when desire comes upon him, the part in which it is collected desires friction. This desire may be due to diet or to the imagination. When desire is stirred from any cause, the breath collects and secretion of this kind flows to its natural place. If the secretion be thin and full of air, when the breath finds its way out the desire ceases (just as the erection in boys and older persons sometimes ceases without the discharge of any moisture); and the same thing happens, if the moisture dries up. But if neither of these things occurs, the desire continues till the one or the other of them takes place. But those who are effeminate by nature are so constituted that little or no semen is secreted where it is secreted by those who are in a natural state, but it collects in this part of the body. The reason of this is that they are unnaturally constituted; for, though male, they are in a condition in which this part of them is necessarily incapacitated. Now incapacity may involve either complete destruction or else perversion; the former, however, is impossible, for it would involve a man becoming a woman. They must therefore become perverted and aim at something other than the discharge of semen. The result is that they suffer from unsatisfied desires, like women; for the moisture is scanty and has not enough force to find its way out and quickly cools. When it finds its way to the fundament only, there is a desire to submit to sexual intercourse; but if it settles both there and in the sexual organs, there is a desire both for performing and submitting to the sexual act, and the desire for one or other is greater as more semen is present in either part.</span>", "filename": "anon", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 800, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671750858320626, "time": 1671750858, "md5": "RU1ZCvvTu+p+lj0awjQZaA==", "fsize": 75826, "resto": 21420241}, {"no": 21420267, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)18:15:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420260</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This condition is sometimes the result of habit; for men take a pleasure in whatever they are accustomed to do and emit the semen accordingly.

They&#039;re certainly good at what they do so long as you judge them only against other, similar series in their medium, but the moment you take a step back and compare them to something outside that medium, their flaws stand out much more, and they begin to just become so tiresome to trudge through knowing you could&#039;ve enjoying yourself much more if you had picked up a good novel instead. This is why it&#039;s important to focus on what each medium does best, and for anime that isn&#039;t Dark Fantasy, that isn&#039;t Mystery, and it&#039;s definitely not Historical Fiction. It&#039;s Slice of Life and Iyashikei; Ecchi, Moe, and Comedy. Let literature be what you read when you want a riveting story, when you want to learn and sometimes even come back with some very wise, immediately applicable life advice. Let anime and manga be where you go to relax, looking for comfort in the benign. That&#039;s not to say a book can&#039;t comfort you, travel literature is great for that, but in my experience it&#039;s been a very different sort of comfort; a sort which again, I wouldn&#039;t look for in another medium, but allow it to stand out as being distinct in its function and and in its worth.", "filename": "1650815206407", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671402194975201, "time": 1671402194, "md5": "XQyaf5OHgN5ZZjVHIsZnug==", "fsize": 97002, "resto": 21400647}, {"no": 21401644, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)17:24:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hey I remember this thread", "time": 1671402243, "resto": 21400647}, {"no": 21401663, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)17:28:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21400647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21400647</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What the fuck, /lit/?

A few weeks ago I was bored so I decided to solve the problem of the edge of space, and after thinking for 7-10 minutes I realized that this universe has no edge and is finite at the same time, because it is a 3-torus, a slice of a 4D space. So the only \u201cedge\u201d is in an entirely imperceptible dimension. I view everything through the lens of evolution, the emergence of order and complexity from chaos. For this reason I don\u2019t believe in God, since causality evolved, the universe evolved, life evolved, and religion evolved. Who can blame ancient humans for crediting the gods with lightning?

These minds often find in Hamlet a vicarious existence for their own artistic realization. Such a mind had Goethe, who made of Hamlet a Werther; and such had Coleridge, who made of Hamlet a Coleridge; and probably neither of these men in writing about Hamlet remembered that his first business was to study a work of art.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an \u201cobjective correlative\u201d; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked. If you examine any of Shakespeare\u2019s more successful tragedies, you will find this exact equivalence; you will find that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated to you by a skilful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife\u2019s death strike us as if, given the sequence of events, these words were automatically released by the last event in the series. The artistic \u201cinevitability\u201d lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion; and this is precisely what is deficient in Hamlet. Hamlet (the man) is dominated by an emotion which is inexpressible, because it is in excess of the facts as they appear. And the supposed identity of Hamlet with his author is genuine to this point: that Hamlet\u2019s bafflement at the absence of objective equivalent to his feelings is a prolongation of the bafflement of his creator in the face of his artistic problem.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the character Hamlet it is the buffoonery of an emotion which can find no outlet in action; in the dramatist it is the buffoonery of an emotion which he cannot express in art. The intense feeling, ecstatic or terrible, without an object or exceeding its object, is something which every person of sensibility has known; it is doubtless a subject of study for pathologists. It often occurs in adolescence: the ordinary person puts these feelings to sleep, or trims down his feelings to fit the business world; the artist keeps them alive by his ability to intensify the world to his emotions. The Hamlet of Laforgue is an adolescent; the Hamlet of Shakespeare is not, he has not that explanation and excuse. We must simply admit that here Shakespeare tackled a problem which proved too much for him. Why he attempted it at all is an insoluble puzzle; under compulsion of what experience he attempted to express the inexpressibly horrible, we cannot ever know.</span>", "time": 1671735383, "resto": 21415853}, {"no": 21419139, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)13:59:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419132</a><br>hamlet is a qt sadboi<br>ts eliot can seethe from his grave", "time": 1671735583, "resto": 21415853}, {"no": 21419149, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)14:01:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415853</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kike hates the New Testament</span><br>Go figure.", "filename": "jews_hate_christianity", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 624, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 76, "tim": 1671735706070829, "time": 1671735706, "md5": "yBkhI2Z5Ur4JnjpxETd9SQ==", "fsize": 143082, "resto": 21415853}, {"no": 21419164, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)14:04:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21417182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21417182</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eighteen hundred years later the same phenomenon appears; the Hebrews as spreaders of atheism and of Communist materialism among the Christians, Mohammedans and the other Gentiles, take every kind of precautionary measure to prevent the materialistic cancer from infecting the Israelite communities, which they have been better able to achieve at present than in the times of Gnosticism; for the experience of eighteen centuries in this kind of service has made these destroyers into true masters in the art of handling poisons and of spreading them throughout the world without the poison infecting the Jews themselves.

In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.</span><br><br>So goes the famous first paragraph of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cA Farewell to Arms,\u201d which I was moved to reread by the recent announcement that what was said to be Hemingway\u2019s last novel would be published posthumously next year. That paragraph, which was published in 1929, bears examination: four deceptively simple sentences, one hundred and twenty-six words, the arrangement of which remains as mysterious and thrilling to me now as it did when I first read them, at twelve or thirteen, and imagined that if I studied them closely enough and practiced hard enough I might one day arrange one hundred and twenty-six such words myself. Only one of the words has three syllables. Twenty-two have two. The other hundred and three have one. Twenty-four of the words are \u201cthe,\u201d fifteen are \u201cand.\u201d There are four commas. The liturgical cadence of the paragraph derives in part from the placement of the commas (their presence in the second and fourth sentences, their absence in the first and third), but also from that repetition of \u201cthe\u201d and of \u201cand,\u201d creating a rhythm so pronounced that the omission of \u201cthe\u201d before the word \u201cleaves\u201d in the fourth sentence (\u201cand we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling\u201d) casts exactly what it was meant to cast, a chill, a premonition, a foreshadowing of the story to come, the awareness that the author has already shifted his attention from late summer to a darker season. The power of the paragraph, offering as it does the illusion but not the fact of specificity, derives precisely from this kind of deliberate omission, from the tension of withheld information. <br>Joan Didion, \u201cLast Words: Those Hemingway Wrote, and Those He Didn\u2019t\u201d", "filename": "hem", "ext": ".png", "w": 587, "h": 604, "tn_w": 121, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671723468910205, "time": 1671723468, "md5": "P5lbg9DAzwHO3mVWIeq7dg==", "fsize": 360684, "resto": 21414379}, {"no": 21418383, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)10:40:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416247</a><br>how does one solve this", "time": 1671723617, "resto": 21414379}, {"no": 21418775, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)12:26:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21418360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21418360</a><br>This has to be bait, but I&#039;ll reply anyways.<br>Having perfect pitch does not make you a good listener nor does it make you a proficient critic. <br>It is a niche ability, its scope of being able to connect a particular pitch to a note in an equal temperament (western) tuning system without needing a tonal center as reference encompasses about as much of the art form that is &#039;Music&#039; as knowing the definitions of the 1000 most frequent words in the western canon would encompass &#039;Literature&#039; as a whole.<br>It enables you to know a key of a song which is only the domain of harmony and only functional and tonal harmony at that.

All of this talk of archetypes, complexes, &quot;fundamental drives&quot; like lust and death, all explain nothing on their own, which is why psychology appears as such a hodgepodge mess to those who are interested in real facts as opposed to interpretations. To this day (far beyond the reaches of psychoanalysis) mental health problems are still treated as problems of &quot;hidden complexes&quot; or &quot;psychological coping mechanisms&quot; which require therapy or counseling to resolve (they are either unresolvable, or actually require physiological alterations in order to improve the physical and consequently psychological health of the patient; all psychopathologies, one way or another, directly or indirectly, are due to the body&#039;s inability to support the psyche). The first thing most people notice is that these &quot;solutions&quot; are perpetual, and do not resolve anything, the psyche CANNOT be resolved into any stable state all by itself, it is not self-sufficient (this is clear to anyone with their wits about them). Therapy provides the same solution as a stress ball or chanting, it distracts the mind from the more substantial issues which plague it, whether it be some kind of repressed, chronic physiological pain, fatigue, or any of the other basic detriments of human life.

But no army of inhuman Sranc had scaled its ramparts. No furnace-hearted dragon had pulled down its mighty gates. Ishu\u00e4l was the secret refuge of the K\u00fbni\u00fcric High Kings, and no one, not even the No-God, could besiege a secret.<br>Months earlier, Anas\u00fbrimbor Ganrelka II, High King of K\u00fbni\u00fcri, had fled to Ishu\u00e4l with the remnants of his household. From the walls, his sentries stared pensively across the dark forests below, their thoughts stricken by memories of burning cities and wailing multitudes. When the wind moaned, they gripped Ishu\u00e4l\u2019s uncaring stone, reminded of Sranc horns. They traded breathless reassurances. Had they not eluded their pursuers? Were not the walls of Ishu\u00e4l strong? Where else might a man survive the end of the world?<br>The plague claimed the High King first, as was perhaps fitting: Ganrelka had only wept at Ishu\u00e4l, raged the way only an Emperor of nothing could rage. The following night the members of his household carried his bier down into the forests. They glimpsed the eyes of wolves reflected in the light of his pyre. They sang no dirges, intoned only a few numb prayers.<br>Before the morning winds could sweep his ashes skyward, the plague had struck two others: Ganrelka\u2019s concubine and her daughter. As though pursuing his bloodline to its thinnest tincture, it assailed more and more members of his household. The sentries upon the walls became fewer, and though they still watched the mountainous horizon, they saw little. The cries of the dying crowded their thoughts with too much horror.<br>Soon even the sentries were no more. The five Knights of Trys\u00eb who\u2019d rescued Ganrelka after the catastrophe on the Fields of Elene\u00f6t lay motionless in their beds. The Grand Vizier, his golden robes stained bloody by his bowel, lay sprawled across his sorcerous texts. Ganrelka\u2019s uncle, who\u2019d led the heartbreaking assault on Golgotterath\u2019s gates in the early days of the Apocalypse, hung from a rope in his chambers, slowly twisting in a draft. The Queen stared endlessly across festering sheets.&quot;", "time": 1671793130, "resto": 21419571}, {"no": 21422574, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)06:03:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419608</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;riverrun</span><br>this sounds like something Joyce would shit out just for le epic troll", "time": 1671793399, "resto": 21419571}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21419582, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:29:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "as a guy from a shitty poor household this doesn&#039;t seem that bad", "filename": "BraveNewWorld_FirstEdition", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 258, "h": 387, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671740943592610, "time": 1671740943, "md5": "4GPLMhUruCyYkBDDZVsYSw==", "fsize": 24645, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "as-a-guy-from-a-shitty-poor-household-this-doesnt", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 12, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 21419620, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)15:38:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419582</a><br>Which part, the drug-addled emotionally crippled over class or the bio-engineered slave class?", "time": 1671741511, "resto": 21419582}, {"no": 21420032, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:19:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419620</a><br>The part that Huxley conveniently neglected to tell us; the harem of savage women Bernie Marx fucked raw on the regular.", "time": 1671747554, "resto": 21419582}, {"no": 21420062, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:25:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419582</a><br>Anytime this book gets posted, it reminds me how fucking utterly soulless and retarded the bulk of /lit/ is", "time": 1671747923, "resto": 21419582}, {"no": 21420167, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420062</a><br>Gonna post Animal Farm memes just for you bud", "time": 1671749318, "resto": 21419582}, {"no": 21421305, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)22:38:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419582</a><br>/lit/ goes from I WILL NOT EAT ZE BUGS AND LIVE IN THE LE POD!!!111 But the second this book comes up you go to &quot;Man, it isn&#039;t so bad.

Yes, the culture surrounding us plays a huge part in how we perceive reality. Fairy tales and media we consume as children are a large part of that. However, simply &quot;having terrible stuff happen in fairy tales prepares kids for real life&quot; is a gross oversimplification to begin with, for several reasons. It ignores that fairy tales are far from the only product of culture accessible to kids. In a modern environment, kids are going to be exposed to the fact that there are terrible things happening in the world either way. The argument also ignores that they have a limited effect. Even if a fairy tale gives someone a basic idea of death, it&#039;s still gonna hit hard when their loved one dies for real. Regardless of how many gritty stories they&#039;ve read, because experiencing something by yourself is always different than just being a passive observer to a fictional scenario. I know you&#039;re gonna reply with some vague slogan like &quot;oh but reading these stories is gonna make them more prepared&quot;, but that is an extremely moot and vague notion that also leads me to my next point: there are so much more factors influencing how a person grows up than the culture they consume. It&#039;s also about their parents, their peers, their upbringing, their social environment. It&#039;s possible for one to have never read a single Grimm brothers story but have seen some horrendous shit as a kid.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As children&#039;s tales, kids still love them because kids like to be excited, swooned, and frightened, and these stories do that, so it&#039;s not dumb in that regard. </span><br>It is. If a teenage girl reads a hundred YA dystopias about the evil government killing and tornuring its helpess citizens in cruel ways, she&#039;s not gonna get a comperehensive understanding of how governments like this are actually formed, how they realistically rise to power, or how governments work in general. Works like this are not going to make her a better, smarter person, they&#039;re not going to make her more prepared to become a politician and change the society in productive ways herself. All they are going to do is pander to the feeling of rebeillous youthful maximalism. No matter how overly dark and edgy they are, they are worthless in actually preparing one for the complexities of the real world.<br>Engaging in dark fiction is still escapism. For an average person, there are mundane things much scarier in life than the distant horrors of dark fiction. Watching someone get dismembered on-screen is easier than having to struggle with a job you hate. It does not make you a more &quot;mature&quot; person, you can still end up a fucking failure no matter how much dark fiction you consume. <br>Modern audiences need something more fulfilling than &quot;Grugules the Demigod killed a snake-monster and stole a mystic doodad.&quot; Stop pointing to precedent we&#039;ve evolved beyond.", "time": 1671640204, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21414061, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411807</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beautiful, and much better than the shitty version of the sisters having their eyes plucked out</span><br>They&#039;re both bad.

The genre of folk tales that the Grimm&#039;s were drawing upon were NOT initially considered explicitly for children in the way that you seem convinced that they are, they were just common stories that everyone knew. Reproducing them for children was at least partially a project to provide a corpus of literature for bourgeois children that would both aid to properly socialise them with bourgeois values and provide a valuable material object to act as a conspicuous commodity. The lushly illustrated books of the late 19th century were created for the purpose of being purchased as expensive gifts.<br>Of course, tolkien believed that the relegation of fairy tales to children&#039;s literature was more of an accident of history, that they were deemed not serious enough and handed down to children. I think that misses some of the socialisation aspects. As he himself notes, the fantasy story is ultimately about the depiction of the world as it should be in opposition to how it is, things why they largely focus on unusual turns of justice and happy endings, a phenomenon he recognised enough to give it a name, &quot;eucatastrophe&quot;. This tendency produces the unusual contradiction people see in the fairy tale genre, since it&#039;s stories have accumulated over hundreds of years as society had changed drastically.<br>Compare the explicitly medieval notion of justice in &quot;the snake who bore witness to a maiden&quot;, in which a snake forces a prince to marry the commoner girl he has raped lest the snake strangle him to death, to the more bourgeois and child focused world view of something like Hansel and Gretel, where the grandeur and temptation of fairy if medieval fairy stories is scaled down to a house of tasty treats that middle class children would desire. Compare also how in some stories women are largely passive objects, while in others women, and young girls in particular, evade danger or are rewarded for obedience, politeness, or observing social norms. Competing social norms over centuries generated a huge variety of stories that were later repackaged in to the fairy tale genre you recognise. This continues in fiction written during the period, look at Alice in wonderland for a great example of the &quot;girl survives encounter with faerie through force of manners&#039;.<br><br>And since you seem determined to pull hot opinions out of your ass, here is a bibliography for this post to flex on your dumb ass.<br>Zipes, fairy tales and the art of subversion<br>Zipes, the irresistible fairy tale<br>The Cambridge companion to fairy tales<br>The Oxford companion to fairy tales<br>Tolkien, on fairy stories<br>A Washington college lecture series called Fairy and Fantasy, available on the professor&#039;s podcast feed.", "time": 1671657262, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21415371, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412993</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. never read La Fontaine or Charles Perrault</span>", "time": 1671659888, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21415378, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:59:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412989</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disney changed the originals!</span><br>Disney did not make these changes, there are variants across time and cultures<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but Disney removed anything scary and intense</span><br>Okay but I can watch these Disney movies and see that that\u2019s not true.

I judge concepts by how &quot;useful&quot; they are, and I interpret how other people deploy concepts by questioning what utility they gain from them. I don&#039;t deeply question the source of my desires that orient my sense of what is &quot;useful&quot; I take for granted that I have &quot;desires&quot; or &quot;impulses&quot; or whatever you&#039;d like to call them that motivate me to action. Though i do engage in symbolic discourses about the &quot;true nature&quot; of some desire, like what it is to want freedom, or love, or recognition, or beauty or whatever, but I remain at arms length considering it a kind of game to engage in for a while. What else am I supposed to do with my endless wanting? Its like a radio signal with an infinite variety of channels constantly beamed into my head. That I want seems elementary, though the objects of desire or its particular manifestations appears various and conflicting, as I&#039;m also always existing in a present moment that seems to limit how my desire can fulfill itself. I don&#039;t think I deeply question the &quot;true nature&quot; of things, instead having a vague sense of accepting that I have impulses and desires for movement and thought and actions which don&#039;t appear as a &quot;choice&quot; I&#039;m making, anymore than I chose to exist in this manner in the first place. I simply do exist, I exist as something that wants, and my wants appear bottomless and groundless and ultimately meaningless, since the desire to just continue desiring, continue attempting to fulfill the endless desires, is doomed. But on a provisional basis I can use tools and symbolic systems to fulfill my desires, including to remimagine them. Sometimes it is satisfying, I can feel for a moment as though I fulfilled something, as though whatever cosmic task that animated me has been fulfilled and I can finally turn off. But then I&#039;m still here and suddenly the moment is slotted back into my personal history, the desiring machine continues, the symbolic discourses return to sublate that moment in a process of continuously rewriting what is happening, but history never wants to stop and be written.

Not necessarily a bad thing if you&#039;re some 21 year old Chad, and &quot;yo&quot; &quot;u dtf?&quot; is the character she wants you to play. But for the vast majority of average guys, there&#039;s not much to be gained by increasing the likelihood in the woman&#039;s mind that you are capable of saying &quot;Yooooo that&#039;s dopeeee bro lol so wuddup u wanna smoke??&quot; at any time. <br><br>All this is typical &quot;everything you do is wrong, there&#039;s always a secret reason what you&#039;re doing is wrong!!!&quot; gaslighting shit that women force men to endure by being choosy and fickle, and men buckle under and internalize, and then use to feel momentarily superior to other men by going &quot;lmao bro don&#039;t say &#039;yo&#039; lol dumbass,&quot; which is really a form of self-harm because we&#039;re all victimized by the disingenuous gaslighting regime. It&#039;s also unfortunately a real thing you have to be mindful of, since like it or not, women can afford to hold contrary fickle preferences that change moment to moment and force you to finesse your way through the contradictions on the fly.<br><br>Generic is not bad in itself. A lot of women are relieved by generic, trust me. They go on dates with a lot of guys who try too hard to play a role, because they are brutalized and made retarded by the gaslighting regime and near hopelessness about ever figuring out what the right move is. Then they go on a date with you and you&#039;re just normal, and don&#039;t seem like you&#039;re always one second away from manifesting insecurity or applying some PUA strategy, and you win by default. Earnest niceness, with indifference about being considered milquetoast (if she thinks that she&#039;s a thot anyway), is always a good default position to start from. <br><br>Even trying to appear like you&#039;re not trying or don&#039;t care is bad. Just be real and have the confidence to know that if she ghosts you for saying &quot;Hey, how&#039;s it going?&quot; something is wrong with HER, or at least the culture that broke her, not you. Some of the best advice is just to treat women like you&#039;d treat a normal decent fun seeming guy you are genuinely interested in getting to know. But this advice can also be taken too far, because maybe your idea of how you&#039;d talk to a bro IS &quot;yo, want to be racist together and play AoE2?&quot; All woman advice goes like this, it&#039;s all gaslighting both/neither shit, but it&#039;s also all true. Perform, but don&#039;t overperform. Put your best foot forward, but don&#039;t be a tryhard. Be generic to avoid being tryhard, but don&#039;t be boring and basic. Treat her like a guy but not too much like a guy. The best you can do is think of it like Nichomachaean Ethics for pussy.", "time": 1671748612, "resto": 21419796}, {"no": 21420116, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)17:38:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420106</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I shouldn&#039;t be surprised that /lit/ posters get no pussy but on dating apps you should skip past greetings or introductions entirely and ask them something about themselves based on information you gleamed from their profile. imagine her inbox full of 100 losers that all just say &quot;hello&quot; and expect the woman to get the ball rolling</span><br>Tryhard and desperate.

All men in their early to mid 20s are retards trying way too hard in one direction or another. I&#039;m not sure I could have internalized any advice at that age that would have prevented me from being that way either. All that happened is that I got enough experience that I stopped being desperate and just stopped really caring. Men peak in terms of dating easiness around 30, women peak around 20. Remember you&#039;re playing a rigged game as trying to date young girls as a young guy. Don&#039;t feel bad about losses. Don&#039;t fall into the black hole of trying to figure out what you did wrong, beyond your standard cursory examination of how you may have done something inauthentic, douchey, or immoral. If you send &quot;Hey, that&#039;s a cool X&quot; because she had a pic of an X in her profile, and she ghosts, resist the male temptation to think you messed up the secret rain dance somehow. Don&#039;t think &quot;wtf did I do wrong, should I have said Hello or Yo or Heya or Hey there instead of Hey?????? Was it weird to ask about the X right away?!,&quot; instead think &quot;Weird.

Very roughly, the split is over three factors: 1) How seriously to take political life (Jaffa encourages political engagement and defense of the American constitution while the ECers tend to be ambivalent and focused more on scholarship and overt philosophy), 2) how Strauss understood what he termed the Theological-Political Problem (WCers defend religious belief as an alternative to philosophy while ECers tend to treat it as an exoteric tolerance for the sake of protecting philosophical atheists), and 3) the status of the American founding (WCers see it as having ancient roots via an Aristotelianized Locke while ECers consider it a step dow from the ancients).

Something else I\u2019ve written which is an unpublished manuscript. In 1996, it was, Charles Kesler had a conference here on the American regime. I wrote a piece, it was about a hundred pages. I called it the \u201cDecline and Fall of the American Idea.\u201d And among those who had put on the wrong side of the fence were the Straussians who interpreted the founding as a Hobbesean document masqueraded by Locke, and they all took their stand, by the way, from Strauss\u2019s chapter on Locke in Natural Right and History, the chapter which is hard to explain because it makes Locke the opponent of everything that we identified as good Americanism based on the Declaration of Independence, based in turn on Locke. And my reply to that criticism is that in Natural Right and History Strauss offers us an interpretation of Locke, not of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson\u201455</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SG: So. Strauss would not have been pleased there were a group called Straussian?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: I know what I was going to tell you: that near the end of this little piece of mine, I had read a review by Harvey Mansfield, Jr. He used to call himself Junior. I don\u2019t know why he took the Junior off, because his father was a published author and you can\u2019t tell which is which. But for some reason or the other he dedicated one of his books to his father too. He was personally attached, but in other respects detached. Anyway, Harvey is an interesting case study of Straussianism, and he is a very clever guy and a very shrewd writer, and he can be both obscure and clear depending upon what he wants to be. Anyway, he was reviewing this book edited by the famous writer on the American founding at Harvard. Anyway, it was a collection of the documents dealing with the ratification of the Constitution between 1787-1789. About two thousand pages of documents, and Harvey began by praising the book and saying what a wonderful level of discourse that it was, and too bad we don\u2019t have anything like that today. He didn\u2019t give any real account of what was in the substance of the book. </span><br>(1/?)", "time": 1671663063, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415731, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415599</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: But then he went on to\u2014I don\u2019t know how he got on to the subject of the Declaration, but he spoke about the self-evident half-truth of the Declaration of Independence, which means no truth. It\u2019s not a half-truth, but it\u2019s still a truth. Worse than that, in the literature on the Declaration, the other people who rejected the Declaration, like Calhoun, rejected it because of the idea of racial equality, and Harvey certainly did not have any reservation as to the rights of Negroes; but that\u2019s what he said about hat. Anyway, [he] then went on to give pure eastern Straussian interpretation: Locke is just a\u2014only Hobbes with a veil over him. Which means that\u2014Walter Berns has also said that the beginning of the Declaration and the end contradict each other because the beginning is really Hobbes, and that means that there\u2019s no nobility in the idea of courage. And Harvey then later went on to write a whole book on manliness. Of course, the word manliness is only a translation of the word virtue. So anyway, I took the strongest possible exception. And then, later on when the conference\u2014Harvey Jr. made a terrible, terrible personal attack on me before the audience, you see, without any explanation as to why. Just that the chap attacked everybody and he finally got around to me. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, since then I\u2019ve written three open letters and I have a manuscript of a book with over two or three pages devoted to this dispute. I haven\u2019t decided yet if I want to publish it or not. But the most important feature of it is the discussion by Strauss and the reply to Koj\u00e8ve of the classic idea of friendship, [in] which Strauss describes how the philosophers have to have friends because they can\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about unless they have something reflecting back to them. And so philosophic friends begin, in effect, to form a kind of club or class by themselves. But when the association of philosophers turns into\u2014it becomes dogmatic and they just attack everybody outside and have internal dissonances. The Communist Party is a perfect example of what began as a philosophic friendship turned into a political party. So that whole process, there is about a page in which Strauss talks about\u2014this is the only place that I know that he really describes the meaning of friendship in the highest sense, when he says that the philosopher, when he finds himself now inside of a sect, has got to leave the sect and has got to return to the marketplace. This is a political action. A political action, according to Strauss, is the foundation of the integrity of the classical idea of friendship, which I think is a complete vindication of everything that I\u2019ve ever done. </span><br>(2/?)", "time": 1671664920, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415750, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:28:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415731</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And well, Harvey\u2014you see, Harvey\u2019s father was my teacher at Yale. I think I told you that. And when I went to Columbus in the fall of 1951, Harvey I think was still a student at Harvard. But we got to know each other and he used to come to my office and we had long discussions. He was defending Talcott Parsons, his Harvard professor, against Strauss and it was very unequal conflict. I most often said that Harvey\u2019s conversion was\u2014hard conversions make good principles. And later on, Harvey was teaching at Berkeley when Strauss was at Stanford, at the Behavioral Sciences Institute, and Strauss always had a weekly seminar. I don\u2019t think he could live without his seminar. It was like whiskey to an alcoholic. [Laughs] And I remember Harvey used to go over once a week from Berkeley to the seminar and he wrote me a letter in which he said that sitting across the table from Strauss he discovered for the first time what it meant to admire greatness from a distance, which was a beautiful phrase and Harvey\u2019s capable of that. Well, he\u2019s made several visits here since that episode and he always came over here and visited with my wife, which I really appreciated. [HJ shows SG photos of his wife.]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyway, Harvey wrote me a beautiful letter after she died and I believe it was an attempt to mend the fences that were broken down because of that eruption. It was a very unfair . . . of him . . . It was a completely non-intellectual attack on me just because I was wrong because I attacked my friends. But what is the basis for friendship, then? I mean, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, there\u2019s one book on justice and two books on friendship. So anyway, I\u2019ve got a lot of other things to get. I don\u2019t know whether\u2014but it\u2019s easy to see from that eruption on the floor of the conference, which was paralleled later on by the eruption of Tom Pangle telling me before 200 people that he had to pull rank on me. Twenty years my junior, he pulls rank on me. That Strauss confided in him. By the way, at that same banquet, Pangle went on\u2014and this also reveals a great deal about eastern Straussiansm\u2014that Socrates encouraged young men to become homosexuals as a way of\u2014and this is the phrase he used\u2014softening their souls for philosophy. And he gave a reference to the Memorabilia. The minute I got home, I dug out the Memorabilia. There was no such reference there. In that same introduction\u2014but Joe . . . real philosophers. They patronize the morality because it protected them. But at the same time, they went on to enjoy the \u201cquote the pleasures that were naturally sweet.\u201d So they all\u2014anyway, I don\u2019t know that Strauss ever\u2014. Of course this was in a post-mortem publication.

Nevertheless, Christianity has everywhere introduced the negation of what it affirms. In the last resort it cannot reject this God whose name is not to be uttered, who cannot be assimilated to other gods or to human values, who is thus a permanent factor that can be neither reduced nor erased. This is the extraneous dimension that cannot be utilized, so that even in the cleverest reconstructions it is an incomprehensible factor that immediately calls all else into question. Thus transcendence is on the one hand a removal of God from the world, a reduction of the latter to its mere reality with no purpose, no signification, no third dimension. It is also on the other hand the relativization of everything in this world, and ultimately its total devaluation. It leaves us literally alone and defenseless. We had invented the sacred. We had sacralized things in order to protect ourselves and give ourselves meaning. But Christianity with the absoluteness of its revelation destroyed the sacred and put nothing in its place. Only those who have faith can live. As for the rest\u2026 Similarly, Christianity destroyed the religions that enabled people to live with the moral and psychological courage that they give, and it put nothing in their place, for it is not a religion. It does not meet our religious needs. In its essence and truth it contradicts them. Christianity claims not to be a religion that is superior to others, but to be an anti-religion that refutes all the religions that link us with a divine universe. No doubt Christianity constantly becomes a religion, but for religion as for syntheses of values it carries with it an irreducible criticism. The Christian religion itself is constantly called into question by the absolute that is revealed in Jesus Christ. And we are thus left to ourselves, poorer and more naked than when we lived in our religious universe.</span>", "filename": "ellulsnap", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671756750622290, "time": 1671756750, "md5": "EVA8tjrCG7Doi+mrcQ6LdA==", "fsize": 99652, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420677, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:55:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420663</a><br>Where is this from?", "time": 1671756906, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420703, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:00:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420162</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just follow the (revealed) law.</span><br>How about instead of that I spend hundreds of years finding loopholes in it so I can say I technically follow it while doing my best to disregard the spirit of it?", "time": 1671757227, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420728, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:04:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419895</a><br>What makes you think this place even reads?", "time": 1671757499, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420761, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419375</a><br>He&#039;s an anarchist, don&#039;t expect there to be any structure or coherency.", "time": 1671757890, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420958, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:09:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420677</a><br>Subversion of Christianity, on nihilism.", "filename": "619pffPaDXL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 880, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671761350264207, "time": 1671761350, "md5": "JLPvItQXKg9cuMiQ7KFB+w==", "fsize": 90326, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420978, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:14:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420958</a><br>Ellul makes it impossible to be a Christian.

For 99.99% of people out there there&#039;s not a single original thinking-speaking piece of their own, the learned bits and pieces fire away when the conditions they learned them at are right. <br>Making actual new language pieces is incredibly difficult and requires peak thinking and feeling abilities from philosophers and poets respectively.

I will die a virgin. My death will be a death that would have been considered sad if it had occurred perhaps fifteen years before. There will be grief, but all the agonies that my progenitors might pass into (and they are the only people in this entire world who even know of my existence) will be underpinned by this indomitable truth: it is a mercy that he is gone. The quantity of my existence stands only as a component for perpetuating the tortuous quality of the cheap jest that constitutes its vapid manifestation. My virginity has become the gorgon against which all my faculties rise only to be turned to stone; but this is no silent stone, this is not the stone of Plotinus that stands as the antithesis of the Intellectual Principle--for while yet stone I still feel the mind&#039;s unscrupulous lacerations and all that grieves the very fibers of its being. The spirit is dimmed each time a girl passes before the mechanism of sight that some pitiless god has glued to my body. Even the ugly, unshaven, modernity enthralled women with clowns&#039; hair and bodies desecrated with tattoos which map out upon fastfood fed bodies the vapid cliches that coagulate to form their mind, even these paralyze the life in me. Masturbation has become merely the corpse of a habit that no longer instills pleasure, no longer even succeeds in distracting, but is only the dull libidinal twitch of a mind faced with the irrepressible impossibility of its reality, while lacking the courage to galvanize itself towards rectification. In the end I do not seek repentance. The decimated husk of my ego drifts towards the only gray shore its virginity-shackled mind can still vaguely form, still vaguely know as whisper or faint wriggling worm in an unclear wound--worm&#039;s whisper out of a wound that clears: Death. Here is the Telos to which the entirety of my Dasein has been speeding. Here I shall sink at last, unrequited, into the tentacles of Annihilation&#039;s amnesia. My humiliation slowly becomes seething hatred for all who embody that element of the opposite sex, and my soul&#039;s relentless cry for something beyond suicide slowly twists itself into ever more feverish fetishes that the internet can happily supply an outlet for. At last, the inconsequential blip that referenced Myself whenever it imagined &#039;I Am&#039; shall find, not rest, but an end to the sequence of caustic images that only ever taunted it into further depths of Hell&#039;s sardonic pitch. No prostitute can relieve me of my virginity, for it has become a magnificently metaphysical lesion that I lack the medicine or Savior&#039;s name to remove and, like that man at the pool of Bethesda, take up my carpet and walk into the world again.", "time": 1671755160, "resto": 21420581}, {"no": 21422220, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A mighty hearted man, small of stature, thus bursting to the brim with energy.

She took definition as her province and challenged the existing definitions of poetry and the poet\u2019s work. Like writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman, she experimented with expression in order to free it from conventional restraints. Like writers such as Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she crafted a new type of persona for the first person. The speakers in Dickinson\u2019s poetry, like those in Bront\u00eb\u2019s and Browning\u2019s works, are sharp-sighted observers who see the inescapable limitations of their societies as well as their imagined and imaginable escapes. To make the abstract tangible, to define meaning without confining it, to inhabit a house that never became a prison, Dickinson created in her writing a distinctively elliptical language for expressing what was possible but not yet realized. Like the Concord Transcendentalists whose works she knew well, she saw poetry as a double-edged sword. While it liberated the individual, it as readily left him ungrounded. The literary marketplace, however, offered new ground for her work in the last decade of the 19th century. When the first volume of her poetry was published in 1890, four years after her death, it met with stunning success. Going through 11 editions in less than two years, the poems eventually extended far beyond their first household audiences. Dickinson is now known as one of the most important American poets, and her poetry is widely read among people of all ages and interests.</span>", "filename": "Emily Dickinson", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1940, "h": 1293, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1671756736219621, "time": 1671756736, "md5": "2hyCa/stDpEz5wzCfe9p+g==", "fsize": 649754, "resto": 21420661}, {"no": 21420681, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:55:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1671756954, "resto": 21420661}, {"no": 21422156, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:28:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1671784125, "resto": 21420661}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21422013, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)02:43:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So that whole generation of normie females went en masse from reading Harry Potter, and then as they grew into adolescence the hot thing was the Twilight Series, but when they reached their late 20s early 30s their new dumb obsession was 50 shades of grey.

Indeed, the animus power does need more limitations in general. Darkstalker and Anemone throw around spells as fast as a greeting. However, Turtle doesn&#039;t use his animus power flippantly. He&#039;s careful and timid and i can think of ten ways he could have trivialized this story in as many minutes. He was just being used as a tool so the reader can see what&#039;s going on around Darkstalker. I didn&#039;t feel like he grew whatsoever by the end of the book. I really, really wanted to love him because he was awesome in the other books as part of the friend group and I was very disappointed with him. There was so much he could&#039;ve done but he&#039;s mostly static.<br><br>Tui&#039;s particular brand of humour continues - though more muted than Book 8. Turtle is not the most exciting of protagonists as he is a self-admitted coward and generally passive wishing to stay in the background. It&#039;s strong trait for him to carry as a character but makes for slower reading than Peril\u2019s book. Resultantly, I found the book bit slow, especially in the middle/end where my interest meandered a bit. At first, I loved the spying, but after a while it just felt...pointless. Like, if he had been axed out of this book, it wouldn&#039;t really have affected anything. <br><br>Darkstalker is frankly the real main character here with turtle keeping hidden the whole way and he continues to be one of the most devious and best-written villain characters in general I&#039;ve seen in a long time. He&#039;s this sticky oily kind of evil that thinks he&#039;s charming and lovable and a generous guy everyone should like, but he&#039;s just scary underneath. Maybe he&#039;s just controlling. He does these horrific petty, and vast reaching vindictive acts that everyone tells him are bad and it all just washes off him like water to a duck . . .. He&#039;s a black pit of malice and pride that&#039;s willfully ignorant of itself like a scorpain that stings the frog and denies it would ever do such a thing in one breath and then says the frog deserved it in the next. <br><br>As much as I love the new books (6, 7, 8, and 9), the dragons in them have too much power. There seems to be too much focus on special powers (mindreading, fire scales, animus magic) rather than sheer characterization. I liked that about the first books, the dragonets had to rely on cleverness and each other rather than powers. I&#039;m hoping the 10th book will be about a powerless dragon (and a little searching shows the pov character should be Qibli, whom I preferred over Kinkajou anyway).<br><br>Normally I like special-powered characters. I&#039;m not sure why it bothers me in this series Maybe it&#039;s that the animus power doesn&#039;t have enough limitations and overshadows the other powers too much.<br><br>3.8/5", "filename": "2000[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 854, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1671676438702876, "time": 1671676438, "md5": "7lDGSCh0ZWWihIFrN6QO+A==", "fsize": 294070, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416418, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:47:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just bought Joe Abercrombie&#039;s The First Law books and Brandon Sanderson&#039;s Mistborn Era 1", "time": 1671677275, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416422, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416332</a><br>Please explain to me how endless worldbuilding isn&#039;t masturbatory<br>Howard wrote fuck all compared to tolkien yet his hyborian age feels more real and lived in than any part of middle earth", "time": 1671677394, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416434, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:54:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;DCC dude&#039;s patreon two months out of date on kemono</span><br>Get to it, paypigs.

The decision to intermix was, most often, a European one - even if only out of a utilitarian mentality. The minorities which are now wholly indigenous subgroups within white societies, are culturally and genetically distinct, not only from one another, but from those people living in the lands of their ancestors of how ever many hundred years ago. Expecting them to conform to the same societal expectations as you would whites is perfectly justifiable and laudable, but to expect them to uproot en masse and migrate to nations their forefathers have had no hand in for centuries would be as illogical as sending all the Germanic whites in Texas back to Germany and Switzerland, and it leaves no place for the many mixed families out there.
