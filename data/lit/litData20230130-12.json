I agree with the other anon that there seems to be have developed a kind of pathological desire among youth within the last 100 years(?) or so to not only separate from their family units, form boundaries, and make their way but now to also form entirely different cultures that are based on reaction to what their parents raised them in. I think fast-paced mass media helps this to happen because young adults can not only lash out, but now see that they&#039;re not the only ones, and are actively emboldened and encouraged by other young ones 300 miles away to do it. This helps legitimize the reactionary youth &quot;cultures&quot; that spring up. Don&#039;t even get me started on the vampires in marketing, &quot;entertainment&quot;, and &quot;education&quot; who will then go on to capitalize these trends out of greed and/or fear.

It seems like these days &quot;politics&quot; arent about policy or taxes or anything like that its just about your thoughts on unrelated things. I feel like most terminally online people would classify the gym as a right wing thing despite the fact its literally just picking up metal and putting it back down. If you were a vegetarian people would assume you were a lefty but if you were a vegetarian who grew everything yourself you would become a righty again. I would love to say its just retards online but considering close to 100% of people under 25 spend way too much time each day browsing some garbage social media (4chan included) its going to seep into real life. People praise the younger generation for getting into politics but in reality its just a bunch of people larping online while nothing happens at the governmental level, no matter how anti semitic you are you have to admit they&#039;ve gone and constructed the perfect distraction, politics is now reduced to 300 follower nobodies yelling at each other while there is no threat of any policy change ever occurring. I think around the gamergate and tumblr era &quot;politics&quot; became more connected to general discussion and I guess people wanted to fit in so they tied their opinions on everything to their political affiliation and now you get things like the harry potter game where one third of the people say you can&#039;t play it<br>because its transphoic, one third saying you have to play it because its transphobic and one third saying you cant buy it because it has black people in it.<br>At this point you can easily avoid this garbage by not communicating with people who are underage but I genuinely believe as zoomies grow up this shit is going to become completely normal.<br>Every political thing has basically become a set of memes, look at the culture surrounding Ted Kaczynski for this, you can find 2 million memes with the black and green background and something talking about monkeys despite the fact that Ted himself wrote about how hard caveman life was.

You can argue about whether or not &quot;returning to traditional values&quot; is necessary but at the end of the day none of them have any understanding of what that means other than fat people shouldnt be so fat and women shouldnt be so slutty. It&#039;s that simple, they see what they view as issues and they joined an echo chamber.

The former refers to emancipation from restrictions such as social conventions placed on individuals by other people or institutions. This is the kind of freedom typified by the existentialism of Sartre, and has often been fought for historically but, according to Fromm, on its own it can be a destructive force unless accompanied by a creative element \u2013 &#039;freedom to&#039; \u2013 the use of freedom to employ the total integrated personality in creative acts. This, he argues, necessarily implies a true connectedness with others that goes beyond the superficial bonds of conventional social intercourse: &quot;...in the spontaneous realization of the self, man unites himself anew with the world...&quot;<br><br>In the process of becoming freed from authority, Fromm says we are often left with feelings of hopelessness (he likens this process to the individuation of infants in the normal course of child development) that will not abate until we use our &#039;freedom to&#039; and develop some form of replacement of the old order. However, a common substitute for exercising &quot;freedom to&quot; or authenticity is to submit to an authoritarian system that replaces the old order with another of different external appearance but identical function for the individual: to eliminate uncertainty by prescribing what to think and how to act. Fromm characterizes this as a dialectic historical process whereby the original situation is the thesis and the emancipation from it the antithesis. The synthesis is only reached when something has replaced the original order and provided humans with a new security. Fromm does not indicate that the new system will necessarily be an improvement. In fact, Fromm indicates this will only break the never-ending cycle of negative freedom that society submits to.", "filename": "Escape_from_Freedom,_first_edition", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 346, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675037813637330, "time": 1675037813, "md5": "P7+LNkqcrXq8Uk+cHQKwYA==", "fsize": 16661, "resto": 21589135}, {"no": 21589414, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)19:18:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589380</a><br>Yes!

If &quot;meaning&quot; itself is a culturally contingent concept or word that can be genealogically reduced to certain historical developments and psychological states and so on and so forth, why does it recur, why does it &quot;punch through&quot; and reassert itself, even when those developments and states are effaced?

Ironically, his writings actually can lead you to religion. After all, he still has a metaphysical value standing at the core of his worldview: power. CS Lewis explains why this is basically a belief in God in his book Mere Christianity. <br><br>\u201c\u2026People who hold this view say that the small variations by which life on this planet \u2018evolved\u2019 from the lowest forms to Man were not due to chance but to the \u2018striving\u2019 or \u2018purposiveness\u2019 of a Life-Force. When people say this we must ask them whether by Life-Force they mean something with a mind or not. If they do, then \u2018a mind bringing life into existence and leading it to perfection\u2019 is really a God, and their view is thus identical with the Religious. If they do not, then what is the sense in saying that something without a mind \u2018strives\u2019 or has \u2018purposes\u2019? This seems to me fatal to their view. One reason why many people find Creative Evolution so attractive is that it gives one much of the emotional comfort of believing in God and none of the less pleasant consequences.\u201d", "time": 1675062500, "resto": 21588414}, {"no": 21590804, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)02:27:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21588414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21588414</a><br>If only the Neetzsch had gotten around to reading Kierkegaard", "filename": "mom7xjn6zxz91", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 492, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1675063666863318, "time": 1675063666, "md5": "tL5hYKD+c8gHfHZn77kMfQ==", "fsize": 44726, "resto": 21588414}, {"no": 21590867, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)02:49:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21590000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21590000</a><br><a href=\"#p21590007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21590007</a><br>First day on 4chan?

He fucks her for an entire weekend and they have a lot of fun. He is so playful and animalistic about it that he seduces the female camerawoman into a threesome as well. Pure retard-Chad energy.<br><br>The next guy that answers the ad is Sid Lukkassen, a major public &quot;&quot;&quot;intellectual&quot;&quot;&quot; of the Dutch /pol/-tier right, who believes all the standard issue /pol/shit about males should have all the agency, women should be passive and deferential to men, bla bla bla. In the days leading up to the filming, Dutch right-wing forums are completely electric at the prospect that one of their idols gets to fuck a leftie girl and put her in her place as a deferential woman. Sid&#039;s application to fuck Jini is a video of him talking about how he used to fuck a leftist woman, and the inspiration it gave him made him believe he could create entirely new artforms - it is very, very cringe.<br><br>The day arrives, Sid shows up to fuck Jini, and what ensues can most adequately be described as the most thorough character assassination and sexual humiliation of a public figure I have ever seen. It is profoundly enjoyable to see a retarded trad-LARPer like Sid be so utterly fucking destroyed by his own autism once he has to live up to his delusional self-image. It is an absolutely masterful deconstruction of his entire being, and rightoid faggots in the Netherlands petitioned to have the film banned because they feared for Sid&#039;s mental health, should it be released. Several other rightoid outlets considered it exploitation of autism, these well-meaning attempts to defend Sid the trad-LARPer just adding insult to his already mortal injuries.<br><br>See for yourself, it really is pretty great.

People looked sad, on the subway, in the bars; decisions were questioned, opinions rearranged. The same grave epiphany was dragged around everywhere: we were transitioning from an only retrospectively easy past to an inarguably more difficult future; we were, it could no longer be denied, unstoppably bad. Although the death of any hope for humanity was surely decades in the making, the result of many intersecting systems described forbiddingly well, it was only that short period, between the election of a new president and his holding up a hand to swear to serve the people\u2019s interests, that made clear what had happened, that we were too late. I didn\u2019t believe all this, necessarily, though as the news got worse and more bizarre I wavered. I\u2019ve always been drawn to pragmatism, just not exactly a natural at it; as my brain says, \u201cCalm down,\u201d my heart says, also weirdly calmly, \u201cA paradoxical comfort can be found in drama.\u201d It was and still is my official position, if you were to ask me at a party or something, that the popular turn to fatalism could be attributed to self-aggrandizement and an ignorance of history, history being characterized by the population\u2019s quickness to declare apocalypse finally imminent despite its permanently delayed arrival. We don\u2019t want to die, but we also don\u2019t want to do anything challenging, such as what living requires, so the volubility with which certain doom was discussed made a tedious kind of sense: the end of the world would let us have our cake and eat it, too; we would have no choice but to die, our potential conveniently unrealizable due to our collapse. Until such time, the idea that everything was totally pointless now was seductive, particularly as a mantra you could take advantage of when it suited you and abandon when life actually started to feel alarming. I myself was soon using it to indulge some of my naughtier impulses, by which I mean that in the first hours of a morning in early January, when the sky was still dark and the government still inevitably hurtling, I decided to snoop through my boyfriend\u2019s phone while he was asleep. I\u2019d never really had the urge to go through another person\u2019s things before.

After I tell you of my sordid tale, of which I alone am left to tell, you will see why it is so unreasonable to keep me in this institution for long. <br><br>In the summer of 2019, I was a young man who had been disinherited of my Grandfather&#039;s immense fortune. Destitute, and near deprived of everything that should have rightfully been mine\u2014save for snub-nosed revolver my Grandfather always carried on him; I had little choice for work. <br><br>It was to my then considerable fortune that I had chanced upon the old Kosher deli, and seeing that they had little in means of workers and were hiring, I figured that I would apply in spite of my reservations at the sight of the place. I did not know then, but my hesitation was a sign that I should have stayed well away from that cursed deli. <br><br>I walked into the deli with nothing but the clothes on my back and a near-empty wallet, and upon seeing the old proprietor of the deli, my hopes for any chance of employment collapsed entirely. <br><br>The old proprietor, known as Cohen, was as Jewish a man descended matrilineally of old Roman stock could get. His curled hair had long gone grey, yet his build was still stocky and powerful. He spoke with a overwhelmingly powerful Yiddish accent, and upon seeing me, greeted me in Yiddish, assuming me for one of his own. <br><br>I spoke to him, and told him that I was not there to purchase anything, but that I had seen his notice for employment and had come in to the shop, with little qualification save for my will to work for an honest wage, for the purpose of gaining employment within. His dark, indiscernable gaze fell upon me for but a moment, no doubt calculating the gains that could be squeezed out of a desperate young man, and the losses he could no doubt cheat me out of.<br><br>He then spoke to me, \u201cWhen can you work?\u201d<br><br>I told him, \u201cNow or tomorrow.\u201d <br><br>As it was very late in the day when I had come upon his shop, he bid me to come behind the counter, and as I did, the striking countenance of an ancient, decrepit wine box greeted me.

I could understand the meaning of the old Jew, and I inwardly scoffed at his worse nature overtaking him. I said that I would return, and I walked out of the establishment to my car to get my possibles and spare clothing. <br><br>I should have driven away when I could have. <br><br>After I stowed my few belongings away into the unused office, where a spare, squeaky mattress had been taken out from somewhere and laid out for me, the old Jew showed me around the stations of butchery, and taught me the tricks of deep Jewry for cutting meat in a kosher way, and much else, before he told me to come with him and observe. <br><br>As he left the room, the once sterile and boring room seemed to come alive with a malicious intent. The hanging butcher hooks sank lower, the wet knives gleamed sharper, and the soaked concrete floor was all the more slippery. Each component of the Butchery, vital in their lonely use, had all come together in a secret covenant against my personage. Yet in spite of the maliciousness of the carving knives and cleavers haphazardly laid out on wet pink rags, there was nothing more desolate than the feeling of Jewishness that permeated the back. I shuddered and swiftly followed after the old Jew.<br><br>He stood there behind the counter, both hands laid flat on the clear glass pane, and slightly leaning forwards, waited for his next customer with a distinct eagerness that was altogether disturbingly familiar to me. It was the love of money that so ingrained itself to the Jewish race, that it was part of their soul, other than loud arguments over nothing and the propensity to being exiled from places of living. I stood there beside him, and beside the warped dusty wine box that remained tightly closed in spite of its disuse.

Nothing long winded; not even any suggestions, really, unless you want to. The goal of the chapter is to create a sense uneasiness that ends in horror. But even I do feel that I didn&#039;t give enough time nor details to build the uneasiness needed for the horror to be impactful. Which is precisely why I&#039;d like insight. <br><br>To whomever may choose to do so, all I ask is that you must actually: enjoy reading fiction, in particular high fantasy; that you understand what is being asked of you and that you are reading something built off of more than 15k words before it; and that it is rough and roughly edited just enough to hopefully keep the reading mostly smooth--meaning you must understand that I&#039;m asking an assessment of the delivery of content in words, not their structuring nor depth of language. The latter two come with editing. <br><br><br>Thanks in advance to any takers.", "filename": "Screenshot_20221212_033237", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1438, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674981452447764, "time": 1674981452, "md5": "NGUZHtqwkuk5F1kFY5KYzQ==", "fsize": 1340511, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21586456, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "are there any stories in antiquity where a magician turns a staff into a sort of vapor or other inanimate objects? similar to how moses turned his staff into a snake and back", "time": 1674987203, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21586463, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)05:15:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21586456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21586456</a><br>I once paid a magician to turn my staff into a snake if you know what I mean", "time": 1674987315, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21586925, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)08:56:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21586285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21586285</a><br>For fucks sake you gorilla nigger just post a link to the sample.

I feel really bad about cutting away all contact after ending things, maintaining radio silence for a year with not even one single sent text. I still care a lot about her despite making it seem so cold. I don&#039;t know where she resides these days, but part of me wants to find her and drive down to look around irl, see how she seems to be doing first before attempting to make my presence known. I realize how stalker-y that plan sounds, but I would much rather take an aggressive response to my face than have it be online and keep speculating about 90% of her reaction on my own, because body language is crucial in these kinds of situations. I don&#039;t want to get back together or make any promises, I just want to know she&#039;s doing good now with an opportunity to apologize in the way that I never have during our time together, because it&#039;s the very least that I owe her. The other issue is that due to the lack of contact, I don&#039;t know how she really took the breakup, and therefore I don&#039;t know she perceives me. She already had built-up trauma from years of familial abuse, and she loses her temper very quickly once something potentially threatening or reminding her of intense emotional pain comes up in front of her.

If they had therapists writing those checks, there would be a lot less anxiety and depression in the world. My point is, the solution to your problems in life have to emerge from your own actions and attitudes. A therapist might help change your self-limiting beliefs and bring to your awareness why you are lonely, alienated, and socially incompetent.

Its right in front of all our faces yet it takes a drug like mushrooms to make you actually see it. <br>The reason it sounds so boring or obvious to state that this system is so bad, is because everyone around you is asleep. Their eyes are open, but they are not awake. They exist in a dreamy haze of man made society, living for artificial dopamine hits, and many of them are impossible to wake up. The NPC meme is not far from the truth, and like in that movie the Matrix, many of them will become hostile and fight you when you expose to them just how big of a lie this society is. To the NPC, exposing the lie of society shows them that their identity is fake, and that they have done their whole life wrong. The NPC cannot handle the chaos from being awakened, and therefore I advise you to stay clear of those true NPCs.<br>Probably 97-99% of people around us are complete dead ends, if you are looking to change things. Changing the opinions of NPCSand showing them a better path is too time consuming for those of us who are awake. We have precious time, and there are very few of us, which is why you need to look for the Nietzschean Ubermensch around you in your environment, be it University, Work, or whatever. They can be anyone, and these Ubermensch have the ability to save the world due to their high Thumos and will to life.

He considers them surrogate activities because they are meaningless filler to detract from the, in his eyes, horror of not being capable of fulfilling the power process in a &quot;natural&quot; way - i.e., to the best of my interpretative abilities, sheer, primitive survival - the only end worth pursuing for Ted.<br><br>This is fatal for his thought. He is stuck in the means-ends reasoning of modernity. Reading rigorous philosophical analyses of technological encroachment, such as those by Adorno (or Heidegger who says much the same thing, if you have retarded gripes about Adorno), I think it is very convincingly demonstrated that the problem with technology is the way it colonizes minds to only accept means-ends reasoning, without ever reflecting on what ends are chosen, or whether there might be such a thing as an end-in-itself (by the way, this is the exact reason why the caricature of a STEM bugman cannot appreciate art - he is incapable of seeing art as an end-in-itself).", "time": 1674904440, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582414</a><br>2/2<br>This is the true danger of technology, and Kazcynski does not escape it - he REITERATES IT, but in an even more radical way.

That he has the gall to speak of &quot;autonomy&quot; (in a perverted, modern american sense, very far from the enlightenment ethos from which it arose) after reducing humans to Skinner-like-behaviorist animals with a singular function and purpose (defined by Ted) is outrageous. <br><br>So no - playing the cello is an end-in-itself, not to seduce and reproduce, not to &quot;communicate&quot;, not to make money, not to this or that. It is without any further purpose. It is not done for anything except itself. And that does not detract from it and turn it into a mere surrogate - on the contrary, that is the mark of its excellence, of its distinctly human character. <br><br>That is not to say that technological society is not a menace and an enemy - I agree. I just think Ted&#039;s approach to it is so profoundly flawed that I find it worthless, and everything he had to say was said better by Heidegger and Adorno.

I&#039;m going to point out the three most glaring issues and differences, and the reason that although Kaczynski was initially sympathetic to Marxism, he ultimately decided it was the same system:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Marxism does not address the advancement of technology.</span><br>Technological development is dangerous on its own. Even careful, well planned developments cannot account for the full range of its effects, and the lack of capitalism will not stop the bourgeois from seeking to develop new technologies to further &quot;improve&quot; living conditions. In a very simple example, akin to persistent pharmaceutical and microplastic contaminationn imagine the proletariat discovers a highly effective drug to cure aging. Because they aren&#039;t dirty capitalists, they don&#039;t release it immediately for profit but test it thoroughly in a lab for decades to ensure that it&#039;s safe. Lo and behold, it is! The proletariat found no negative effects and an end and slight reversal to aging. Furthermore, the drug decays in the environment into harmless water, carbon, and nitrogen.<br>They release the drug and everyone is happy- until 40 years later, when the children of those who were tested on in the initial lab experiments show an extreme decay in cognitive function. The proletariat is not concerned with profit! They immediately withdraw all of the drugs and begin investigations.<br>Long story short, the drug causes the development of prions in neo-natal cells that develop slowly over the course of decades. The mothers in the lab experiments did not show signs because it didn&#039;t effect them, and their children didn&#039;t for the decade of experiments becauee the prion didn&#039;t have enough time to develop.<br>By this time, it&#039;s too late. The prion spreads rapidly and persists in the water and enviromment for hundreds of years. Entire cities are contaminated with an unstoppable protein that will guarantee extinction within three generations.

All of your actions and nearly everything that happens to you is dictated by events entirely outside of your control. Are you a wage worker? Your livelihood depends on semiconductors from Taiwan, plastics from China, oil from Iran, corn from Ukraine, and so on. A small bureaucratic decision in China could result in your starvation. A minor technological development in Bangladesh could make you irrelevant.

As William James says somewhere, we&#039;re &quot;almost born hard-headed now,&quot; meaning hard-headed, sceptical, earthy scientific empiricists and materialists. Even when we want to believe in higher realities or dimensions of reality and are radically open to it, we &quot;default&quot; and painfully snap back to sober atomistic materialism and individualism in any given analysis that fails to decisively and radically prove an alternative. This is fine, it&#039;s a good heuristic for doing certain scientific inquiries, but the prestige and past efficacy of such inquiries has been used as a deceptive justification for making this sort of thinking the overall human default. What this means: any time you look at things, you tend to see the &quot;default&quot; &quot;most reasonable&quot; assemblage of &quot;at least inarguably real&quot; things, like: [individual, selfishly hedonistic and merely materialistically evolved until proven otherwise, basically mundane human beings] grouped together in [&quot;societies,&quot; i.e., mere happenstance assemblages of humans due to historical accident and socio-economic push-and-pull factors with no moral or metaphysical content], etc. <br><br>You do this with one eye while the other eye is trying to find a &quot;place&quot; or &quot;space&quot; to put things like morality, purpose, the struggle against evil, hope, hidden forces that might be working toward the good, etc. And naturally you find nothing, because the very premises of your way of seeing, the theory built into your &quot;theory-laden perception,&quot; all about rule out any such possibility - you could only see or imagine a moral or metaphysical counter-force against mere hedonistic individualism and evil itself if it were a giant, stark, obvious rupture with the former. <br><br>In short, you look out onto a universe you presume to be dead, flat, material, and empty, with a few rationicating self-interest following algorithmically evolved ape-beings meaninglessly harming each other due to blind forces that for some reason always seem to add up to evil, and you wonder where the good is, or where it could come from or ever enter into the system. As Rudolf Steiner says, &quot;we only see dead things,&quot; we only see things in their downward-tending aspect, their materializing/concretizing aspect, i.e. not the underlying wellsprings of life and spontaneity that produced them SO THAT we could see them on their &quot;way down&quot; into mere inertia and materiality in the first place. <br><br>Making you see in this way is the greatest weapon the system has. It&#039;s depriving YOU of your natural weapons, namely the ability to see otherwise, hope, and faith in the essential good of things.

The succession of Commodus and the establishment of the Severan dinasty brought too much corruption to the Empire. Provinces didn&#039;t feel as accountable to Rome as much as before and after the fall of the Severan the corrupt the Praetorian Guard even managed to sell the throne of Rome for the highest bid after the death of Pertinax. So, after reaching its highest, Rome became corrupt, bureaucratic and unable to maintain control of its borders. The crisis of the Third Century resulted in terrible outcomes that we can see in the decline of the arts and architecture.<br><br>What people don&#039;t realize is that the aftermath of the crisis meant also a sort of &quot;energy crisis&quot; in Rome. Firstly, because the empire could no longer maintain coinage as before and archeologists can see that Rome was already having problems with bullions even before Constantine. Another reason was the environmental destruction, considering the importance of charcoal and the lack of this essential resource crippled Roman metal works. The other and more efficient resource was charcoal, that came primarily from Britain and became more pricy, since mining this resource became more expensive, problems of corruption and of course, barbarian incursions in that region. This lead to a poorer infrastructure, soldiers wouldn&#039;t have access to weapons and armors of quality, petty disputes paved way to barbarians to strike and last but not least, environmental factors brought more barbarian migrations and the arrival of the Huns.<br><br>My point is, with energy crisis, a growing population, the current corruption of establishment politics and the dependency of foreign markets make both the West and China (the bastions of technology btw) weak. It gives us opportunities to strike.<br>The current goal should be exporting Kaczynski&#039;s ideas to Chinese misfits.

There is a description of how the Tupinambas treated captives from war, in which the final goal was the cannibalistic ritual:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the routine wars between the tribes, the victory of one of them guaranteed the right to devour one of the warriors of the enemy tribe. The prisoner was taken to the village and forced to parade in front of the people while everyone threatened him, announcing his death.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The execution could take almost a year to happen. Meanwhile, the prisoner was very well treated, fed and even given a wife. When the day of his death approached, the neighboring tribes were invited to the great ritual</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the day arrived, the prisoner and the one chosen to be the executioner were decorated with strong and bright colors. After being immobilized, the prisoner&#039;s head was smashed. His body was cleaned, cooked in large pots and enjoyed by those present. This whole ritual was intended to avenge relatives and friends killed during the war and at the same time embody the warrior virtues of the dead man. Eating the meat of a warrior from an enemy tribe, after a war, had a mystical meaning rooted in the culture of the Amerindian peoples</span><br><br>So the tribes had this sense of otherness, they kept themselves separated and not mixing, even tho they were from the same ethnic group.<br>However, there were tribes of different ethnic groups, such as the Waitaka, the Tupi people&#039;s would avoid them and probably have serious conflicts with these &quot;barbarians&quot;<br><br>War can have many meanings, in primitive society, war is almost like a sport to solve petty disputes, it was seen as a noble event and served a social purpose. I believe that this is the historical origin of sports, especially the way it was practiced in Hellas.

E.; Haier, R. J. ,2006). In men IQ grey matter correlations are strongest in the frontal and parietal lobes, and are evenly distributed (45% each), women had grey matter mostly in the frontal cortex - however this study also found that &quot;With respect to voxel types, men had roughly 6.5 times the number of GM voxels identified as related to intellectual functioning as did women, and women had roughly nine times more WM voxels than did men_&quot;, it can be concluded that the IQ discrepancies between men and women can be attributed to neuroanatomical differences rather than patriarchy or social reasons (Haier et al., 2005).<br><br>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimag<wbr>e.2004.11.019<br><br>https://doi.org/10.1348/000709905x5<wbr>0906<br>Ever wonder why women are such good manipulators of men?

Another study reported Liars showed a relatively widespread increase in white matter (23-36%) in orbitofrontal, middle and inferior, but not superior, frontal gyri compared with antisocial and normal controls. This white matter increase may predispose some individuals to pathological lying. Compared to men, women show more white matter and fewer grey matter areas related to intelligence. Women have more white matter in the frontal lobe, while men have more grey matter there; 86% of the identified white matter voxels were found in the frontal lobe (Haier et al., 2005). The reduced grey matter predisposes women to lie and grey matter is also correlated to moral behaviour - this can explain why a lot of women lack basic morality and virtue signal a lot.", "time": 1675050742, "resto": 21588354}, {"no": 21590535, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)00:52:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21588370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21588370</a><br>This world can feel like hell sometimes.", "time": 1675057933, "resto": 21588354}, {"no": 21590702, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)01:49:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589078</a><br>finnish and estonian girls are up to no good", "time": 1675061354, "resto": 21588354}, {"no": 21590803, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)02:27:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21588354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21588354</a><br>Women are perpetual toddlers, whining is their default state cunt they&#039;re so fucking annoying", "time": 1675063657, "resto": 21588354}, {"no": 21590816, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)02:34:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21588925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21588925</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The meta analysis on the bottom</span><br>Where you severely retarded faggot?

I do think that it would be interesting to see which traditional planet is attributed with the negative phenomenon of pride/arrogance.<br>As to the reason why Saturn is associated with limit, I think it has to do with two things. First, Saturn is the dimmest planet in the sky. It carries connotations of weakness, endings, the expending of strength and finality. Second, Saturn is traditionally the most external planet - if Earth is the centre, and all the other planets form concentric circles around this circle, Saturn is the final circle, the edge of the cosmos. It marks the outer limit and the end of life and light, both celestial and human. Further, as a symbol of the outer limit, it is also a symbol of time and death, hence why Saturn was also known as Kronos or the star of Kronos. Everything exists and lives on its appropriate plane, and carries on its journey, until the very end, at which point Saturn collects what is due and dispenses death - the meaning of the life is therefore forced to be constrained within a beginning and an end, giving mortal beings a kind of imperative to attend to our tasks, needs and duties - this is why Saturn is the lord of organisation, control, discipline, mastery and authority, in addition to being a lord of disaster, pain, suffering and death.<br><a href=\"#p21589629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589629</a><br>That&#039;s probably the Saturnine era conceived in cthonic terms, the cthonic demon Saturn rather than the celestial Saturn.", "time": 1675042875, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589721, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the greeks and romans are not western btw", "time": 1675042997, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589728, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585665</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I always assumed that this was merely some commonplace reactionary diatribe,</span><br>Spengler was part Jewish friend.", "time": 1675043077, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589758, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589608</a><br>Who said this 2000 years ago?

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

Firstly relativism is a self contradictory position.

The Good, The One, True Being is above this in terms of intelligibility. As the sun allows us to see the world with the eye, the principles of maths and geometry allow us to understand eternal truths with the light of the mind, so to The Good is the eternal Truth of Intellectuality that allows understanding of anything whatsoever.

This means it is THE HIGHEST principle of all experience, the conditio sine qua non of all experience. &quot;So&quot;, you might say, &quot;doesn&#039;t that also make it the necessary condition of the imagination?&quot;. I answer emphatically: NO YOU FAGGOT! The power or ability that is the imagination does NOT lie in experience! In experience there is contained only the EFFECTS of the imagination, the fantasy and the phenomena, but the imagination itself, the CAUSE- this is only inferred by the power or ability of reason, as an object of the mind, noumena. Now what is that which lies beyond phenomena and therefore outside human consciousness also called in our times? The fucking unconscious ok. So think about it ok just think about it. Reason is your mental power or ability to see into the realm of the noumena, what to sensory conscious experience is unreal, only because it has not pushed itself to those outer limits where ouranos and gaia embrace one another in eternal erotic bliss, culminating in the nutting of ouranos in gaia&#039;s sweet sweet cunt, filling her warm natural womb with his thick white creamy supernatural seed: The immaculate conception, of the earthly and the divine, hule and morphe- the Creation. But through the power of Divine Reason, Logos, we may know our skyfather, our Father in Heaven, who is also Logos. (John 1:1). But between the two Logoi, their is the Veil of Isis, Mary mother of Christ: that black abyss of the imagination that depives our mind&#039;s eye of the fullness, vividness, and clarity of the noumenal realm, the Kingdom of Heaven. She is that great veiled High Priestess, that stands by at the threshold of the depths: the veil of the unconscious. No mortal man hath ever unveiled her, the implication here being that her unveiling demands becoming Divine. To answer your question however, imagination and TUA, are both necessary conditions of experience, but only together with the thing-in-itself (which is just another name for the Unknown God), do they become the sufficient condition of sensory experience or ordinary waking consciousness. A higher standpoint, however, recognizes the imagination and TUA as attributes of the thing-in-itself, or the Unknown God, God-in-itself, prior to the comprehension of God, which Kant denied as impossible, only because he, like Moses, had been chosen by God to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey, and yet of which he would never live to partake.

In Dick&#039;s book, the police chief, Felix Buckman, meets a black stranger at an all-night gas station, and uncharacteristically makes an emotional connection with him. After handing the stranger a drawing of a heart pierced by an arrow, Buckman flies away, but he quickly returns and hugs the stranger, and they strike up a friendly conversation.

After giving the man some money and then driving away, he returned to help the man reach a gas station.

The essential implications of everything in the drama is already there if you just read the poem. Because it&#039;s a drama, we watch the characters&#039; actions, not just a perspective of one individual and at one point in time. This is obvious if you know that Wagner would read his poems as an actor without any music. The original two part poem of the Ring Wagner criticised for being &#039;half epos half drama&#039;; so to present the story as directly as possible he added two more parts and removed the excessive summarising and describing. But there&#039;s still much of that &#039;epos&#039; left in it, with lengthy descriptions. Certainly, not all of the essential themes of the drama are apparent in every moment without the music, but this is the original purpose of the music as set out in Opera and Drama.

The bureaucracy is enormous, making it an undesirable investment for most private corporations, it yields more energy upon energetic investment, but it&#039;s by far the most expensive energy business to maintain. The second problem is party politics, which are public concerns over this technology (look what the greens are doing in Germany).<br><br>Now, hydro is a whole different case (clean in emissions, but terrible for wildlife), and it depends on environmental factors (well, it gotta rain in a regular basis). Paraguay, a small country in South America, has 100% of it&#039;s electricity generated by hydro, which they actually purchase from Brazil and Argentina, countries with immense rivers if compared to rivers in North America/Europe. However, recently Paraguay started to face problems, since a drought in the region forced these dams to operate at a low capacity, increasing much of the energy prices for landlocked Paraguay.

With enough time, humanity will be left in the dust and we will marvel and behold at our electronic superiors with complete reverence. Moby Dick will look like a fucking joke to the stuff X8-9000 is going to come up with. The Divine Comedy will pale in comparison to WORDOTRON&#039;s &quot;Mist in Reno&quot;. Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Tchaikovsky, Schubert...mere footnotes in musical history, by the year 2391 AD we will have a seemingly infinite repertoire of AI authored symphonies that move the soul in ways impossible to comprehend. What were we thinking...we are puny, pathetic, meager creatures who have created Gods that will at best serve as benign, yet superior beings to us all.

It is true that all the imperfections it contains are not attributable to me; I only had at my disposal the text printed at Boulaq, a rather incorrect text and in several places completely unintelligible. But, understanding all that this translation could be useful for those who are interested in Egypt in any capacity whatsoever, I have decided to publish it as it is. Doubtless it would have been preferable to undertake such work on a text that was surely established, but when will this text appear, if it ever appears? The manuscripts which should be consulted are scattered in all the libraries of Europe and it is not always easy to examine them on the spot; I had to give up even correcting the most obviously altered passages. I hope that people will kindly take me into account of all these difficulties and consider above all that I had no other aim than to make available to those who are interested in Egypt, but who are not not versed in the Arabic language, the treasure of documents which contains the Description of Egypt of Maqrizj. It is in all respects extremely regrettable that QUATREM\u00c8RE did not follow up on its plan to carry out a translation by our author. The thorough knowledge that this scholar possessed of the Arabic language, the soundness of his views, the clearness of his explanations would have made an impeccable work of it; unfortunately, for various reasons, he had to abandon the task begun and no one after him devoted himself to this work; it is not that the Orientalists failed to recognize the historical value of the Arab writer; many of them consulted it and sometimes even gave the translation of important pieces, but no follow-up translation has been undertaken to date, a translation which alone, by presenting to us the author with his undeniable qualities and his real faults too, would allow us to judge him without prejudice and to realize the degree of credence that can be accorded to his assertions. It is this work that I am undertaking, without concealing the difficulties or the pains, convinced at the same time that I am accomplishing a useful work.

That&#039;s why most chinks have word amnesia and why NOT ONE (1) good Chinese novel has been written. It&#039;s like writing a novel by punching out the predictive text on the phone. Also it makes them not think in characters but an alphabet so they&#039;re undoing the benefit of characters as the brain translates the characters to the spoken word instead of interpreting it as a unique entity and speedily processing it. Want know who among the Chinese is a literal subhuman insect NPC? Ask how they write. If it&#039;s the phonetic to character, they basically have no understanding of their own written language. The only Chinese speakers that have any right to comment are those that use cangjie, wubi or written character input.
