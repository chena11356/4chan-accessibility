A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. <br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. Nothing but the codified New England berms on Janice lane. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle. He could hold onto her large ears as she bound over hill and river. They could mass with the stones and the leaves. Lem was alone.", "time": 1674440696, "resto": 21560326}, {"no": 21560389, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)21:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21560326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21560326</a><br>Was wondering where this general had went.

It was as cool and quiet and dim as when he had reconnoitered it the day before. The librarian didn&#039;t look up from her desktop game of solitaire as he walked toward the corner where the classic literature was shelved. Seeing that it too had maintained the state in which he initially observed it \u2013 desolate and inconspicuous \u2013 the trepidation which had been festering on the edges of his consciousness faded. Still under the influence of some anxiety, however, he absentmindedly groped at his genitals through his silver polyester athletic shorts. Scanning the shelves, he read and recognized the names of authors he had not and did not care to read. Balzac, Dickens, Faulkner, Mann, and so on. The problem with working through a book, he thought, was that he didn&#039;t have to. If the work contained any novel insight, the reading public would integrate those insights into their daily life; being a member of that same population, those insights would find their way to him eventually. His apish appearance belied the fact that the degrees of separation between him and this reading public was about three.<br> Now almost fully erect, he decided to sneak a quick ejaculation into the day&#039;s schedule. Kneeling down on the dark-blue carpet, he retrieved his member from his running shorts. Each stroke produced a sort of whispering sound; a sound no louder than that of actual whispering one might hear if this particular library was more popular. Not having the strongest pictorial imagination, he glanced around for something even tangentially erotic. Instead, all he saw was phalanxes of names of very famous and dead authors. He was unsure if they were bemused or amused or shocked or disgusted, but he felt as if they were all arrayed around him with unyielding eyes. Joyce and Jung and even Joubert, all gazing from the spines of their works in a sort of ghostly or immortal way. <br> The frictive heat on his member, the slow fatiguing of his arm, and the why-am-I-even-doing-this species of boredom all crept up on him and tapped on his shoulder in a dissuading way. He persisted, however, until his haunches tightened, and whitish phlegm spattered the carpet. The bookshelves glared with unison disapproval. Zola, who was only inches away from the clump of spermatozoa, stared with the greatest disdain. With anxiety still lingering, he wiped the dampness from his urethra on the carpet, stood up, and peeked around the bookcase toward the door. Just then, the sound of barking broke the silence. It grew louder until the glass door swung open, and a man with a chained pit bull invaded the library. <br> &quot;My God! Sir, you can&#039;t bring your dog in here,&quot; the librarian cried. <br> The dog walker scanned the entirety of the room, save the librarian&#039;s eyes.

The energy of mindfulness is a necessary ingredient in healthy communication. Mindfulness requires letting go of judgment, returning to an awareness of the breath and the body, and bringing your full attention to what is in you and around you. This helps you notice whether the thought you just produced is healthy or unhealthy, compassionate or unkind.<br><br>Conversation is a source of nourishment. We all get lonely and want to talk with someone. But when you have a conversation with another person, what that person says may be full of toxins, like hate, anger, and frustration. When you listen to what others say, you\u2019re consuming those toxins. You\u2019re bringing toxins into your consciousness and your body. That\u2019s why mindfulness of speaking and mindfulness of listening are very important.<br><br>Toxic conversation can be difficult to avoid, especially at work. If it is going on around you, be aware. You need to have enough mindful awareness not to absorb these kinds of suffering. You have to protect yourself with the energy of compassion so that when you listen, instead of consuming toxins, you\u2019re actively producing more compassion in yourself. When you listen in this way, compassion protects you and the other person suffers less.<br><br>You absorb the thoughts, speech, and actions you produce and those contained in the communications of those around you. That is a form of consumption. So when you read something, when you listen to someone, you should be careful not to allow the toxins to ruin your health and bring suffering to you and to the other person or group of people.<br><br>The Buddha used the graphic image of a cow that has a skin disease. The cow is attacked by all kinds of insects and microorganisms coming from the soil, coming from the trees, coming from the water. Without skin, a cow can\u2019t protect herself.

If you study math in more depth, to the point of majoring or minoring in it in college, you will start to hear about &quot;analysis&quot;. In math, the word &quot;analysis&quot; has a specific meaning, apart from its general sense. Again, it really just refers to looking at continuous things and using derivatives and integrals to model them, but is much more rigorous. Mathematical &quot;analysis&quot; is one of the major branches of math, and is distinguished from things like algebra and topology. A mathematician who specializes in one of these broad subjects might be called an analyst, an algebraist, or a topologist.<br><br>In short, analysis is &quot;harder&quot; because it&#039;s more rigorous. Calculus is learning formulas that actually work.

That is, that technological progress is an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. We have already seen that technological developments that seem entirely beneficial at first can turn out to have a proven negative effect decades after their invention. In a simple case, imagine plastics(which are now breaking down into molecular sizes in vast amounts, causing endocrine disruption and, in the future, possibly far worse effects) poly-chlorinated biphenyls, BPAs, PTFEs, and other highly disruptive chemicals. Each of these their own times were not known to cause negative effects or be biologically reactive under lab conditions, yet some are now banned globally and most are known to be highly hazardous to life, yet remain in because of corporate and industrial interests. And further, they cannot be banned because any ban would set the nation that banned it back economically, thus allowing less prudent nations to out compete it, resulting in NO NET EFFECT. Even if ALL negative chemicals were banned globally at this moment, any new technological development could result in likewise unforeseen consequences of an even greater magnitude.<br><a href=\"#p21560908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21560908</a><br>In the context of industrial society, the internet IS good. Modern people can hardly function without it, whether as a means to survive or as a means to reduce suffering imposed by other parts of industrial society. Yet, I want you to think about something. Let us suppose that we get rid of all of the &#039;bad&#039; technologies but leave in internet- something you think is &#039;good&#039;. Let us also suppose that it really is objectively good. How would we keep the internet functioning? First, we&#039;d need electricity. That would require power plants, which would depend on industrial mining and semiconductors manufacturing, which would rely on plastics and international transportation, and the cell towers and satellites would rely on... etc, etc. There is no way to take only the &#039;good&#039; without the &#039;bad&#039;, and Kaczynski elaborates on this in ISaiF and pic related is a specific chapter pertaining to this.", "filename": "Screenshot_2023-01-23_00-47-55", "ext": ".png", "w": 1783, "h": 426, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 29, "tim": 1674452948923905, "time": 1674452948, "md5": "8PeKRNWWMYAgojh4n8031Q==", "fsize": 124655, "resto": 21559899}, {"no": 21561080, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)00:50:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21560891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21560891</a><br>Indeed.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. He also wrote that it was only shared with his wife, as a gift to her, and I think the passion of that also comes through. It&#039;s different in meaningful ways from anything I&#039;ve ever read from him, which may be a problem for those expecting more of the same that&#039;s typical of his Cosmere writings. It&#039;s by far the most humorous work I&#039;ve read from him, not so far in that I&#039;d call this a comedy or a satire, but it goes a long way towards that. His humor for me has mostly been a miss, but I found it amusing enough this time around. He&#039;s definitely become more proficient in a style of humor of being crude and lewd in an obscured way. His practice of making suggestive political and social commentary while also providing life lessons is also here as well. I don&#039;t find anything wrong with that, but some might.<br><br>The primary theme for this novel is about taking chances and pushing your boundaries because then you may discover what truly motivates you in life, and it may well be something you hadn&#039;t even the slightest idea that it could be. It&#039;s a tale told by Hoid of self-discovery, courage, determination, friendship, loyalty, and of course, love. If you find those ideas to be trite, then this book will have substantially less to offer you. For me it was a considerable amount of visceral joy, especially near the end.<br><br>What was most surprising for me is how little I minded the length considering its content. Usually when I&#039;m reading Sanderson I think that it could be much shorter. It&#039;s not even that he&#039;s necessarily better at short length, he has some awful short fiction. The content for a full three-quarters of the book is being on ships sailing. I don&#039;t know if that makes it nautical fantasy, but there&#039;s certainly an argument for it. There&#039;s not much to do fill several hundred pages worth of being on a ship other than discussion, experimentation, and a few dangerous events on the high pollen seas. Yes, the seas are filled with pollen, twelve varieties around the world that each have their own magical effects.<br><br>There&#039;s a twist, but considering the extensive foreshadowing it receives to where it&#039;s all but stated multiple times, I don&#039;t know if it really counts as one. I thought I caught it early on, but at the end, the book literally tells the reader when the earliest point they could&#039;ve known and how. Considering how obvious it was in retrospect, I was rightfully put in my place. As to whom Hoid is telling all of this, it&#039;s indirectly stated near the very end, but that requires having read the relevant novella and remembering. As to why he is, I guess that&#039;s just a Hoid thing to do.<br><br>I&#039;m very pleased by this simple and straightforward story that&#039;s filled with heart.<br><br>Rating: 4/5", "filename": "60531406", "ext": ".png", "w": 943, "h": 1471, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674329308465725, "time": 1674329308, "md5": "lBfeIB7nF4IAGmdxYhLg/Q==", "fsize": 1444355, "resto": 21553468, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21554681, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)14:32:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Gameplayers of Titan was great.

But make no mistake. This &#039;studying&#039; cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who &#039;feel for the people.&#039; In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all instinct, are capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own amazement, the result of their social &#039;efforts&#039; is always nil, frequently, in fact, an indignant rebuff, though this, of course, is passed off as a proof of the people&#039;s ingratitude.<br><br>Such minds are most reluctant to realize that social endeavor has nothing in common with this sort of thing; that above all it can raise no claim to gratitude, since its function is not to distribute favors but to restore rights.<br><br>I was preserved from studying the social question in such a way.

Later SS works clearly translated this in 4 so called life laws which made up the &#039;&#039;racist worldview&#039;&#039; which is more accurately called a natural worldview since it is largely based on biological concepts.

A letter and local papers from Dr. Howard tell the whole sad story\u2014which by this time you may have heard directly. If you have not received first-hand information from Cross Plains, I\u2019ll send you the material I received. Like you, I feel clubbed on the head\u2014or as if the whole thing were a nightmare from which one might suddenly awake. In case duplicate data hasn\u2019t reached you, I\u2019ll say briefly that grief about REH\u2019s mother was the cause. When he was told that she could not live more than 48 hours, he entered his car, closed the doors, and shot himself through the head\u2014never regaining consciousness and dying 8 hours later. That was June 11. His mother died the next day without regaining consciousness or knowing of his act. The shock to Dr. Howard must be devastating\u2014wife and splendid only child gone in one dread blow. I only hope he can weather it successfully. I\u2019ve just written him a letter of sympathy. His letter showed tremendous bravery, and the paper spoke of his being about to visit relatives in Missouri. One can imagine his suffering\u2014as well as the degree of grief which drove REH to his own desperate act. REH\u2019s library will go to his alma mater\u2014Howard Payne College in Brownwood\u2014as the nucleus of a Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection which will later include letters, mss., etc.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poor old Two-Gun! His sombre, moody side\u2014or else his general sensitiveness\u2014must have gone deeper than we ever realised. Heaven knows the loss of a cherished parent is bad enough, but most can accept it as part of the inevitable order of things. REH\u2019s idolisation of both his parents was always manifest, but the present sad extreme was hardly to be looked for\u2014although his father says he feared it for some time. I suppose that, in the last analysis, his desperate reaction to his grief came from the selfsame endowment of sensitiveness and imagination which made his stories stand out so. He saw everything in the heightened light of its dramatic relationships to things behind and around it, and subjectively felt the events of history, and the spirit and overtones of scenes and personalities, as very few are able to see and feel. Turned on the sorrow in his immediate life, this faculty must have given things an intolerable aspect and precipitated the fatal act. One could wish that, for once, he had been less of a sensitive artist.</span>", "filename": "WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_011921_1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 714, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 59, "tim": 1674349580179121, "time": 1674349580, "md5": "wVJhzVzgVskxfwsXvCsZ2w==", "fsize": 245572, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21556226, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21556123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556123</a><br>oh shit I ( <a href=\"#p21556101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21556101</a> ) confused him with John Norman for a second... mille scusi!!!!!!", "time": 1674351458, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21556287, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)20:59:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555920</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe there is a word or phrase for this that I&#039;ve never heard, idk</span><br>Being white (not a nigger)?", "time": 1674352760, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21557385, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:39:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555560</a><br>I am unironically doing this as we speak<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they are fine with it</span><br>Rich parents for the win, suck a fat one poorlets", "time": 1674380367, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21557755, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)07:57:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555582</a><br>Because you are a no gf NEET loser", "time": 1674392256, "resto": 21555560}, {"no": 21557789, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)08:19:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555560</a><br>My parents are the same.

So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of information obtained; lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it, can make another in the suit. He recognizes what is played through feint, by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table.

It is simply to protect traits that have naturally arisen in a small group of people, purity does not enter in to it.

Plutarch, On Sparta put me on this road. But I wouldn&#039;t recommend reading them unless you are a Laconophile like myself. I, on a whim, read Mein Kampf. I can not underestimate how much I agreed with that book, specifically the Ford translation, there are parts that are dark but entirely relevant to what is happening today.

It can easily outline what the goal is and why we want it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For My Legionaries, Codreanu</span><br>One of my favorite books, the autobiography of a Orthodox man who fought and was murdered protecting his beloved nation of Romania. This book is probably the most impassioned work I have ever read. The man is an inspiration and one whom I continue to regard as a role model.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A New Nobility Of Blood and Soil</span><br>A proposed blueprint for an idealized society within a National-Socialist society, one that tries to put in to practice many but not all, and some new one values that NS espouses. It is both easy digestible and engaging.<br><br>There are many others that I will link in a pic, but if you suspect that a book is too much for you find something else. The old Iron March stuff is not too bad, it can easily serve as an introduction to this sort of thing. Above all though, don&#039;t be what the other side what you to be.

As the logical Idea is seen to unfold itself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the history of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and thus at the same time the poorest. The relation too of the earlier to the later systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the corresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier are preserved in the later: but subordinated and submerged. This is the true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of philosophy \u2014 the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by a later. Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative sense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything, has been set aside and done for. Were it so, the history of philosophy would be, of all studies, most saddening, displaying, as it does, the refutation of every system which time has brought forth. Now although it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted, it must be in an equal degree maintained that no philosophy has been refuted, nay, or can be refuted. And that in two ways. For first, every philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and secondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular stage in the evolution of the Idea.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1674372637, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557138, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21557136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21557136</a><br>Dostoyevsky was a far superior writer if I&#039;m being honest.", "time": 1674372681, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557404, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "At first I was lukewarm on Pale Fire (didnt even try to do that) cuz I thought its structure was just Nabokov showing off and I&#039;m generally apprehensive when it comes to praising books solely for being intricate, but its the final third or so of the book where all the small pieces really come together.

He who wants to buy some of it will find it in such and such a place.&quot; The Frank&#039;s pay for the announcement made would be the wine in that bottle. One day this Frank went home and found a man with his wife in the same bed. He asked him, &quot;What could have made thee enter into my wife&#039;s room?&quot; The man replied, &quot;I was tired, so I went in to rest.&quot; &quot;But how,&quot; asked he, &quot;didst thou get into my bed?&quot; The other replied, &quot;Well, I found a bed that was spread, so I slept in it.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; said he, &quot;my wife was sleeping together with thee!&quot; The other replied, &quot;Well, the bed is hers. How could I therefore have prevented her from using her own bed?&quot; &quot;By the truth of my religion,&quot; said the husband, &quot;if though shouldst do it again, thou and I would have a quarrel.&quot; Such was for the Frank the entire expression of his disapproval and the limit of his jealousy.&quot;</span><br><br>westernbros...", "time": 1674422573, "resto": 21559028}, {"no": 21559134, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:28:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559028</a><br>A short poem by aleister Crowley<br><br>When Celia cums, &#039;tis earthquake hour The bed vibrates like kettledrums It is a grand display of power when Celia cums.

To the knight I applied a small poultice untill the abscess opened and became well; and the woman I put on diet and made her humour wet.

And I was standing by. Then the physician laid the leg of the patient on a block of wood and bade the knight strike his leg with the axe and chop it off at one blow. Accordingly he struck it - while I was looking on - one blow, but the leg was not severed. He dealt another blow, upon which the marrow of the leg flowed out and the patient died on the spot. He then examined the woman and said, &quot;This is a woman in whose head there is a devil which has possessed her. Shave off her head.&quot; Accordingly they shaved it off and the woman began once more to eat their ordinary diet - garlic and mustard. Her imbecility took a turn for the worse. The physician then said, &quot;The devil has penetrated through her head.&quot; He therefore took a razor, made a deep cruciform incision on it, peeled off the skin at the middle of the incision until the bone of the skull was exposed and rubbed it with salt. The woman also expired instantly.

Other anons have addressed you from an intellectual standpoint but I would also say that there must be a movement of the heart. And I don&#039;t mean that in a New Age effeminate way. What I mean is that Christ is also experiential and that if we only approach the matter from a rational perspective we can harden our capacity to accept anything. That goes for any other philosophy or ideology. Likewise, when we are too reliant upon our emotions, we get swept away with any wind that comes across our path. Ideally, there needs to be a movement in both because both faculties are to operate in symphony. Discussions about the heart are extensive in both Christ and the writings of His saints. <br><br>Above all else, pray that He may reveal Himself to you in some way that you understand. And pray for a supple heart to be able to accept this revelation in a humble way. I know it sounds ridiculous and I know that when someone first starts praying if feels mechanical and silly. But if you take one step towards God, He will take a hundred towards you. His love for you is beyond measure. Also, maybe visit a church near you and talk to the priest there and maybe also attend a service. I&#039;d personally say to attend an Eastern Orthodox church if you can.

From time immemorial, the &quot;love&quot; of the Christian has never prevented him from persecuting religious pagans with a murderous hatred; and this same &quot;love&quot; doesn\u2019t prevent him even now from abolishing the sacred rituals of conquered tribal cultures. It is a well-known fact that Buddhism proscribes the killing of animals, because the Buddhist recognizes the obvious fact that each and every earthly creature shares a common nature with man himself. But when one objects to the Italian\u2019s murdering of an animal, he will immediately respond by assuring you that the creature &quot;has no soul,&quot; and &quot;is not a Christian.&quot; This indicates clearly that, for the devout Christian, only man has a right to live.

Capitalism, along with its pathfinder, science, is in point of fact the fulfillment of Christianity; the church, like science, constitutes a consortium of special interests; and the &quot;one&quot; that is addressed by a secularized morality is indistinguishable from the life-hostile &quot;ego,&quot; which, in the name of the unique godhead of the spirit\u2014only now coupled with a blind cosmology--accounts for the war that has been waged against the innumerable, &quot;many&quot; gods of the world; earlier ages were at least more honest in their opposition to the cosmic deities, for they frankly approached the fray in the menacing aspect of judge.&quot;<br>-- Ludwig Klages", "time": 1674400484, "resto": 21542235}, {"no": 21558091, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:24:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you haven&#039;t read at least 50% of these, you&#039;re very poorly educated on Christian theology and history", "filename": "christian_doctrine", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 7655, "tn_w": 32, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674401097371671, "time": 1674401097, "md5": "4GswvxXi14Nv02qINnIUsg==", "fsize": 3501661, "resto": 21542235}, {"no": 21558093, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:26:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21553912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21553912</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;replies to a literal bot post</span>", "time": 1674401160, "resto": 21542235}, {"no": 21558120, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)10:35:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21542745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21542745</a><br>I have this as well.

I wonder why that is. This thread will eventually get deleted for being &#039;off topic&#039; or some asshole makes another, even worse, meta thread and the mods will decide that&#039;s the better thread and get rid of this one. <br><br>The fundamental problem goes back to Marshall Mcluhan. The medium is the message. This board, this website, this corner of the internet, it was made in a different time. It was made during an age of budding internet use. The transfer to windows XP. The emergence of DSL internet. Just look at the web design of this page. This website was meant for a smaller audience. the CHAN format was meant to be slower. The fact that /b/ was always the hallmark of &#039;it&#039;s so crazy, you never know what you&#039;ll get!&#039; was because it was the one &#039;fast&#039; board compared to the rest of the website. <br><br>Do you remember GETS? GETS used to define memes. They were so rare and it was such an event that the entire chan zeitgeist shifted from some idiots post ending in 0000000. It was a delight. It was interesting. Arbitrary posts with unique numbers CHANGED the collective subconscious. Now? Now everyone just replies to a GET and goes lol and moves on. So many people here, so many posts, made some of the fundamental cultural artifacts that came from the medium itself disappear. As the website grows in population, the culture is both destroyed, but it is also forgotten. The old leaves and the new stays. New board culture appears in the new apparatus of the medium. When so many people post that the posts themselves don&#039;t matter, what happens? Post quality drops. People shitpost. People save photos of frogs and continue to post photos of frogs over and over and over again. People stop putting effort into their posts. This post itself, why the fuck am I typing all this out? This thread is going to get deleted. I&#039;m not going to get any (you)s. This post isn&#039;t going to make people go &#039;oh wow, great point anon, I sure am going to start putting effort in again!&#039; because that&#039;s some delusional great man theory bullshit. There are too many people to use social pressure anymore. When was the last time someone told you to &#039;lurk moar&#039;? I remember the fear of being called out, I didn&#039;t post on 4chan for months. This was back in 2005. This was the time people nostalgically remember. This was before the eternal summer. Before /pol/&#039;s 2016 bullshit. Before all the other historical markers you think are important but are just dots along a timeline.<br><br>/lit/ sucks because /lit/ sucks. 4chan has too many users for there to be a thoughtful culture. The internet sold out and everyone got access to a smartphone. <br><br>Do you think we can go back to posting on forms? Do we go back to iirc? BBS?

Lets look at what threads are successful on /lit/? Generals. the scifi general has maintained for what seems like an eternity. Why is that? Everyone but the people who want to post about scifi ignore it. it is a /lit/ within /lit/. The writing general maintains for the same reason. Everything else, every thread you people complain about being shit gets so many posts it autosages. (When the fuck was the last time someone declared they saged a post and gave a shit? That used to be a thing.) The threads you people want die instantly with 7 replies. No one cares about other people&#039;s /lit/ threads. No one bumps the good one&#039;s and sages the bad ones. Why? Because there are too many shitposters who are on their own little crusade of what THEY think /lit/ should be to care.

They have mastered the Star Wars or Star Trek universes or whatever, but their objects of veneration are useful mainly as a backdrop to their own devotion. Anyone who would camp out in a tent on the sidewalk for weeks in order to be first in line for a movie is more into camping on the sidewalk than movies. Extreme fandom may serve as a security blanket for the socially inept, who use its extreme structure as a substitute for social skills. If you are Luke Skywalker and she is Princess Leia, you already know what to say to each other, which is so much safer than having to ad lib it. Your fannish obsession is your beard. If you know absolutely all the trivia about your cubbyhole of pop culture, it saves you from having to know anything about anything else.

Murrah Federal Building and the period after his 1995 arrest until his 2001 execution. McVeigh&#039;s life, as Dr. Wendy Painting describes it, offers a backdrop for her discussion of not only several intimate and previously unknown details about him, but a number of episodes and circumstances in American History as well. In Aberration in the Heartland, Painting explores Cold War popular culture, all-American apocalyptic fervor, organized racism, contentious politics, militarism, warfare, conspiracy theories, bioethical controversies, mind control, the media&#039;s construction of villains and demons, and institutional secrecy and cover-ups. All these stories are examined, compared, and tested in Aberration in the Heartland of the Real, making this book a much closer examination into the personality and life of Timothy McVeigh than has been provided by any other biographical work about him</span>", "time": 1673972249, "resto": 21532622}, {"no": 21538168, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:21:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21537208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21537208</a><br>Aberration talks about JTF6 if that&#039;s relevant to you. <br>Wendy&#039;s second book is said to focus more on these overarching organizations/projects/task forces and the players in these events other than McVeigh.", "time": 1673972491, "resto": 21532622}, {"no": 21538261, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)11:49:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21532622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532622</a><br>I don&#039;t get what&#039;s so interesting about the guy since I was born in the 90s and didn&#039;t know about him until many years later", "time": 1673974164, "resto": 21532622}, {"no": 21538357, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)12:23:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21538261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538261</a><br>he&#039;s like britney spears or justin bieber only he&#039;s the patsy to hundreds of people being murdered", "time": 1673976210, "resto": 21532622}, {"no": 21538391, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)12:35:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I liked the digressions in the book; the history of &quot;lone&quot; gunmen, the history leading up to the Gulf War and the fucked up shit that happened there, the shady vaccines giving soldiers AIDs, the mental breakdown of double agents, the history of brain implants, the US government creating UFO conspiracies and literally driving people mad with them.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

It was proven fake in the 15th century but was looked at suspiciously since the 11th. The Donatio was seen as a side argument for the independence of the Church and for particulars of church organization. This argument was fake (though presented without fraudulent intent) but didn&#039;t work convincing contradictors. What rests on it then? <br>Second, the temporal authority was hardly the keeper of the papacy, they spent centuries upon centuries trying to bring down the pope or make him their pawn, with only rare exceptions like Charlemagne or St Louis that protected the pope against the threat of tutelage to Constantinople or Frederick II. Of course secular rulers taking over their local churches was the main reasons protestantism spread with backing from political leaders (like the rogue princes gave a damn about the tranny soteriology, at most they wanted to divorce and have harems) or why easterners kept the schism. <br>Third, the office of pope is from the earliest apostolic tradition but the specifics of the job have changed a lot through history and that relative power (which I assume you are alluding to). It reached its peak after the first council of the Vatican, a time where the pope was theoretically prisoner of the kingdom of Italy and can certainly not be described as being kept by temporal rulers.", "time": 1674292096, "resto": 21549151}, {"no": 21553531, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:08:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21549151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21549151</a><br>Is Ybarras really fair though?", "time": 1674302893, "resto": 21549151}, {"no": 21553561, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)07:24:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21549179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21549179</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aquinas Summa is overrated imo.

Every time a new medium comes along\u2014whether it\u2019s the invention of the printed book, or TV, or Twitter\u2014and you start to use it, it\u2019s like you are putting on a new kind of goggles, with their own special colors and lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see things differently.<br><br>So (for example) when you start to watch television, before you absorb the message of any particular TV show\u2014whether it\u2019s Wheel of Fortune or The Wire\u2014you start to see the world as being shaped like television itself. That\u2019s why McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes along\u2014a new way for humans to communicate\u2014it has buried in it a message. It is gently guiding us to see the world according to a new set of codes. The way information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is fast; that it\u2019s about surfaces and appearances; that everything in the world is happening all at once.<br><br>This made me wonder what the message is that we absorb from social media, and how it compares to the message that we absorb from printed books. I thought first of Twitter. When you log in to that site\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Bubba the Love Sponge\u2014you are absorbing a message through that medium and sending it out to your followers. What is that message? First: you shouldn\u2019t focus on any one thing for long. The world can and should be understood in short, simple statements of 280 characters. Second: the world should be interpreted and confidently understood very quickly. Third: what matters most is whether people immediately agree with and applaud your short, simple, speedy statements. A successful statement is one that lots of people immediately applaud; an unsuccessful statement is one that people immediately ignore or condemn. When you tweet, before you say anything else, you are saying that at some level you agree with these three premises. You are putting on those goggles and seeing the world through them.", "filename": "stolen focus", "ext": ".png", "w": 1059, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 165, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674423068127167, "time": 1674423068, "md5": "znkpH4VxNwJyVe+7EFFD6g==", "fsize": 999783, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-like-the-person-i-become-when-i-read-a-lot-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 86, "images": 7, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 21559160, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559152</a><br>How about Facebook? What\u2019s the message in that medium? It seems to be first: your life exists to be displayed to other people, and you should be aiming every day to show your friends edited highlights of your life. Second: what matters is whether people immediately like these edited and carefully selected highlights that you spend your life crafting. Third: somebody is your \u201cfriend\u201d if you regularly look at their edited highlight reels, and they look at yours\u2014this is what friendship means.<br><br>How about Instagram? First: what matters is how you look on the outside. Second: what matters is how you look on the outside. Third: what matters is how you look on the outside. Fourth: what matters is whether people like how you look on the outside. (I don\u2019t mean this glibly or sarcastically; that really is the message the site offers.)<br><br>I realized one of the key reasons why social media makes me feel so out of joint with the world, and with myself. I think all of these ideas\u2014the messages implicit in these mediums\u2014are wrong. Let\u2019s think about Twitter. In fact, the world is complex. To reflect that honestly, you usually need to focus on one thing for a significant amount of time, and you need space to speak at length. Very few things worth saying can be explained in 280 characters. If your response to an idea is immediate, unless you have built up years of expertise on the broader topic, it\u2019s most likely going to be shallow and uninteresting. Whether people immediately agree with you is no marker of whether what you are saying is true or right\u2014you have to think for yourself. Reality can only be understood sensibly by adopting the opposite messages to Twitter. The world is complex and requires steady focus to be understood; it needs to be thought about and comprehended slowly; and most important truths will be unpopular when they are first articulated. I realized that the times in my own life when I\u2019ve been most successful on Twitter\u2014in terms of followers and retweets\u2014are the times when I have been least useful as a human being: when I\u2019ve been attention-deprived, simplistic, vituperative. Of course there are occasional nuggets of insight on the site\u2014but if this becomes your dominant mode of absorbing information, I believe the quality of your thinking will rapidly degrade.", "time": 1674423148, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559164, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559160</a><br>The same goes for Instagram. I like looking at pretty people, like everyone else. But to think that life is primarily about these surfaces\u2014getting approval for your six-pack or how you look in a bikini\u2014is a recipe for unhappiness. And the same goes for a lot of how we interact on Facebook too. It\u2019s not friendship to pore jealously over another person\u2019s photos and boasts and complaints, and to expect them to do the same for you. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much the opposite of friendship. Being friends is about looking into each other\u2019s eyes, doing things together in the world, an endless exchange of gut laughs and bear hugs, joy and grief and dancing. These are all the things Facebook will often drain from you by dominating your time with hollow parodies of friendship.<br><br>After thinking all this, I would return to the printed books I was piling up against the wall of my beach house. What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.<br><br>I realized that I agree with the messages in the medium of the book. I think they are true. I think they encourage the best parts of human nature\u2014that a life with lots of episodes of deep focus is a good life. It is why reading books nourishes me. And I don\u2019t agree with the messages in the medium of social media. I think they primarily feed the uglier and shallower parts of my nature. It is why spending time on these sites\u2014even when, by the rules of the game, I am doing well, gaining likes and followers\u2014leaves me feeling drained and unhappy. I like the person I become when I read a lot of books. I dislike the person I become when I spend a lot of time on social media.&quot;", "time": 1674423222, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559165, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:33:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I could answer that question in about 10k words with as much factual accuracy and clarity as some academic longform fuckwit does in his entire 200+ page book, AND provide a reasonable answer as to how to reverse it<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh no the screens making us dumb</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;better meditate and install an extension to limit my screentime</span>", "time": 1674423236, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559190, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:40:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559165</a><br><br>Why are you so condescending and assumptious?", "time": 1674423625, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559202, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:43:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559165</a><br>Read &quot;The Four Agreements&quot;", "time": 1674423785, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559405, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)17:49:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Good post.<br>I think what he says applies far more broadly than your post indicates.

Self Help is bad because it exploits the suffering of others. There is often wisdom in it, and the author may genuinely be interested and wish to help, but the form of the industry, the flashy titles, blurbs, the insane promises they make, they all serve to draw in desperate people in order to raise their own power, generally. It is a business, like 10 minute Youtube videos padded out to waste your time. A book needs 200 pages and a flashy cover and some celebrity blurbs about how it will change your life. And it needs to sell enough to buy the author a beach house. And they need to make you think you can change your life nice and easily and quickly without hard work and suffering.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the three-step formula it uses to advance its claims is one that is widely used in the popular self-help movement: first, human failure and unhappiness are reduced to one simple cause; second, simple digestible solutions are offered for solving the problem at hand; and third, seductive promises are made as to what faithfully following these solutions will bring. Many books which use this formula are often couched in a literary style designed to sell and impress \u2013 one that tends to favour catchy titles and bullet points which summarise the redemptive path.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is also a marked tendency to evade the contradictions that these books can sometimes contain, for example, that significant insight and lasting change can be attained with little effort; that uncritically following the dictates of a book is compatible with independence of thought and critical reflection; that reading a book to attain social success and material wealth is consistent with liberation from egocentricity; that one can feel better and become better without undergoing any deep personality change or without changing certain oppressive social circumstances; that one may have a \u2018life of detachment\u2019 while reading a book which motivates its readers with promises of increased wealth and status; that a \u2018life of infinite advancement\u2019 can be achieved for those who possess few resources, and only limited access to social care and education. In short, the formula commonly used in many self-help regimes is designed for people whose lives (unfortunately) leave them with little time to think, for people who therefore wish to be told what to do, and for those who desire immediate results without expending too much effort to attain them.</span><br><br>--The Importance of Suffering by James Davies", "time": 1674438493, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560217, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:51:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes a thread on /lit/ about reading more</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REEEEEE I WANT TO CONSOOM ELECTRONICS INSTEAD</span>", "filename": "1645845544572", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 944, "h": 960, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674438668987524, "time": 1674438668, "md5": "3PAo2CrW2Peh8URlCuHlug==", "fsize": 86778, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560222, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:52:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainment technology is a net negative for mankind.</span><br><br>Entertainment is a positive IF you are already a whole and complete person with the right mindset.
