As for my own background, during my teenage years I read roughly 200 novels that had related D&amp;D campaign settings and played as well. I was really deep into it for some years, which contributed to why I didn&#039;t like this at all. One might think it&#039;d be the other way, but I couldn&#039;t help but it think it was a bootleg knock-off.<br><br>The main reason I didn&#039;t like this is because of how it&#039;s written, which I&#039;m unable to explain in detail. Unfortunately I have more problems with it than that. The worldbuilding is expansive but shallow and oftentimes didn&#039;t make sense. This is a quest-based book, so as with many *RPGs it&#039;s almost entirely sidequests, detours, along the to the destination/main quest. To be clear, this is not LitRPG. There&#039;s a dungeon near the end in which the narrative shifts to ruin delver mode, but it doesn&#039;t last long until the book ends. I would be able to put all of these problems aside better if it didn&#039;t take itself so seriously. I see that as a disconnect between tone and content, which is more of a problem than I thought it&#039;d be. All these problems would be less for someone who can accept its self-seriousness.<br><br>The protagonist is assigned party members from the ruin explorers guild which he&#039;s a retired member of. He&#039;s in his middle age after having survived almost 30 years of ruins exploration and has PTSD, from both domestic and adventuring life. His nightmares are provided in detail. There&#039;s not really anything that I want to say about the other party members, who are there to fill their relevant role. I didn&#039;t care for any of them and didn&#039;t have any engagement. There are many other NPCs that they meet and there are various encounters, but I couldn&#039;t care enough for any of it to matter, regardless of what happened to them.<br><br>The Hanifax Imperium, which is where all of this takes place, is ruled by a Queen well past her 100th year of rule. She made a pact with the trickster god to continue living, but that rather changed her. Now she&#039;s a chaotic evil dictator that everyone must follow or be killed by divine intervention as he&#039;s been made into the state religion. This is a problem for the Imperium, but it&#039;s much more so for those who meet her in person. I really wondered at what kind of cosmology would allow for the other gods, of which there are many, to be seemingly unconcerned about this. I looked at the synopsis for the two other books and all was revealed. I don&#039;t agree with a synopsis being complete spoilers, but it happens.<br><br>This is far better rated and reviewed by others and if it seems like something you&#039;d enjoy, then it&#039;s more likely that their opinion has more predictive value for you than mine, so you may as well try.

I suppose this text can be cannibalized for various on-going books on the same subject]<br><br>The nature of the \u2018Moderator\u2019 we have explored already; as to the person who holds and controls the denizen of the \u201cinternet,\u201d but there is so much more to this subject than a clich\u00e9 classical narrative of a person of otherwise good and rational sense who is being held against their will and who would break free if only given an opportunity. We are, I think, around twenty or so years into the \u201cinternet as we know it (i mean the contemporary times)\u201d and the psychological damage which has occurred to those exposed to it cannot be understated; indeed, they were damaged in the first place, now they are far more damaged. The real precedent, I think, is that of Television back when Television was somewhat at its apex in the 60\u2019s to 80\u2019s; people with no lives to speak of would go to Television to escape the dreary monotony of their own personal world and the manner in which they were shaped by what they were exposed to is no greater or lesser than that of the same process which occurred via the Internet. Even the \u201cfake commentary\u201d (i mean the heavily censored and therefore entirely \u2018false\u2019 sense of \u2018what is the public opinion\u2019, see: Twitter, Reddit, etc.) is no moreso than \u201ccanned laughter\u201d and \u201ccamera sweeps\u201d of a happy or sad or vexed \u201cstudio audience\u201d being inserted into a picture to elicit the same response in the actual observer of the picture; the psychological mechanism and its utility is self-evident in application and ease of use. We might say that it is \u2018this\u2019 mechanic by which both operations were all the time depending upon, that is: one is presented with a false perception of \u201caudience reaction\u201d tailored to elicit whatsoever reaction in the actual observer; constructing an artificial presentation of \u2018tribe response\u2019, and that this false perception is the primary or even singular and sole method by which the coercion takes place at large; this is a highly simplistic thing, of course, to alter a picture or, if in News-Journalism some event, to be taken in whatsoever way one wishes by presenting a reaction to it to the observer who seems by some psychological flaw to derive their own reaction based upon the reaction given to them. <br><br>1/5<br><br>*bit of a long one this morning for you, reader, like my cock ha ha", "filename": "aristotles ethics - the slave as the master", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 812, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 198, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674196506650081, "time": 1674196506, "md5": "VKItgYd1Zt2GzqXnC4P7XQ==", "fsize": 65380, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "phil-platos-cave-as-the-internet", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 18, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 21549031, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:35:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Tracking this process back to its origins in the last century when it was possible to create a \u2018fake audience\u2019 via Television and Radio is something that, I am quite confident, will not be undertaken by anybody in the near future due to political reasonings of their own but it is dismaying that this has proven to be the case in my own times, given that this \u2018process\u2019 or \u2018mechanic\u2019 appears to be the common junction by which various cognitive disorders and otherwise epidemic mental health problems enter into the mind of certainly a vast segment of the population.<br><br>This mechanic is twofold, of course, in the first place such a person is already retreating from reality into fantasy (be it Television and then Internet) because they are surmounted by grievous externalities; after this point the process we are detailing in this text takes hold of them as their sense of the reality is constructed and deconstructed by one moving-picture after the next.<br><br>1.5/6", "time": 1674196550, "resto": 21549030}, {"no": 21549034, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)01:36:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "We have always considered the \u201cfadism\u201d of a young child to be \u201cnormal\u201d in that we recall doing it ourselves and see it all the time amongst younger (and increasingly older) people; swapping out items of apparel and consumption choices to present themselves as one thing one day and then another thing another day, to present outwardly a sense of belonging to one fictitious artificial-image of tribe, in other words, and finding only that the all-along desired \u2018tribe\u2019 when encountering other persons who have undergone the same process; all are poseurs, to put it properly.

The modern version of the procedure is outright mutilation with the complete excision of a highly complex and innervated structure that not only protects the penis from desensitisation and the elements but also facilitates intercourse between husband and wife so that it is not abrasive to the woman. There are a number of studies which highlight how the bare contact of keratinised glans causes irritation and discomfort to the woman and scrapes out all the lubrication that also facilitates the act. The same studies also have women themselves confirm this and the degree of discomfort it brings. Obviously marriage isn\u2019t merely about sex but it is a key part of bringing a man and woman together in a loving relationship and to facilitate fruitfulness. Plus a poor sex will often translate into poor relations in other aspects of the marriage. <br><br>I say modern version because circumcision in the Biblical context was only the cutting of the very end of the foreskin so as to leave the overall structure and function together as God designed it (brit milah). In effect, it was a ritual minor cut with spiritual significance and the prefigurement of baptism and the circumcision of the heart as St Paul puts it. It was only when the Pharisees seethed at Jews pulling down their foreskin to enter into Greek gymnasiums that they decided to just cut off the whole prepuce off to make the process of restoration far more difficult (brit periah). Jews themselves admit that the modern iteration is an innovation in their own texts. Theologically, I cannot see the process other than one that destroys God\u2019s design of the human what intentions He had for its function. I view it as a mockery of God. <br><br>What also messes me up is the fact that I was strapped down when I was born and had a healthy part of my body excised for no reason and subject to extreme pain. I cannot see it as anything other than a profound violation and mutilation. That thought really messes me up too. <br><br>However, I can also see the perspective that foreskin restoration should be avoided due to potentially lustful desires that may arise, that it would take time away from God and that I may be placing stock in things of this world and creating an idol. But then again we don\u2019t condemn a woman who has had a mastectomy to have reconstructive surgery to restore a part of her body. Also my whole intention about engaging in restoration is for me to offer my body to the woman I marry - I have no desire to engage in sexually licentious activity. <br><br>I\u2019ve tried to speak to a contact a priest about this via email given that I can\u2019t take to one in person given certain circumstances at the moment but none have responded so I guess I\u2019m just venting here so mock away.", "filename": "FknF5zTUUAAiFYk", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674088013141155, "time": 1674088013, "md5": "T0EF4QKbLt8RpDlvsVvwMg==", "fsize": 117717, "resto": 21543467}, {"no": 21543545, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21543467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21543467</a><br>I just had an amazing date, he slid his hand on my waist.

He made an exception for the case where the man and woman explicitly gave up sex for spiritual renewal , the implication being sex is supposed to feel good for men and women, but it is only non-sinful in a context that is within marriage and open to being fruitful(&quot;multiply and be fruitful&quot;) and centered around genuine love. This is in 1 Corinthians 7 or 13. He also said circumcision is unnecessary and possibly even sinful to force any Christian to go through in Acts. Really, you should have the self conttol to not have sex outside of marriage as a man. Agree with thebpoint on FGM though. Basically, you are supposed to deny the pleasures of the flesh but only the ones that can and will lead you astray from God. Marital sex is perfectly licit form of pleasure that God demands a man and woman joined in holy matrimony partake in since that was always part of His plan anyway, so long as the union is aimed towards marital union and fruitfulness( i.e. the man and woman being joined as one flesh and aiming towards the poasibility of having kids).", "time": 1674101252, "resto": 21543467}, {"no": 21544237, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:09:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21543881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21543881</a><br>I feel you bro.

Germans are idealists: They want - more than anything - to believe in something. This is joined with a level of na\u00efvete or reckless abandon; they will dive headfirst into any new, mystery future so long as it promises hope to them. So they gave us Martin Luther, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Hitler. But in 1945, something drastic happened - the German youth told that their own culture was evil and wrong. So did they abandon their idealism?<br><br>No: They looked elsewhere. Germans are ubiquitous online, and distinguished by a fervent desire to embrace things like Hip Hop - not because it&#039;s the trashy hedonistic spectacle that it actually is, but because it is portrayed as some valiant rejection of the mores of American society and police violence, and it&#039;s considered deep. <br><br>I don&#039;t mean this to be patronizing, if it appears that way. Germans are my favorite nationality, I love this trait of theirs. It brings a degree of sincerity and passion to their art which most nations can&#039;t even muster.

Even though one may find many things to be pleasurable, it in no wise makes up for life&#039;s peculiar &quot;qualities.&quot; For one, every single moment that that one is not distracted by trivialities they are bombarded with increasingly obsessive thoughts about injustices. The heat of their obsession with injustice reaches such a degree that, from time to time, they are not sure what would happen in the moment. A rash decision to enact justice may bring some minor virtue, but it would result in such a negligible effect that in a moment or less the injustices committed elsewhere would be so great as to make the justice undetectable.

The wait is so long. Each and every day one feels like surrendering their self to the peculiarities, until some other injustice comes to their mind and they are forced by will to press on. One cannot allow oneself to be freed without having done anything to save the multitudes from the suffering that they are unwittingly subjected to or subverting the greater sufferings to come by political and technological developments. Living is worthless, and if it can be exchanged for, if not a certain good, an infinitesimally small chance to avert great suffering, then it is morally impossible not to make the trade.<br>At the same time, one may not be free from their material desire, and is subjected to a still greater torture of uncertainty.

Every time I finished raging I would go somewhere private and nearly get to tears with shame and regret for what I had done. I knew I was wrong while doing it, and I knew I was wrong afterwards. At around 13-14 I realized my rage was growing rapidly and I would soon be unable to control it, and made a conscious effort not to ever verbally, emotionally, or physically(luckily never did this, but I started thinking about it near the end) harm family.

After my father threatened to kill me with a knife once and a gun another time, I planned to commit patricide and suicide, double homicide and suicide, etc. I hated what I was becoming and cried nightly wishing I were normal. I resolved again not to become a piece of shit again and also to commit suicide (for unrelated reasons, but also because I felt like a monster). Long story short a bunch of shit happened, I ended up in psych, and now I&#039;m here. (psych made things much worse, unrelated though)<br>I wanted to apologize to my family for being abusive towards them, but I could never bring myself to do it. I felt like the reason must have been pride or arrogance and it made me feel like even more of a piece of shit, but that never seemed quite right.

This might be what the other anon had in head when he called Tate a modern philosopher. This wisdom a practical life lesson drawing upon insights of the mechanics of practical life and human nature. This can be short sighted and fixed towards a certain goal. Like those life coaches like andrew tate. Self analysis and introspection become tools to reach a certain goal, human nature and practical life too are seen in a certain fixed way within the tension of the goal and those or that which misses the goal. Why are ppl poor and some are rich. What mechanics. How to become rich. There are truths in their but its a standpoint, a view purposely limited to fullfill a practical purpose. That may count as philosophy and how to become such a person is by introspection, experience, observation also necessary is the practical aspect and you must be disciplined and apply and adjust your outlook to various situations. If you want to be a philosopher in an absolute sense as someone who is a teacher of wisdom and life lessons you must not constrict yourself and try to find out the true nature of the human soul, the laws of life, then mechanics of practical life will be revealed to you. <br><br>2. a scholar. Someone who sees philosophy as an academic field of study. A noble one for it aims at some level of truth. You either read books and learn how to read like a philosopher or you tackle questions or problems arising from a philosophical standpoint. Either way you make yourself on the way to a standpoint. To not just be a bookworm you need to philosophize and not just understand a standpoint but stand on it by rethinking it for yourself. That takes practice and close reading and dwelling. This is what most peopleon lit would think of when speaking of philosophy.<br><br>3. a philosopher in an absolute sense is he who strives for truth to attain it. To reach the peak of philosophy, wisdom, to then leave philosophy behind. Its the path or mystics, of plato, of yogis and such kind. All who strive to grasp the absolute beyond thought. There are many paths to it. Its not a mere theory but practical life and theoretical truth go hand in hand. You must constantly self analyse, introspect, empty yourself from false belief, even from knowledge, and make truth an experience as it is unfiltered through beliefs. As i said to achieve this you must be on a mystical or spiritual path or however you want to call it.

This is Plato&#039;s \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, which he calls a \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. But what distinguishes the false philosopher from the true is this: the perplexity of the latter arises from the contemplation of the world itself, while that of the former results from some book, some system of philosophy which is before him. Now Fichte belongs to the class of the false philosophers. He was made a philosopher by Kant&#039;s doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and if it had not been for this he would probably have pursued entirely different ends, with far better results, for he certainly possessed remarkable rhetorical talent.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neither our knowledge nor our insights are ever especially increased by comparing and discussing what is said by another, for that is always merely like pouring water from one container into another. Only through one\u2019s own consideration of things themselves can insight and knowledge really be increased, for it alone is the ever ready and ever proximate living source. Accordingly it is curious to observe how would-be philosophers are always busy on the first path and seem not to know the other at all; how they are always occupied with what this person said, and with what that person might have meant, so that they are constantly tipping over containers, as it were, to see if maybe some little drop might remain.

This is why at bottom all who think for themselves are basically in agreement, and their difference arises only as one of standpoint; but where this does not change anything, they all say the same thing. For they are merely stating what they have objectively apprehended. Often I was pleasantly surprised afterwards to find formulations in ancient works by great men of propositions that I had hesitated to bring before the public because of their paradoxical nature. \u2013 The book philosopher on the other hand recounts what this man said, what that one meant and then again what another objected and so on. This he compares, evaluates and criticizes, thus attempting to get at the truth of things, and in the process he becomes quite similar to the historian. So for instance he will launch investigations on whether Leibniz might ever have been a Spinozist for a while and so forth ... Herbart ... \u2013 One might be amazed by the great effort such a man takes, since it seems that if only he tried to focus on the matter itself, he would soon reach his goal with a bit of thinking for himself.

Now in respect to the history of philosophy such an autopsya of the subject is actually available, namely in the original writings of the philosophers. At any rate, we can then limit ourselves, for the sake of brevity, to well-chosen principal chapters, the more so as they all abound in repetitions, which we can spare ourselves. In this way we will get to know the essence of their doctrines in authentic and unadulterated form, whereas from the half dozen histories of philosophy that now appear every year we merely receive what entered the head of a philosophy professor, and in the form in which it there appears at that.

The common trajectories traced by Trudeau&#039;s technocratic politics and by McLuhan&#039;s sense of technological utopia reveals, powerfully so, the importance of the Catholic touch in Canadian politics and letters; just as much as it reflects, that for the empire at least, Catholicism is, indeed, intimate with the &quot;central cultural discoveries&quot; of the modern age. Moreover, the very existence of a &quot;McLuhan&quot; or a &quot;Trudeau&quot; as the locus of the Canadian discourse discloses the indelible character of Canada, not just as a witness to empire, but, perhaps, as a radical experiment in the working out of the intellectual and political basis of the technological imagination in North America. Canada is, and has always been, the most modern of the New World societies; because the character of its colonialism, of its domination of the land by technologies of communication, and of its imposition of an &quot;abstract nation&quot; upon a divergent population by a fully technological polity, has made of it a leading expression of technological liberalism in North America.</span>", "time": 1673967526, "resto": 21536142}, {"no": 21537910, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)09:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536222</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quebec is not a divided cultural mosaic and the Quebecois are proud nationalists</span><br>Quebec nationalism ironically only works within the Canadian federation.

The story follows its protagonist, a young boy named Faggot Gardner (no relation to F. Gardner, the author), as he searches the grimy streets of Chicago for &quot;the Crocodile&quot;, a local leather daddy notorious for putting bad little boys like Gardner in their place.<br>Young Faggot Gardner searches high and low for the fabled dominant: in dilapidated crack dens, in public restrooms, in subterranean glory holes. Yet no matter how assiduously he searches, how quickly he moves from clue to clue, how many dirty men&#039;s toes he sucks (an activity constantly referred to in the novel as &quot;pussing the boots&quot;), Gardner seems always to be one step behind the object of his obsessive desire.<br>The twist comes near the end of the novel, during a scene reminiscent of Polanski&#039;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;, where the beautiful Carole, played by a young Catherine Deneuve, finally descends into madness, and hallucinates human arms reaching oot of the walls of her apartment and grabbing her, thereby externalizing her fear not only of sexual assault, but of any form of intimate contact whatsoever. F. Gardner (the author) parodies this scene, effectively turning its tone and implications upside down, by having his protagonist, the now cock-starved and desperate Faggot Gardner (again, no relation) crawl on his knees through a dark apartment, groping along the walls to find his way, only to feel, poking proudly oot of the holes in the walls, not scary arms with grabby hands, but dozens of diamond-hard dicks. They poke him in the eyes. They shoot gobs of bitter gravy into his nose and ears. They wag reproachfully at him, like the index fingers of the stern private school teachers who buggered him in his earliest childhood memories, as he slowly makes his way to the end of the hall. The twist is this: when he finally reaches the end of the hall, and opens the door there, he finds himself staring into a blinding white light. He believes that when his eyes finally adjust to the glare, he will see there, waiting for him, horse-whip in hand, croc-skin chaps pulled snugly against his obese thighs, the man he has been seeking for so many days, seeking, in a way, for all of his life. But instead what he sees is a hospital room. He is lying in a hospital bed. The bright light is coming from the naked bulb above him.

Nothing would be more humiliating for him than to live out his final days imprisoned in the anatomical labyrinth of a normal sized human. Every inch of my intestines would be a mile of torment for Warwick, every little step of his a reminder of his puny insignificance. In order to sufficiently break his will, I\u2019d ensure that his death came slow.

His infantile stride is assisted by the corrosive flow of my digestive system but gradually, Warwick\u2019s candy-colored armor degrades. The exposed tissue of the vile homunculus starts melting, limiting his movement even further (as if that\u2019s even possible).<br><br>Engulfed in agony, his LED bulb depleted, the midge finally collapses. The world around him is now a pitch black void, a meaningless pocket of space inside my body but for Warwick, his tomb. Suddenly, a glimmer of light emerges. Warwick fixes his beady, partially corroded eyes on it. The light grows brighter until suddenly he begins moving toward it, as if carried by angels to the gates of heaven. But alas, there is no heaven for the odious midge. I reach with toilet paper in hand, wipe and feel an odd sensation like popping a zit. Upon the paper I find the smeared visage of Warwick Davis\u2019 upper half, his face a squished skin mask streaked in browns and reds.

Who is the subject of a verb whereas whom is the object. It is easier to identify where who should be used than to figure out whom. A hint is in the spelling of the word &quot;whom&quot; itself too in that it is kind of equivalent in use to him or them. &quot;To whom should I give this?&quot;, &quot;I&quot; is the subject therefore &quot;whom&quot; is the object. Prepositions in English are often used instead of a case system when we go outside simple SVO constructions, &quot;to&quot; here indicates the object. Compare: &quot;Who is taking all this?&quot;. Amusingly all German speakers essentially use the who/whom distinction as well as whence/whither (where from/ where to), etc because that is all Germanic obviously.", "time": 1674180629, "resto": 21539889}, {"no": 21548255, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:11:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21548237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21548237</a><br>indeed but it&#039;s against my religion to use honorifics<br>you can call me anon", "time": 1674180706, "resto": 21539889}, {"no": 21548261, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)21:13:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "ESLs do this a lot.

But being scientific, you cannot say what is morally correct, as that is not an empirical subject.<br><br>So you should probably take most philosophers as explorers of &quot;shoulds&quot; and explorers of pre empirical things. which can get all looped aroung because you must be motivated by things before you even start the empirical process. Often times post empericalities can be used to explore pre empericalities.

She intensely rejoiced that Caspar Goodwood was gone; there was something in having thus got rid of him that was like the payment, for a stamped receipt, of some debt too long on her mind. As she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a little lower; the sense was there, throbbing in her heart; it was part of her emotion, but it was a thing to be ashamed of\u2014it was profane and out of place. It was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her knees, and even when she came back to the sitting-room her tremor had not quite subsided. It had had, verily, two causes: part of it was to be accounted for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise of her power. </span><br>Am I wrong for reading a sekshual connotation to this or is it one of those Victorian novel tropes?

Naturally, I still disagree with him, but there are a lot of interesting observations you could make even when looking at abstract space.<br>Analysing the earth is difficult from inside an urban space because there are so many ugly buildings blocking the horizon, but the sky is different. The sky - pure, blue, serene - stretches in every direction inviolate. The heavenly objects move slowly and peacefully, and when you really look at the sky, you get the feeling of a place of peace and glory, far above the earth, its filth and its struggles - a heavenly kingdom ruled by the sun, which actually projects much more massive concentric circles of light than I would have expected.<br>Looking at the sky, you get the feeling that it envelops the earth - or at least the urban space - almost like a dome, a universal, superior plane. Now, this must look quite different in open land - land that stretches in every direction therefore appears as a second plane, a second infinity, albeit closer and more familiar to us, perhaps less dignified, if no less massive. However, looking at the planes flying through the sky, I thought of Spengler&#039;s idea of Western humanity being defined by &quot;the world as three dimensional space&quot;. There was the sky far above, yes, and there was the earth down here below, but there was also the intermediate plane, a kind of &quot;in between&quot; that we could (and did) conquer in order to reach up to the heavens. Obviously, Spengler thinks this is a natural trait of Westerners whereas I see it as a materialistic degeneration of the original impulse, but it is very interesting.

I&#039;m reading his Faux-Monnayeurs. What do I think of it is this, that it&#039;s certainly Gidean, but I feel at times that he&#039;s trying too hard to write a novel. His dialogue is remarkably good, but it was already good in his fiction which weren&#039;t proper novels. His &quot;abstract&quot; prose sequences(that which is neither narration nor dialogue) is obviously excellent, but why wouldn&#039;t they be(see : his Journal).<br>What I have most trouble with is the actual narration. It seems like he&#039;s forcing himself to tell a story despite himself. He tries to break it up with the Journal chapters sure, but I almost wish he had taken the format he had used for La Porte Etroite, where first came the story itself and followed by an &quot;alternative angle&quot; through the personal journal.<br><br>I have the softest affection for Gide so I can&#039;t help but find beauty in this novel, but I am disappointed, at least in this first reading(which has been done in a rather depressive state, and so maybe that is why I have been unpleased with it at times),with how unkempt the structure seems. He&#039;s never been a very architectural author, but in this novel I feel like it&#039;s especially loose. Also, he uses certain narrative voices, particularly at the beginning, which really didn&#039;t please me(Diderot-ish &quot;well let&#039;s see what our characters are up to now). It just seems that he&#039;s throwing everything into this work, with little mediation, little discernment.<br><br>Any other Gide fans here, who weren&#039;t too satisfied with this book on their first reading?

I scribble what I found important for the day without much proof-reading. I don&#039;t know what Plotinus has to say about that, but I will try to argue the opposite of what you&#039;re saying from his position. <br>From the schema I&#039;ve come to understand so far, all idea is thought good, and matter evil (&quot;Essential Fire is good, but things burning can be bad&quot;). So if a person fully masters the Intellective-Principle, there is no room for evil. If a person is doing evil, it&#039;s because part of them is in Non-Being, or thoughtless Matter, which has nothing to do with their thoughts or intentions, since those are part of the Good.<br>A child who steals money from Aristotle thinking it&#039;s ok should be dealt with in a moral way where the behavior doesn&#039;t continue. We don&#039;t attribute agency to him since he doesn&#039;t know better, but he still might be chastised or punished. Plotinus seems to extend that rule to everyone, that in sum total, people who do evil always just don&#039;t know any better. <br><br>There is still responsibility Plotinus seems to assign everyone of trying to possess the Good, but punishment of an evil may instead be treated as whatever brings the evil to zero, or what balances it, prevents it&#039;s reoccurrence, or increases the thought associated with it and which necessarily will result in the opposite good.<br><br>A lot of early Christian scholarship equates evil as merely the lack/privation of goodness. I don&#039;t remember who. Plotinus seems to have this but with a source for evil, &quot;Absolute Evil&quot;, which has at least less reality than the Good, since he calls it a substratum/hypostasis for evil. Matter is evil, and translated as &quot;Non-Being&quot;, so unless there&#039;s some difficulty with the linguistic traditions or if everyone had an altered state of consciousness then vs. now, I don&#039;t comprehend why evilness can have a quality and act as a substratum while also being nothingness.

Moreover, the mortality of man entails the possibility of his violent death.

Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, &quot;I admire him, but I love Shakespeare&quot;.[235] He also famously remarked that Shakespeare &quot;was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there.&quot;[236] For several decades, Rymer&#039;s view held sway.

He characterizes Polus&#039;s first speech about Gorgias&#039; s art as rhetorical, because it failed to say what the art is and instead said *what kind of* thing it is and praised it as if it had been attacked. Dialectic, we are left to presume, answers the question *what a thing is*. But when Socrates later overturns Polus&#039; s assertion that doing injustice without paying a just penalty is better than suffering injustice, the whole refutation turns on the premise granted by Polus (474c) that doing injustice is baser than suffering injustice; it rests, in other words, on an assertion of *what kind of* thing injustice is without making clear *what* it is. At this crucial point of the discussion, then, Socrates refutes rhetorically rather than investigates dialectically.

Fowler, West, and Kremer are close here, bringing out that Socrates speaks of the virtue (&quot;arete&quot;) of a judge and the corresponding virtue of an orator; Fowler&#039;s minor change is a repetition of &quot;virtue&quot; that isn&#039;t in the Greek, but no biggie. Rouse translates it curiously as &quot;merit&quot;, which is alright but imprecise in the sense of being good at something (the other accurate translation of &quot;arete&quot; is &quot;excellence&quot;), but it would be wrong if it implied having to earn something, instead of the innate characteristic excellence of a being, as Plato uses it. Jowett doesn&#039;t acknowledge the word in his rendering. He turns Socrates statement into something hortatory, &quot;let x do y&quot;, switches the order of the judges and orators, and supplies a verb and adverb not present in the Greek (&quot;decide justly&quot;). His choice to translate &quot;rhetoros&quot; (&quot;rhetors/orators&quot;) as &quot;speaker&quot; seems poor since Socrates has just made a big effort to show how he&#039;s not a skilled speaker like the rhetoricians/orators, who, after all, are represented by one of his three accusers, Lycon.<br><br>All in all, West and Kremer, the Straussians, are slavish to the Greek and usually attentive to the order of Greek phrasing. Fowler is very close to them. Rouse takes some liberties here and there, but some might just be differences in the meanings of words from when he translated and now. Jowett takes a bunch of liberties, sometimes eliding clauses, sometimes ignoring important words, sometimes mangling the grammar, for what&#039;s admittedly a more readable product, but less philosophically sharp or rewarding (for a close reader) paraphrase.", "time": 1674000323, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21540406, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)22:02:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21536537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536537</a><br><a href=\"#p21536544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21536544</a><br><a href=\"#p21539473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539473</a><br>A more modern version, by George Theodoridis:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don\u2019t be surprised or disturbedin the slightest, gentlemen if, as I go on with my defence speech, I use words which I always use in public, at the tables of the market place,say, or elsewhere in the city, places where many of you would have heard me speak.

The deepest root of things is, in fact, matter, not just the \u201cmateriality\u201d of the four elements, but something coursing beneath these, eternal, moving, not accessible to perception, and not really accessible to the intellect either. The existence of this ultimate matter can be much more plausibly inferred than can the existence of separate ousiai, but only as a kind of limit case of what the human intellect can infer.

We cannot even be sure that the claims we venture to make about it are governed by the principle of non-contradiction.

The human intellect is no more than a possibility, so to speak, that was always latent in this matter. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6.

Flourishing, i.e. the development and exercise of a being&#039;s capabilities.<br>2. Being<br>3. Pleasure<br>4. That which we choose for the sake of itself alone<br><br>1 is something I came up with. That first definition is my own. A friend criticized it soundly on the following grounds: development of a being&#039;s capabilities reduces to the exercise of a being&#039;s capabilities; and since everything a being does is an exercise of its capabilities, no matter what it does, it is accomplishing the good. Therefore the definition is worthless, in the sense that understanding the good should enable us to set an aim or purpose for our actions, or at least provide understanding our actions. <br><br>2 is Aquinas and most traditional Christian philosophers/theologians. Second, existence. Aquinas makes a case for this when he equates the good with being (he also identifies it with the fullness of being. The two statements may or may not be equivalent). This seems to fail for most of the reasons above. If not, consider: every choice and every action is made by an existing being. They are made real, incarnate, by that being. Therefore insofar as they equally are, they are all equally good, and no choice or way of life could be set above or apart from another as superior or degenerate, even when they completely contradict one another, as they often and manifestly do.<br><br>3 is an obvious one from ordinary experience, and it&#039;s not terribly repugnant even to Christians, because for a Christian, true ecstasy is found in the contemplation of and being caught up in the triune life of God. <br><br>An obvious objection is that we choose these and such things because they are good - sharing in the divine nature, philosophic speculation, music, service to others - and that pleasure necessarily accompanies the good, that the good is pleasant. Hence these things are pleasing, but pleasure is not the sufficient reason for us choosing them. This fails for the following reason:<br><br>Of all our choices and actions, none of them would occur if they were wholly devoid of pleasure and purely painful instead (this, in fact, is what believers understand hell to be like); from a father making difficult sacrifices for his family, to serving others (not even enjoying the happiness of others), to the passion of the martyr. What do we do that is good simply, and entirely painful? This is practically inconceivable. Therefore, since there is no good without pleasure, and since we choose pleasant things, and avoid painful things, the conclusion that pleasure is the sufficient reason for our choice seems increasingly inescapable, meaning that \u2018pleasure\u2019 and \u2018the good\u2019 are convertible terms.This seems to be the most solid of all the positions.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "time": 1674168049, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21547520, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)17:51:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21547468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21547468</a><br>But that position isn\u2019t free of difficulties either: some people find pleasure in cruelty. Torturers, rapists, serial killers, etc. Less dramatically, some, perhaps many people, find manipulating and hurting others fun, pleasant, and enjoyable. If pleasure is the good, than it would seem as if cruelty and kindness were equally good - and isn\u2019t that absurd?<br><br>Or on a more mundane level, the sorts of controlling, domineering people who enjoy flaunting their superiority or privilege. I know or have encountered plenty of such people. Lucretius bears witness to this type in general when he writes how sweet and pleasant it is to lie on the grass, watching while a ship wrecks itself on the coast, thinking to yourself how nice it is that you are spared such things. It&#039;s an uneasy for me to think that way, but it&#039;s a cogent, coherent view. <br><br>Or a second counterargument, addiction: intoxication, food, and sex are all variously pleasurable to some degree; so why is what we call addiction to these things bad?<br><br>To the second argument, the most obvious way forward to is argue that these ways of life are not genuinely pleasant. Consider gluttony and pornography. Before, mostly during, and after, there is often nothing but pain: shame, guilt, self-disgust, self-loathing, seeking to forget, trying to numb, etc. Excess in general is characterized more by pain than pleasure. Habitual disspiation of the appetites is the result of sadness, not joyful delight.<br><br>I regard the answer to the second objection sufficient for me, but I don&#039;t regard it as demonstrative, unless it\u2019s inconceivable that an addict to anything could be happy - and I\u2019m not sure how to prove that yet. <br><br>The first objection is much more difficult. The only possible ways out would be to deny anyone truly takes pleasure in hurting people; e.g., that a rapist takes no pleasure in rape (which, while I\u2019d like to, seems completely absurd. The idea of a woman pleading and crying beneath me while I do what I want is a massive turn off, but even I can see how the dominating, shaming, and controlling sides of rape are very pleasant. Therefore etc. And this doesn&#039;t even touch rape fantasies, widely shared by women, etc), or argue that such things are driven by compulsion (people making these choices are diseased, sick, etc), and that compulsion is not pleasant. Both of those replies seem to fail for manifestly obvious reasons (the second reply is attractive, but it fails to explain why these disordered choices are unpleasant, nor does it give us a way of evaluating and ranking the pleasures of different choices).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2/3</span>", "time": 1674168719, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21547544, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)17:56:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21547520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21547520</a><br>A way out might be Aristotle&#039;s definition: That which we choose for the sake of itself, and not for anything else.

Because some will say wealth, honor, pleasure, contemplation, etc. Aristotle&#039;s own answer seems to be pleasure, understood as contemplation, the highest pleasure, if I&#039;m understanding Nicomachean Ethics X right.<br><br>Aristotle (and Plato, who might have a similar view, but nobody fucking understands the Philebus so who knows?) can hold this opinion because they were conversant in bodily, spirited, and intellectual forms of pleasure, and being deeply experienced in all three (they were all rich Athenian noblemen, and I can only imagine the parties they attended, not to mention enjoying wealth, honors, privilege, and staggering intellectual genius), chose philosophic contemplation as the most pleasant (why didn&#039;t they choose music?

The Republic might respond most to your question, but even then, there&#039;s some difficulty. In book X, Socrates brings up the poets again, and in making a point about the distance between the poet&#039;s depiction and reality, he says:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Do you want us to make our consideration according to our customary procedure, beginning from the following point?

Does this guarantee the truth of the matter? Or is this related to a point Socrates makes twice earlier in the Republic, that some of the subjects they discuss have a shorter and longer way to understanding? Glaucon chooses the shorter; is this kind of account a shorter way? Even earlier, the account of the idea of the Good claims that the Good is the cause of all beings; is this related? One hint (not original to me, check out Benardete&#039;s Socrates&#039; Second Sailing) is that there&#039;s no coincidence in the examples chosen, couch and table, for these are the things that Glaucon claims he wants but sees lacking in what he calls the &quot;city of pigs&quot; in book II. Would this passage, taken together with the account of the Good, and Glaucon&#039;s desires, point to how and in what way the Good is the cause of beings? Maybe a tentative account might be that the Good shapes human desires for itself, so it might be closer to the truth of things to say that the artifacts we make don&#039;t necessarily have a form or idea, but rather come about on account of our desires shaed by an Idea?<br><br>It&#039;s very difficult, and I&#039;m not satisfied I understand it all.", "time": 1674179006, "resto": 21535298}, {"no": 21548192, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)20:55:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21548112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21548112</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;d certainly agree that</span><br>I think those objections are fitting, and maybe that highlights a problem not actually solved but perpetually lingering: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, they&#039;re not ascetics, even if more moderate than many; Socrates has given himself over to sex to produce his three kids, and really might not be as far from Cephalus (who praises conversation only because his appetites are incidentally calming in old age) as appears on first and subsequent sights, since Socrates only doesn&#039;t have to worry about his needs because his friends readily supply them.<br><br>I wonder if this points to something of the meaning of &quot;philosophizing is the practice of dying and being dead&quot; in Phaedo; not literally (though death being something one really only encounters for the most part once isn&#039;t of no interest to the philosopher, who wants to know about it), but that thinking takes you out of yourself, somehow dissolving the circumstances one lives with, such as &quot;hungry&quot;, &quot;need sleep&quot;, etc. This can&#039;t hold all the time however, though maybe the peculiarities of Socrates (skips dinner in the Symposium; stays up all night while drinking and stays up all the next day, also in Symposium; stays up all night for the conversation in the Republic, also sipping dinner) points to the problem of Nature and &quot;natures&quot;; some people can eat and digest metal, an astoundingly rare condition.

These sections are typically neighborhoods, walled off from the outside and accessible only via those major roadways. Within each neighborhood are schools and parks, many fenced off from non-residents, but never shops. Interspersed at some major intersections are large outdoor shopping centers that service the needs of the residents.

Many are successful whites or immigrants (from Asia) that work in the business parks and, besides location, have little in common with their neighbors.

These neighborhoods are not self-contained in the important sense; there is no work in these neighborhoods. The necessities are not only produced outside, they are bought outside as well. There is no intermingling of work and play, in fact they are kept strictly segregated. That these communities are nonproductive stems from this fact, not the safety/prosperity/homeless-less aspect.

Obviously things have changed to the point that even in these towns it is very common, for example, that the parents commute to another town for work, but humor me. The children don&#039;t use the parks and schools to play at; they use the town. A few minutes walk and they are at the commercial center of town where real human beings live and work career jobs from low to high end and everywhere in between. Small business owners manage and run stores. Maybe to get home from school they have to walk a couple miles. Maybe their parent(s) work in the area, i.e. as contractors, shop owners, policemen, professionals, etc. Maybe they come home for lunch, etc.<br><br>Even if it is not strictly true that these traditional towns are more self-sufficient in that they produce more of what they consume internally, I hope you don&#039;t think I make a large leap when I say that that appears to be the case to a much higher degree than in the isolated suburbs of Irvine.

Irvine is a city that was developed entirely by corporate land developers; where government regulated planning and the general direction of development in most cities, in Irvine it was the corporate Irvine Company.

They were created as part of a grander design that views everything as a commodity to control and exploit. A design that is far more concerned with limiting and taking away what worked and made sense in the past because it is far too empowering to the average person. You&#039;d think there are few better ways to control people than to control the very environment in which they live.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

He found this piling up of blue Sundays hard to endure. Lisa\u2019s long silence had made him quite miserable. He thought he might take a trip alone to Ohio. This very lyrical sadness, the frustrating sadness of having his writings interrupted by Lisa\u2019s silence, this groan over things unfinished, as it must be called, was something James had completely forgotten since his days of literary apprenticeship over forty years earlier. This groan was a harking back to the most awkward part of youth, the most unpleasant, least valuable part. That was a fatalistic incompleteness going far beyond the usual interruption, a ridiculous incompleteness filled with humiliation. Every time one reached out one\u2019s hand, all the branches and fruit would be carried high in the wind; no fruit ever reached the mouth of Tantalus. In this incompleteness his thirst was never assuaged. In that period, one day\u2014that was now over thirty years in the past\u2014 the artist in James was born.

Like believers in libertarian<br>free will, transhumanists believe we can make ourselves. But this is impossible. Because of<br>evolution, we got made. We did not bring ourselves out of the primeval ooze. And<br>everything we have done since we became a species has been a consequence of being<br>made. No matter what we do, it will be what we were made to do\u2014and nothing else. We<br>may try to make something of ourselves, but we cannot take over our own evolution. We<br>made antibiotics because we were made to be the kind of beings who make such things as<br>antibiotics. That changed our condition without changing us, being as we are the kind of<br>creatures who do things and make things, yet are not in the business of getting ourselves<br>made. Nature had plans for us and still does. One of those plans seems to be the dream of<br>transhumanism, which may just be a plan to unmake us. If so, we are not going to alter<br>that plan simply because we imagine we can make a new person with new evolutionary<br>programs that we will write. We know how to survive and we know how to reproduce.<br>We know how to do many things, but we do not know what to do with ourselves that is<br>over and above our preset patterns. Some of us only think we do. We are not even part of<br>the process of getting remade. We are following orders, as we have always done, that nature<br>is forever barking out.<br>As humans conceived transhumanism, transhumanists have conceived posthumanism, a<br>far-off condition in which none will live as we have all these years but will have evolved<br>into something beyond our present selves. And then what? Have the transhumanists really<br>thought this through? And how could they? We have no idea where our next thought is<br>coming from, not excluding the thoughts of transhumanists. We do have thoughts, but we<br>do not know what we are going to make of them. How, then, are we to know what to<br>make of ourselves? Maybe we could outdo posthumanity, or at least do something that<br>would not take as long and would be no less useless. But it is not as if being posthuman is<br>an idea first conceived in the late twentieth century. In its search for the \u201cgood,\u201d or at least<br>the better, it recapitulates our most ancient fantasies. Like a song we feel we have heard<br>even though we are hearing it for the first time, the machinations of transhumanists call to<br>us from the past, and even from a pre-historical Eden of perfect existence, depending on<br>whether or not one likes their song or cares for a homecoming in Eden.

Naturally, they<br>think that being alive is all right\u2014so much so, in fact, that they cannot stand the idea of<br>not being alive and have envisioned strategies for staying alive forever. Their problem is<br>that they need being alive to be vastly more all right than it is. And the power of positive<br>thinking is not enough to get them where they want to go. They are past all that, or would<br>like to be. They are also past believing in God or an afterlife of eternal bliss. To a believer,<br>transhumanism would be a useless appendage to what they already believe, as well as an<br>offense against Him who made us as He made us, with nature as the go-between, and long<br>ago laid down the ways in which we can make ourselves better and better. Those ways<br>may be hard to follow, but the alternative is the despair of living without hope of an<br>unimaginably better future. For the believer\u2019s alternative to despair, transhumanists have<br>substituted their own.

It could begin a dynamic new chapter in the history of our race, or it could<br>trumpet the end of us. Either way, the prophesized leap will be jumpstarted by all manner<br>of gadgetry and will somehow involve artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, genetic<br>engineering, and other habiliments of high technology. These will be the instruments of the<br>New Genesis, the Logos of tomorrow. Or so says one desperate group of scientific thinkers.<br>For a less desperate group of scientific thinkers, posthumanism is a chimera and will not<br>occur: We will go on with our lives as stumblebums of the same old story. Understandably,<br>the transhumanist view is more arousing than old-fogy humanism precisely because an<br>apocalypse has been inserted as a wild card. (See Bill Joy\u2019s \u201cThe future doesn\u2019t need us,\u201d<br>Wired, 2000.) In this sense, transhumanism is a secular retelling of the Christian rapture,<br>and some of its true believers foresee it as happening within the lifetime of many who are<br>alive today, just as the early Christians believed in an impending Judgment Day.

Freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) of the life-and-death issues of one\u2019s existence: food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one\u2019s environment. Freedom means having power; not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one\u2019s own life. One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised.

If third worlders are going to seethe about how whites violated muh self-determination etc the natural thing to do would be to remind them that the only reason they have self-determination today and value it as a principle is because of white people&#039;s actions.

The struggle here isn&#039;t really interpretation besides, but rather against ambiguity and its encroachment upon meaning. Very few people embrace ambiguity, and those who do so are typically individuals who do not profit much from reading in the first place, because their narcissistic echo-chamber hardly lets the mind of anyone else pierce its halls. Unfortunately, ambiguity gets a bad rap for this reason, since the greatest authors have the capacity to utilize ambiguity in such a way that it not only gives the reader space to bring themselves &quot;to the table&quot;, but also can be a sort of trap, that guides one through research into a seeming void that leads exactly where the author wants the reader to go. Chalking everything up to openness of infinite interpretation is an intellectually lazy thing to do, but so is insisting upon there being a definite reason to any piece. Interpretation overall is for the weak. The great man siezes objective meaning from the wraith, upon ripping the author&#039;s ghost from the ether, invoking their eternal souls to dispel all that could not be made seen in their lifetime, whilst leaping upon their phantasmic shoulders, and forming brave new meanings the author could never even come up with himself.", "time": 1674002652, "resto": 21539484}, {"no": 21539955, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539939</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seethe</span><br>You adopt the jargon of this site as a substitute for original thought: you will me to be angry, and pretend it is the case so as to make yourself feel superior.
