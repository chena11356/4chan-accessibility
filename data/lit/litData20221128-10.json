I have a tendency to talk alot about things I have going on, often repeating myself in the process so this is a harmless way of doing that without occupying the time of those around me. <br>I don&#039;t think its the fix all cure that alot of mental health gurus talk about but its very nice to have, I do atleast one page a day, everyday. I track the weather and the temperature outside too. <br>I was curious if any of you guys keep one and if so what for? I know a few people who have Gardening and Reading Journals where they log basic info like the weather, quality of the plants, and the amount of pages theyve read.<br>Its a pretty nice exercise in habit.", "filename": "EVIL SNUFKIN", "ext": ".png", "w": 4660, "h": 4660, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669647699976598, "time": 1669647699, "md5": "zyA/xf/321TVMKesqEOx0Q==", "fsize": 2671955, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "journaling", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "last_modified": 1669647699}, {"no": 21310046, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)17:28:44", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/law/", "com": "Salvete fellow /lit/igators.<br><br>How&#039;s work?

What matters less is describing each individual movement or attack - noone focuses this hard or perceives this quickly in an actual fight, and thus it bogs down the tone and action when we spend inordinate amounts of time reading about things that occur in a fraction of a second.<br>Just focus on retaining the feeling of snappiness, brutality and violence. If you&#039;re willing to get real jazzy with it, try to also apply your character&#039;s personalities to how they fight. A ruthless, unyielding and unflinching stoic will power through his enemies with impossibly powerful techniques, used pragmatically and sparingly. A goofier character might fight in a more roundabout manner, relying on trickery and diversions. A physically strong character might prefer to overwhelm their opponents with raw strength alone and stay unarmed, while a weaker character might be more prone to panicking and improvising weapons from the scenery.<br>Finally, be sure to consider how the action impacts your characters. Violence is inherently a traumatic experience, but people can react to it wildly differently, especially if they are more used to it than others.<br>Keep all this in mind and you&#039;ll be far ahead of the norm when it comes to writing action.

Quit falling for shitty azquotes bait meant to attract lowest common denominators like you asses who think an out of context quote is enough to get you rattling out your inane, self-important opinions. The context was more specifically about the arrival of logic through illogic, a progression that Nietzsche likes pointing at in order to distinguish two conflicting forces: the search for truth and older life-serving errors. He isn&#039;t wrong for saying that logic and math would have never come about if thinkers were strictly attempting to draw conclusions from the &quot;real world&quot;. It&#039;s not a strict refutation, it&#039;s his drawing of the history of reason for the purposes of describing his artistic Socrates, his Frohliche Wissenschaft, or usually for simply showing the interesting progressions that a seemingly solid and well-founded institution actually goes through.<br>Autists like <a href=\"#p21312601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21312601</a> are especially the type to fail to understand him, as they have no artistic license and treat words like building blocks for their little castles. Similarity implies equality, but to say that equality exists is a huge leap. 0.85 is close to 1.00 but for logical statements like A = B to be made it must posit that equality exists, hence to classify one animal a fox and other animals like it as foxes requires a leap that someone more keen to details would not make. Ironically the defenders of logic only put themselves further from the truth: which in this case is that they take themselves without even a grain of salt, and certainly no levity. To arrive at truth through error - Nietzsche simply recognizes the errors along that path, making it a surface to dance on, again something autists can&#039;t do.<br><br><a href=\"#p21311755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21311755</a><br><a href=\"#p21312762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21312762</a><br>So read.

Some suggestions:<br><br><br>\u2014 It should develop ALL the body, rather than just one or more parts of it.<br><br>Football (soccer) is imperfect because it over-emphasizes the lower body. If some latter-day Frankenstein were to create the perfect footballer in a laboratory, the result would be like a Tyrannosaurus Rex \u2014 huge powerful legs and tiny vestigial arms. (That&#039;s probably what we&#039;ll have in another fifty years, thanks to genetic engineering.)<br><br>Basketball is even uglier than football, for the same basic reason. In basketball, being freakishly tall is a big advantage. To be the best at basketball you have to be too tall for anything else.<br><br>This issue also downgrades sports with marked chirality. Most would agree symmetry is aesthetically preferable; an athlete should be reasonably ambidextrous. A sport which uses the right arm exclusively can&#039;t be ideal. (You end up looking like that meme of the coomer, haha.) That&#039;s a bit of a strike against tennis.<br><br><br>\u2014 It should promote overall fitness and health.<br><br>The sport should require a good balance between explosive, short-term strength &amp; long-term endurance. Weightlifting goes too far in one direction; marathon running too far in the other.<br><br>Also it should not (barring rare accidents) damage the participants. This is the big problem with martial arts, which otherwise seem just about ideal. (It&#039;s also why I don&#039;t like ballet \u2014 it damages the dancers.)<br><br><br>\u2014 If a team sport, it should not depend disproportionately on a few individuals.<br><br>This is difficult to organize because a star player can always make a big difference. But something like doubles tennis, where both team members are in action all the time, is clearly superior to e.g. cricket, where you might have just one monster bowler or batsman.<br><br><br>\u2014 It should end on a climax.<br><br>Tennis always ends with someone winning a match-point. A race ends with someone crossing the finishing-line. Those are climaxes. Football just ends when the time runs out; nothing might be happening. Clearly inferior. Basically, any sport that depends on a fixed time is inferior.<br><br><br>VERDICT:<br><br>No idea. I watch gymnastics and figure-skating in the Olympics.

Thus in many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents.

It&#039;s a fundamental misunderstanding of the book to think you can &#039;solve it&#039; by knowing their sources.<br>One example above: &quot;fuligin&quot;, originating from &#039;f\u016bl\u012bgo&#039; which refers to soot. Yet inferring &quot;carbon colored&quot; is a misstep, fuligin is not &#039;carbon colored&#039;, but described in the book as &quot;being darker than black&quot;. These words, just like the world, may mean something to us, but they mean something else to the characters in the setting. Words may vary in obscurity, but since they&#039;re all stand-ins for something else, it&#039;s really in the context where these are defined. If the book described a cat and called it a dog you&#039;d be a fool saying you easily knew what a dog is.

Also very different from Wolfe, who&#039;s not actually about purple prose. (comparisons to Lovecraft I understand, CAS has a lot more imagination, better vocabulary and it never feels tackled on) On themes they&#039;re even further away, one influenced by the decadents and later weird fiction, and the other with a strong catholic upbringing and drawing from borges and nabokov, thus the tone of their works is completely different<br><br>Would be better if criticisms were not just compromised of wrong readings of his work coupled with namecalling and nothing more.

Here are the proposed rules of this year:<br>- The choices should fall into the literary arena: book of fiction, book of poetry, or book of literary essays. Philosophy, science, politics, and other unfortunate non-fiction genres are not allowed and will be invalidated.<br>- You can choose up to 5 books but only one book per author. This is done to avoid overrepresentation (e.g. 3 Dostoyevsky novels in the top 25).<br>- Shakespeare&#039;s plays will count towards one book, The Complete Works (how they were originally published). Borges&#039;s collections (e.g. Ficciones, The Aleph, Labyrinths, etc) will count towards Collected Fictions (Borges&#039; English releases were kind of botched and irregular). This also done to avoid atomization.<br>- The titles should be presented in English if they have been translated (e.g. The Divine Comedy rather than La divina commedia). This makes the vote counting easier because the titles are normalized and there&#039;s little variation.<br>- The responses should be in the form &quot;[Book title] by [Author]&quot; rather than &quot;[Author]&#039;s [Book title]&quot;", "filename": "9349549943", "ext": ".png", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 225, "tn_h": 225, "tim": 1669603135227471, "time": 1669603135, "md5": "S53zQrKXzqgl8JmAEQHYeA==", "fsize": 7028, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "lits-top-100-2022-version", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 30, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 25, "omitted_images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 21311844, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)01:39:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21311043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21311043</a><br>It\u2019s honestly not worth it to do it anymore.

Would recommend reading Adam Tooze&#039;s The Wages of Destruction or this massive brick brick instead if you want to learn more about the Nazi regime in power.

I find it&#039;s better to go more granular and scholarly when it comes to Nazis because when looking at them in broad strokes from mainstream history books the over-arching narrative about them never changes and you yourself could probably tell half as good as any historian really", "filename": "51ECF12V0BL._SX310_BO1,204,203,200_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 312, "h": 499, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1669605053331238, "time": 1669605053, "md5": "lIVonnULzw3wcVRctYsC8A==", "fsize": 26571, "resto": 21310802}, {"no": 21311493, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)23:46:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21310871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21310871</a><br>Fpbp", "time": 1669610817, "resto": 21310802}, {"no": 21311946, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)01:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21310802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21310802</a><br>No", "time": 1669618798, "resto": 21310802}], "last_modified": 1669618798}, {"no": 21310963, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)21:13:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are some good books on emptiness?", "filename": "1669601576480", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 686, "h": 857, "tn_w": 200, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669601587126686, "time": 1669601587, "md5": "5Rka/7KWxWityQFIIn7yKg==", "fsize": 877138, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-some-good-books-on-emptiness", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 6, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 1, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21311086, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)21:51:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Seeing That Frees by Rob Burbea<br>Jay Garfield&#039;s MMK translation <br>Nagarjuna&#039;s Madhyamaka by Jan Westerhoff<br>The Emptiness of Emptiness by C W Huntington", "filename": "25172403._SY475_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 316, "h": 475, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669603899347439, "time": 1669603899, "md5": "F2lSLkxrOGJMS+26UtEZPQ==", "fsize": 25551, "resto": 21310963}, {"no": 21311173, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:14:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21311086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21311086</a><br>based", "time": 1669605292, "resto": 21310963}, {"no": 21311507, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)23:51:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21310963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21310963</a><br>books are emptiness", "time": 1669611092, "resto": 21310963}, {"no": 21311679, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)00:51:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21310963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21310963</a><br>that&#039;s like asking good books on flying saucers, there isnt one since it&#039;s fiction", "time": 1669614687, "resto": 21310963}, {"no": 21311934, "now": "11/28/22(Mon)01:57:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21310963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21310963</a><br>That&#039;s the one and only question for which The Bible is not the answer.", "time": 1669618652, "resto": 21310963}], "last_modified": 1669618652}, {"no": 21311280, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)22:40:33", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Out of context quotes", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;An artist respects the silence that serves as the foundation of creativity.</span>", "filename": "1669588759792476", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 1266, "tn_w": 213, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1669606833596640, "time": 1669606833, "md5": "qybeHCMniPNcZpPXpHl0rQ==", "fsize": 87528, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "out-of-context-quotes", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 1, "omitted_posts": 5, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 21311411, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)23:22:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Y&#039;hear that, Noah?
