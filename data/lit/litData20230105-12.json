It explains so many of the apparent contradictions of the present system of power (like &#039;Woke Capital&#039;), and makes you realise that the standard tools for analysing power (like Marxism) are hopelessly out of date. TL;DR the bourgeouis were replaced as the dominant class in the West during the early 20th century by professional managers. The bourgeouis were no longer able to exercise direct control due to the increasing complexity and size of government, industry and educational/cultural institutions. The managerial class transformed government into a mass bureaucratic welfare state, business into the bureaucratised, shareholder-owned corporation and the university into the mass training and research institution. The managerial class continually expands its power by finding (or creating) new problems to solve with government interventions, and has successfully fused government, corporation and culture into a single vehicle for their class interests. In the West the managerial state relies on manipulation and consumerism to control the masses, while in Russia and China it uses physical repression and appeals to group solidarity. <br><br>The Managerial Revolution by James Burnham is the book that started the whole theory, but it&#039;s out of date and many of its predictions turned out to be incorrect.

She wondered how they might summarize the world once swollen with vigor and now weak and deflated from overstimulation driven to atrophy, she came back to one phrase in particular, recited by an anchor, well dressed and unemotional as he delivered a summary of the findings - the forensic evidence gathered from the ruins of a cult in Nevada. They were made sick by consuming, in large quantities, their own living flesh.<br><br> Fuels were burned, the land consumed, the skies filled with trinkets and with each year the ouroboros grew closer to its own head. Modern life became a lesson in eschatology, Greek, the study of end times. The industrial revolution had spawned doomsday cults before but the dogmatic religiosity of the era had them largely contained. The predicted rapture came and went, and then the Seventh Day Adventists with their righteous embarrassment, retired to their sitting rooms. The Jehovah&#039;s Witness took up croquet in the afternoon and forgot about their looming day of Armageddon which had converted so many with its dramatic pronouncements. The memory of bad predictions came and went with the casseroles and the Sunday picnics and the rumors of the Organist\u2019s affair with the reverend\u2019s daughter until all was much the same as it had always been.<br><br> Now, in the modern era, we had a new end. He was named Behemoth and under his auspice things were different. His name had always been rumored but his existence was new, incarnated only with the rites of Watt, Ford and Walton. Now, everyone knew him, recognized his face, his quantity, his effervescent need to consume, own and to be, and to be more. Behemoth was the face of our new eschatology, and we listened to his whispering in the dark like curious children gathered about the circus tiger\u2019s circus after the show was all wrapped up. He told us many things, and tempted us with all our dreams come true should we only reach up and gently unlatch the cage.<br><br> And so in the dawning of the Information age we did, and the new eschatologists were born, and they did not lean to religious fervor - to thick and terrible piety in the face of such momentous ends - they leaned toward atomization, a pulling apart, a siloing of the self. They had seen the world bound up and they sought to save themselves, their own desires and their own wants. Like a mountaineer who sees the lead climber slip, humanity began cutting the ropes that bound them in a desperate attempt to save themselves from the fall.<br><br> But that was their great misconception: the fall was coming for everyone.", "time": 1672897838, "resto": 21466803}, {"no": 21481337, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)00:52:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471568</a><br>Your writing is clear and perfectly fine.

Ahhhh, like you are relaxing or understanding something, for alpha; awww, like you are admiring a cute puppy, for omicron; and ohhhh, like you are shocked or dismayed, for omega.<br>Oh (like omega) by the way, zeta is not a straight up z. Textbooks will instruct you to pronounce it like dzeta or zdeta.

The most popular material for &quot;direct&quot; teaching of Latin is that of Hans \u00d8rberg, entitled lingua latina per se illustrata; in it one can already see several elements of the degradation described above. I quote the text of one of the first lessons, and ask the reader to pronounce everything, patiently, aloud:<br><br>iulia cantat: lalla. Iulia laeta est.<br>Marcus: st! Marcus laetus non est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus: ssst! Marcus iratus est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus iuliam pulsat.<br>Iam iulia non cantat, sed plorat: uhuhu!<br>Marcus ridet: hahahaha!<br><br>It did not seem appropriate to reproduce the illustrations. So that the student doesn&#039;t have -- poor thing! -- to see a vocabulary, in which laetus would appear next to the translation &quot;joyful, happy&quot;, we have to repeat, like mental patients: iulia laeta est; marcus laetus non est, as we look at the illustrations, in which iulia appears smiling, and marcus, angry. After being hit by marcus, we read, iulia non cantat, sed plorat, which would already be repulsive enough to any living intelligence but still lacks the complement: uhuhu. And, as if marcus ridet weren&#039;t obvious enough, we still have to recite, with classroom gravity: hahahae. Anyone familiar with the language courses that are popular around the world is already familiar with these artifices, and knows that, in the classroom, they must be complemented by mime and other circus activities. And that&#039;s the price to pay if we want to eliminate translations. Before, we read Cicero and Horace to the children; now, we meditate on iulia and her uhuhu.<br><br>1", "time": 1672784553, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475303, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:23:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475229</a><br>In fairness, every athletic achievement since the advent of hormonal supplementation is invalid, male or female.", "time": 1672784598, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475305, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:23:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I know that many, especially those whose mentality has already been irremediably deformed by modern pedagogy, will claim that this is necessary for the little ones. What can you tell me about adults who study using the same method, and who are, by the way, the majority? Has this time already degenerated to the point of losing track of the obvious? Anyone who stoops to reading aloud -- worse, to acting -- the story reproduced above, muffling the natural revolt and sense of ridicule, becomes even more stupid in the act. There is no quicker way to stupidity than to make a willful idiot of yourself; this has always been known to men, by virtue of mere intuition.<br>Today, in addition, there is even the developed discipline of psychodrama, used by social engineers to reduce children&#039;s brains to dust, turning them smoothly into automatons. Language courses use these techniques to inculcate linguistic habits, and most users think that nothing else happens in the process. It is irresponsible naivety.<br><br>The great pedagogues have always recognized the importance of teaching with high quality material, not from the point of view of didactic effectiveness, but from the point of view of objective literary value. Not even the simple recitation of a text could dispense with the examination of its content, as it would be imprinted in the memory and, therefore, would have some effect on the soul. This practice degenerated, in the modern age, into mere moralistic training (leading to the monstrous psychological manipulation promoted today in classrooms by globalist organizations), but it was originally more ambitious: it aimed to imprint in the child&#039;s mind images of everything that was good and beautiful, and always to be the best from the beginning. This was the demand of Quintilian, perhaps the greatest pedagogue of antiquity and certainly one of the most influential, both in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance: that the child, as soon as he began to write his first words, copy excerpts from poets and maxims of high moral content; and that, when she was reading with some ease, she should read the great Virgil right away. And he added, perhaps anticipating the objection of the moderns: to understand Virgil&#039;s virtues, a more trained intelligence is needed; however, there will be plenty of time for that, and it will not be read just once... What would Quintilian think of our Laeta Iulia and her Marcus Iratus, who are applauded, not by inexperienced and immature children, but even by adults in universities?&quot;<br><br>2<br><br>https://rafaelfalcon.com.br/wp-cont<wbr>ent/uploads/2016/09/Sobre-a-Arte-de<wbr>-Ler-em-Latim.pdf<br>google translate", "time": 1672784615, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475313, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475301</a><br><a href=\"#p21475305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475305</a><br>Wow, thank you sir, now I can understand 2 year old level Latin!

The Colloquia, despite having relatively simple vocabulary and a more didactic structure than that of Cicero&#039;s texts, are dialogues of great elegance, whose style is very reminiscent of Terence. Some critics claim that it was in the Colloquia that Erasmus achieved his most perfect literary expression. However, in the preface our author had to justify himself for, being a mature man, dedicating his attention to \u201cchildishness\u201d. The work seemed excessively puerile and vulgar, since the subject of the dialogues was light, and its treatment, mildly comic, literary characteristics convenient to the genre, but little accepted by the morality of the time, formed as it was in the principles of Quintilian. Nor did Erasmus think much differently \u2013 he reaffirms many times, in his De Ratione Studii, that one must read the best materials from the beginning and he justified these lighter texts as the sugar we add to certain medicines, to make it easier for children to take them. If his dialogues, which are veritable works of literature, were like sweetened medicine for him, what would he say about Hans \u00d8rberg? Pure sugar, and without the medicine together! What result can something like that have, if not a type of intellectual diabetes?<br><br>What I say about \u00d8rberg applies, with all due proportions, to any method that uses adapted or facilitated texts, or that follows the principles of the \u201cnatural method\u201d. And yet many, more and more, will continue to use them and justify themselves, while they postpone again and again, as adults, what the pupils of blessed Alcuin did in their earliest childhood. It is because \u201cthey are not yet prepared\u201d for the classics; the old methods are \u201ctoo hard\u201d. Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of the essayist Thomas Carlyle, memorized by herself, at the age of four, the declension of the word penna, to convince her father to send her to Latin school. At nine, she was reading Virgil. In the 19th century, this method was good enough for a four-year-old Englishwoman, but it no longer works for a thirty-year-old American.

She\u2019s going to school one day, bag on her back carrying all her shit and something else. A pen. A special pen. A multi colored pen we take for granted now, but a very advanced and fancy and glorious pen for a third world country. Her father was a book salesman, they didn\u2019t have any bookstores or markets back then. If you wanted a book you\u2019d pay too dollar and you\u2019d get it in a few days and the man who offered would get a good commission. She had brought the pen to school because she loved it. It wasn\u2019t hers, it was her father\u2019s. He was proud of it and would pull it out for those indecisive customers who would be sold on the elegance of a nice suit, good shoes, and a futuristic pen. She was proud of such a small trinket, she wanted to keep it with her and show it off to everyone in school. So on she marched to school.<br>Once she had gotten to school, everything was normal. But once the teacher asked them to pull out their mandatory paper stock and writing intensive, everything changed. She pulled out the pen and some classmates gasped. What a pen! What a fine piece of plastic! Was it from the states? From the utopia? Why, yes. Of course it was. Where else could you find such a pen?<br>She wrote and scribbled and dragged the pen for session after session until it was time for lunch.<br>Lunchtime. <br>You had to leave your bags and supplies in the room and sit outside at the benches waiting for the daily slop.

But quality here doesn&#039;t matter at all, it&#039;s just a matter of being loud and whorish. The guy who goes BRAAP HUEHUEUEHUE isn&#039;t putting a fraction of the effort, his work is lazily made and 90% of his output is memes. But he&#039;s being loud and that gets him attention. My issue isn&#039;t that I&#039;m scared of participating to this competition, my issue is that I feel like I&#039;m wasting my fucking time. Sure if I publish 20000 stories eventually some 15 year old will say &quot;gj anon&quot; in a comment but for fuck&#039;s sake, the work:reward ration here is so fucking abysmal I sincerely feel unable to entertain this idea.

I can feel them, the psyche can recognize the memory even though my brain cant conjure an image. But the feelings linger; the melancholic somberness of things once done and places once visited, and the longing to return there, wherever it is. <br><br>I am a delivery driver. I spend my nights up and down the coast of eastern Massachusetts. The nights are always the worst in regards to this. Its as if the light of the moon creates a blanket on the earth where things that are and things that could be or could have been merge into one viscous liquid and are poured into my tired eyes. I pass by a complex and im hit with the sudden sorrow of a far removed life. Images of a young woman, mid 20s, getting ready to go out with her girlfriends on a Saturday night. I can remember the feeling inside me, but I cannot recall a face. They&#039;re still shots of half composed scenes on a canvas; a living room only half carpeted, half walled, half of a persons belongings lazily strewn about on coffee tables and desks; or else a bar with no booths, or no patrons, or a bartender with no face, just black hair done up in a bun and tacky wish earings. <br><br>Sometimes its a man; a fat, greasy, happy man. Then cheated on and had done horrible things in retaliation. Or a girl, 16 and naive and stupid and with a whole life ahead of her; a real life ahead of her, not just the innate possibilities of youth, but middle class, some natural hobbies, some friends, a 3.7 GPA and a litter of midpack schools on the horizon. Only shes destined to die in a car accident with a bus on summer break in her first semester in Seattle. <br><br>My heart remembers all of it, even when my brain doesnt. I lay in bed at night and cry that something is wrong. Im not supposed to be here, this is a mistake. But I dont know where that place im desperate to get back to is. I cry that I miss my family and my friends, but I dont know who they are. Their names, their faces. I long to come back to people I dont know, only feel like I know, and thats the hardest part. The not knowing. Whats the point of all this? That&#039;s my question; the one thing I want to ask God when I die. When im standing before him, and im being judged for all the petty things that frankly stopped mattering lifetimes ago, I just want to cry and ask him why. Why was I there, what were you trying to show me? I want to sob and tell him I hate him and im sorry at the same time, that I just want to understand why. I&#039;ve asked before, plenty of times, but he never answers, and why would he?

In their research they looked across cultures and across millennia to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures. Their list includes six character strengths: wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence.

He had laughed at a very funny joke about a Negro when Irwin told it at a party, and then the following day had seen some white men lightly kicking a Negro man in the pants, and temporarily he had questioned laughter altogether. He had gone to several universities with the vague exaltation of Old Man Axelrod and had found only curves and credits. He had become drunk on the idea of God and found only theology. He had risen several times on the subtle and powerful wings of lust, expectant of magnificence, achieving only discharge. A few times he had extended friendship with palpitating hope, only to find that no one quite knew what he had in mind. His solitude now was the result of his metabolism, that constant breathing in of joy and exhalation of sadness. He had come to take shallower breaths, and the two had become mercifully mixed into melancholy contentment.

All of the life lesson that i have accumulated but failed to realize, are suddenly carrying fruits. And its not like bad thoughts have disappeared.

Who, in sowing the seeds of the hippie movement tilled the soil of many of our current problems, were satanic plants - more or less - men working to bring to birth the Harlot of Babylon, and laying the foundations for a necessity of enslavement upon all of Western civilization, as an increase in sin represents a decrease in self-rule, and a thing which does not master itself necessitates mastery from without. <br><br>In essence, they are in Hell for leading many astray through various ways.

Disregard yourself and what you think, haikus are not about showing what you feel about something\u2014 it&#039;s about telling your reader about something you&#039;ve witnessed or lived through and hoping that, maybe, they will feel something similar to what you felt. <br>Haikus are characterized by &quot;season words,&quot; which are markers that point towards the season the event is set in. It can be anything from mentioning petals (spring) to snow (winter) or outright using the word summer or autumn somewhere. Personally, I think that&#039;s a trash rule, one that I am more than willing to break, and no classicist is going to convince me otherwise. <br>Most haiku you see around are seiryu, though. They&#039;re cynical or humorous haiku that speak of the human condition, and don&#039;t really take the season pointers in consideration. <br><br>I recommend reading The Haiku Handbook and lurking around HSA&#039;s site.

Isn&#039;t it the confined who must be frightened? And why would the moon be afraid of it? At this point, I feel like there&#039;s a lot of pent up violence bubbling just beneath the surface of a tense layer of fear in this poem. It reminds me actually of Mark Strand&#039;s beloved (by me) poem Sleeping With One Eye Open - in terms of the atmosphere you&#039;re creating (which is very good). The issue I&#039;m having is there isn&#039;t any clear issuer or recipient of this oozing tension, and I have the sense you&#039;re listening to and observing the dog, but now the poem gains this sort of fearfully apprehensive heavenly viewpoint, motherly even, so for whom is she fearing? The caged dog? You? It&#039;s owners? The neighborhood - should he get loose? I think this poem can be very strong if you can establish a clearer symbolic orientation without destroying the vague apprehension you&#039;ve created.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when the branches hold no shelter</span><br>So is the moon afraid he&#039;ll kill small tree animals in the yard?

It sounds great and the imagery is very strong. However, as great as these lines are, from the poems prior lines, I don&#039;t get the sense there&#039;s anything earth shattering about to occur. Perhaps something not good, but nothing on that scale. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s to be done about that.

The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and The Ballad of the Sad Cafe were both rereads and are both amazing- McCullers has such great characters- even the second time around they both affected me greatly.

They walk our streets with muffled steps, and look at no one. No anxiety can be discovered in their eyes, no haste in their gestures. For them an outside world has ceased to exist, and they submit to every solitude. Careful to keep their distance, solicitous of their detachment, they inhabit an undeclared universe situated somewhere between the memory of the unimaginable and the imminence of certainty. Their smile suggests a thousand vanquished fears, the grace that triumphs over all things terrible: such beings can pass through matter itself. Have they overtaken their own origins? Discovered in themselves the very sources of light? No defeat, no victory dis turbs them.

Perhaps a new imprint could be a viable sense of permanence to what\u2019s currently flirting around the edges of society with podcasts, telegram groups, and urbit meetups. Regardless of how digital we are, we still need to touch things; to feel things and read them with our eyes to trust them.

The question is raised more than once whether the ocean can even have a concept of plurality, or of the existence of other conscious organisms. I think to Kelvin&#039;s working theory that he discusses with Snaut at the end of the novel, the emphasis and import he places in the fact that, unlike us, the ocean&#039;s actions cannot have a purpose beyond what the ocean itself creates (or at least could not until it &quot;discovered&quot; us).<br><br>What was sent in the original X-ray bombardment (not somebody&#039;s consciousness I assume), and why did it provoke the appearance of the g-formations? Why can&#039;t the g-formations be apart from their &quot;hosts&quot;? This might be evidence in favor of your theory, as it might be evidence of the recognition of distinct individual conscious entities outside of itself. But who knows? I think now to that dream I mentioned earlier, it&#039;s timing (after the consciousness bombardment), the notion that the two parties only discover themselves and not the other through the contact.

In every chapter there is a narration by him and it never gets old. We even learn what happened to him in the war.<br><br>There&#039;s a parallel that it&#039;s absent in the film that I found peculiar. When Moss is wounded after a shootout, he asks to some young men in the street to sell him one of the coats they&#039;re wearing. After they refuse he basically begs them to sell him a coat until one of them does (this is the scene in the film with the norte\u00f1o band). On the other hand when Chigurh is wounded after the car accident, two young men happen to be near there, Chigurh offers money for a t-shirt and one of them voluntarily gives it to him for free, he then insists in paying them.<br><br>Another important difference is that in the film Carla Jean refuses to call it when Chigurh tosses the coin. While in the book he&#039;s there to kill her but decides to give her another chance with the coin toss, which she calls heads but was tails, in the very final moments she accepts her destiny.<br><br>We learn that Carson Wells worked once with Chigurh, and the reason why Chigurgh was handcuffed at the begining of the film is that a man insulted him and he killed him in a parking lot, later he allowed the deputy to detain him so he could &quot;extricate himself by an act of will&quot; (basically getting himself in trouble only to prove himself he could get out of it). There&#039;s also more details on what exactly happened in the war to Sheriff Bell and why he feels so guilty about it.<br><br>Overall it was a pretty good read even after having seen the film. And yes, they&#039;re basically the same but the small differences is what made the book better in my view. &quot;And then I woke up.&quot;", "time": 1672860463, "resto": 21478758}, {"no": 21479386, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)14:28:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21478790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21478790</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He\u2019s supposed to be the personification of death though.</span><br>In the film in a literal way, in the book in a metaphorical way.

His advices is harmful and you will end up like him if you can&#039;t let go and just accept people are evil and not your problem. If someone wants to be your fren, great.

You don&#039;t have an inner voice that tells you what to do, you have a parallel world you can visit whenever you want, even with eyes open. There is no one telling you how to behave, but you can create pretty much anything inside this world. You can even visit this world if you sleep, though this is insanely tough to do.<br>I wish I had more free time, because going on adventures and literally slaying dragons in your &quot;shizo world&quot; is comfy.<br><br>As a side note, if you are able to understand Jung, you have no psychological problem anymore, because the &quot;shizo world&quot; is your Psyche and your Self.<br><br>I would say any IQ below 180 makes it nearly impossible to actually visit in a quantum physical way your inner world.", "time": 1672902391, "resto": 21481422}, {"no": 21481513, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:06:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21481509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21481509</a><br>Yes, and Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.", "time": 1672902417, "resto": 21481422}, {"no": 21481516, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)02:10:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21481422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21481422</a><br>Found this somewhere<br>1.

Because, as Aristotle taught and as the Moors both learned and eventually passed on to the Christian universities of Iberia, it isthisuse of the narrative art that is closest to philosophy: to the investigation of the problems of metaphysics that the novel, properly conceived, invites us to consider.

But for someone involved in the production of the Don&#039;s tale, perhaps the Cide, offering up moral fables as truth is the greatest falsehood of all, and accordingly the proper response is to subvert the genre, via satire, and with an aim that is eminently philosophical: to destroy the pretense to truth of genre-conventional works by making the writing of fiction principally an exploration of the moral and metaphysical dimensions of recounting as true events that are strictly false.&quot;<br><br>From: https://www.berfrois.com/2015/05/on<wbr>-cide-hamete-benengeli/", "time": 1672879174, "resto": 21474205}, {"no": 21480589, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)19:51:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21480535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21480535</a><br>Based, I knew my instincts on this weren&#039;t simple /pol/schizophrenia", "time": 1672879908, "resto": 21474205}, {"no": 21480626, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)20:00:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21480425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21480425</a><br>I think the first step to truly enjoying art is obliterating (as completely as you can) the idea that art is a puzzle to be solved.

Eliot is highly distinguished as a poet, a literary critic, a dramatist, an editor, and a publisher. In 1910 and 1911, while still a college student, he wrote \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\u201d published in Poetry magazine, and other poems that are landmarks in the history of modern literature. Eliot\u2019s most notable works include The Waste Land (1922), Four Quartets (1943), and the play Murder in the Cathedral (1935). Eliot\u2019s awards and honors include the British Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize for Literature. His play The Cocktail Party won the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. In 1964, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats was famously adapted in 1981 into the musical Cats, which won seven Tony Awards. Despite his enduring popularity, Eliot and his work have been criticized as having prejudiced views, particularly anti-Semitism.</span><br><br>Full biography here<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ets/t-s-eliot", "filename": "735c26b7fddbea13d2ed50afaa67f1ce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1940, "h": 1293, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672842233133668, "time": 1672842233, "md5": "YerzDwzFjvpgZummk1T2Rw==", "fsize": 362388, "resto": 21478294}, {"no": 21478314, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)09:28:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21478294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21478294</a><br>I myself like the first 2 stanzas much more than the rest.

Maybe on top of that I also tend to wonder too much if, among the values that are taken for granted in my surroundings, and which the people of my era, country, and social class believe unsurpassable, eternal, and universal, there aren&#039;t some that will one day appear grotesque, scandalous, or just plain wrong. When unsavory characters like Limonov and his kin say that our faith in human rights and democracy is the modern equivalent of Catholic colonialism--the same good intentions, the same absolute certitude in bringing truth, goodness, and beauty to the savages--I may not be pleased by this relativist argument, but I&#039;ve got nothing solid to counter it with.</span>", "time": 1672880795, "resto": 21480605}, {"no": 21481344, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)00:54:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My one claim to fame was that i met Limonov in the early 2000&#039;s.<br><br>I was at the time hanging out with some rather questionable people, more regular Nazis then Nazbols, and knew a guy who occasionally contributed to his newspaper.
