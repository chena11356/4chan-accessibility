I don&#039;t know what the grammatical or linguistic word for this is, but in Bengali adding the vowel &quot;i&quot; at the end of a noun, pronoun, or demonstrative shows specificity or emphasis. As a sample sentence, if I say &quot;amar shahosh ache&quot;, this would mean I have bravery. If I said &quot;amar-i shahosh ache,&quot; the &quot;i&quot; adds specificity and implies other people we are talking about don&#039;t have bravery, and the sentence now means that I alone have bravery (and the others don&#039;t). This is a crude example for illustrative purposes, but you can see that for subtle meanings it would be difficult to translate to English the specificity which is conveyed in Bengali with only one vowel. Even in my example I needed several words.<br><br>The same issue exists in the line I am dissecting from Tagore. The word &quot;aemon&quot; means &quot;like this&quot; or &quot;such is.&quot; But in the poem, Tagore does not write &quot;aemon&quot; but &quot;aemon-i,&quot; which adds a certain emphasis which is difficult to translate. He has translated it as &quot;such is thy pleasure,&quot; which loses the emphasis of the original. I don&#039;t know how he would have captured that emphasis, because the vowel &quot;i&quot; adds emphasis in a subtle way and English adjectives of specification (&quot;this alone is thy pleasure,&quot; or &quot;this specifically is thy pleasure&quot;) would be too strong and would actually be a mistranslation. And furthermore it would ruin the brevity and concision of the sentence, and so I think Tagore made the right choice in simply translating it as &quot;such is&quot; though he inevitably loses part of the meaning.

In arguing i&#039;ve raised the aspect of pair-bonding as differentiating non-procreative sex between spouses from promiscuous sex between strangers, but a Catholic would not agree that pair-bonding is the Ends of sexuality. Non-procreative sex is understood, by a Thomist, as innately and INDIRECTLY frustrating procreation. A Catholic would say, I believe, that when you engage in non-procreative sex you&#039;re engaging in something abjectly lustful, therefore, you&#039;re completely objectifying your partner and thus implicitly denying their dignity as a human person. This has implications for your capacity to properly raise children (i.e, I care about her body, not her), meaning, you&#039;ve indirectly frustrated procreation. To get here, the reasoning is, as you&#039;ve touched on with Aquinas, that sex and sexuality has the telos of procreation and anything short of a genuine attempt to conceive is simply mutual masturbation and serves only to denigrate the dignity of yourself and your partner - because you&#039;re a human person, not a toy, - and in damaging that human dignity you&#039;ve made yourself and your partner less excellent people, and so less excellent parents. <br><br>Of course this does not mean a married couple who used a condom a decade ago are doomed to raise crack babies, rather, if you&#039;ve two identical couples, differing only in engagement with non-procreative sex, the refraining one will be more effective parents insofar as they&#039;re closer to the potential excellence of the human person. Since sexuality is a very major aspect to human life, the misuse of it will have major consequences. That&#039;s basically tautological, we&#039;ve all seen the degenerates on this website, but it isnt so obvious when we&#039;re discussing a view of sexuality in total contradiction with contemporary perceptions.", "time": 1673439675, "resto": 21509805}, {"no": 21510538, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)07:29:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21510517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21510517</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; if you&#039;ve two identical couples, differing only in engagement with non-procreative sex, the refraining one will be more effective parents insofar as they&#039;re closer to the potential excellence of the human person.</span><br>This is an empirical proposition.

And as a person of faith, I also believe in the power of God to guide us on our path in life. To me, these two beliefs are not mutually exclusive. To me, these two beliefs intersect in the idea of laissez faire capitalism. The idea that every individual has inherent rights to life, liberty, and property.<br><br>You see, capitalism is a system of choice. It is a system in which individuals are free to make their own decisions about how to use their resources and talents, and to pursue their own goals and aspirations. It is a system in which people are free to succeed or fail based on their own efforts and abilities.<br><br>And what could be more in line with the principles of God than the idea of free will and personal responsibility? After all, isn&#039;t God the ultimate source of all freedom? did he not give us the ability to make our own choices, and to take responsibility for the consequences of those choices? Indeed, what makes moral choices moral is that they are what they are, choices. And did he not create us in his image? In creating man in his own image, did he not give man the gifts of creativity also?<br><br>So when I look at free market capitalism, I see a system that reflects the values and principles of God. A system that allows people to fully express their God given talents and abilities, and to use them to improve the lives of others. Indeed, it is a system that aligns with the golden rule to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; by recognizing that when we take care of ourselves, we are better equipped to help and serve others. So in short, capitalism and my faith in the Lord are inseparable. Free market capitalism is not only the most practical system because it is the most efficient, but the most moral one as it enables things to be the way God intended, giving me and every individual as a whole the ability to choose. surely, it is no coincidence that communism, the antithesis of capitalism, has implimented mandatory athiesm in every major country it was in. It is because communism is an enemy of the Lord, and the Lords enemies are my enemies also.", "time": 1673396974, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508240, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:30:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Where is that slave?", "time": 1673397053, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508262, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:35:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508240</a><br>Woof", "filename": "713defc92cacaa7c39298e6521f04088", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1574, "h": 2048, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673397323513976, "time": 1673397323, "md5": "jVfOVOn6QOFSO4FRAFwBaA==", "fsize": 443356, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508264, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:35:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508236</a><br>gr8 b8 m8", "time": 1673397335, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508305, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:45:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508262</a><br>I hate myself for being turned on by this", "time": 1673397910, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508329, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:49:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "what it is what it do", "time": 1673398183, "resto": 21508214}, {"no": 21508391, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)20:04:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/lit/thread/21501666#p21505563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505563</a> #<br>Which country or state?

One I particularly like is a sort of Rip Van Winkle derivative set in modern times. Married man with two kids driving home on a freeway in LA. By chance a vanishingly rare phenomena occurs where his car is collides with a momentarily manifesting tear in space-time, completely halting the spin of every atom from the outer layer of the vehicle all the way inside. Including his own. He and the car are completely frozen in time, totally immovable and anchored to the earth below it and possessing a hardness that withstands any force that is applied to it. The incident gains world-wide renown almost instantly. &quot;The Frozen Man&quot; becomes the most famous person on earth. He&#039;s voted Time man of the year. Millions of people flock to the spot where his car is frozen to catch a glimpse of him. The man&#039;s wife and children are obviously devastated by this. The section of the highway is eventually cordoned off and covered by a large hangar, turning it into a giant lab for research, only accessible by authorized scientific delegations, US intelligence, military and the president...but the Frozen Man&#039;s immediate family are also allowed visitation. As years pass, many profound scientific discoveries are made as to the nature of matter. Frozen man&#039;s oldest son becomes the most frequent visitor among his family as wife can no longer bear the pain of seeing him. The son is a bit of a prodigy studies in school and eventually grows up to specialize in plasma physics. He becomes a regular researcher at the facility. He comes up with a novel method to observe the frozen matter and eventually dislodge and capture some particles from it using a particle accelerator. These captured particles were found to be capable of seeding a process to create exotic materials, capable of withstanding astoundingly high levels of heat. At year 20 after the freeze, the son is having a coffee break talking to his dad behind the glass and he notices that his dad&#039;s hand was slightly off of the steering wheel which wasn&#039;t the case. He also observed the beginnings of a squint in his eyes...as if he&#039;s about to flinch. Calling an emergency meeting, the scientists take measurements and discover that the frozen vehicle is in fact accelerating exponentially. They calculate that within 3 days, the car and everything in it will hit an inflection point and very rapidly come out of the freeze. They prepare by clearing a path for the vehicle through the hangar and out to a now abandoned section of the freeway.. With the whole world watching and anticipating on the third day, the car starts rolling forward slowly and then suddenly accelerates to 65 MPH and Frozen Man, who was a split second ago driving on a freeway was now driving inside a giant hangar. He pumps the breaks just as his car exits the end of the hangar in full view of news helicopters. His son, and others run out to the car as he steps out into a world that has left him 20 years behind.", "time": 1673339705, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21505222, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:36:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505219</a><br>This would be the first half of the story.

If he had desired something for me I would have desired it too. Happiness for example or fame. I only had the desires he manifested. But he must have manifested them all. All his desires and needs.

I don\u2019t know if by that he meant me to leave him for good or only to step aside a moment. I never asked myself the question. I never asked myself any questions but his. Whatever it was he meant I made off without looking back. Gone from reach of his voice I was gone from his life. Perhaps it was that he desired. There are questions you see and don\u2019t ask yourself. He must have been on his last legs. I on the contrary was far from on my last legs. I belonged to an entirely different generation.

The free or outer hands hung bare. He did not like to feel against his skin the skin of another. Mucous membrane is a different matter. Yet he sometimes took off his glove. Then I had to take off mine. We would cover in this way a hundred yards or so linked by our bare extremities. Seldom more. That was enough for him. If the question were put to me I would say that odd hands are ill-fitted for intimacy. Mine never felt at home in his. Sometimes they let each other go. The clasp loosened and they fell apart.

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. Lem liked to imagine Sisyphus happy. Sissyphus may be the name of a porn star Lem liked<br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle.

But I think I will leave in &#039;Defeat&#039;. Because I think that first &#039;Defeat&#039; in the line &#039;Defeat, defeat me.&#039; is important for referring to the character&#039;s conception of Defeat he has created. Not defeat the word, but a figure of Defeat itself. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m explaining it properly, but I suppose it is a personification of defeat, like how there is death, but then there is also Death. <br><br>On your suggestion <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; change &quot;and I will be defeated, defeated as soon as I finish this drink&quot; to &quot;and I will be defeated as soon as I finish this drink&quot;,</span><br><br>That&#039;s an option worth considering, but I think it is stylistically more interesting to have the repetition of defeat. In contrast, your aforementioned cutting of &quot;it is in, is in my chest&quot;, I thought was a good cut because the phrasing is a little awkward and it interrupted the rhythm. But as you mentioned, you liked the repetition. So if you had any more specific reasons behind why some repetitions worked and these one&#039;s didn&#039;t, I would love to hear it. Although I think I know the problem is that the repetition is probably to repetitive. Who would have guessed?<br><br>Another point of yours that I would like to discuss is your perception of &#039;post-incel&#039;. The concept of incel crossed my mind when I was writing, and it is exactly what I wanted to avoid. Because it comes with misanthropic and hyper-sexual connotations that I think aren&#039;t present in many men that want to be a part of the collective.<br><br>The piece was a proof of concept more than a full story, so regarding his objective, while I don&#039;t think the piece shows it super clearly, this is what I am attempting with the character and would go into more depth in a longer story: <br>The character is self-conscious about his reclusive position in society. He is attempting to become more active in the collective of society. So he goes to the club to join the collective. This requires a defeat of his self-conscious tendencies and identity as an outsider. It requires him to dance. Though it would not solve his problems, this act would be a step in the right direction. Because regardless of what one thinks about the club, there is benefit in being able to dance with others. It proves an ability to exist in a group. But to dance, his self-conscious identity must be overcome by his desire and the infectious atmosphere of the club. If he could overcome his identity by himself, then the story would be about victory. But because he needs his identity to succumb, he must be defeated. But at the end he is still standing by the wall. He has a strength to resist the collective, but that does not bring him the defeat he desires. <br><br>Bit rambly, but this is all rough stuff at the moment.", "time": 1673432595, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21510227, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:43:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21504225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21504225</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;been working on my book for 5+ years</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20k words</span>", "filename": "1650466782269", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673433831086904, "time": 1673433831, "md5": "BUr8Lu3RKsvyWg9+CcBG4g==", "fsize": 27960, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21510253, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)05:51:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505739</a><br>Harassment Architecture is great, if you read it knowing the author is laughing at you for identifying with it.

I&#039;ve never thought about this before, but I do have some experience with -STJs, and seeing as I&#039;m an INTJ, perhaps I can help. <br><br>First off, an INFJ may have the most difficult time of all writing for an ESTJ in my opinion. For reasons I won&#039;t go into here, I believe your type represses the dominant function of the ESTJ, Te, more than any other function. Conversely, the ESTJ does the same. Ni, your and my dominant, is their most repressed function - just like the ESFJ. With that in mind it might be helpful for you to think of a sort of cloud of other types which fluidly relate to the ESTJ and which might be easier for you to comprehend the perspective of. <br><br>On the one hand you have the following: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ESTP - alike in preference for thinking and extroverted judgement, both repress their feelings to the point of not noticing - ESTJs less so, thus more driven by an undercurrent of feeling heavily rooted in a Te-Fi &quot;objective, generally common-sensical&quot; morality</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISTP - their mirror - both are driven to act quickly and efficiently with no frills. The ISTP tends more towards doing this with a stylish and idiosyncratic eye due to hyper-repressed Fi, while the ESTJ, repressing Ni is striving for insight and manifestation of a longterm vision (the 4-7 link Fi-Ni). As with all types, this will be best viewed through the lens of their 2-5 function link. Si-Ti. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISTJ - possibly unhelpful for you, I&#039;m not sure. The ISTJ, sister type of the ESTJ, stuggles with Ne-Fe the relationship of Fe to the immediate big picture, and the micro-interconnections of the social sphere to the big picture. The ESTJ struggles less with this, and in fact, though not being much better at it than the ISTJ in certain regards, almost seems to pride themselves on it. I believe it is the nature of our weaker functional links to take on this aspirational nature and in so doing, orient our dominant functions to those domains. Like the ISTJ, ESTJs like dead-pan, punchy humor, generally.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ENFP - They share all functions with an ENFP, in some ways it may be useful to imagine ENFP, ENFJ, ESTP, ESTJ as one group to get a sense for these extroverted types. Regardless, like an ENFP, they hold strong convictions and will, unlike an ENFP, try to fulfill the role of these convictions stoically, stolidly - as opposed to like a firecracker or a whip. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;INFP - I find ESTJs to be most similar to INFPs in how they enjoy company. Again, these two types share all the same preference of cognitive function in a different order, but the weaknesses of the INFP are the strengths of the ESTJ and vice versa. Beyond that, they are quite similar. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ESFJ and ISFJ - these may be the most useful for you, being Fe-Ti users with Si-Ne preference, but I am an INTJ. Explaining Fe types to an INFJ would be comical. Fe-Se is my weakest link, thus all INTJs tend to have a lot to say about Ne-Fe via Te (which this entire post could amount to, no doubt). </span><br><br>(1/2)", "time": 1673426613, "resto": 21509298}, {"no": 21509875, "now": "01/11/23(Wed)03:47:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509861</a><br>In summary, ESTJs seem to like clear archetypal characters who lean towards action.

Think of the quizzes as merely a way for typists to allow themselves to be checked against the self-perception of the subject they are typing, and a way for individuals to get a handle on the system by self-typing.

The system, at base, is a set of logically counter-balanced categorizations which represent an attempt to isolate and reduce an observed patient&#039;s processes to abstract concepts - for the purpose of gaining greater insight into the subject, and into all subjects at large. The quizzes are inherently flawed for several reasons, but the most noteworthy two are the following: <br><br>- every quiz author has a type. thus the quiz is influenced by the cognitive efficiencies and deficiencies of the quiz-maker(s)<br>- every test-taker has varied levels of self-observance and biases, as well as their own type - which will make it easier to comprehend the questions in the manner the test-taker intended, or harder, depending on the subject&#039;s relationship to the type of the quiz-writer<br><br>But for someone who understands the system, a gross mistype is easy to see.

Really hugged.<br>But now I saw that even our finest moments, and my best memories, somehow involved death. Our lives were built on death, our brightest days shadowed by it.

We christened and crowned, graduated and married, passed out and passed over our beloveds\u2019 bones. Windsor Castle itself was a tomb, the walls filled with ancestors. The Tower of London was held together with the blood of animals, used by the original builders a thousand years ago to temper the mortar between<br>the bricks.

We didn\u2019t blame her, and in fact we\u2019d gladly forgive her if she could make Pa happy. We could see that, like us, he wasn\u2019t. We recognized the vacant looks, the empty sighs, the frustration always visible on his face. We couldn\u2019t be absolutely sure, because Pa didn\u2019t talk about his feelings, but we\u2019d pieced together, through the years, a fairly accurate portrait of him, based on little things he\u2019d let slip.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For instance, Pa confessed around this time that he\u2019d been \u201cpersecuted\u201d as a boy.

The deeper message here is non-identification with the body and mind. &quot;The one who knows and understands the activity of the gunas [the threefold interplay of the material substrate] is not deluded about the actions of the body and mind&quot; (paraphrased from the B.G.). But the Self, Atman, is not the agent of any of this interplay, it is without a second, and therefore does not act upon anything, because there is nothing apart from it to act upon. Therefore the Self/Atman is completely without action, no one is killed by anyone, the Self does not kill. But this is the absolute height of the teaching of the B.G. On a level that is more meaningful to human beings, in this case Arjuna, there is still a choice of what to do, but the right action is indeed pre-determined by the Dharma, the Law of Manu established at the beginning of Creation (the individual is not responsible to himself, which would not make sense, but responsible to the greater order established by Manu). You would have noticed that Krishna gives more than a single reason for Arjuna to act according to his caste, and that the first I mentioned (the highest teaching) is given last as a way to eliminate Arjuna&#039;s fundamental dissatisfaction with the need to take life in general, even after he accepts the necessity of his Dharma. The &quot;lesser reasons&quot; are partly that it is preordained by the cosmic order (rita/dharma) and therefore intrinsically constitutes a force for good in the world, another is that death is not really the end, another is that as long as you act well, you will be rewarded whether you live or die. Moral agency is still presumed to be relevant in the case of Arjuna because he clearly has the choice of acting in accordance with his Dharma, or not doing so, the &quot;higher teaching&quot; is that this choice is fundamentally illusory, even though it is still necessary.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against 2000 years of western ideas about subjectivity</span><br>You would mean approximately 500 years. &quot;Subjectivity&quot; is basically made up by modern philosophers, it&#039;s not found anywhere in influential thinkers like Aristotle.

rarely say this buzzword meme phrase, but nice cope. Those restrictions were part and parcel of the metapolitical framing of the war. &quot;All&#039;s fair in love and war&quot; is a phrase for a reason. So is &quot;war is politics by other means,&quot; and so is its inverse. This isn&#039;t 1685, we aren&#039;t fighting cabinet wars. All 20th century war is assymmetrical and self-consciously so. Vietnam played the possibilities of its situation perfectly and won at the strategic level fair and square. <br><br>It&#039;s no surprise that minor nations like Vietnam can&#039;t compete with industrial juggernauts like the Cold War era USA, one of the two remaining superpowers and geopolitical hegemons on the planet. For the USA to say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t drop our thousands of nukes on every single rice farmer, because then international opinion would have turned on us and our tactical victory in Vietnam would have been geostrategically pyrrhic!!&quot; is pathetic. Vietnam fought an incredible war using every single means at its disposal and proved that the pawns can outmaneuver the queens on the board of realpolitik. Vietnam&#039;s victory was so incredible that it&#039;s philosophically significant, it&#039;s a modern Thermopylae, Marathon, or Salamis. Who cares that the Persians burnt Athens? Does anyone even remember that? No, they remember Thermopylae, Marathon, and Salamis. <br><br>To say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t disregard all metapolitical factors!! if we could have done total mobilization and destroyed our geopolitical hegemonic position and caused revolution on the home front, we could have had more tanks than you!! you had a worse K:D ratio!!!&quot; is childish and shows a lack of understanding of war.

It was a good feeling as this was my first time in the big city and I felt quite ambitious and invigorated, doubly so as I began to remember the passion of Mishima works. As I sat there admiring the cover of the temple of golden pavilion, I saw a cute Asian girl from across another bench looking at me book in hand. I never had much luck with women because I lacked experience and confidence, after reading sun and steel I had gotten quite fit and fairly well groomed and dressed, so this was my first opportunity ever. The second time she turned we locked eyes and I shyly looked away. I decided it would be pathetic of me to not at least try so I struck a conversation and we talked about each other\u2019s books. I began to describe in great detail about the life of Mishima and she was struck with great shock but luckily this manifested as an interest so she seemed to enjoy the conversation and so did I. We decided to walk around the city and she showed me her campus and some other cool scenic spots. She said it was getting late and I didn\u2019t want to make it awkward so I volunteered to leave. We embraced each other, hugging and saying our goodbyes. Looking back had I been more confident I would\u2019ve really sealed the deal probably stayed the night with her but I was too nervous.

For example, Anglo-Saxon England is cool but not especially interesting IMO. Medieval England is captivating because of its complexity and activity - the wars in France and the crusades are super cool. If you like knights, you should read up on the reign of Richard the Lionheart for sure. He&#039;s like the quintessential knightly prince. After the medieval period, personally I find English history really boring up until the modern period when suddenly shit hits the fan every which way.

What if grown women do actually have a conception of &quot;fuck boys&quot;? What if it isn&#039;t a phenomenon limited to &quot;histrionic tweens&quot; on tiktok? You&#039;ve made a pretty substantial implication here: that grown, adult women haven&#039;t also recognized these behaviors in men as undesirable.

It makes sense, but incels in general seem to get incredibly defensive in these discussions. I&#039;ve had many discussions with incels whose sense of self is so fragile that they couldn&#039;t admit that a stop sign is red if asked to argue against the idea that they shouldn&#039;t hit pedestrians at a stop sign, even if they&#039;re women in Ontario or whatever. <br><br>There&#039;s another way of interacting with information, frens.

Remain interested in the conversation, put forth your best effort to discuss it in your faith, and &quot;lose&quot; the argument.

For Guenon it is Advaita. For Evola it is Magic of which Alchemy and Yoga are examples par excellence. For Eliade it is shamanism. The lattermost was most accomplished scholar and rose to prominence. We must however question the politics of his move to place shamanism first. Is it most correct? Or most politically correct? Are shamans roots of all religions? Are modern so-called capitalist oppressed civilization avoidant shamanic indigineous cultures today really how all of primitive man lived? Eiade himself says drug use is degenerate shamanism lol. Many scholars nowadays also argue for schismogenetic religious experience and schismogenetic prehistoric culture. Polyphony. Plurality. Multivalence. I like pure Gnosticism and Hermeticism and Neoplatonism however myself... altho I do like Evola&#039;s Yogic and Alchemical approach for applying such philosophies even if I don&#039;t follow his methods exactly.<br><a href=\"#p21497323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497323</a><br>This is a good question and would require many books to answer but maybe check out Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, it is one of the classic books in the field of esoteric stuxies generally which lead to the modern scholarly interest in the so-called Hermetic Underground. In short, it is very complicated and the answer is yes and no and changed with time and place. Catholics have sacraments. And mystics. Masons are initiatic too. Kept alive certain stuff. Enemies tho. But latter led to GD and Thelema and stuff now. Whole mess of masonry illuminati and rosicrucians mixing. But also gnosticism. Christian theosophy. Not to be confused with theosophical society. Tho same milieu as Crowley Evola Guenon etc. Neoplatonism and Hermeticism crosspollinated. Both integral to western proto sciences like alchemy and astrology and magic. Catholic church is ambivalent. Delicate game of avoiding heresy. Science also considers heresy.

If the physician cannot infuse vitality into decaying parts, he cannot effect a cure, but must wait until Nature accomplishes the task; but he who can guide the power of life can guide and command Nature.\u201d</span><br><br>\u2014 Franz Hartmann,The Life of Paracelsus<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First there should be the invocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart, and a conscience which should be free from all ambition, hypocrisy and vice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, boldness, pride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and similar iniquities which should all be rooted out of the heart\u2014that when a man appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of his body, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be changed into a pure temple of God cleansed of all that defiles.\u201c</span><br><br>\u2014 Basil Valentine<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The more pure thou art in heart and mind, by so much quicker shall you perceive those high secrets we teach, and which are entirely hid from the discernment of the vicious and depraved\u2026</span><br>\u2014Francis Barrett, The Magus", "filename": "Henryk Waniek, Upon the Sky (1989)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 655, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1673231206909579, "time": 1673231206, "md5": "Mr96kNcaasS8ZvYmxIIOFQ==", "fsize": 217553, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21499859, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498558</a><br>It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit.<br>If I as a materialist were an alchemist I&#039;d never truly succeed", "time": 1673234098, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500558, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499859</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit</span><br>But what precisely does this mean?<br>If I were to become an alchemist, what would I truly be trying to do, without any mystical language to obscure it?<br>I&#039;m not a materialist by any means but I have no love for excessive obscurantism.", "time": 1673250518, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500751, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)03:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br>same<br>it seems like everyone who is into alchemy today only talks and reads about it and looks at pretty colorful pictures<br>there&#039;s no real practice anymore, no longer a tradition. just gnostic smugness that they know stuff about it", "time": 1673254106, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501256, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:49:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21497858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497858</a><br><a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br><a href=\"#p21500751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500751</a><br>just want to bump these concerns <br>maybe someone has an answer", "time": 1673268591, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501316, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)08:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498558</a><br>These difficult and unintuitive metaphysical truths often have deceptively simply applications that can lead to the sort of results some would consider magical or miraculous.<br><a href=\"#p21498581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498581</a><br>This is correct.

Ofc, I take the nondual tack rather than strict flat monist or more conventional aristotelian logical dualism (which ofc is adapted to be moreso nondual by way of neoplatonism in hermeticism methinks).

This has diluted the term somewhat and now there is much new age alchemy bullshit on the market but at the same time this is nothing new. Spirituality was always an integral part of such. Also, hermeticism as an esoteric philosophy is much broader than the mere practice of alchemy. Jung used alchemical principles to develop his theories of individuation and create what is now called active imagination. This latter practice he believed was more helpful and healing to the world than all his psychological theories combined -- provided people actually practice it. Which admittedly he worried was more dangerous and difficult. People like Lull also used techniques similar to active imagination to create vast memory palaces and turn themselves into what is almost like, if you&#039;ll pardon my Dune reference, a human mentat, or walking encyclopedia.", "time": 1673270410, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501763, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)10:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Larry Principe is one of the few legit alchemists of our day<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ea<wbr>lYU2ICnU&amp;ab_channel=BytesizeScience<wbr>", "time": 1673279115, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21502845, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)15:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any French anon alchemists here? <br>What do y&#039;all think of Patrick Burensteinas and his Voyage Alchimique and books on alchemy?", "time": 1673296090, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21503849, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)19:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673311605, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21504993, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the Count of St. Germain legit?

Half a century ago there was little doubt in the West. It was a superstition among ignorant ancients that, by certain manipulations, base metals could be turned into gold.<br><br>Then, when Freudian and Jungian ideas began to circulate in Europe, a new, enlightened view of alchemy became fashionable. The alchemists were psychoanalysing themselves. They were sublimating and calcining their own subconscious. Their real aim was not to make gold but to make a non-aberrated man.<br><br>As pursuits of this kind in the Middle Ages overlapped territory which the Church held to be its own, the alchemists had been obliged to conceal what they were really doing behind an apparently lunatic attempt to turn lead into gold.<br><br>Even for the new psychological avant-garde this explanation was not entirely satisfactory, because it was well known that even in the 20th century highly intelligent men in Fez, Cracow, Damascus, Paris and London were currently engaged in attempts to make perfectly tangible yellow gold. They had given up charcoal furnaces and were using Calor gas, but they were manifestly doing something with pots and pans, and not with Egos and Ids.<br><br>Perhaps all external ideas about the nature of alchemy could be put into four views, separately or in combination:<br><br>First View: It is possible to transmute one element into another. One such transmutation is lead or iron into gold. From some unimaginable antiquity, a mighty secret has been handed down which shows how to do this. It is the most closely kept secret in human history.<br><br>Second View: Alchemy is the science of purifying man\u2019s inner nature and arriving at a non-aberrated individual. Such an individual would have, by comparison with ordinary men, certain advanced powers. For political reasons, this exercise had to be concealed in a pseudo-science of metal refining to which the Church would have no reason to object.<br><br>Third View: Metals CAN be transmuted. Lead CAN be turned into gold. An alchemist knows how to do this, and also knows a greater secret. If he is in a certain relation to the crucible in which the process happens, a comparable transmutation takes place in his own common presence. As lead turns into gold in the crucible, the operator\u2019s mind is transformed. He is subjected to something like nuclear radiation. Also, certain chemical by-products in the crucible are capable of being stored and used to either make more gold or to transform other men. Hence legends of \u201cThe Sly Man\u2019s Pill\u201d and the Elixir which Saint-Germain is supposed to have offered Casanova when he was dying.<br><br>Fourth View: An alchemist is a man who knows an immensely powerful method of cleaning the Augean stable of his own subconscious mind. Pushed far enough, this process gives rise to a true soul-body inholding the properties of a different order of things. If this soul-body is directed on the base metals in a certain way (projection), it will accomplish a comparable transmutation in inorganic matter.", "filename": "803E7E06-8AC9-4A31-B6C1-27A448D86814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 251, "h": 400, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673393798699408, "time": 1673393798, "md5": "HxhBJkP2vV1I4eCx+A9+KA==", "fsize": 19795, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21508123, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21506706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21506706</a><br>That somewhat lowers my opinion of Evola sadly.

In Athens, there was a temple specifically dedicated to that god and very often Athenians would swear &quot;in the name of the Unknown God&quot; (\u039d\u1f74 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f0c\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, N\u0113 ton Agn\u014dston). Apollodorus,[citation needed] Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.<br><br>According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affair), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech:<br><br>22Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, &quot;You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things. 23For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#039;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&#039; What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 24The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn&#039;t dwell in temples made with hands, 25neither is he served by men&#039;s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things. 26He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 28&#039;For in him we live, and move, and have our being.&#039; As some of your own poets have said, &#039;For we are also his offspring.&#039; 29Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man. 30The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "time": 1673408736, "resto": 21508813}, {"no": 21509033, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:46:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509027</a><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

The best purge is painful, like all medicines of a drastic nature,\u2014the purge which hales to punishments by means of justice linked with vengeance, crowning the vengeance with exile or death: it, as a rule, clears out the greatest criminals when they are incurable and cause serious damage to the State. A milder form of purge is one of the following kind:\u2014when, owing to scarcity of food, people are in want, and display a readiness to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the wealthy,\u2014then the lawgiver, regarding all such as a plague inherent in the body politic, and in the friendliest possible way, will say they should be (as it will be tactfully put) &quot;transferred to a colony.&quot;</span>", "filename": "21F6CYFAolL._AC_SY780_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673403991989327, "time": 1673403991, "md5": "85WCwB+dxIeXbqW4zjcwkQ==", "fsize": 7232, "resto": 21507974}, {"no": 21508705, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)21:28:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508698</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since, however, our present object is political excellence, it is the natural character of a country and its legal arrangements that we are considering; so that we differ from most people in not regarding mere safety and existence as the most precious thing men can possess, but rather the gaining of all possible goodness and the keeping of it throughout life.

He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them. In like manner the God, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of daemons who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Cronos, as tradition paints it, and order both our homes and our States in obedience to the immortal element within us, giving to reason&#039;s ordering the name of \u201claw.\u201d But if an individual man or an oligarchy or a democracy, possessed of a soul which strives after pleasures and lusts and seeks to surfeit itself therewith, having no continence and being the victim of a plague that is endless and insatiate of evil,\u2014 if such an one shall rule over a State or an individual by trampling on the laws, then there is (as I said just now) no means of salvation.</span>", "filename": "UWHQDRHYVJCBTE5ZZQCWCPZ6UI", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1920, "h": 1632, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1673404138059078, "time": 1673404138, "md5": "Y4zW/6AovWRXBEd5WJ2KDA==", "fsize": 966047, "resto": 21507974}, {"no": 21508845, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)22:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21508590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21508590</a><br>Some people are born to be whiny faggots who accomplish nothing (you and OP).

Lacking these structures, both sexes fill the void of purpose and pleasure with counterfeit artifices of both, the purpose being to fight for a hollow purity, and the pleasures being impotent contracepted sex with people you can&#039;t really trust, or inherently homosexual self-pleasure using one&#039;s hand and degenerate, aggressive porn.", "time": 1673300178, "resto": 21501552}, {"no": 21503249, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:04:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21502126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21502126</a><br>Those aren&#039;t just factual descriptions, though, some of them read as practically drooling.", "time": 1673301887, "resto": 21501552}, {"no": 21503384, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)17:38:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21503249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21503249</a><br>What &#039;facts&#039; are you looking for?

I can appreciate how every facet of the plot has a underlying meaning, the fact that the world is split into three poles, the tennis academy, the desert steppe, and the addiction clinic, is probably emblematic of the opposing philosophies of social order that underpin society itself, a sort of Aristotelian betterment through competitive struggle vs a sort of social contract based upon habilitating an innate sinfulness or hedonistic tendency and then a sort of security state thing, but it also seem\u2019s like a lot of the setting is from his own life, so idk how \u2018deep\u2019 it really is, maybe it is all sort of facile posturing that an MFA spat out in order to please his supposed peers.", "time": 1673412111, "resto": 21508650}, {"no": 21509202, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:43:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509195</a><br>thanks man but i couldn&#039;t be bothered to read your entire post", "time": 1673412234, "resto": 21508650}, {"no": 21509204, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:44:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509202</a><br>it\u2019s fine lid, i mostly wrote it for myself", "time": 1673412299, "resto": 21508650}, {"no": 21509208, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:46:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509195</a><br>DFW* kek", "time": 1673412373, "resto": 21508650}, {"no": 21509215, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)23:48:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21509195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21509195</a><br>Yeah.

Writing and drawing are putting your thoughts on paper, and once you have enough down you can begin to crystallize and refine.
