I will die a virgin. My death will be a death that would have been considered sad if it had occurred perhaps fifteen years before. There will be grief, but all the agonies that my progenitors might pass into (and they are the only people in this entire world who even know of my existence) will be underpinned by this indomitable truth: it is a mercy that he is gone. The quantity of my existence stands only as a component for perpetuating the tortuous quality of the cheap jest that constitutes its vapid manifestation. My virginity has become the gorgon against which all my faculties rise only to be turned to stone; but this is no silent stone, this is not the stone of Plotinus that stands as the antithesis of the Intellectual Principle--for while yet stone I still feel the mind&#039;s unscrupulous lacerations and all that grieves the very fibers of its being. The spirit is dimmed each time a girl passes before the mechanism of sight that some pitiless god has glued to my body. Even the ugly, unshaven, modernity enthralled women with clowns&#039; hair and bodies desecrated with tattoos which map out upon fastfood fed bodies the vapid cliches that coagulate to form their mind, even these paralyze the life in me. Masturbation has become merely the corpse of a habit that no longer instills pleasure, no longer even succeeds in distracting, but is only the dull libidinal twitch of a mind faced with the irrepressible impossibility of its reality, while lacking the courage to galvanize itself towards rectification. In the end I do not seek repentance. The decimated husk of my ego drifts towards the only gray shore its virginity-shackled mind can still vaguely form, still vaguely know as whisper or faint wriggling worm in an unclear wound--worm&#039;s whisper out of a wound that clears: Death. Here is the Telos to which the entirety of my Dasein has been speeding. Here I shall sink at last, unrequited, into the tentacles of Annihilation&#039;s amnesia. My humiliation slowly becomes seething hatred for all who embody that element of the opposite sex, and my soul&#039;s relentless cry for something beyond suicide slowly twists itself into ever more feverish fetishes that the internet can happily supply an outlet for. At last, the inconsequential blip that referenced Myself whenever it imagined &#039;I Am&#039; shall find, not rest, but an end to the sequence of caustic images that only ever taunted it into further depths of Hell&#039;s sardonic pitch. No prostitute can relieve me of my virginity, for it has become a magnificently metaphysical lesion that I lack the medicine or Savior&#039;s name to remove and, like that man at the pool of Bethesda, take up my carpet and walk into the world again.", "time": 1671755160, "resto": 21420581}, {"no": 21422220, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)03:53:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "A mighty hearted man, small of stature, thus bursting to the brim with energy.

His obscure jovial derivations left him considered an aesthete, and even an elitist among critics, yet with a wide circle of friends, but scarcely a triangle of kindred souls.

How can you complement one another and raise your kids with certain values if you don&#039;t have similar mindsets? Plus, I believe the types of relationships that last are the ones where the man and woman have commonalities that go deeper than just the romantic/sexual aspect to the point of being a genuine team. Even if there are differences in mindset (which there will be), the similarities will allow one to see the other side of things. It&#039;s hard to fake that sort of oneness of purpose and of flesh which your average marriage doesn&#039;t have outside of birthing and raising kids, which is why so many people get divorced or end up not loving each other after the kids leave. I&#039;ve seen couples just not talk to each other or have ANYTHING in common and I don&#039;t understand how some people tolerate that. That just seems like a miserable existence. If you share a house and a life with someone, it only makes sense to share a lot in common mentally and spiritually with the other your spouse, especially if you have kids. Kids deserve to be born into a healthy household where their birth and rearing only enhances the libe the parents dote upon them. I think society should rethink how we treat romance and love.

You are melting into mush and it&#039;s an irreversible process if you go too far. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; How to I brainwash myself into enjoying work more </span><br>This is the key to your mistake. You are falling into a version of the hedonic paradox, where you are trying to consciously will your current subjective state of mind into/onto another subjective state (pleasure/fun) while staying completely subjectively conscious, i.e. not melding with the objective at all. That&#039;s not how any human activity works. We are supposed to lose ourselves in things, look up Csiksantmihayli&#039;s &quot;flow&quot; concept. <br><br>You do need to do a little bit of alchemy and self-steering, obviously, like you need to be in a job you basically don&#039;t despise and doing tasks you basically enjoy, ideally. But the part of the problem you are missing is &quot;hard&quot; obstacles, objective tasks that simply need doing, regardless of your subjective assenting to them or finding them fun. You will find out IN HINDSIGHT that you found it fun or got really engaged with something objective, after you are in it or done with it. You can&#039;t will yourself to enjoy work as if it&#039;s play, that&#039;s tautologically meaningless, work and play are antitheses. You need to fall or lapse into the kind of &quot;flow&quot; that turns work into play, and this can only be done when the subjective mind is not autistically, autarkically awake and active, sitting on grandma&#039;s couch and reducing the whole world to playthings for itself.<br><br>The opposite extreme is also bad obviously, living entirely to work and seeing any attempt to abstract from your work and ask &quot;do I really enjoy this?&quot; as a weakness, Protestant ethic type shit. But you are in no danger of that extreme, you are in danger of the &quot;gifted underachiever&quot; basement dweller syndrome extreme, where 15 years go by in a flash and you are just a 45 year old anime watching loser on the dole. <br><br>Find objective things to do NOW. Also start treating yourself like an addict. What do we do with addicts? We treat them like objects, not subjects. You don&#039;t sit there for ten hours convincing an addict not to touch the drugs on the table. You take the drugs off the table and lock the door. Start imposing hard restrictions on yourself. This is a very common problem of terminally online &quot;underachievers,&quot; they only ever see themselves as an abstract subject abstractly subjectively regarding themselves, from the comfort of the basement. They never experience the fun of obstacles, of looking back in hindsight at obstacles overcome. They never grow and see themselves in concreto, they remain a seed forever, with infinite virtual possibilities but no actuality.", "time": 1671831513, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21424918, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)16:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424902</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeff</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opposite of hep; unhip, uncool or opposed to hipness.</span><br><br>rude", "time": 1671831695, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21425031, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)17:07:59", "name": "the xi jinping of weed smoking", "com": "I&#039;ve been building a tower for years and it will collapse someday.

I looked in an amateur astronomy book and discovered that this was the Cassiopeia open star cluster. I also read that people use it as a vision test, and that people with good vision can resolve individual stars. I realized that I was near-sighted, informed my father, and saw an optometrist, who gave me glasses. All of a sudden my world popped out in super-HD. I looked up at the night sky and saw a field of brilliant, glistening diamonds. I read the book further, and began to learn more about the universe, and the constellations. I asked for a small telescope for Christmas, and got one. I began to pour through amateur astronomy books and magazines, observing every change I could get, my curiosity endlessly inspired. I constructed a larger 10&quot; Dobsonian telescope, which revealed more of the universe&#039;s grandeur. One night when I was staring at the night sky everything I had learned and experienced came together in a gestalt. The galaxy was no longer &quot;there,&quot; but here, all around, the galaxy popped out in three dimensions and I had the perception of being on a sphere in space. This experience was so moving that it brought me to tears. When I was 16 I took classes in amateur astronomy at the local community college, and did so well that I got student of the year award.<br><br>Meanwhile I was completely failing in school, and had to make up work during the summers. The teachers were horrible, and my peers were completely caught up in hedonistic pursuits and monkey-ass social status games. I had found the REAL shit, and nobody else seemed to care or be interested in anything similar (I lived in a backwards conservative county that was a cultural wasteland of mini-malls and churches.) I grew ever more alienated from the dumb-ass world around me.<br><br>Eventually I had to take a high-school equivalency test, passed, and began to attend the community college full-time. My first semester I took a philosophy course with the most outstanding teacher I ever have had: Johnny Terry. This man lived to teach and inspire curiosity. He was flamingly gay in every sense of the word. His animation and passion was infectious, he argued the philosophical position in question so well that it was impossible to tell what he actually believed. This man was infected by the REAL shit! He expanded my narrow interest in astronomy to a general love of knowledge and creative experience. I became absorbed and fascinated by my other classes, I did lots of outside reading in the subjects I studied, I experimented with electronic music and art. It was a personal Renaissance.

Later I realized that this was because he was using again, and wanted me out to control my mother. So I said fuck it, used some of my modest trust-fund money from a sewage disaster settlement when I was younger, and went on a 1000-mile solo bicycle tour up the coast of California. This was epic self-initiation into adulthood; I was living the REAL shit! When this was over, I went to live with my father, and began to re-attend classes.<br><br>Except no, oh no. The more I learned the more my social perception grew. This was the time of 9/11, George Bush, and the Oil Wars. The prison of dumb-assery I thought I had escaped from was omnipresent in the highest levels of social organization. I saw absolutely no significant movement to counteract this. Democrats? LOL. I began to feel more and more hopeless, until it crashed upon me in suicidal depression. I stopped going to class, and resolved to end myself.

It no longer produces anything of value. No meaningful discourse or discussion can occur there. Board culture has stagnated and in many ways de-evolved. It has become exactly the kind of vapid, retarded, schizophrenic wankery that the site once derided. Internet culture and more specifically chan culture is a reflection of the people using the site and society in general at the time. It&#039;s just a mirror. It reflects whatever you show it back at you. Early 4chan was a synthesis of an extremely specific set of factors at a specific point in time that will probably never coalesce again. A shitty economy, a general malaise of apathy among the youth, anime and gamer culture being obscure and ostracized, &quot;The internet&quot; having a barrier to entry, how fucked up and unmoderated the early internet was etc. Chances were, if you used the internet back then you had seen some shit. But anyway, people like to congregate with other people that have the same interests as they do. Where do you hang out if you&#039;re some loser living in a shit town with few or no friends and you spend your time playing Warcraft 3 custom games and watching Ego Proxy or whatever? you find the other social outcasts online because people in real life who have the same hobbies as you don&#039;t exist. The point being that there is an extremely specific kind of person who would waste the best years of their life on an anime website where there&#039;s a 9 out of 10 chance on any given day that you&#039;re going to see a picture of someone cutting their own dick off. These people congregate together and a baseline of culture forms from their mutual interests, experiences and attitudes. The culture evolves over time as knowledge about the site spreads through word of mouth, or people discover the site after raids or fox news specials or whatever. Site culture gradually shifts as the demographics of the user base change. At the same time popular culture shifts as more people of all ages gain access to the internet, media corporations begin to target a wider demographic of casual consumers rather than a niche of hardcore fans. Subcultures are exploited by corporations and integrated into popular culture. Someone emails their friend a funny cat picture not realising where it came from, or that the person who made it probably also jacks off to lolicon tentacle rape doujuns.

Upvotes, retweets, reacts, shares etc. On 4chan the success of a thread is measured by the number of replies it receives. Because of the ephemeral nature of imageboards, users do not have any way to accumulate a representation of authority or post quality. Inversely there&#039;s very little repurcussion for being banned because there&#039;s no account to lose. These dynamics incentivize the poster to create a thread/post that will generate as many replies as possible. In theory, this will produce good content. Interesting posts will attract replies while retarded faggotory will attract sages, moderators or nothing at all. People will of course game this system for one reason or another. Clickbait is prevalent on YouTube because people can make money from it. Posting pictures of your cat on fifteen different subreddits to farm karma works because Reddit rewards banal, kitsch, inoffensive content. Posting bait to 4chan works because the user base is fucking retarded. People who get their kicks by pretending to be fools will soon find themselves surrounded by fools who think they are in good company. 4chan had a reputation for being le sekrit hacker club, so they naturally attracted every edgy 14 year old who could figure out how to download LoIC. Once external raids and harassment campaigns were cracked down on by the mods the user base seemed to turn inwards and begin eating itself. This came to a head in the post election years as more and more boards were saturated with low quality content. Why should anyone bother creating OC or contributing to a discussion if it will be immediately derailed or drowned out by the same repetitive bait or incomprehensible schizophrenic rambling?", "time": 1671865050, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21426733, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:58:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21426730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21426730</a><br><br>For a long time 4chan had purpose.

Anons went from sincerely enjoying things, to ironically liking things and then pure hatred. Except not, it became the default to be a contrarian asshole except when you were only pretending, and actually everyone else was retarded for not seeing that you were fucking with them the whole time. It&#039;s faster to call everyone a cuck onions drinker and move on than it is trying to decipher the 9000 layers of meta comedy and half winking irony that everything was covered in.

This has accelerated the drop in post quality to the point where bot posts are indistinguishable from human posters. At which point, why even bother posting at all. There was a time that anons were comrades in misery. You didn&#039;t end up on 4chan because you were successful or had your life together. You were more than likely an outsider, a loser, fucked up in one way or another. Unmotivated. Devoid of purpose or meaning - flotsam of the modern world - just drifting. But that thread, that shared understanding, connected you to other anons in a way that it didn&#039;t with normal people. There was shit like The Well-Cultured Anonymous, an earnest effort by anons to help other anons unfuck themselves. Anons encouraged other anons to find purpose and meaning in their lives. Years ago I tried to give anons help and advice the same way that other anons had helped me. I had hoped that they would, in turn, carry it forward and help the next generation of &quot;weird kids&quot; to better themselves. I no longer feel this way. The anger that anons feel doesn&#039;t dissipate or drive them. Rather it feels like it&#039;s compounding. Their rage is directed back in on itself and becomes magnified. They no longer seem to want to escape from their misery, or even try. The ones that do are crucified as &quot;normies&quot; or &quot;chads&quot;. Now they are like crabs in a bucket. If one tries to escape the others drag him back down. Assuming that the original wave of 4chan posters were somewhere between 15 to 25 years old then most would be somewhere in their late 30s if not 40s by now. By the same metric most anons from the &quot;golden age&quot; of 4chan (00s up to the early 10s) would now be in their late 20s. I wonder what became of them all. I wonder how many anons never made it. That one kid with the rainbow face mask who ate a shotgun in front of a blue tarpaulin. Lowtax went out the same way. Or the anon who set himself on fire in his dorm. Zyzz died of a heart attack. All the an hero threads, some of them had to have gone through with it, or were lost to drugs or alcohol or their own demons somewhere along the way. Inversely how many made it and did something with their lives? How many bought a home? got married or had children? Mandalore, SSeth, ExaminedLifeOfGaming/Hoplopfheil and shoe0nhead are confirmed former channers, as are ContraPoints and Shaun. Those are all the ones off the top of my head, but there are definitely others. Moot keeps a low profile these days and seems to be doing well.

Go to any board, and there&#039;s a ton of threads about TFW NO GF and it&#039;s like, fuck, at this point, just merge every board into one - call it /pussy/ - and just let anons wax and wane over how they can&#039;t get a waifu, bros, and how &#039;over&#039; it all is. It&#039;s just sad. This site used to be all about bonding as a community, over interests you weren&#039;t too likely to find talked about in real life, but now it&#039;s all just a glorified hugbox for dopey faggots who can&#039;t get over themselves and think that the entire world needs to hear about how they can&#039;t get their dick wet. What does any of this have to do with literature? Trust me, getting pussy isn&#039;t the savior some of y&#039;all seem to think it is. You&#039;re still going to be empty inside....and then you&#039;ll whine about that, too, as if we&#039;re supposed to give a fuck, and you&#039;ll clutter this site with threads about it, and if you dare tell &#039;em off, they&#039;ll call you every slur under the sun because, like the average Redditor, they need those internet asspats. 4chan is just an edgier Reddit at this point, really. Nothing separates the two save the former&#039;s liberal use of gamer words. I&#039;m reminded of picrel. What a shame. The internet used to be something cool.

Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them.

Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his \u201cprophetic works\u201d were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form &quot;what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language&quot;. His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him &quot;far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced&quot;. In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC&#039;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as &quot;the body of God&quot; or &quot;human existence itself&quot;.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as &quot;Pre-Romantic&quot;. In fact, he has been said to be &quot;a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism&quot;. A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions. Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake&#039;s work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a &quot;glorious luminary&quot;, and &quot;a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors&quot;.</span>", "filename": "William Blake", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1023, "h": 703, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1671877066949523, "time": 1671877066, "md5": "VFBerT3MvfTMY5zdWGMuzg==", "fsize": 131438, "resto": 21427185}, {"no": 21427240, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:40:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Funny Blake quote I came across on wiki<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There have been claims by people in the past, like William Blake, to have seen fairy funerals.

Now nobody reads Montherlant, and his would-be reactionary fans read C\u00e9line! But after the war it all fell apart and he became a dirty name in France. Only the fascists and weirdos wanted anything to do with him (not a bad thing of course!). The \u201crehabilitation\u201d of a writer is different in France, as the idea of greatness still exists there, unlike in the US of A. By the 60s, just after he had died and successfully passed off his novels as stylistic exercises, all the big names began to praise him as a genius. You have that idiot Philippe Sollers, who will defend C\u00e9line\u2019s reputation to the end, \u201cour Joyce\u201d or something to that effect\u2026 now yes, he is everywhere, from Israel to Timbuktu to Singapore everyone thinks they\u2019re a little C\u00e9line. You go to a bookshop in Paris and there are fresh editions of C\u00e9line full of comic book illustrations, C\u00e9line-themed dildos, C\u00e9linien mechanical keyboards that\u2019ll glow beneath your tranny cat ears as you play the C\u00e9line Simulator 1936, the latest in antisemitic writing games\u2026 a circus, and the only way out of it is to read between his lines.<br><br>I will say the one place C\u00e9line is thankfully neglected is the USA. I recently read that stupid bitch Alice Kaplan talk about how she can barely read him anymore, that she only likes how he exposed colonialism in Africa, that he is too much. Good! Good riddance! Americans, with the exception amusingly enough of Bukowski, never really understood C\u00e9line for what he was. The same goes for Proust, who is probably the writer who is, spiritually, the closest to what C\u00e9line was saying", "time": 1671844841, "resto": 21423897}, {"no": 21425780, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:27:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21423897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21423897</a><br>Why didn&#039;t you vote for him in the poll, bros?", "time": 1671845239, "resto": 21423897}, {"no": 21425794, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:31:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21425757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21425757</a><br>Not that anon, but what do you think it was that made him &quot;rehabilitation-compatible&quot;?

He is part of the old European tradition of literature, one that dates back to Rabelais in France (and even earlier if we look at the medieval chroniclers he read late in life)... but he is distinctively apart from the classical, mannerly, pretty writers that were in vogue in the early 1900s. As such a lot of modern artists, like Dubuffet, and leftish types, like Sartre and Debord, came to love his spirit, whereas I do not think Brasillach&#039;s writing really lends itself to such a thing. Brasillach is not as good as Celine... that is one thing you have to understand. Celine is at the level of Dante in terms of what he can evoke with words, how it flows, the drama he can build in a single sentence, the severity of his statements. So naturally it would have been hard to ignore him, even without the non-fascists who came to like him. Celine was not a fascist himself, but that is another story...<br><br>France, as I&#039;ve said, has a reverence for greatness in a way that is unheard of in America and I assume the UK. To a Frenchman, literature is number one, and you can get away with a great deal of things as a writer... countless French writers were pederasts who went to Algeria to have their way with the local boys, but their names adorn the streets of Paris. Yet Americans won&#039;t read Lolita simply because it is ABOUT something they find disturbing. So in general, one has to do a lot to really lose out on immortality if one is a great writer in French. <br><br>Rebatet is an interesting case. I am not French (though I have lived there) nor am I that familiar with all the details of his life/work. I imagine it has something to do with his novel being published AFTER the war, whereas we can all make the excuse that Voyage came &quot;before Celine lost his mind&quot; as the imbeciles love to say.", "time": 1671846493, "resto": 21423897}, {"no": 21425961, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)21:13:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424683</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his books have no sense of structure</span><br>Absolutely filtered lmao<br>C\u00e9line&#039;s books are extremely structured lol.", "time": 1671847988, "resto": 21423897}, {"no": 21426079, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)21:56:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Incelines seething ITT that Inceline couldn&#039;t make the top 100 this year.

The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil.

They were mainly tools like saw machines and drills or conveniences such as lights and fans.</span><br>Pacing bro pacing. You&#039;re just listing exposition after exposition.

During the times when she would be briefly cognizant, it was often while one of her sons had their cock jammed in her head. With extensive decomposition, her hearing went first. Then, her sense of smell and taste. Her eyesight had been gradually getting worse for years anyway but disappeared completely when Jon transformed her head into a masturbatory aid by removing her eyeballs. Jon made the spontaneous decision that, after killing her, he wanted to skull-fuck her before she got cold. Spencer begged for a go as well, since up to that point in time, he had no experience of fucking anything warm unless it had been blasted in the microwave first. Jon agreed, and they double-penetrated her face until she cried rivulets of spunk.\u201d", "filename": "1528C22E-C5A1-40E8-A95F-6A3CEA2D127F", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 973, "h": 1529, "tn_w": 159, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671792518769118, "time": 1671792518, "md5": "AMxJJwHAkt+0p937UUzvtw==", "fsize": 339422, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "read-this", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 19, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 11}, {"no": 21422540, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)05:52:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422529</a><br>meh", "time": 1671792731, "resto": 21422529}, {"no": 21422649, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)06:28:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422529</a><br>No", "time": 1671794896, "resto": 21422529}, {"no": 21423247, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:03:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422529</a><br>What urged a man to write something so ugly and vile. sage and fuck you.", "time": 1671807794, "resto": 21422529}, {"no": 21423253, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:05:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21423247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21423247</a><br>Just because it makes you feel a stirring in your loins that you don\u2019t want to acknowledge doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a big old meanie bobeanie", "time": 1671807926, "resto": 21422529}, {"no": 21423297, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)10:22:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422529</a><br>What a coincidence.

The second thing is that he generally devoted only about a week and a half to writing a novel, a practice that, again, was good for his bank account and bad for his reputation. Finally\u2014and this is a matter that Simenon discussed enthusiastically with journalists\u2014he spent a great deal of his life having sex.

We only rely on Catcher in the Rye for our evidence, rather than going to the fact that he wrote a bunch of other pedophile short stories.<br>2) &quot;External material,&quot; such as the nature of talking therapy in the 1940s, or how medical history taking in psychiatry works: they make you repeat the lot from the beginning. Note that this violates 1) except:<br>3) Hypertextual analysis. We know from the text itself that Holden is imprisoned (Maybe I can get out and see DB) in the hospital. This means we can infer that the structure of hospitals as per the late 1940s in a rich persons psychiatric hospital hold. As we can from the fact that its talking therapy.<br><br>If Holden is being treated with talking therapy they&#039;ll make him repeat his history time after time to try to get him to &quot;slip&quot; or &quot;crack&quot; new findings when he stop telling the psychiatrists the lies he tells to himself. &quot;But if you really want to know it\u2026&quot;<br><br>He has kept being raped by his father, and raping his sister in turn to himself: he has repressed the first (if not actively concealing it), and is actively repressing the second. The &quot;ellision&quot; or &quot;gap&quot; or &quot;deletion&quot; between the two Phoebe in New York chapters is such a gap.<br><br>Similarly with his school chum&#039;s suicide being way too short given the effects. Or him glossing over his childhood friend who was raped by her step dad &quot;giving the time&quot; to his alpha school buddy.<br><br>He&#039;ll skip talking about the child hood abuse because both of his parents would have heart attacks if he talked about it, especially his Dad who is especially touchy.<br><br>See how the colour of words contains multiple meanings? Holden&#039;s subconscious chooses a &quot;colourful&quot; word instead of a &quot;plain&quot; word. If his parents were &quot;nervous&quot; or &quot;private&quot; instead of &quot;touchy&quot; it would give a different colour.<br><br>Holden is being medically treated by talking over his incident in an asylum. Holden is resisting treatment (maybe I&#039;ll get out next year?). Holden is failing to admit what has happened: he is resisting his treatment. Therefore Holden is a hostile narrator and his narrative will conceal facts which the character Holden wants to conceal. Like being raped or being a rapist. Or being an utter failure at school. Or leaving the phallic sticks on the subway. Or being unable to get it up with a prostitute. Holden wishes he was a &quot;deaf mute&quot; and neither talking nor speaking: he doesn&#039;t want to tell us anything, but he&#039;s being made to repeat his story ad nauseam.", "time": 1671883629, "resto": 21426708}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21426635, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:30:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Former President Barack Obama stuck to an annual tradition Friday, releasing a list of his favorites for the year of 2022, including movies and books.<br><br>\u201cI always look forward to sharing my lists of favorite books, movies, and music with all of you,\u201d Obama tweeted. \u201cFirst up, here are some of the books I read and enjoyed this year.

It&#039;s filtering me out, and I&#039;m wondering if I should continue. <br><br>Some little background. I&#039;m a big Bram Stoker fan. I read Dracula when I was a teenager a decade and a half ago. I haven&#039;t read it since, but it clear in my mind at 38. Last year, I read two other of his horror novels, &quot;Th Jewel of the Seven Stars&quot; and the infamous &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; the latter probably for the wrong reasons. Then I read two of his short story collections, &quot;Dracula&#039;s Guest and Other Weird Stories&quot; which I genuinely enjoyed, and had three extra stories attached to the Barnes and Noble leather-bound collection that weren&#039;t in the original. Then I read &quot;Under the Sunset&quot; which was meant for little kids, but was very violent and too haunting. I liked all these books. I tried to read &quot;The Primrose Path,&quot; another novel of his, his first, but didn&#039;t get through it because it was too amateur and didactic. <br><br>This is labeled as a Short Story Collection, just like Dracula&#039;s Guest and Under the Sunset, but it&#039;s not exactly. There is a frame story, but all the stories are told by characters in the frame story, in the first person, from their view. It&#039;s like calling &quot;Rashomon&quot; a short story collection, because characters are telling stories from their view point in it. <br><br>The first story isn&#039;t bad or great. It&#039;s just Stoker talking about how he bought a snake when he was a manager of a theater company that traveled by train and everyone wanted pets, so he bought a giant snake to scare everyone from buying pets themselves. After that, it gets fucking hard to read. It starts out as light reading, but then things are written in Scottish, Yorkshire, and Cockney accents with Stoker&#039;s own unique invented orthography to display that. It&#039;s not like Dicken&#039;s Cockney, it&#039;s totally hard to read and has no fucking seeming order to it that one can pick up. Also, some of those stories, in dialects, lead into other stories told by other people, and things in those stories refer to things in the previous stories. I&#039;m a quarter of a way through, and I have no idea what&#039;s going on anymore. I picked this book up as light bed time reading, and it doesn&#039;t seem to be narratively complex, just in writing.

Trained to be in four year college. Despite all the ineptitudes the current university system in America, I still have spent many, many hours reading, writing, and walking around in jobless thought about the world and people. I have many ideas to write down, many of which I think are close to genius. I am not a genius but if you walk around in a daze for long enough, you might just happen to strike some linguistic gold. This is to say, my novels are philosophical and conceptual more than aesthetic and emotive storytelling. Although my vocabulary has suffered from my screen induced ADHD, which has led me to neglecting my reading, I&#039;m still more than capable of explaining very complicated and laborious concepts with my current vocabulary. A lot of brilliant writers of the past with wonderful minds have had a ton of technical words or extremely poetic words. These words, while neat and beautiful if one appreciates prose for the sake of prose, are not so important for the ability for the devote writer to make observations about their culture. Maybe our words are less worth a question in jeopardy, but still my words work for me fine. <br><br>&quot;Attach a file of an anime girlie to get these people to read your message&quot; - my roommate who reads the drivel from other boards", "filename": "1652830845002", "ext": ".png", "w": 333, "h": 480, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671786412816700, "time": 1671786412, "md5": "k3Ctjsc+Pap86Cw2hU6D+Q==", "fsize": 104419, "resto": 21415720}, {"no": 21422258, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:08:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21417237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21417237</a><br>Gimme some reccs anon", "time": 1671786511, "resto": 21415720}, {"no": 21422291, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:19:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415720</a><br>Dunno.

These past few generstions are different, and I&#039;m going to lay out why these changes cannot be explained away so easily. For one, we are experiencing a revolution which is similar to the inventions of written languages and the printing press with the outgrowth of this distributed network we call the internet. This is going to change how we view the world on a metaphysical level. For instance, I personally don&#039;t even see myself as an individual in a Cartesian sense. There is no stable subjectivity, which is fully distinct from the world around it. To put it in more schizo terms, its like I am a temporary grounding point where millions of minute electrical signals compose flows that are redirected through this point in every which way. Identity for me consists of something entirely different than identity for previous generations. It&#039;s more amorphous, and detached. You could say that this is just my personal mental illness or something, but there&#039;s also been an explosion in mental health issues the past few decades among the entire population - and especially the younger you get. This notion of, &quot;oh, it&#039;s just a phase, every generation complains about the next generation!&quot; is reddit tier melodrama that is analogous to putting your head in the sand. No, you can quite clearly see that there is nothing normal about my generation. Even if society would like to think it is business as usual, it just isn&#039;t true. There was no end of history. The prior generations have this weird conservatism where they genuinely believe in this clap trap. Peak oil alone should demonstrate to you the poverty of this facile conservatism, where you just explain away intergenerational differences.

You know, in that moment, that you no longer are the one who attends, but she. There is a reversal between the lover and the beloved. The lover becomes the beloved, and the beloved is now the lover who turns out to be indifferent. Their youth and vivacity affords them a certain discriminatory quality to their gaze\u2014they see through you now. It does not matter who you are\u2014you are seen fully. If you are a complete loser, you are seen for who you are. Yet, if you are the well-to-do putting off an aura, that too is controverted. The feminine gaze subverts the symbolic order of interpersonal relationships\u2014the rules of old are out, since the women, in their unreason, have seen through it. Indeed, the subversion of the very project of the Enlightenment, whose seeds are in fact within the Enlightenment itself, culminates in this feminine gaze\u2014it is unreason born of reason that subverts reason itself as such.

Perhaps it is possible that for many people, without God, nothing is permitted; whereas you retain a sort of supranatural freedom when you believe in the transcendental which might push you beyond basic ethical concerns. Though, I think most &quot;atheists&quot; are implicitly theological - in the worst sense - insofar as they naively take positivism and physicalism for granted. The irony of most &quot;secular humanists&quot; is that they insist on maintaining a rational regime with no actual law giver or base, and so it becomes very muddied and confusing. If you question it at all, it completely crumbles. Not to say you should be religious; I personally am an atheist.

This means: 1) insofar as the city operates according to opinion and may endanger philosophers, and 2) insofar as philosophy, by inquiring into opinions, may endanger civic life.

Sounds like he was a drama magnet who neither forgave nor forgot even the slightest details. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SG: Do you think Strauss would have been comfortable with individuals referring to themselves as Straussian, and there being a school identified as Straussian that traces back to him? Do you think that he would have been comfortable with that, or pleased, or resigned?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: Probably not. Something else I\u2019ve written which is an unpublished manuscript. In 1996, it was, Charles Kesler had a conference here on the American regime. I wrote a piece, it was about a hundred pages. I called it the \u201cDecline and Fall of the American Idea.\u201d And among those who had put on the wrong side of the fence were the Straussians who interpreted the founding as a Hobbesean document masqueraded by Locke, and they all took their stand, by the way, from Strauss\u2019s chapter on Locke in Natural Right and History, the chapter which is hard to explain because it makes Locke the opponent of everything that we identified as good Americanism based on the Declaration of Independence, based in turn on Locke. And my reply to that criticism is that in Natural Right and History Strauss offers us an interpretation of Locke, not of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson\u201455</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SG: So. Strauss would not have been pleased there were a group called Straussian?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: I know what I was going to tell you: that near the end of this little piece of mine, I had read a review by Harvey Mansfield, Jr. He used to call himself Junior. I don\u2019t know why he took the Junior off, because his father was a published author and you can\u2019t tell which is which. But for some reason or the other he dedicated one of his books to his father too. He was personally attached, but in other respects detached. Anyway, Harvey is an interesting case study of Straussianism, and he is a very clever guy and a very shrewd writer, and he can be both obscure and clear depending upon what he wants to be. Anyway, he was reviewing this book edited by the famous writer on the American founding at Harvard. Anyway, it was a collection of the documents dealing with the ratification of the Constitution between 1787-1789. About two thousand pages of documents, and Harvey began by praising the book and saying what a wonderful level of discourse that it was, and too bad we don\u2019t have anything like that today. He didn\u2019t give any real account of what was in the substance of the book. </span><br>(1/?)", "time": 1671663063, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415731, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415599</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: But then he went on to\u2014I don\u2019t know how he got on to the subject of the Declaration, but he spoke about the self-evident half-truth of the Declaration of Independence, which means no truth. It\u2019s not a half-truth, but it\u2019s still a truth. Worse than that, in the literature on the Declaration, the other people who rejected the Declaration, like Calhoun, rejected it because of the idea of racial equality, and Harvey certainly did not have any reservation as to the rights of Negroes; but that\u2019s what he said about hat. Anyway, [he] then went on to give pure eastern Straussian interpretation: Locke is just a\u2014only Hobbes with a veil over him. Which means that\u2014Walter Berns has also said that the beginning of the Declaration and the end contradict each other because the beginning is really Hobbes, and that means that there\u2019s no nobility in the idea of courage. And Harvey then later went on to write a whole book on manliness. Of course, the word manliness is only a translation of the word virtue. So anyway, I took the strongest possible exception. And then, later on when the conference\u2014Harvey Jr. made a terrible, terrible personal attack on me before the audience, you see, without any explanation as to why. Just that the chap attacked everybody and he finally got around to me. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, since then I\u2019ve written three open letters and I have a manuscript of a book with over two or three pages devoted to this dispute. I haven\u2019t decided yet if I want to publish it or not. But the most important feature of it is the discussion by Strauss and the reply to Koj\u00e8ve of the classic idea of friendship, [in] which Strauss describes how the philosophers have to have friends because they can\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about unless they have something reflecting back to them. And so philosophic friends begin, in effect, to form a kind of club or class by themselves. But when the association of philosophers turns into\u2014it becomes dogmatic and they just attack everybody outside and have internal dissonances. The Communist Party is a perfect example of what began as a philosophic friendship turned into a political party. So that whole process, there is about a page in which Strauss talks about\u2014this is the only place that I know that he really describes the meaning of friendship in the highest sense, when he says that the philosopher, when he finds himself now inside of a sect, has got to leave the sect and has got to return to the marketplace. This is a political action. A political action, according to Strauss, is the foundation of the integrity of the classical idea of friendship, which I think is a complete vindication of everything that I\u2019ve ever done. </span><br>(2/?)", "time": 1671664920, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415750, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:28:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415731</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And well, Harvey\u2014you see, Harvey\u2019s father was my teacher at Yale. I think I told you that. And when I went to Columbus in the fall of 1951, Harvey I think was still a student at Harvard. But we got to know each other and he used to come to my office and we had long discussions. He was defending Talcott Parsons, his Harvard professor, against Strauss and it was very unequal conflict. I most often said that Harvey\u2019s conversion was\u2014hard conversions make good principles. And later on, Harvey was teaching at Berkeley when Strauss was at Stanford, at the Behavioral Sciences Institute, and Strauss always had a weekly seminar. I don\u2019t think he could live without his seminar. It was like whiskey to an alcoholic. [Laughs] And I remember Harvey used to go over once a week from Berkeley to the seminar and he wrote me a letter in which he said that sitting across the table from Strauss he discovered for the first time what it meant to admire greatness from a distance, which was a beautiful phrase and Harvey\u2019s capable of that. Well, he\u2019s made several visits here since that episode and he always came over here and visited with my wife, which I really appreciated. [HJ shows SG photos of his wife.]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyway, Harvey wrote me a beautiful letter after she died and I believe it was an attempt to mend the fences that were broken down because of that eruption. It was a very unfair . . . of him . . . It was a completely non-intellectual attack on me just because I was wrong because I attacked my friends. But what is the basis for friendship, then? I mean, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, there\u2019s one book on justice and two books on friendship. So anyway, I\u2019ve got a lot of other things to get. I don\u2019t know whether\u2014but it\u2019s easy to see from that eruption on the floor of the conference, which was paralleled later on by the eruption of Tom Pangle telling me before 200 people that he had to pull rank on me. Twenty years my junior, he pulls rank on me. That Strauss confided in him. By the way, at that same banquet, Pangle went on\u2014and this also reveals a great deal about eastern Straussiansm\u2014that Socrates encouraged young men to become homosexuals as a way of\u2014and this is the phrase he used\u2014softening their souls for philosophy. And he gave a reference to the Memorabilia. The minute I got home, I dug out the Memorabilia. There was no such reference there. In that same introduction\u2014but Joe . . . real philosophers. They patronize the morality because it protected them. But at the same time, they went on to enjoy the \u201cquote the pleasures that were naturally sweet.\u201d So they all\u2014anyway, I don\u2019t know that Strauss ever\u2014. Of course this was in a post-mortem publication.

He&#039;s miles apart from somebody like, let&#039;s say Mortimer Adler, somebody of similar background (Jewish, Aristotle-Aquinas scholar, conservative, loves the Great Books, etc.) yet was far more open about his conversion to Catholicism than whatever Harry Jaffa professes. <br><br>Anyway, given my prejudices, I can&#039;t help but think that both Jaffa and ECs like Mansfield are horrifically misguided either way, as much as I want to sympathize with them.

Nevertheless, Christianity has everywhere introduced the negation of what it affirms. In the last resort it cannot reject this God whose name is not to be uttered, who cannot be assimilated to other gods or to human values, who is thus a permanent factor that can be neither reduced nor erased. This is the extraneous dimension that cannot be utilized, so that even in the cleverest reconstructions it is an incomprehensible factor that immediately calls all else into question. Thus transcendence is on the one hand a removal of God from the world, a reduction of the latter to its mere reality with no purpose, no signification, no third dimension. It is also on the other hand the relativization of everything in this world, and ultimately its total devaluation. It leaves us literally alone and defenseless. We had invented the sacred. We had sacralized things in order to protect ourselves and give ourselves meaning. But Christianity with the absoluteness of its revelation destroyed the sacred and put nothing in its place. Only those who have faith can live. As for the rest\u2026 Similarly, Christianity destroyed the religions that enabled people to live with the moral and psychological courage that they give, and it put nothing in their place, for it is not a religion. It does not meet our religious needs. In its essence and truth it contradicts them. Christianity claims not to be a religion that is superior to others, but to be an anti-religion that refutes all the religions that link us with a divine universe. No doubt Christianity constantly becomes a religion, but for religion as for syntheses of values it carries with it an irreducible criticism. The Christian religion itself is constantly called into question by the absolute that is revealed in Jesus Christ. And we are thus left to ourselves, poorer and more naked than when we lived in our religious universe.</span>", "filename": "ellulsnap", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671756750622290, "time": 1671756750, "md5": "EVA8tjrCG7Doi+mrcQ6LdA==", "fsize": 99652, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420677, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)19:55:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420663</a><br>Where is this from?", "time": 1671756906, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420703, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:00:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420162</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just follow the (revealed) law.</span><br>How about instead of that I spend hundreds of years finding loopholes in it so I can say I technically follow it while doing my best to disregard the spirit of it?", "time": 1671757227, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420728, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:04:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419895</a><br>What makes you think this place even reads?", "time": 1671757499, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420761, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)20:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21419375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21419375</a><br>He&#039;s an anarchist, don&#039;t expect there to be any structure or coherency.", "time": 1671757890, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420958, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:09:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420677</a><br>Subversion of Christianity, on nihilism.", "filename": "619pffPaDXL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 880, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671761350264207, "time": 1671761350, "md5": "JLPvItQXKg9cuMiQ7KFB+w==", "fsize": 90326, "resto": 21419375}, {"no": 21420978, "now": "12/22/22(Thu)21:14:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21420958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21420958</a><br>Ellul makes it impossible to be a Christian.

According to Jewish oral law, the type of carrying that G-d prohibited on the Sabbath is actually very specific. The cases where it&#039;s relevant are limited. At some point, though, there was a Rabbinic enactment made to expand the range of the prohibition, lest people come to violate the more serious one, and also to lend an increased sanctity to the Sabbath. The enactment itself allowed for the Eruv, otherwise life would be very difficult. The different types of Eruvin essentially all serve as reminders.<br>The case of the Rabbis arguing with G-d is actually not so dramatic in context, but either way, it&#039;s a favorite plaything of Jewish philosophers precisely because it seems so absurd.

The abruptness and simplicity of the language is indeed an aesthetical tool to bring this about. However I believe you are wrong in the sense that the specific degree of apathy displayed by Merseault isn&#039;t itself indicative of the Absurd itself, but rather of his own response (in fact, the general outlook of his existence) toward the Absurd. You are mistaking the flow of the story for the &quot;feeling&quot; created specifically by the narration being that of the main character. You have to separate his autism being the story&#039;s subject matter from the genre&#039;s technicalities, and not only to properly evaluate the oeuvre itself, but also to understand the philosophical content of the book. If all Camus said about the Absurd was that life was meaningless and you can get crushed by a soulless bureaucracy because you shot some Algerian while fully within your rights, the bot threads you see spammed on this board all the time would be right about calling him a brainlet. My understanding of him is that his philosophy was much more nuanced than this 18 years old angsty shit, the Absurd was not an ontological fact for him like it was for Sartre. It isn&#039;t so much the rather idiotic position that all of existence and life is meaningless but that rather moments of existence and life fail to satisfy a natural sense of human dignity we have, and that those moments can open us up to the final indignity, death, and what is specifically insulting to us about death, being that we are left to speculate to what is beyond without any answers from the Universe (the term &quot;answer&quot; is important here, we have solutions, ideas of what happen, even a Revelation, but to Camus, even a Revelation seems unsatisfying unless it is revealed to us directly). There is a positively Catholic interpretation of Camus by Emmanuel Mounier which is one of the most beautiful and profound text written in the last 100 years, and no one ever talks about it. <br>Merseault get in the position he is because parts of existence are indeed meaningless and absurd and chaotic (Algerians).

It isn\u2019t efficient and graceful writing but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t good or enjoyable.

Secondly, he rejects the almost-universally held belief in the eventual enlightenment of all sentient beings, because he needs there to be a bottom-of-the-barrel worthless subhuman vermin caste for higher castes to abuse for fun. Although the belief in icckantikas (a person that has committed crimes so heinous that they are never going to be reborn in a realm where they can achieve enlightenment) is basically unheard of now, it&#039;s still contradicted by Evola&#039;s rejection of karma, because an icchantika is (technically) a being in a ream other than ours and as such you could never meet one anyways (the term is occasionally used more loosely to just mean &quot;non-believer&quot;, however). This is the third point, in that he believes that rebirth is due to the soul&#039;s in-built condition rather than actions in the past (the Buddha repeatedly states that it&#039;s the opposite). This, also, is because he wants there to be a spiritually lesser slave caste for the upper castes to bully for no reason but shits and giggles.<br><br>There&#039;s an irony here as despite his views aligning much more closely with Mahayana thought (icchantika&#039;s are a Mahayana thing, the Theravada have ALWAYS rejected the idea of them), he completely rejects the Mahayana as a Satanic Inversion of Tradition (though not as heinous as Christianity) in favor of the Theravada.", "filename": "buddha2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 564, "h": 743, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671843984575269, "time": 1671843984, "md5": "pqNLGlFNaQ+2K3TnTRzZdQ==", "fsize": 120903, "resto": 21420330}, {"no": 21425719, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)20:09:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u05e0\u05d0\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4\u05e8", "time": 1671844145, "resto": 21420330}, {"no": 21425993, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)21:20:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "If you liked Hermetic Tradition, Taoist internal alchemy is so based.

Many Muslims\u2014and Orientalists\u2014will tell you otherwise, of course, but the fact is that a fifth of the Koranic text is just incomprehensible.

It&#039;s a 2,000 year old spat between two competing sects of Judaism: one believed that Jews are special unique race that deserves to continue to exist separate from other races (by ruling over them), and the other believed that everyone needed to mix together into one mulatto blob. The founders of the latter eventually got replaced by the gentiles who outnumbered them. Every single piece of Christian theology is an attack on the Jewish religion, by definition. As anons in this thread have said, Christians hold it as a central tenet of their religion that the Jews are special, superior, and NEED to be converted to Christianity to lead the global unified Christendom (ironically proving Bloom&#039;s theory right). That&#039;s literally the point of &quot;Jesus is the Jewish Messiah as foretold in the Jewish holy texts&quot;, that&#039;s WHY Jesus went around doing what he did. When Jesus said that everyone needs to unify, speak one language, miscegenate into one race, and practice one culture, he was directly attacking ~600 years of Jewish ethnic particularism, so even though all of the anti-racist multicultural working class tradlarpers in this thread are trying (and failing) to use Christianity as a way to sneak in racial anti-Semitism, Jesus himself is even more radical by directly stripping away the Jews&#039; ability to maintain an ingroup cohesion (granted he also takes away every OTHER race&#039;s ability to maintain ingroup cohesion).<br><br>If getting Jews to love Jesus is so important, the best thing to that you could do would be to go back to Asatru or take up Buddhism or something.

That is &#039;Work in Progress&#039;. The important thing is not what we write, but how we write, and in my opinion the modern writer must be an adventurer above all, willing to take every risk, and be prepared to founder in his effort if need be. in other words we must write dangerously: everything is inclined to flux and change nowadays and modern literature, to be valid, must express that flux....A book, in my opinion, should not be planned out beforehand, but as one writes it will form itself, subject, as I say, to the constant emotional promptings of one&#039;s personality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, it doesn&#039;t have a title yet.

Maybe it&#039;s because the people who make it are often infantile themselves.<br>This is why I mainly like stuff like Toradora or Patlabor.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1671877000, "resto": 21424388}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21427006, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:48:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What are some books that take place in venice, or fictional cities based on it?", "filename": "{9B262328-743C-4E6C-8BEE-23C4CD23D185}Img100", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 510, "h": 680, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671871693319700, "time": 1671871693, "md5": "jWJmHizozsWEXEobkuwRNQ==", "fsize": 60449, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-are-some-books-that-take-place-in-venice-or", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21427051, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:09:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21427006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21427006</a><br>A Death in Venice, presumably.", "time": 1671872940, "resto": 21427006}, {"no": 21427173, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:14:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21427006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21427006</a><br>The Masque of the Red Death by Poe", "time": 1671876844, "resto": 21427006}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21426610, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)01:18:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;spend hundreds of hours reading stoic and Christian philosophy </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;minor bad thing happens to me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crumble instantly </span><br><br>Is anyone else like this?

But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she blows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure.

It&#039;s why the same thing is happening with troons and other insane social groups. &quot;Truth&quot; is not really that important to human beings. It never was. The idea that rural people are &quot;dumber&quot; is a very simplistic idea that comes from being an urbanite. Rural people think this way: it is so and I must. They do not discuss &quot;is this right?&quot; or &quot;is this true?&quot; they just think, things are this way and I must. The penalty is &quot;losing face&quot; or some other thing, but the obligation they feel is deeper than just an analytical result. It&#039;s really bizarre but if you understand the mindset everything is clear. Obviously there is no God, sadly, there is no such thing. We&#039;re just meat. It&#039;s horrible. People probably understood this way further back than the industrial revolution, but they did not process this idea the same way as some college educated urbanite would. People were capable of just doing things without really thinking about the whys and hows. I think there was a more natural flow in people&#039;s thinking that allowed them to just go with what happened. It&#039;s probably why urbanites feel like killing themselves when they do repetitive work; you&#039;re using your brain too much. Even normalfags who are gigantic NPCs are still overprocessing things although not like pre-industrial peasants would. That&#039;s a whole another mindset. NPCs do twice the amount of work: they overthink everything while doing shit because they&#039;re compelled to. It&#039;s like they do the peasant&#039;s repetitive work but whereas the not so braindead urbanite would process that it&#039;s fucking harrowing, NPCs just go like &quot;yeah but money, yeah but money, yeah but money, yeah but money, I gotta do this right, yeah money, I have to buy that phone, yeah money&quot; like a mantra. They&#039;re fucking retarded. The peasant would just ride it. His mind was free. He went to church because he did.

And as you said, animals can maim each other, like Mufasa getting trampled in The Lion King.<br><br>But when you have franchises like Sonic or My Little Pony, which are happy and simplistic, a lot of those darker themes are going to seem melodramatic and cloying.

Or have Kirby watch tearfully as Waddle Dee dies of cancer? <br>They don&#039;t work because it&#039;s tonally dissonant.

Weird flaky brown girl who smoked far too much weed, kept hugging people and spreading love, she could really draw and wanted to become a tattoo artist, though had no tats herself, kept becoming more emotional, until I had to fire her, after a month of emotional scenes and her loudly singing hallelujah during work.<br><br>3. Another musician/writer, shy and friendly, but boy was he forgetful, he couldnt keep his focus, so there where days where every pallet he collected had errors, he was fairly strong, so made him do bulk order and just recount, but he had the annoying habit of having to listen to music all the time.

Wherefore from out great Beethoven there was now to be won a quite new knowledge of her essence; the roots, whence Music had thriven to lust this height and this significance, were to be followed thoughtfully through Bach to Palestrina; and thus there was to be founded a quite other system for judging her aesthetically, than that which took its reckonings from a musical evolution lying far outside these masters&#039; path.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Emanuel Bach, Haydn and Mozart had established the structural laws of sonata form for all time. It was the outcome of a compromise which the spirit of German music reached with that of Italian music. It acquired its external character from the way it was used: the pianist used the sonata to present himself to the public in order to delight them with his dexterity and to entertain them agreeably as a musician. We are no longer speaking of Sebastian Bach assembling his congregation in front of the organ in church, or summoning a connoisseur or colleague to a competition; a wide gap separated the wonderful master of fugue from those who cultivated the sonata. They learned the art of fugue as a means of consolidating their musical studies but applied it to the sonata only as a learned device. The raw consequences of pure counterpoint gave place to pleasure in stable eurhythmics: only the completion of its pattern in the sense of Italian euphony appeared to meet the demands of the music.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With Palestrina\u2019s music religion had vanished from the church, whereas the artificial formalism of Jesuitical practice counter-reformed religion and at the same time music. Thus, for the sensitive observer, the same Jesuitical style of construction of the preceding two centuries obscures the venerable nobility of Rome; thus the glories of Italian painting became soft and sweet; thus, under the same guidance, \u2018classical\u2019 French poetry arose in whose stultifying laws we can detect a quite telling analogy with the laws governing the construction of the operatic aria and the sonata. We know that it was the German spirit, so very much feared and hated \u2018beyond the mountains\u2019, which, everywhere and including in the area of art, confronted and redeemed this artificially introduced corruption of the spirit of the European peoples.</span>", "filename": "Karl Bauer 2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 638, "h": 857, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671870044240203, "time": 1671870044, "md5": "7j5SWmaQE8JvaXK0hU430g==", "fsize": 137010, "resto": 21425712}, {"no": 21426964, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:30:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21426891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21426891</a>", "filename": "Imagine being at computers", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 619, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1671870605672404, "time": 1671870605, "md5": "hSM10zqM59ya+u8SpvafZw==", "fsize": 174319, "resto": 21425712}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21423452, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)11:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Collectors Thread", "com": "My thread got pruned last night so here\u2019s a new one.

This is not &#039;rational&#039; behavior. <br>In OCD patients, anxiety problems (which can have their basis in a disregulated limbic system) can be converted into ego-syntonic behaviors by the ego. Here, a general, unidentifiable feeling of anxiety actually causes the ego to search the environment for a threat, and when none are found can string together a sequence of semi-reasonable arguments to motivate reasonable behavior. E.g., &quot;I am anxious&quot; =&gt; &quot;Something is wrong&quot; =&gt; &quot;Germs are everywhere&quot; =&gt; &quot;Germs can be unsafe&quot; =&gt; &quot;I am anxious because I am covered in germs&quot; =&gt; &quot;I must wash my hands&quot;.", "time": 1671827014, "resto": 21421995}, {"no": 21424571, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:24:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424568</a><br>motivate unreasonable behavior*", "time": 1671827075, "resto": 21421995}, {"no": 21424666, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:45:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424536</a><br>hrrmm now that you mention it.. you might be right.

They simply cannot engage with media of any form without going out of their way to read some vague subtext into children&#039;s media whether or not it was intended. Of course, children&#039;s media is not always devoid of a political message, often state-sponsored propaganda, but really they seem unusually eager to find it in the most odd places, as if the absence of it would mark a series as being worse. It&#039;s because of their fear of being suspected of having left in them even a drop of childlike innocence then, that they make the effort to over-explain everything they choose to read or watch, I assume. They require justification for their interests. I&#039;ve even seen people suddenly have a change of heart, excited over the possibility of having something new, not exactly to them, but to their peers; Something acceptable for their peers to know they watch, after it gains popularity. I guess because they don&#039;t have to put up as much of a front anymore. A (not so) recent example being when Netflix picked up Neon Genesis Evangelion, which of course isn&#039;t like the stories they pile false narratives onto. It&#039;d be hard to even misconstrue it as not having a &quot;message&quot; regardless of how lame it may be, and yet they even give that show the same treatment they do of children&#039;s cartoons, that is pushing more meaning onto it than there ever was meant to be.

Looking at goodreads reviews, they called out the author for being a Nazi piece of shit. That naturally got me interested, since the book is about killing fantasy monsters and monsters from the folktales. Maybe he had his vampires all be jews or something similar?<br>Turns out that was the regular reaction of liberal parts of fantasy story community for the author saying that conservative stories are being underrated.<br>In the story, one of the main villains is a Portugese man who conquered the Mayan temple and turned into some evil being due to Old Ones, yes from Lovecraft, he controls powerful vampires, the main one is a Nazi.<br>Then to add to the colourful cast, our protagonist has an old Jew inside of his head, a black man and hooker are part of his team.<br>So what about our protagonist, is he a racist? He is a mutt by his own words &#039;my ancestors got around, the race is hard to pinpoint&#039;, paraphrasing but close to his own words. He has no problems with anything really, except he hates Grant.<br>What is so special about this guy you might ask? He is the current boyfriend of his crush, one great female who is a gun tottin badass who kills monsters and comes from a lineage of monster hunters who own this group of monster hunters. Yep, it&#039;s a human vs monster novel, and that dude is simping hard. As in every time he is around our great female lead, everything revolves about him loving her. <br>As is tradition, she doesn&#039;t refuse his advances, yet is adamant she is together with Grant, who is described as perfect Prince Charming, but is seen as our MC as a pompous prick, so you know how it goes. Our MC is ultra special talanted in shooting, a very important thing for a Hunter and from the fight scenes, the only important thing. He and Grant are at odds and in the first mission Grant leaves him to die in a situation where only plot armour can save him, which it does. This surprisingly doesn&#039;t instantly fuck over Grant, and changes nothing really, but he isn&#039;t present for the good part of the novel. When he does reappear again, he is kissing the female lead, cucking our dear MC still, but then couple of pages later Grant gets kidnapped by a vampire and his fate, while I haven&#039;t read it (I read 2/3 of the novel so far), its already set up to be either death with redemption, or turning into a vampire to be killed. Yey MC. Female lead instantly hops on MC&#039;s dick, kissing him not even a day after Grant gets missing. Yey for MC.<br>What is so special about our MC, except being a perfect killing machine? He is set up to be the Chosen One, like the evil guy was when he was alive.. The old jew guy living in his head that I mentioned? He allows him to see memories of the evil guy, and gives him astral vision. Also saves him from drowning early on by interacting with his gas canister..<br>All in all, I feel like I have read this novel before, which means it&#039;s just one of many trash novels out there.

The protagonist is an aged knight who got thrown out of the order and joined a group of bandits. One day he meets a cute little girl who says she can talk to angels and needs their help to go across the entire country, she can&#039;t tell why exactly, but an angel told her. The bandit group wants to rape her so the knight kills them all and decides to escort the little girl, not knowing if she really has supernatural powers or is just fantasizing stuff because she is traumatized or something. On their way really early on they also meet an alcoholic monk who joins them too because he is the only survivor of the monastery anyway and his alcohol is running low.<br>On their way they have to fight off hunger, thirst and the weather. The monster/demon encounters are relatively rare, but if they happen they are absolutely terrifying, this is where the horror/fantasy elements come into play. The protag is a very capable knight but he is getting older and he is only human and can do so much. The athmosphere is absolutely crushing and hopeless and in the book it says several times the only person who can turn this around would be God but he isn&#039;t doing anything. Also it is a great motivator to keep reading so you find out what happens when the little girl reaches her destination like the angel supposedly told her to and you really root for all characters.<br>All in all I really enjoyed this a ton and it gripped me from the start until the very end and I am a reader that it easily turned off.", "filename": "61Nxq9EvcKL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 907, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671873813224488, "time": 1671873813, "md5": "uJeMg3gh2ddXzL/0HTfAow==", "fsize": 124787, "resto": 21422679}, {"no": 21427141, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)04:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21425974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21425974</a><br>Swallowing", "time": 1671875823, "resto": 21422679}, {"no": 21427169, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21426337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21426337</a><br>You finished the first book, which sets up the plot, but didn&#039;t bother with the second book that has all the payoff?
