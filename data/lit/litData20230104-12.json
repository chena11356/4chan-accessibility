Psilocybes create a kind of experience that differs from person to person, and from situation to situation. The best advice I can give for consuming mushrooms is to do so with a friend at first. After you&#039;re comfortable with the high, they can make outdoors activities like hiking more enjoyable. Also mushroom consumption is an all-day kind of activity. Most highs last between eight to ten hours, assuming you&#039;re not microdosing. Mushrooms are worth doing for the experience, but do not enhance anything about your mental state. You won&#039;t find out anything great about the state of the universe. They do not &quot;open your mind,&quot; as some would claim.

Isn&#039;t it the confined who must be frightened? And why would the moon be afraid of it? At this point, I feel like there&#039;s a lot of pent up violence bubbling just beneath the surface of a tense layer of fear in this poem. It reminds me actually of Mark Strand&#039;s beloved (by me) poem Sleeping With One Eye Open - in terms of the atmosphere you&#039;re creating (which is very good). The issue I&#039;m having is there isn&#039;t any clear issuer or recipient of this oozing tension, and I have the sense you&#039;re listening to and observing the dog, but now the poem gains this sort of fearfully apprehensive heavenly viewpoint, motherly even, so for whom is she fearing? The caged dog? You? It&#039;s owners? The neighborhood - should he get loose? I think this poem can be very strong if you can establish a clearer symbolic orientation without destroying the vague apprehension you&#039;ve created.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when the branches hold no shelter</span><br>So is the moon afraid he&#039;ll kill small tree animals in the yard?

It sounds great and the imagery is very strong. However, as great as these lines are, from the poems prior lines, I don&#039;t get the sense there&#039;s anything earth shattering about to occur. Perhaps something not good, but nothing on that scale. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s to be done about that. On the other hand, I do like the implication, if I&#039;m conceiving this rightly, that splitting in two can reference the dog&#039;s escape, or his unleashed (heh) violence.<br><br>Overall, I liked it.

He was proud of it and would pull it out for those indecisive customers who would be sold on the elegance of a nice suit, good shoes, and a futuristic pen. She was proud of such a small trinket, she wanted to keep it with her and show it off to everyone in school. So on she marched to school.<br>Once she had gotten to school, everything was normal. But once the teacher asked them to pull out their mandatory paper stock and writing intensive, everything changed. She pulled out the pen and some classmates gasped. What a pen! What a fine piece of plastic! Was it from the states? From the utopia? Why, yes. Of course it was. Where else could you find such a pen?<br>She wrote and scribbled and dragged the pen for session after session until it was time for lunch.<br>Lunchtime. <br>You had to leave your bags and supplies in the room and sit outside at the benches waiting for the daily slop.

Life is a really complex thing and his second books feels more like writing about stuff that sells good, than actually stuff that helps.<br><br>For example Peterson says in his second book that you shouldn&#039;t let &quot;bullies get away with it&quot;.<br>The reality of life is that you have criminals, drug addicts, other mentally fucked up people, and ALWAYS problems. If you want to defend yourself, you always have to keep in mind if it&#039;s even worth it and don&#039;t play hero for no reward.<br>Especially as a psychologist he fails to understand that you need to find your inner value and literally don&#039;t care about people who you are not responsible for and are not your family. Sure, you can defend yourself against a losers who is a weakling and you know he won&#039;t stab you tomorrow.<br><br>For example look at all the drama. The best thing is always either ignoring the stuff and just moving on, or fight until death.<br>A piece of shit will always be a piece of shit. Do you really want to dedicate your life to fight one person? This is why Peterson is so retarded. You can&#039;t change the world. You can&#039;t change people.<br>If the person who is a &quot;bully&quot; is not important in your life, just move on. There are literally neighbor wars for literally nothing &quot;SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOUR MOUTHT SHUT!&quot;<br>Assholes are assholes and the best way is to do nothing, because assholes will always clash with other people if you ignore them long enough. Just don&#039;t be easy pray, train your body, and study, because the real bullies are not those who insult you, but those who have a nice face while trying to harm you indirectly.<br><br>This is the whole problem with Peterson and why he is on benzos and a crying mess. His advices is harmful and you will end up like him if you can&#039;t let go and just accept people are evil and not your problem. If someone wants to be your fren, great. But if someone &quot;bullies&quot; you, don&#039;t listen to Peterson, because you will end up crying as an adult man with a psychology PhD.", "time": 1672798978, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476381, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)21:26:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476361</a><br>fucking esl retard", "time": 1672799211, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476397, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)21:30:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476291</a><br>...<br>It is.", "time": 1672799437, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476442, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)21:43:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476283</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;covered in tattoos from head to toe like a nog convict</span><br>No, you still have MANY issues to deal with.", "time": 1672800190, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476594, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)22:32:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476361</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;completely worthless</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;here&#039;s some things I liked about it.</span><br><br>never change /lit/<br><br>never change", "time": 1672803125, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476801, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:26:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476317</a><br>Name five important intellectuals (not artists or poets) that were addicted to drugs.", "time": 1672806365, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476808, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476801</a><br>does alcohol count?", "time": 1672806445, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476829, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:33:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "lmao", "filename": "jp", "ext": ".png", "w": 1262, "h": 634, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1672806813291108, "time": 1672806813, "md5": "kRM5a32xy2+7vxB0+Xc6mA==", "fsize": 140354, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476837, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:34:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476801</a><br>does caffeine count?", "filename": "jjimi0hsrsi91", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 918, "tn_w": 102, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672806888318638, "time": 1672806888, "md5": "ern7WSZfq1dSYZVaS9OVKQ==", "fsize": 70257, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476859, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:41:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476801</a><br>Paul Erdos was famously addicted to amphetamines", "time": 1672807272, "resto": 21476277}, {"no": 21476884, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)23:49:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21476801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476801</a><br><a href=\"#p21476317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476317</a><br>Intelligence is correlated highly with the personality trait openness.<br><br>People who are more open to new experiences are more likely to do drugs.<br><br><a href=\"#p21476325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21476325</a><br>Drugs are not necessarily a &#039;trap&#039;<br>Don&#039;t associate addiction with lack of intelligence.

Here&#039;s a great one from the start of the book.<br>14<br>What Is Called Love<br><br>Avarice and love: how differently we feel towards each of these words! And yet it could be the same impulse twice named, in the first case, disparaged by the \u2018haves\u2019, in whom the impulse has settled down somewhat and who now fear losing what they have, and in the other, glorified as \u2018good\u2019 by the discontented and the thirsty. Love of our neighbour \u2013 is it not a hankering after new property? And similarly, our love of knowledge, of truth and even all eagerness for news? We gradually grow weary of the old, familiar things we securely hold, and again stretch forth our hands; even the most beautiful landscape lived in for three months is no longer assured of our love, and some more distant shore excites our avarice: what is had loses much in the having. Our pleasure in ourselves thus seeks to sustain itself by continually transforming something new into ourselves \u2013 that is just what possession means. To grow weary with a possession is to grow weary with ourselves. (One can also suffer from an excess of possessions \u2013 and then the desire to dispose of or distribute may assume the honorific \u2018love\u2019.) When we see a man suffer, we welcome the opportunity to take possession of him; for example, the charitable and compassionate do this, calling the desire for a new possession awakened in them \u2018love\u2019, and taking pleasure in it as in a new conquest beckoning to them. However, it is the love of the sexes that most clearly betrays possessiveness: the lover wants the unconditional and exclusive possession of the person he longs for, he wants unconditional power as much over her soul as over her body, he wants to be loved exclusively, and to live and reign in the other soul as what is highest and most desirable. When we consider that this means nothing less than to exclude the whole world from a precious commodity, and from the happiness and enjoyment it affords, that the lover contemplates the deprivation and ruin of all rivals, and would like to be the dragon of his golden hoard, the most inconsiderate and selfish of all \u2018conquerors\u2019 and exploiters, and finally that to the lover himself the rest of the world seems pale, indifferent and unprofitable, and that he is ready to make any sacrifice, disturb all existing arrangements, and put his own interests above all others \u2013 we are astonished that this ferocious avarice and injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified to such an extent. Still more astonishing is the fact that the concept of love as the opposite of selfishness has always been modelled on it, when it is perhaps precisely the most candid expression of selfishness!

The first attempts were associated with the early Apollonian-Dionysian syncretism of Birth of Tragedy and the Wagner circle. The second attempt was the positivism of Daybreak and Human All Too Human, which however proved too weak to skeptical doubts prompted by Schopenhauerian pessimsism.

In normal circumstances caste is supposed to be heritable, yes, but today the situation is different and the caste can vary by individuals even within the same family. <br>If you need help with the caste issue, I can try to help you figure it out - just remember that I am simply giving my opinion, that I do not know you personally, and further that caste as such does not have to define you, although it could be a useful tool in defining yourself.<br>Some sources you could consult is a compilation of texts by the Traditionalists entitled &quot;Race and Caste&quot;, and also Schuon&#039;s book &quot;To Have a Centre&quot; or whatever it was called. Both texts deal heavily with caste. <br>The essential point is to figure out which quality of the four varna qualities predominates within you. Here is a quote from the Bhagavad Gita on this topic:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.41 The duties of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras\u2014are distributed according to their qualities, in accordance with their gu\u1e47as (and not by birth).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.42 Tranquility, restraint, austerity, purity, patience, integrity, knowledge, wisdom, and belief in a hereafter\u2014these are the intrinsic qualities of work for Brahmins.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.43 Valor, strength, fortitude, skill in weaponry, resolve never to retreat from battle, large-heartedness in charity, and leadership abilities, these are the natural qualities of work for Kshatriyas.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.44 Agriculture, dairy farming, and commerce are the natural works for those with the qualities of Vaishyas. Serving through work is the natural duty for those with the qualities of Shudras.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.45 By fulfilling their duties, born of their innate qualities, human beings can attain perfection. Now hear from Me how one can become perfect by discharging one\u2019s prescribed duties.</span><br>Basically what you have to do is look deep within yourself and honestly confirm what your inclinations are. If you are dishonest then there&#039;s no point in messing with caste at all and you should just approach identity in the way modern people do this. I am going to attach a chart that may be helpful to provide some orientations if you use your brain to interpret it. In the attached pic, the &quot;world&quot; section refers to the world of matter - Shudras are drawn to the lower half which relates to instincts, vital forces, the body, pleasure, etc. Their joy is the basest joy of the body. Vaishyas have (as per Schuon) an &quot;objective&quot; rather than &quot;subjective&quot; character like the shudras - they pursue an eudaimonic happiness grounded in their material activity. The Vaishya loves to make more and better material things, in a peaceful, orderly and profitable manner. I ran out of characters so I&#039;ll continue in the next post. <br><a href=\"#p21474653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21474653</a><br>Eh I mean that&#039;s technically true, and whites as a whole are a Kshatriya people, but there&#039;s obvious internal differentiation within the race.

The Kshatriya is active and assertive, and he too loves making use of his body, but to him the body is just a vehicle for his intangible spirit. He relates to the world through spiritual values like honour, fidelity, courage, and other high virtues that he sticks to inflexibly, even at great material cost. He cherishes these things more than matter, because he is fundamentally a spiritual being, and he understands his connections to the world and to his actions and to other people on this basis - as something valuable not for its material outer shell, but its spiritual core. The Kshatriya perceives his own spirituality and immortality in these virtues and in his actions, which are proof that he belongs more to spirit than to flesh. As to the Brahmin, he has an objective spiritual core that belongs on the highest heights, and as such is above the virtues because he can grapple with spirit directly. If the Kshatriya always feels his sense of honour which defines his spiritual self, then the Brahmin always feels his spiritual self and his irresistible draw and loyalty to the divine. To put things in another way, the Brahmin can be considered to be &quot;more awake&quot; to his spiritual nature than the Kshatriya, who perceives his spirit, but somewhat obscurely. <br>If you are observant and perceive the nature of these principles and qualities, you can see their influence and determine someone&#039;s caste background in virtually every aspect of life - although whenever you meet someone of more mixed natures you may find that he possesses the features of different castes in different parts of his life.<br>If you give me a description of your principles, interests, selective affinities, values, traits etc I may be able to cook up a tentative profile for you. You should keep in mind however that this by itself will probably not be sufficient to make your dharma immediately obviously, although it may act as an aid. Figuring out my caste certainly was a considerable aid for me. Still, you should know that there are dharmas that you can actively undertake by your own initiative - this includes ascetic and esoteric dharmas that revolve around pursuing spiritual enlightenment in this lifetime. Further, the dharma of a being as it relates to caste remains the same in principle but varies in implementation. So, for example, if you are a Kshatriya it may be difficult for you to find any feudal lords to pledge your allegiance to, especially considering that even during feudalism you&#039;d still need a society with a transcendent and spiritually integral background to do your work properly. Personally, I found that orienting myself around the divine was very helpful in affirming my form, dharma or duty in these modern times, and although I had to use a lot of independent thinking to make it work for me, having a specific tradition helped me tons", "time": 1672787777, "resto": 21474594}, {"no": 21475650, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)18:35:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475471</a><br><a href=\"#p21475549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475549</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whites as a whole are a Kshatriya people</span><br>Where does Evola says this?

However, a dream does not impart anything special to you which you do not already have - it is at best an image or a representation of an internal event. Granted, there may be very powerful and transformative dream experiences that I am not aware of - mine have given me some experience of alternative states but nothing that felt too impactful. Perhaps at a higher scale there may be permanent differences to waking life. With that said, especially given that you are a Buddhist, I think you should just treat these experiences as, perhaps, milestones and signifiers of what occupies your consciousness. Do not grow attached to them because it will set you back as a Zen Buddhist.

Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for victory and salvation<br>and through him they expected nature to give them whatever was necessary to their existence\u2014above all, rain. Jahveh is the god of Israel, and consequently the god of justice: this is the logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the Jews both aspects of this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its herds and its crops.\u2014This view of things remained an ideal for a long while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows: anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained, as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge\u2014a vision best visualized in the typical prophet (i. e., critic and satirist of the moment), Isaiah.\u2014But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no longer could do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned. But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was changed\u2014the conception of him was denaturized; this was the price that had to be paid for keeping him.\u2014Jahveh, the god of \u201cjustice\u201d\u2014he is in accord with Israel no more, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism; he is now a god only conditionally.... The public notion of this god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to him, for \u201csin\u201d: that most fraudulent of all imaginable interpretations, whereby a \u201cmoral order of the world\u201d is set up, and the fundamental concepts, \u201ccause\u201d and \u201ceffect,\u201d are stood on their heads.

But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "filename": "PaulTheApostle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672453480295577, "time": 1672453480, "md5": "dFHTxDSoXDfSCWT7xazvfQ==", "fsize": 22769, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457444, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457437</a><br><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

In their research they looked across cultures and across millennia to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures. Their list includes six character strengths: wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each of these has three to five sub-entries; for instance, temperance includes forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.</span><br>Cool, thanks anon.

He had laughed at a very funny joke about a Negro when Irwin told it at a party, and then the following day had seen some white men lightly kicking a Negro man in the pants, and temporarily he had questioned laughter altogether. He had gone to several universities with the vague exaltation of Old Man Axelrod and had found only curves and credits. He had become drunk on the idea of God and found only theology. He had risen several times on the subtle and powerful wings of lust, expectant of magnificence, achieving only discharge. A few times he had extended friendship with palpitating hope, only to find that no one quite knew what he had in mind.

This alludes to the judge killing kids and if I remember correctly in real life the judge is chased off for killing kids. Anyway I could be conflating Blood Meridian and the historical book My Confession. I do think that at the end of BM the missing girl plays a part and the kid participates with the judge. Whatever happened in the jakes went beyond just rape/murder judging by the other guy&#039;s reaction.

And this happens in the &quot;biggest town for sin in all Texas.&quot; I&#039;m sure everyone there is accustomed to rape and murder. After the Kid enters the jakes the Judge locks the door behind him. When the other guy goes in it is unlocked so I believe whatever happened is over and it is empty (at least of living human beings.) I believe the third man who is pissing outside and warns the men not to enter to be the Kid. He seems to know what happened inside the jakes and is unfazed by it. &quot;I wouldnt go in there if I was you.&quot; I don&#039;t think McCarthy mentioned the missing bear girl for no reason. I think the Judge has her in the jakes and the Kid joins him in doing whatever they do to the poor girl. I think the raped and murdered corpse of the girl is left in there. So it ends with the Kid fully embracing his dark side. In my eyes the Judge actually does fully envelop the Kid and they kind of become one. &quot;Evil&quot; wins. And another note, if I&#039;m remembering correctly, when the children were found murdered/missing throughout the book McCarthy does not go into any graphic detail about their death. He just says something like their bodies were found, or that a girl&#039;s bloodied clothes were found and the girl missing, or &quot;a girl of perhaps twelve years cowering naked in the floor&quot; with the Judge standing naked behind her.

Foote spoke truer than he knew, for Blood Meridian is the central novel of McCarthy\u2019s canon, and at its core is an allegorical origin story for language itself.<br><br>After more than thirty years, Blood Meridian Or the Evening Redness in the West remains one of the most elusive and allusive novels in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s canon. An exploration of the novel\u2019s many allusions led me to a new comprehensive interpretation of the book incorporating the historical revelations of John Sepich, the Nietzschean interpretation of Shane Shimpf, and the Gnostic interpretations of Leo Daugherty and Petra Mundik. In addition to referencing numerous literary works and thinkers, Blood Meridian repeatedly alludes to itself. Hundreds of carefully placed mirrors \u2014 words, phrases, themes, and structures\u2014 occur throughout the book. These mirrors form a \u2018vicious circle\u2019 as an expression of Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s August 1881 realization of the Eternal Return, that \u201ceverything becomes and recurs eternally.\u201d. Though the bulk of the novel is a \u201cmeditation on a Nietzschean world where God has died,\u201d the epilogue, viewed through a Gnostic lens, provides a glimmer of hope opposing this nihilism.<br><br>In his essay, \u201cOf Judge Holden\u2019s Hats; or The Palindrome in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian,\u201d Christopher Forbis cites more than sixty mirrors throughout the book to convincingly argue that Blood Meridian is a palindrome. \u201cBy way of method,\u201d Forbis explains, \u201cI ball-point pen numbered a copy of Blood Meridian\u2019s last page, the Epilogue at 337, with a zero, until on the novel\u2019s earliest page, of epigraphs, I wrote 337. All page-pairs that sum to 337 are exact mirrors.\u201d Forbis then searched through the book marking dozens of mirrors he found, allowing for a two-page margin of error. One of the most striking sets of mirrors that Forbis cites concerns hats:<br><br>After he has disrupted the Reverend Green\u2019s sermon, the judge stands at the bar with two hats and a double handful of coins in front of him, one of the hats likely the Reverend Green\u2019s former \u2018collection plate.\u2019 On the mirror page at the book\u2019s end, the showman in a tyrolean costume moves among the crowd shaking coins in his hat, while the judge wears a \u201cround hat with a narrow brim.\u201d On the book\u2019s meridian page, at a peak moment for the gang, the judge appears last of all at the governor\u2019s ball, clad in a freshly tailored suit complete with a Panama hat joined from \u201ctwo such lesser hats\u201d with such skill that \u201cthe joinery did scarcely show at all.\u201d Forbis argues that the spliced hat is a metaphor for the novel. Indeed, the hat crowns the book\u2019s most striking figure, the judge", "time": 1672822665, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477582, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)03:58:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477576</a><br>Though Forbis cites an impressive number of mirrors, he offers no explanation for their meaning. So on April Fool\u2019s Day of 2018, I began a possible fool\u2019s errand to determine the meaning of these mysterious mirrors in Blood Meridian. I copied Forbis\u2019s technique of numbering the book\u2019s pages backward, and as Forbis had focused on the judge\u2019s spliced hat at the book\u2019s center, it was there that I began my search, taking the number of pages in my copy and dividing by two to find the middle, or meridian, page of the novel. This line nearly leapt off that page at me:<br><br>\u201cCigars were presented and glasses of sherry poured and the governor standing at the head of the table made them welcome and issued orders to his chamberlain that every need be seen to.\u201d In his Notes on Blood Meridian, John Sepich reveals that Samuel Chamberlain\u2019s My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue provides the historical framework for McCarthy\u2019s tale. Here on the book\u2019s meridian page, McCarthy slyly confesses to lifting the backbone of the story from My Confession by having the governor issue \u201corders to his chamberlain.\u201d<br><br>Upon discovering what I believe to be a secret clue to the book\u2019s origin, I began an ongoing treasure hunt to find hundreds of new mirrors and hidden details in Blood Meridian. I could spout mirrors for hours, but in the interest of time, I\u2019ve picked just one prime example that hopefully demonstrates that these mirrors are not merely a seeker\u2019s projection:<br><br>At the jail in Chihuahua City, the kid takes up a pallet with Toadvine and another Kentuckian, a veteran of the war: Grannyrat Chambers, who describes the battle at Mier, where he sat against a wall with his shattered leg stretched out listening to a lull in the firing that grew into a strange silence, and in this silence there grew a low rumbling. He tells of how an army of irregulars took the city of Chihuahua clothed in rags and underwear, how the cannonballs were solid copper and came loping through the grass like runaway suns, how at night they sat by the fires listening to the moans of the dying. He\u2019d heard stories of Mexican soldiers chained to the trailspades. They picked powder in the locks and blowed them gates open, releasing prisoners that looked like skinned rats \u2014 the Whitest Mexicans you\u2019ll ever see. Old Bill turned all the prisoners loose, and then whipped two to death for stealing. The kid pokes at his bowl while listening and asks, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d To be told \u201cThat\u2019s prime bullmeat, son. Don\u2019t let it feel ye to weaken.\u201d The kid chews and listens, and he chews and tells of his encounter with the Comanche. \u201cI\u2019m proud I missed that dance. Them is some cruel sons of bitches,\u201d says the veteran.", "time": 1672822737, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477587, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:02:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477582</a><br>On nearly the mirror page, the Borginnis woman reads Cloyce Bell riot over his treatment of the idiot, asking \u201cIf your mother was to see him, what do you reckon she\u2019d say. Ain\u2019t you ashamed? Cloyce replies, \u201cI can\u2019t do any more than what I\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cDamn if you aint a sorry specimen,\u201d she retorts. She and the women take the idiot to the river, and Toadvine asks the kid where are they taking it? The kid doesn\u2019t know. She reaches in and takes him by the hand and receives him, handing him down. She is smeared with feces but seems not to notice, and tells the other women to \u201cBurn that thing.\u201d \u201cImagine having this child penned up like a wild animal,\u201d she says. That night, the idiot sits before the migrants\u2019 fires in a coarse woven wool suit. A fish colored moon rises, and the Borginnis woman strips the idiot to his underwear and tucks him in, only for the naked idiot to reappear, whimpering and pushing at things in the night. He hoots softly and his voice passes from him so that no sound echoes back. The judge on his midnight rounds rescues the idiot, snatching him aloft by the heels.<br><br>Blood Meridian is certainly a Vicious Circle, but there is more going on in this strange loop of a book than just Nietzsche and Gnosticism, and the mirrors extend beyond Blood Meridian.<br><br>If we count The Border Trilogy as one book, and we include the allegedly forthcoming book The Passenger, there will be nine novels in McCarthy\u2019s canon. Four books before Blood Meridian and four books after. And just as there are nine books total, there are nine words in the title: Blood Meridian Or the Evening Redness in the West. Even trickier, there are 30 words total in all the titles of the books, the same number of days in a month, and the judge is repeatedly linked with the moon. This might seem like I\u2019ve lost my marbles, but there are 60 marks separating scenes in Blood Meridian, and there are 60 notches on the Ishango Bone, a 25,000 year old engraved bone tool that is perhaps the earliest example of symbolic notation. Alexander Marshack speculates that this bone functioned as a primitive lunar calendar. Hundreds of mirrors occur in Blood Meridian, but the fearful symmetry extends to the the themes of his other works. Working outward from the center novel, Suttree is the story of a man who voluntarily leaves a way of life, while The Border Trilogy is a story of a way of life that is taken. Child of God is the story of a killer who is stopped by the police, while No Country for Old Men is a story of a lawman who stops policing and is unable to stop the killer. Outer Dark is a tale of a father who fails to protect his son and the child dies. In The Road, a father protects his son who lives while the father dies. It is interesting to speculate what the mirrors between The Orchard Keeper and McCarthy\u2019s forthcoming novel, The Passenger, might be.<br>The central circle is a metaphor for the paradox of language.", "time": 1672822974, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477590, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:04:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477587</a><br>So what is language? It\u2019s a complex semiotic system, that is a system composed of signs, of greater importance to individuals that perhaps any other system. A sign is anything that can stand for something else. Ferdinand de Saussure proposed a triad model for the \u201cwhole\u201d of the sign of the signified, the signifier, and the referent. The mental portion of the sign he represented as a circular two-sided model, like a sheet of paper, with the two sides being the signified and the signifier, separated by a bar. Using the example of a horse, the signified is the mental image, the concept of an equine animal, while the signifier is the sound pattern \u201chorse.\u201d The referent is what kicks you.<br><br>The sign is arbitrary, which is to say that there is nothing about the sound pattern \u201chorse\u201d that implies the animal, nor is there anything about the animal which implies the sound pattern \u201chorse.\u201d If the sign weren\u2019t arbitrary, there would be only ONE language. A language is a repository of these sound patterns. But it is not simply a nomenclature system.<br><br>As the sign is arbitrary, the meaning of each sign is not inherent. Each sign has meaning precisely because it is NOT all the other signs. Its meaning is apparent due to its relation with other signs. The sign is linear, as time only flows in one direction. Saussure provided a diagram:<br>Meaning and value are not synonymous. A sign gains its value by some sort of strange societal agreement. Somehow we all agree that \u201chorse\u201d means horse, and these ephemeral agreements are ever-changing. Language is therefore never a set thing, there\u2019s what it was and what it is.<br><br>Blood Meridian is a book of many signs, perhaps the most noticeable signs are the archaic vocabulary and the pervasive violence. Words and war. War is language, and all other trades are contained in that of war. Rick Wallach pointed out in Sacred Violence that the semiotic systems within Blood Meridian are embedded concentrically: The English narration of the gypsy woman\u2019s Spanish fortune-telling of the Tarot deck, which is itself yet another sort of language.<br><br>Referring to Saussure\u2019s model of the sign, the book\u2019s opening line commands us to form a mental image of the signified \u2014 \u201cSee the child.\u201d Next we encounter the Judge at Reverend Green\u2019s sermon, where he informs us \u201cLadies and gentlemen I feel it is my duty to inform you that the man holding this revival is an impostor\u2026\u201d The signifier is a sort of an impostor for the actual thing, the referent that kicks you. Glanton\u2019s first action is to kick the wooden doors for entry to the governor\u2019s mansion in Chihuahua City. Glanton represents the referent, the kid is the signified, and the judge is the signifier. Glanton is reality, the kid is an expression of reality, and the judge is a reflection of reality, a \u201cfalse mirror\u201d as McCarthy describes him in a handwritten note in an early draft of Blood Meridian in the Witliff archives.", "time": 1672823047, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477593, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:05:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477590</a><br>The signified and signifier are separated by a bar and can never touch. The judge reaches through the bars of the kid\u2019s jail cell and says, \u201cCome here, let me touch you.\u201d<br><br>As the sign is arbitrary, so too is the pervasive violence throughout the book. Signs exist in eternal antagonism. The judge declares, \u201cWhat brings men together is not the sharing of bread, but the sharing of enemies.\u201d Additionally, because each sign derives its meaning by virtue of it not being another sign, effectively all is negation, which explains McCarthy\u2019s archaic use of the word \u201cnor\u201d in such phrases as \u201cLittle was said, nor were they quarrelsome.\u201d And as signs form a chain from which we derive their meaning, McCarthy presents us with a chain of \u201ccircular packets\u201d of information.<br><br>But as meaning and value are not the same, in the world of Blood Meridian it is the judge who grants signs their value. After the surgery to remove the arrow shaft from the kid\u2019s leg, in his ether delirium, the kid dreams of the judge.<br><br>\u201cIn that sleep and in sleeps to follow the judge did visit.\u201d He enshadows \u201can artisan and a worker in metal\u201d \u201cwhere he crouches at his trade\u201d \u201chammering out \u2026 some coinage for a dawn that would not be. It is this false moneyer with his gravers and burins who seeks favor with the judge and he is at contriving from cold slag brute in the crucible a face that will pass, an image that will render this residual specie current in the markets where men barter. Of this is the judge judge and the night does not end.\u201d The coldforger is the demiurge, the semi-malevolent Gnostic creator god, and he is hammering out the two-sided coinage of the sign so that the judge may approve his handiwork and grant the sign its value to be traded by men.<br><br>McCarthy foreshadows this dream when the hermit, the true God, tells the kid \u201cYou can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.\u201d", "time": 1672823127, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477596, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:07:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477593</a><br>Not only does the judge give signs their value, the judge is the author of the story, ever-scribbling in his notebook, controlling events, pulling the strings. The gypsy woman raises up on a string. The judge\u2019s coin is fashioned to some subtle lead which he pulls in a series of elongations before flinging it out into the night to have it return. The kid rides like a mounted marionette and the judge holds the fool\u2019s tether. In fact, not only does the judge control events in the book, the judge IS the book, for he is a draftsman as he IS other things, and the arc of circling bodies is determined by the length of their tether. Moons, coins, men. The novel proper is 336 pages and the judge\u2019s weight is 336 pounds. As God spoke the world into existence, the judge writes it out of existence in a mirror-image of John 1:1.<br><br>\u201cIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.\u201d As words ARE things, the mirror-image of the Word is the Mirror.<br>\u201cAt the end will be the Mirror and the Mirror will be with the judge and the Mirror will be the judge.\u201d<br><br>Although in our world the sign is linear, the sign of the world of Blood Meridian is circular. In August of last year, I set out to read Blood Meridian backwards, much like playing a vinyl record backwards in search of a Satanic message. Very quickly, I realized something tricky was going on. In the last paragraph of the novel proper, which becomes the \u201cfirst\u201d paragraph when read backwards, the judge \u201csashays backwards.\u201d Reading the book backwards was a bizarre experience that took 51 days. At times, it felt like McCarthy (or the judge) was speaking directly to me: \u201cDon\u2019t look away. Where only the rules are at hazard. A solitary game without opponent.\u201d Additionally, though the meanings of words and sentences change when read backwards, the story still \u201cmakes sense.\u201d For example, in the book\u2019s opening paragraph, which becomes the closing paragraph when read in reverse, the kid \u201chas a sister in this world that he will not see again. The father never speaks her name, the child does not know it.\u201d Manuel Broncano writes that although McCarthy\u2019s works are structured canonically, McCarthy \u201csubverts the very canon.\u201d I believe McCarthy is slyly referring to a short piece of music by Johannes Sebastian Bach from The Musical Offering called the Canon Cancrizans, or crab canon. A musical canon is a piece that repeats a theme in variations that harmonize with itself. The crab canon is a musical puzzle in which the theme is identical played forward and backwards and harmonizes with itself.

The judge\u2019s world is a \u201cTrance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent.\u201d And as the judge IS the governor, at the center of McCarthy\u2019s central work is the governor\u2019s BALL, a metaphor for language whose echoes reverberate throughout McCarthy\u2019s canon.<br><br>So I\u2019ve come full circle. I set out to determine the meaning of the mysterious mirrors in Blood Meridian: The meaning is meaning. As Douglas Hofstadter explains, \u201cWhen a system of \u2018meaningless\u2019 symbols has patterns in it that accurately track, or mirror, various phenomena in the world, then that tracking or mirroring imbues the symbols with some degree of meaning \u2013 indeed, such tracking or mirroring is no less and no more than what meaning is.\u201d<br><br>Of the judge, McCarthy tells us, \u201cWhatever his antecedents he was something wholly other than their sum, nor was there system by which to divide him back into his origins for he would not go. Whoever would seek out his history through what unraveling of loins and ledger books must stand at last darkened and dumb at the shore of a void without terminus or origin \u2026 and will discover no trace of any ultimate atavistic egg by which to reckon his commencing.\u201d<br><br>For as Saussure remarked, \u201cIt is quite illusory to believe that where language is concerned the problem of origins is any different from the problem of permanent conditions. There is no way out of the circle.\u201d", "time": 1672823349, "resto": 21467604}, {"no": 21477679, "now": "01/04/23(Wed)04:45:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21477576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477576</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Foote said that the true hero in McCarthy\u2019s works is the English language, or more specifically, the American language</span><br>This is the most pretentious thing I&#039;ve ever heard.

He knew. He knew what her body could do. Nakota didn\u2019t reply. There was no point. She knew once he walked back over in a few minutes his statement would be proven correct. And in the minutes he sat back down in his chair. Getting off to what he watched infront of him. A bloody and broken body. Mark didn\u2019t quit know what got him to this point. But all the same he was there. Her blood was warm, smelt less like iron, almost sweet. But maybe that was all in his head. He was horny so for all he knew his brain was playing tricks on him.

Blood stained but immaculet. \u201cRound two yeah?\u201d He laughed and stabbed it into her throat mutiple times. Nakota was paralyzed with fear, not out of fear of death. But out of not knowing what was going to happen to her. She felt blood pool up into her mouth and slip from between her lips. Giving a grunt he grabbed her chin and forced her mouth open. Letting the blood fall out before he forced his sizable girth into her mouth. Eliciting a choking gasp from her. It was insane to her, to an outsider she looked to be choking on both her own blood and his shaft. But in reality she wasnt. But that didn\u2019t make it any better. It was still deeply fucked. Mark grabbed her hair again and began to face fuck her roughly. Her mouth felt wonderful to him. The blood added to it all. He looked down at her. Watching her eyes look to him. \u201cShit you\u2019re fun.\u201d He growled. He felt her throat around his cock,a tight fit. Made it all the better that no matter what orifice he would take, he was too big for her. For some time he pleasured himself with her mouth and thoat. From time to time he sunk the blade into the back of her shoulders. Drawing out more bleeding. Getting closer to his end point he pulled out of her mouth. Giving her a moment to try for breath and to let her throat repair itself. \u201cbastard!\u201d she yelled. This couldn\u2019t be real.

Ahhhh, like you are relaxing or understanding something, for alpha; awww, like you are admiring a cute puppy, for omicron; and ohhhh, like you are shocked or dismayed, for omega.<br>Oh (like omega) by the way, zeta is not a straight up z. Textbooks will instruct you to pronounce it like dzeta or zdeta.

They cannot write seriously because they cannot handle serious issues irl with the gravitas they deserve, so its no wonder they cannot write it. That and the media they themselves enjoy or consume is just as trash too,. Tolkien, for example, grew up and adventurous outdoorsy youth who went out and experienced shit. He also was very well read (he was the one that advocated for the literarily depth of Beowulf) and loved a lot of the classics (in addition to how religion influenced him). He experience the horror of modern war (he was like one of 3 guys from his school group that survived the war). Now compare that to a modern day faggot. The oldest bit of media they prolly dealt with is from maybe the 80s, and it was prolly some toy commercial show or maybe sailor moon or some shit. Now add onto that no personal growth, no real world experience or emotional growth, and the most deep media they ever ingested was Sailor moon for a bit and that is it. Good writing is hard to being with. Now add on top of that the mindset above into an already hard thing to do.

Culture now feels very intent on constantly turning back on itself constantly like an ouroboros. Just look how hot of a commodity nostalgia has become, and how quickly events are mythologized and turned into consumable media (the movie about Weinstein and the Time&#039;s Up movement just got turned into a movie only a couple years after those events happened). Everything that happens is instantly reacted to and communicated, and due to a combination of this and lowered attention spans, the discourse becomes shallow. I have to imagine this relative lack of deeper reflection must cause people to mature differently. Also notice how much more emotional the discourse is too, since reaction can occur so quickly and not allow time for the person to reach any deeper understanding of any given event. <a href=\"#p21477034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477034</a> put it well by saying that millenials are led most strongly by pathos.<br><br>So perhaps, if this thesis is correct, it means that millennials are less emotionally mature due to a more reactionary relationship with media, driven by the internet and its all-consuming nature in our lives.

There&#039;s no sincerity anymore. Irony is a poison that has affected society at large.Everyone has become so afraid of being sincere and then criticized or mocked for it that they&#039;ve instead draped a cloak of irony and sarcasm as armor. Their idea of comedy is just saying the most outrageous shit ever to get clicks. Everyone does it. Nothing these days but a culture packed to the brim with dipshits and attention whores. It&#039;s also their way of filtering out non-cultists; the greatest irony being these people consider themselves &#039;open minded&#039;. Indeed, the very internet itself seems to be much more full of &quot;why this thing you like is bad&quot;, &quot;why that thing you like is cringe&quot;, and &quot;here is how you suck&quot; - from both sides of the political aisle. In other words, excessively judgemental. Other examples are people trying to &quot;gatekeep&quot; stuff, with millennials calling everything &quot;problematic/anti-white/pozzed/kike<wbr>d/degenerate/zoomified/etc&quot; for no real reason other than that they don&#039;t like it. Meanwhile, Tommy Wiseau&#039;s sincerity in making The Room is one of the main reasons why it became such a cult hit. He genuinely believed he was making art, and despite falling flat on his face when the movie first premiered, the movie eventually became a weird sort of success story where people rallied around this unintentionally hilarious film from an mysterious, eccentric dude because people gravitated towards him baring his soul in an embarrassing fashion. I wish millennials would try to emulate him instead of effeminately aping the &quot;not like other girls&quot; bullshit. At some point, you have to stop pretending to be retarded. Shit or get off the pot. Stop pretending to be zoomers and boomers using a way past cool site nobody gives a fuck about anymore. Stop pretending, period.

It inculcates exaggerated notions of \u2018true love\u2019, as a fire from without, a permanent exaltation, unrelated to age, childbearing, and plain life, and unrelated to will and purpose. (One result of that is to make young folk look for a \u2018love\u2019 that will keep them always nice and warm in a cold world, without any effort of theirs; and the incurably romantic go on looking even in the squalor of the divorce courts).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The sexual impulse makes women (naturally when unspoiled more unselfish) very sympathetic and understanding, or specially desirous of being so (or seeming so), and very ready to enter into all the interests, as far as they can, from ties to religion, of the young man they are attracted to. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Under this impulse they can in fact often achieve very remarkable insight and understanding, even of things otherwise outside their natural range: for it is their gift to be receptive, stimulated, fertilized (in many other matters than the physical) by the male.

If you&#039;re anti-Revolution you probably want to read the ultra-royalist Gaxotte. If you&#039;re pro-revolution, you definitely want to read somebody like Michelet, a firm republican. Carlyle has a great style and I liked reading him but he is what I like to call one of the 1789ers. That is somebody who felt the revolution shouldn&#039;t have gone past its constitutional monarchy phase. I will be honest with you most of the actually good shit about the French Revolution has not been translated into English so you&#039;re stuck having to go and find out of print books for any reasonable biographies.

He was born into the family of an obscure cloth maker named John Spenser, who belonged to the Merchant Taylors\u2019 Company and was married to a woman named Elizabeth, about whom almost nothing is known. Since parish records for the area of London where the poet grew up were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, his birth date is uncertain, though the dates of his schooling and a remark in one of his sonnets (Amoretti 60) lend credence to the date traditionally assigned, which is around 1552. Spenser\u2019s reinvention of classical pastoral, The Shepheardes Calendar, was admired by Sir Philip Sidney as a major contribution to the development of English literature and national culture. His epic poem, The Faerie Queene, was written in honor of Queen Elizabeth I and in celebration of the Tudor dynasty. Along with Sidney, Spenser set out to create a body of work that could parallel the great works of European poets such as Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio and extend the line of English literary culture began by Chaucer. Among Spenser\u2019s many contributions to English literature, he is the originator and namesake of the Spenserian stanza and the Spenserian sonnet.</span><br><br>Full biography here<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ets/edmund-spenser", "time": 1672736738, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472473, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472470</a><br>And here is the link to the full canto<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ems/45192/the-faerie-queene-book-i-<wbr>canto-i", "time": 1672736786, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472475, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:06:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472471</a>", "filename": "de7a7c52832d96f6e6aaea9156bc3f6b", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1939, "h": 1293, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672736817729387, "time": 1672736817, "md5": "BMaSLTfbt+uY9pETx1ymKA==", "fsize": 772180, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472512, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:32:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1672738343, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21473183, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)08:49:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472470</a><br>Very based", "time": 1672753777, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21473216, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)08:59:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So is the shield borrowed or what?

The most popular material for &quot;direct&quot; teaching of Latin is that of Hans \u00d8rberg, entitled lingua latina per se illustrata; in it one can already see several elements of the degradation described above. I quote the text of one of the first lessons, and ask the reader to pronounce everything, patiently, aloud:<br><br>iulia cantat: lalla. Iulia laeta est.<br>Marcus: st! Marcus laetus non est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus: ssst! Marcus iratus est.<br>Iulia cantat: lalla, lalla, lalla.<br>Marcus iuliam pulsat.<br>Iam iulia non cantat, sed plorat: uhuhu!<br>Marcus ridet: hahahaha!<br><br>It did not seem appropriate to reproduce the illustrations. So that the student doesn&#039;t have -- poor thing! -- to see a vocabulary, in which laetus would appear next to the translation &quot;joyful, happy&quot;, we have to repeat, like mental patients: iulia laeta est; marcus laetus non est, as we look at the illustrations, in which iulia appears smiling, and marcus, angry. After being hit by marcus, we read, iulia non cantat, sed plorat, which would already be repulsive enough to any living intelligence but still lacks the complement: uhuhu. And, as if marcus ridet weren&#039;t obvious enough, we still have to recite, with classroom gravity: hahahae. Anyone familiar with the language courses that are popular around the world is already familiar with these artifices, and knows that, in the classroom, they must be complemented by mime and other circus activities. And that&#039;s the price to pay if we want to eliminate translations. Before, we read Cicero and Horace to the children; now, we meditate on iulia and her uhuhu.<br><br>1", "time": 1672784553, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475303, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:23:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475229</a><br>In fairness, every athletic achievement since the advent of hormonal supplementation is invalid, male or female.", "time": 1672784598, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475305, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:23:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I know that many, especially those whose mentality has already been irremediably deformed by modern pedagogy, will claim that this is necessary for the little ones. What can you tell me about adults who study using the same method, and who are, by the way, the majority? Has this time already degenerated to the point of losing track of the obvious? Anyone who stoops to reading aloud -- worse, to acting -- the story reproduced above, muffling the natural revolt and sense of ridicule, becomes even more stupid in the act. There is no quicker way to stupidity than to make a willful idiot of yourself; this has always been known to men, by virtue of mere intuition.<br>Today, in addition, there is even the developed discipline of psychodrama, used by social engineers to reduce children&#039;s brains to dust, turning them smoothly into automatons. Language courses use these techniques to inculcate linguistic habits, and most users think that nothing else happens in the process. It is irresponsible naivety.<br><br>The great pedagogues have always recognized the importance of teaching with high quality material, not from the point of view of didactic effectiveness, but from the point of view of objective literary value. Not even the simple recitation of a text could dispense with the examination of its content, as it would be imprinted in the memory and, therefore, would have some effect on the soul. This practice degenerated, in the modern age, into mere moralistic training (leading to the monstrous psychological manipulation promoted today in classrooms by globalist organizations), but it was originally more ambitious: it aimed to imprint in the child&#039;s mind images of everything that was good and beautiful, and always to be the best from the beginning. This was the demand of Quintilian, perhaps the greatest pedagogue of antiquity and certainly one of the most influential, both in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance: that the child, as soon as he began to write his first words, copy excerpts from poets and maxims of high moral content; and that, when she was reading with some ease, she should read the great Virgil right away. And he added, perhaps anticipating the objection of the moderns: to understand Virgil&#039;s virtues, a more trained intelligence is needed; however, there will be plenty of time for that, and it will not be read just once... What would Quintilian think of our Laeta Iulia and her Marcus Iratus, who are applauded, not by inexperienced and immature children, but even by adults in universities?&quot;<br><br>2<br><br>https://rafaelfalcon.com.br/wp-cont<wbr>ent/uploads/2016/09/Sobre-a-Arte-de<wbr>-Ler-em-Latim.pdf<br>google translate", "time": 1672784615, "resto": 21473291}, {"no": 21475313, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)17:25:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21475301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475301</a><br><a href=\"#p21475305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21475305</a><br>Wow, thank you sir, now I can understand 2 year old level Latin!

The Colloquia, despite having relatively simple vocabulary and a more didactic structure than that of Cicero&#039;s texts, are dialogues of great elegance, whose style is very reminiscent of Terence. Some critics claim that it was in the Colloquia that Erasmus achieved his most perfect literary expression. However, in the preface our author had to justify himself for, being a mature man, dedicating his attention to \u201cchildishness\u201d. The work seemed excessively puerile and vulgar, since the subject of the dialogues was light, and its treatment, mildly comic, literary characteristics convenient to the genre, but little accepted by the morality of the time, formed as it was in the principles of Quintilian. Nor did Erasmus think much differently \u2013 he reaffirms many times, in his De Ratione Studii, that one must read the best materials from the beginning and he justified these lighter texts as the sugar we add to certain medicines, to make it easier for children to take them. If his dialogues, which are veritable works of literature, were like sweetened medicine for him, what would he say about Hans \u00d8rberg? Pure sugar, and without the medicine together! What result can something like that have, if not a type of intellectual diabetes?<br><br>What I say about \u00d8rberg applies, with all due proportions, to any method that uses adapted or facilitated texts, or that follows the principles of the \u201cnatural method\u201d. And yet many, more and more, will continue to use them and justify themselves, while they postpone again and again, as adults, what the pupils of blessed Alcuin did in their earliest childhood. It is because \u201cthey are not yet prepared\u201d for the classics; the old methods are \u201ctoo hard\u201d. Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of the essayist Thomas Carlyle, memorized by herself, at the age of four, the declension of the word penna, to convince her father to send her to Latin school. At nine, she was reading Virgil. In the 19th century, this method was good enough for a four-year-old Englishwoman, but it no longer works for a thirty-year-old American. Don&#039;t talk to me, Erasmus, about &quot;childishness&quot;. This is the age of childishness.

For that exact conclusion I was thinking about works such as Parcifal or Faust, and people like Goethe and Wagner in general. I don&#039;t know much about literature myself, but I can safely say that fiction of that caliber, basically any of these &quot;greatest&quot; books are perfect examples of that greatness from antithetical approach to literature from nonfiction.<br><br>The reason I say different is because that intelligence that is mostly associated with &quot;smartness&quot; is very much composed of many things. It just happened to be that it&#039;s the most clear and seemingly obvious representation of it is through subjective brain aneurysms that is non fiction literature. <br><br>Yet fiction works that achieved legendary status possesses much more of that &quot;realism&quot; or should I say &quot;truth&quot; that is mirrored from the world we live in. And so it takes a very special person to do so, one may say an intelligent one to deliver such work that would be so welcomed by the general public.<br><br>Now, I haven&#039;t completely comprehended the work that I&#039;m reciting here, but from what I understand, the main difference that is between supposed &quot;smart people&quot; and others is the amount of natural intuition they possess, or rather how little those supposed &quot;smart people&quot; have it in comparison.<br><br>This amount of intuition, considering many things, reflects on your general comprehension of reality. The fact that there is a clear difference in approach and reach between fiction and non fiction is reflective by product of the perception types that individuals possess.<br><br>Wide and shallow, thin and deep are the characteristics that define this difference. Keep in mind that this fact reaches far beyond just literature, yet it is a good example non a less. Also, it does not necessarily set a rigid rule. Wagner being proof of that, having a decently wide approach, yet absolutly not compromised in depth. It&#039;s just an approximate border from which we can work around.<br><br>Above mentioned qualities, as much as they are gross simplification, still a closest note to the true definition of difference. Both of them have equal cons and pros, being equal to the duality they are, and neither should be valued more over the other. Unfortunately this is not how we view it and depending on the time and place in our history, one is more dominant and valued than the other.<br><br>Long story short, things such as &quot;smart and dumb&quot; are mostly superficial, definition of which changes according to historical needs and periods. Both of them possess their own achievements and uses.<br><br>I&#039;ll even go as far as to say that works of fiction are more intelligent, since as much as the stories, character and themes can be much more basic and rigid, it is through equal wide reflection from all mediums combined in reference you could start to see it&#039;s true epiphany.
