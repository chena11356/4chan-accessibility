The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil. When she moved, the people of Al-Riyadhah were so accepting (they are so even to this day) a stranger could mistake her for a native.</span><br>You can delete like 1/2 of that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She found an occupation by fixing broken electrical appliances and selling them.

After saving enough money, she expanded her business by importing new electrical appliances from The Middle Kingdom. The town was only a couple miles from a popular trading route. They were mainly tools like saw machines and drills or conveniences such as lights and fans.</span><br>Pacing bro pacing. You&#039;re just listing exposition after exposition.

Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences. There are correlations which will inevitably become apparent, but which may never have without the work of Jungian typists, and there are even specialized psychologists who legitimately apply treatment under consideration of a Myers-Briggs type.

How can you complement one another and raise your kids with certain values if you don&#039;t have similar mindsets? Plus, I believe the types of relationships that last are the ones where the man and woman have commonalities that go deeper than just the romantic/sexual aspect to the point of being a genuine team. Even if there are differences in mindset (which there will be), the similarities will allow one to see the other side of things. It&#039;s hard to fake that sort of oneness of purpose and of flesh which your average marriage doesn&#039;t have outside of birthing and raising kids, which is why so many people get divorced or end up not loving each other after the kids leave. I&#039;ve seen couples just not talk to each other or have ANYTHING in common and I don&#039;t understand how some people tolerate that. That just seems like a miserable existence. If you share a house and a life with someone, it only makes sense to share a lot in common mentally and spiritually with the other your spouse, especially if you have kids. Kids deserve to be born into a healthy household where their birth and rearing only enhances the libe the parents dote upon them. I think society should rethink how we treat romance and love.

You are melting into mush and it&#039;s an irreversible process if you go too far. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; How to I brainwash myself into enjoying work more </span><br>This is the key to your mistake. You are falling into a version of the hedonic paradox, where you are trying to consciously will your current subjective state of mind into/onto another subjective state (pleasure/fun) while staying completely subjectively conscious, i.e. not melding with the objective at all. That&#039;s not how any human activity works. We are supposed to lose ourselves in things, look up Csiksantmihayli&#039;s &quot;flow&quot; concept. <br><br>You do need to do a little bit of alchemy and self-steering, obviously, like you need to be in a job you basically don&#039;t despise and doing tasks you basically enjoy, ideally. But the part of the problem you are missing is &quot;hard&quot; obstacles, objective tasks that simply need doing, regardless of your subjective assenting to them or finding them fun. You will find out IN HINDSIGHT that you found it fun or got really engaged with something objective, after you are in it or done with it. You can&#039;t will yourself to enjoy work as if it&#039;s play, that&#039;s tautologically meaningless, work and play are antitheses. You need to fall or lapse into the kind of &quot;flow&quot; that turns work into play, and this can only be done when the subjective mind is not autistically, autarkically awake and active, sitting on grandma&#039;s couch and reducing the whole world to playthings for itself.<br><br>The opposite extreme is also bad obviously, living entirely to work and seeing any attempt to abstract from your work and ask &quot;do I really enjoy this?&quot; as a weakness, Protestant ethic type shit. But you are in no danger of that extreme, you are in danger of the &quot;gifted underachiever&quot; basement dweller syndrome extreme, where 15 years go by in a flash and you are just a 45 year old anime watching loser on the dole. <br><br>Find objective things to do NOW. Also start treating yourself like an addict. What do we do with addicts? We treat them like objects, not subjects. You don&#039;t sit there for ten hours convincing an addict not to touch the drugs on the table. You take the drugs off the table and lock the door. Start imposing hard restrictions on yourself. This is a very common problem of terminally online &quot;underachievers,&quot; they only ever see themselves as an abstract subject abstractly subjectively regarding themselves, from the comfort of the basement. They never experience the fun of obstacles, of looking back in hindsight at obstacles overcome. They never grow and see themselves in concreto, they remain a seed forever, with infinite virtual possibilities but no actuality.", "time": 1671831513, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21424918, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)16:41:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424902</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeff</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opposite of hep; unhip, uncool or opposed to hipness.</span><br><br>rude", "time": 1671831695, "resto": 21424390}, {"no": 21425031, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)17:07:59", "name": "the xi jinping of weed smoking", "com": "I&#039;ve been building a tower for years and it will collapse someday.

I looked in an amateur astronomy book and discovered that this was the Cassiopeia open star cluster. I also read that people use it as a vision test, and that people with good vision can resolve individual stars. I realized that I was near-sighted, informed my father, and saw an optometrist, who gave me glasses. All of a sudden my world popped out in super-HD. I looked up at the night sky and saw a field of brilliant, glistening diamonds. I read the book further, and began to learn more about the universe, and the constellations. I asked for a small telescope for Christmas, and got one. I began to pour through amateur astronomy books and magazines, observing every change I could get, my curiosity endlessly inspired. I constructed a larger 10&quot; Dobsonian telescope, which revealed more of the universe&#039;s grandeur. One night when I was staring at the night sky everything I had learned and experienced came together in a gestalt. The galaxy was no longer &quot;there,&quot; but here, all around, the galaxy popped out in three dimensions and I had the perception of being on a sphere in space. This experience was so moving that it brought me to tears. When I was 16 I took classes in amateur astronomy at the local community college, and did so well that I got student of the year award.<br><br>Meanwhile I was completely failing in school, and had to make up work during the summers. The teachers were horrible, and my peers were completely caught up in hedonistic pursuits and monkey-ass social status games. I had found the REAL shit, and nobody else seemed to care or be interested in anything similar (I lived in a backwards conservative county that was a cultural wasteland of mini-malls and churches.) I grew ever more alienated from the dumb-ass world around me.<br><br>Eventually I had to take a high-school equivalency test, passed, and began to attend the community college full-time. My first semester I took a philosophy course with the most outstanding teacher I ever have had: Johnny Terry. This man lived to teach and inspire curiosity. He was flamingly gay in every sense of the word. His animation and passion was infectious, he argued the philosophical position in question so well that it was impossible to tell what he actually believed. This man was infected by the REAL shit! He expanded my narrow interest in astronomy to a general love of knowledge and creative experience. I became absorbed and fascinated by my other classes, I did lots of outside reading in the subjects I studied, I experimented with electronic music and art. It was a personal Renaissance.

This was epic self-initiation into adulthood; I was living the REAL shit! When this was over, I went to live with my father, and began to re-attend classes.<br><br>Except no, oh no.

It no longer produces anything of value. No meaningful discourse or discussion can occur there. Board culture has stagnated and in many ways de-evolved. It has become exactly the kind of vapid, retarded, schizophrenic wankery that the site once derided. Internet culture and more specifically chan culture is a reflection of the people using the site and society in general at the time. It&#039;s just a mirror. It reflects whatever you show it back at you. Early 4chan was a synthesis of an extremely specific set of factors at a specific point in time that will probably never coalesce again. A shitty economy, a general malaise of apathy among the youth, anime and gamer culture being obscure and ostracized, &quot;The internet&quot; having a barrier to entry, how fucked up and unmoderated the early internet was etc. Chances were, if you used the internet back then you had seen some shit. But anyway, people like to congregate with other people that have the same interests as they do. Where do you hang out if you&#039;re some loser living in a shit town with few or no friends and you spend your time playing Warcraft 3 custom games and watching Ego Proxy or whatever? you find the other social outcasts online because people in real life who have the same hobbies as you don&#039;t exist. The point being that there is an extremely specific kind of person who would waste the best years of their life on an anime website where there&#039;s a 9 out of 10 chance on any given day that you&#039;re going to see a picture of someone cutting their own dick off. These people congregate together and a baseline of culture forms from their mutual interests, experiences and attitudes. The culture evolves over time as knowledge about the site spreads through word of mouth, or people discover the site after raids or fox news specials or whatever. Site culture gradually shifts as the demographics of the user base change. At the same time popular culture shifts as more people of all ages gain access to the internet, media corporations begin to target a wider demographic of casual consumers rather than a niche of hardcore fans. Subcultures are exploited by corporations and integrated into popular culture. Someone emails their friend a funny cat picture not realising where it came from, or that the person who made it probably also jacks off to lolicon tentacle rape doujuns.

Upvotes, retweets, reacts, shares etc. On 4chan the success of a thread is measured by the number of replies it receives. Because of the ephemeral nature of imageboards, users do not have any way to accumulate a representation of authority or post quality. Inversely there&#039;s very little repurcussion for being banned because there&#039;s no account to lose. These dynamics incentivize the poster to create a thread/post that will generate as many replies as possible. In theory, this will produce good content. Interesting posts will attract replies while retarded faggotory will attract sages, moderators or nothing at all. People will of course game this system for one reason or another. Clickbait is prevalent on YouTube because people can make money from it. Posting pictures of your cat on fifteen different subreddits to farm karma works because Reddit rewards banal, kitsch, inoffensive content. Posting bait to 4chan works because the user base is fucking retarded. People who get their kicks by pretending to be fools will soon find themselves surrounded by fools who think they are in good company. 4chan had a reputation for being le sekrit hacker club, so they naturally attracted every edgy 14 year old who could figure out how to download LoIC. Once external raids and harassment campaigns were cracked down on by the mods the user base seemed to turn inwards and begin eating itself. This came to a head in the post election years as more and more boards were saturated with low quality content.

Anons went from sincerely enjoying things, to ironically liking things and then pure hatred. Except not, it became the default to be a contrarian asshole except when you were only pretending, and actually everyone else was retarded for not seeing that you were fucking with them the whole time. It&#039;s faster to call everyone a cuck onions drinker and move on than it is trying to decipher the 9000 layers of meta comedy and half winking irony that everything was covered in.

This has accelerated the drop in post quality to the point where bot posts are indistinguishable from human posters. At which point, why even bother posting at all. There was a time that anons were comrades in misery. You didn&#039;t end up on 4chan because you were successful or had your life together. You were more than likely an outsider, a loser, fucked up in one way or another. Unmotivated. Devoid of purpose or meaning - flotsam of the modern world - just drifting. But that thread, that shared understanding, connected you to other anons in a way that it didn&#039;t with normal people. There was shit like The Well-Cultured Anonymous, an earnest effort by anons to help other anons unfuck themselves. Anons encouraged other anons to find purpose and meaning in their lives. Years ago I tried to give anons help and advice the same way that other anons had helped me. I had hoped that they would, in turn, carry it forward and help the next generation of &quot;weird kids&quot; to better themselves. I no longer feel this way. The anger that anons feel doesn&#039;t dissipate or drive them. Rather it feels like it&#039;s compounding. Their rage is directed back in on itself and becomes magnified. They no longer seem to want to escape from their misery, or even try. The ones that do are crucified as &quot;normies&quot; or &quot;chads&quot;. Now they are like crabs in a bucket. If one tries to escape the others drag him back down. Assuming that the original wave of 4chan posters were somewhere between 15 to 25 years old then most would be somewhere in their late 30s if not 40s by now. By the same metric most anons from the &quot;golden age&quot; of 4chan (00s up to the early 10s) would now be in their late 20s. I wonder what became of them all. I wonder how many anons never made it. That one kid with the rainbow face mask who ate a shotgun in front of a blue tarpaulin. Lowtax went out the same way. Or the anon who set himself on fire in his dorm. Zyzz died of a heart attack. All the an hero threads, some of them had to have gone through with it, or were lost to drugs or alcohol or their own demons somewhere along the way. Inversely how many made it and did something with their lives? How many bought a home? got married or had children? Mandalore, SSeth, ExaminedLifeOfGaming/Hoplopfheil and shoe0nhead are confirmed former channers, as are ContraPoints and Shaun. Those are all the ones off the top of my head, but there are definitely others. Moot keeps a low profile these days and seems to be doing well.

Sadness should have no place on the birthday of life. The fear of death has been swallowed up; life brings us joy with the promise of eternal happiness. <br>No one is shut out from this joy; all share the same reason for rejoicing. Our Lord, victor over sin and death, finding no man free from sin, came to free us all. Let the saint rejoice as he sees the palm of victory at hand. Let the sinner be glad as he receives the offer of forgiveness. Let the pagan take courage as he is summoned to life. <br>In the fullness of time, chosen in the unfathomable depths of God\u2019s wisdom, the Son of God took for himself our common humanity in order to reconcile it with its creator. He came to overthrow the devil, the origin of death, in that very nature by which he had overthrown mankind. <br>And so at the birth of our Lord the angels sing in joy: Glory to God in the highest, and they proclaim peace to men of good will as they see the heavenly Jerusalem being built from all the nations of the world. When the angels on high are so exultant at this marvellous work of God\u2019s goodness, what joy should it not bring to the lowly hearts of men? <br>Beloved, let us give thanks to God the Father, through his Son, in the Holy Spirit, because in his great love for us he took pity on us, and when we were dead in our sins he brought us to life with Christ, so that in him we might be a new creation. Let us throw off our old nature and all its ways and, as we have come to birth in Christ, let us renounce the works of the flesh. <br>Christian, remember your dignity, and now that you share in God\u2019s own nature, do not return by sin to your former base condition. Bear in mind who is your head and of whose body you are a member. Do not forget that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and brought into the light of God\u2019s kingdom. <br>Through the sacrament of baptism you have become a temple of the Holy Spirit.

Certainly any intelligent reader can read and understand it, if he returns to the text again and again. He is setting out on an adventure with words. &#039;Work in Progress&#039; can satisfy more readers than any other book because it gives them the opportunity to use their own ideas in the reading. Some readers will be interested in the exploration of words, the play of technique, the philological experiment in each poetic unit. Each word has the charm of a living thing and each living thing is plastic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;Emotion has dictated the course and detail of my book, and in emotional writing one arrives at the unpredictable which can be of more value, since its sources are deeper, than the products of the intellectual method....In writing one must create an endlessly changing surface, dictated by the mood and curent impulse in contrast to the fixed mood of the classical style. That is &#039;Work in Progress&#039;. The important thing is not what we write, but how we write, and in my opinion the modern writer must be an adventurer above all, willing to take every risk, and be prepared to founder in his effort if need be. in other words we must write dangerously: everything is inclined to flux and change nowadays and modern literature, to be valid, must express that flux....A book, in my opinion, should not be planned out beforehand, but as one writes it will form itself, subject, as I say, to the constant emotional promptings of one&#039;s personality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, it doesn&#039;t have a title yet. The few fragments which I have published have been enough to convince many critics that I have finally lost my mind, which by the way they have been predicting faithfully for many years. And perhaps it is madness to grind up words in order to extract their substance, or to graft them one onto another, to create crossbreeds and unknown variants, to open up unsuspected possibilities for these words, to marry sounds which were not usually joined together before, although they were meant for one another, to allow water to speak like water, birds to chirp in the words of birds, to liberate all sounds of rustling, breaking, arguing, shouting, cracking, whistling, creaking, gurgling - from their servile, contemptible role and to attach them to the feelers of expressions which grope for definitions of the undefined. I took literally Gautier&#039;s dictum, &#039;The inexpressible does not exist.&#039; With this hash of sounds I am building the great myth of everyday life.</span>", "filename": "joyceyoung", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 328, "h": 404, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671824399948990, "time": 1671824399, "md5": "k1QSTSkzTyc+3LFM0UXC8Q==", "fsize": 35408, "resto": 21422133}, {"no": 21424518, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:15:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422604</a><br>not really, finwake is a pretty useless site (fweet is much better for looking things up), and Joyce never expected anyone to get all the references. what&#039;s important is the personal connections that you make yourself. finnegans wake was intended to have multiple equally valid meanings for every line.", "filename": "215ABEE6-9B87-46AA-9DA1-B1A5BD586A1A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2329, "h": 1873, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1671826506592208, "time": 1671826506, "md5": "l+4b3r4h37rsij3BwrnN0Q==", "fsize": 1937359, "resto": 21422133}, {"no": 21424532, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)15:17:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422133</a><br>Is that Irish or just some made up bs?", "time": 1671826675, "resto": 21422133}, {"no": 21425267, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)18:09:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422133</a><br>I hate the Irish so much it&#039;s unreal", "time": 1671836980, "resto": 21422133}, {"no": 21425360, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)18:32:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21422508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21422508</a><br>nabokov is actually the one molested in his childood by his uncle.

Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his \u201cprophetic works\u201d were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form &quot;what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language&quot;. His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him &quot;far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced&quot;. In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC&#039;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as &quot;the body of God&quot; or &quot;human existence itself&quot;.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as &quot;Pre-Romantic&quot;. In fact, he has been said to be &quot;a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism&quot;. A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions. Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake&#039;s work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a &quot;glorious luminary&quot;, and &quot;a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors&quot;.</span>", "filename": "William Blake", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1023, "h": 703, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1671877066949523, "time": 1671877066, "md5": "VFBerT3MvfTMY5zdWGMuzg==", "fsize": 131438, "resto": 21427185}, {"no": 21427240, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)05:40:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Funny Blake quote I came across on wiki<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There have been claims by people in the past, like William Blake, to have seen fairy funerals.

Definitely the Castle has more unity of action. The Trial has a lot of content removed by the editor at the back of the book now, such as development of the relationship with Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrnster, whom K. is told by her roommate to please leave alone and yet he persists in stalking thinking a low key typist can\u2019t say no to him, a prestigious bank Clark, making it clear his relationship with her is one or aggressive harassment. K. in both the novels he is in is very different from the sons of The Judgement, America and Metamorphosis. I think Barnabas is the corollary character for The Castle. K is not based on Franz, and may even be based on his father, Hermann Kafka, who was a bank clerk and left his family at s young age to join the army (as K in The Castle did). Franz said in his letter to father than he, that is Franz, lacked the Kafka assertiveness and way unlike his dad, and K reflects those traits. K also though is predatory, no only with women, but the little boy for example in The Castle whom he pulls between his legs despite the boy resisting and says he will give him a walking stick. This is in contrast to Franz characters, for example Karl is raped by the maid, the Stoker has him lie down on his bed which is suggestive, and a girl throws him on his back in her room against his will and it says he was humiliated and embarrassed by her, so Karl go through scenarios indicating being sexually assaulted whereas K is an aggressive womanizer", "time": 1671910035, "resto": 21424755}, {"no": 21430041, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:19:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Trial nails the atmosphere much better than any other book of his, and than any other book period, really.", "time": 1671931167, "resto": 21424755}, {"no": 21430120, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)20:53:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21424755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21424755</a><br>Kafka was a religious writer and his obsession over guilt was quite appealing to Christians.

His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. </span><br>I\u2019m in love with this essay even though I don\u2019t understand it. Have you ever felt this way about a piece of work?

For one, we are experiencing a revolution which is similar to the inventions of written languages and the printing press with the outgrowth of this distributed network we call the internet. This is going to change how we view the world on a metaphysical level. For instance, I personally don&#039;t even see myself as an individual in a Cartesian sense. There is no stable subjectivity, which is fully distinct from the world around it. To put it in more schizo terms, its like I am a temporary grounding point where millions of minute electrical signals compose flows that are redirected through this point in every which way. Identity for me consists of something entirely different than identity for previous generations. It&#039;s more amorphous, and detached. You could say that this is just my personal mental illness or something, but there&#039;s also been an explosion in mental health issues the past few decades among the entire population - and especially the younger you get. This notion of, &quot;oh, it&#039;s just a phase, every generation complains about the next generation!&quot; is reddit tier melodrama that is analogous to putting your head in the sand. No, you can quite clearly see that there is nothing normal about my generation. Even if society would like to think it is business as usual, it just isn&#039;t true. There was no end of history. The prior generations have this weird conservatism where they genuinely believe in this clap trap. Peak oil alone should demonstrate to you the poverty of this facile conservatism, where you just explain away intergenerational differences.

Zoomers are pretty much taught to write things in rigid coherence to structure on the level of the essay taken as a whole, but with practically no attention paid to sentence structure itself. I was told as a child that you should never use a particular conjuction at the beginning of a sentence more than once throughout any given paragraph. I was taught as a child to follow an outline that goes something like this: introductory paragraph: hook --&gt; introduction/contextualization --&gt; thesis; Body paragraph 1, 2, and possibly 3: Hook --&gt; contextualization --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Counterargument paragraph: Hook --&gt; statement of antithesis --&gt; statement of refutation of antithesis --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation --&gt; evidence --&gt; explanation; Conclusion: hook --&gt; restatement of thesis --&gt; summary of evidence --&gt; closing statement/call to action. I realized early on how systematic it was, and played into it. And lo and behold, I had the highest scores in the reading and writing sections of the ACT out of everyone in my grade. And this is despite the fact that my writing was not anything particularly impressive. Not that I blame English teachers alone, this is a problem endemic to the entire education system in America. Teachers don&#039;t have any incentive to actually teach kids. I remember in 4th grade I had a rather queer way of holding my pencil - between my middle and ring finger at the second knuckle of my fingers - which made it more difficult for me to write cursive. Naturally, my teacher simply gave up and just passed me along. He&#039;s now a principal. The kids don&#039;t make it easy anyhow. I know how it is.

People at least try to do an accent when they speak Spanish, even a bad one. Anglos don&#039;t even attempt an Italic accent when speaking Latin. They just pronounce it like it&#039;s English rearranged in some kind of code.

We could go in the weeds a little deeper, especially since you think Mary refers to Jesus&#039; mother, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the olive tree thing.<br>I&#039;m interested in buying rather old things. I almost bid on a lot containing a couple Ethiopian texts and some metal objects this week. I never bid, and it went out of my price range. But in that same auction, there were a bunch of signet rings and cylinder seals. I really like the look of that stuff and cameos too. It looks like you might know a thing or two about them. What do you look for in terms of provenance and authenticity? Can you give any further information about your collecting? All the people that I know from university hate privately held antiquities and such, meaning they won&#039;t give advice. I&#039;m very much of the opposite position. Several years ago, before even studying Classics, I think I looked at the online store of one of the most prolific and shitty forgery factories before some people at my university exposed it and the FBI shut them down. Thus, I&#039;m quite concerned about provenance and doing my due diligence when a bunch of an item&#039;s value is wrapped up in it being really old or made by a particular person.", "time": 1671785081, "resto": 21409393}, {"no": 21422248, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)04:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21421931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21421931</a><br>Because it basically died out in favor of reconstructed pronunciation.

They are depicted as romanticized villains on the one hand and as genuine social rebels on the other. Life Under the Jolly Roger examines the political and cultural significance of these nomadic outlaws by relating historical accounts to a wide range of theoretical concepts\u2014reaching from Marshall Sahlins and Pierre Clastres to Mao Zedong and Eric J. Hobsbawm via Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault. With daring theoretical speculation and passionate, respectful inquiry, Gabriel Kuhn skillfully contextualizes and analyzes the meanings of race, gender, sexuality, and disability in golden age pirate communities, while also surveying the breathtaking array of pirates\u2019 forms of organization, economy, and ethics. Life Under the Jolly Roger also provides an extensive catalog of scholarly references for the academic reader. Yet this delightful and engaging study is written in language that is wholly accessible for a wide audience. This expanded second edition includes an appendix with interviews about contemporary piracy, the ongoing fascination with pirate imagery, and the thorny issue of colonial implications in the romanticization of pirates.", "filename": "007f4ace", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 334, "h": 499, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671967523838421, "time": 1671967523, "md5": "6QHwn7zkj0ytXY166NRTRA==", "fsize": 39033, "resto": 21429411}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21429834, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What in the devil did you just fucking say about me, you little coward?

The first of these is the doctrine of dukkha: there is suffering. The Three Marks of Existence provide a deeper understanding of what is meant by dukkha. These three characteristics of existence are accepted by all schools of Buddhism.<br><br>The first mark is anicca, or Impermanence. All things in reality change and that change is constant. There is no permanent state because all things are dependent on other constantly changing things. This is also known as conditioned existence because all things are conditioned by what they are dependent upon. Even our mental states are constantly changing from one moment to the next. It is important to accept this concept so we can adjust to the reality of life and ease the anxiousness we feel in response to changing circumstances.<br><br>The second mark is anatta, or Insubstantiality. A person is not a distinct identity that is fixed. Each person exists as a process of changing aspects of being that are called skandhas. When these skandhas are put together they give the sense of an individual. However, this individual is insubstantial because the skandhas are impermanent, interdependent and constantly changing. The five skandhas are rupa, the physical material of the universe; vendana, sensations that come from interaction with the rupa; sanna, the perception of matter and thought through sensations; sankhara, deliberate mental formation of a response to that perception; and vinnana, the state of mind resulting from a pattern of mental formations, or consciousness. Each skandha is dependent on the other, and none can exist if even one is removed. This changing process we identify as a person can continue in rebirth, as a plant continues the process of the plant from which it originates.<br><br>The third mark of existence is dukkha, or Suffering. This mark can be understood in three ways. Suffering itself is understood in our direct experience of pain or uneasiness, but this is not our entire experience of life in general. We also experience dukkha in frustration when pleasant experiences end, and we long for more. The third means of understanding dukkha is the experience of not being completely satisfied when expectations are unfulfilled. This results in dissatisfaction or a feeling that life is meaningless.", "time": 1671958682, "resto": 21430042}, {"no": 21431530, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)06:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21430042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21430042</a><br>yknow what, idk why people bother philosophers beyond the greeks, rest of philosophers sounds so fucking outdated, retarded and insane.

Grace is about a sort of intervention. Dubliners is about a man discovering that his wife will never love truly love him. There is an effort by Joyce to mute what is typically a bombastic style, what is seen in full force when one reads Ulysses, but dubliners seeks what seems to be a subtler path. I&#039;ve often heard criticisms describe his pursuit as that of the epiphany, and when viewed through that lens, it makes far more sense. nothing seems to anger people more than suggesting this, but sometimes you just have to dig under the surface for what you want, and sometimes it&#039;s not what you came for, but it&#039;s still worthwhile. to answer your question about &quot;understanding joyce&quot;, that&#039;s a hard road, and dubliners is helpful for understanding the more bare pervasive themes that are exploded in something like Ulysses. there are things he&#039;s trying to keep secret from you, the reader. he&#039;s purposefully obscuring meaning, not just from you, but also from censors. think about his environment, the overt religious pressure to produce moral works, the academia that surrounded him, the nationalistic pride that he so obviously despised, especially for trying to pin him with the responsibility to uphold their beliefs. if you decide to read Ulysses, Cyclops is about this nationalistic figure, for example. I don&#039;t know what to tell you, but there&#039;s more to a work than the prose, and to make this very clear, joyce has shown he&#039;s capable of both a subdued and precise series of works, and soemthing that surges forth beyond anything that preceded it and strikes the world with his genius.", "time": 1671955001, "resto": 21431065}, {"no": 21431155, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)02:57:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Dead*, not Dubliners (the wife bit)", "time": 1671955061, "resto": 21431065}, {"no": 21431283, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)03:53:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431152</a><br>An Encounter was brilliant, among the best short stories I&#039;ve read.

It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried.

Others have remained and are fighting valiantly in defence of Ukraine.<br><br>Who has left and who has stayed is not entirely a matter of choice. Men, age 18 to 60, have, with few exceptions, been barred from leaving the country. They are required to remain and defend the country. Those who have managed to dodge the draft by fleeing the country have been ostracised by others, including women who themselves have left the country.3<br><br>In some ways, that is unremarkable. Men have been bearing the burden of military service for almost all of human history. On the other hand, this is 2022 and, in many countries, women have the same rights as men. They are enfranchised and hold public office, attend university (often in greater numbers than men), and are doctors, lawyers, and accountants.<br><br>This, many say, is not enough. They complain that there are disproportionately few women in privileged positions, such as in legislatures and the higher ranks of business and academia. By contrast, it is very rare to hear complaints that there are disproportionately many men in undesirable positions, including combat.<br><br>Whereas, in many countries, women have been permitted to join the military and even to enter combat, they are still rarely conscripted and almost never forced into combat. We hear surprisingly little criticism of this from those who purport to be interested in equality of the sexes. Why?<br><br>One possible answer is that there are average differences between the sexes, such as greater upper-body strength, which make men more suitable for combat. If that is so, then the discrimination against men may be said to be justified.<br><br>However, those who offer this argument would have to explain why sex differences would not justify some forms of discrimination against women. Why, for example, would it not justify excluding from combat those women who want to fight? By contrast, if we acknowledge that some women have the capacity to perform combat roles, why should we not conscript those people, whether they are male or female, who have the necessary capacities?", "time": 1671924804, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429742, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:33:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429739</a><br>Yeah, and?

Even if young men, on average, are more suited to combat than women of the same age, many ageing men, with their failing eyesight, weakening backs, expanding bellies, and deteriorating cardiovascular systems, will be less suitable than younger women.<br>If using a person\u2019s sex (and underweighting their age) as a proxy for those capacities, is not a justification for excluding willing and able women from combat, it is not a justification for including unwilling and unable men. Where two people are both able but unwilling, it is sex discrimination to compel only the man but not the woman.<br>One possible objection, at least in the Ukrainian case, is that somebody must accompany children to safety and that women are better suited to that. Why might women be better suited?<br><br>One possible explanation is social: women are socialized as child-carers and for this reason make better carers. Those who wish to advance this rationale must recognize that it could, as it often has been, also be used to justify discrimination against women in other contexts. If they are not willing to countenance that implication, they should resist it in the current case.<br><br>Another possible explanation is biological. Only women can breastfeed nursing infants. The problem with this explanation is that it would apply only to breastfeeding mothers. Many younger women are not mothers. Breastfeeding does not explain why those younger women should be allowed to leave while older men are not. A ban on departure could make exceptions for breastfeeding mothers and, in the case of older children, for one parent \u2013 of either sex. Which parent it is, could be determined by each family (even though that would likely result in many more men than women staying).<br>Another biological explanation that would apply to currently nulliparous women is that many more women than men are necessary to repopulate. Thus, male lives are more expendable. That argument, like earlier ones, is also dangerous for those opposing discrimination against women. This is because it cuts both ways. For example, it can be used to bar women from combat and other dangerous activities even when they wish to undertake them.<br>Perhaps the last refuge of those wishing to justify the practice of a blunt, sex-based bar on leaving Ukraine, is to appeal to some perceived practical problem with implementing a less discriminatory policy. While any such purported problem would have to be engaged on its merits (or demerits), it suffices here to say that sex discrimination is easy. If we must expend the effort, as we should, to avoid sex discrimination against women, we must do the same when the victims of sex discrimination are men. <br><br>https://journalofcontroversialideas<wbr>.org/article/2/2/207/htm", "time": 1671924871, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429753, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:36:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429683</a><br>it&#039;s great if a little dry, chapter 2 is the best and most critical.", "time": 1671925017, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429755, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:37:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429742</a><br>Results&gt;Appearances<br>Women prioritizing appearances over results from unearned positions of power is the reason western society keeps growing more and more dysfunctional by the day.", "time": 1671925056, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429769, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:41:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "regardless of your take on supposed male discrimination, naming the book \u2018the second sexism\u2019 in reference to beauvoir is hilariously pathetic", "time": 1671925283, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429770, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)18:42:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429755</a><br>Men don&#039;t want women to be anything more than decorative.

There the immediate inference is that the individual in question does not perform this wasteful expenditure and undergo this disability for her own personal gain in pecuniary repute, but in behalf of some one else to whom she stands in a relation of economic dependence; a relation which in the last analysis must, in economic theory, reduce itself to a relation of servitude.<br><br>To apply this generalization to women&#039;s dress, and put the matter in concrete terms: the high heel, the skirt, the impracticable bonnet, the corset, and the general disregard of the wearer&#039;s comfort which is an obvious feature of all civilized women&#039;s apparel, are so many items of evidence to the effect that in the modern civilized scheme of life the woman is still, in theory, the economic dependent of the man\u2014that, perhaps in a highly idealized sense, she still is the man&#039;s chattel. The homely reason for all this conspicuous leisure and attire on the part of women lies in the fact that they are servants to whom, in the differentiation of economic functions, has been delegated the office of putting in evidence their master&#039;s ability to pay. There is a marked similarity in these respects between the apparel of women and that of domestic servants, especially liveried servants. In both there is a very elaborate show of unnecessary expensiveness, and in both cases there is also a notable disregard of the physical comfort of the wearer. But the attire of the lady goes farther in its elaborate insistence on the idleness, if not on the physical infirmity of the wearer, than does that of the domestic. And this is as it should be; for in theory, according to the ideal scheme of the pecuniary culture, the lady of the house is the chief menial of the household.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thorstein Veblen</span>", "time": 1671926572, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429820, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:04:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429815</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Theoretically it is possible for a beautiful woman to have less intelligence than a chimpanzee and still be considered an acceptable member of society.&quot;</span><br>Instagram has proven this true par excellence.", "time": 1671926685, "resto": 21428007}, {"no": 21429825, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)19:08:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21428007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21428007</a><br>The hard truth is that women are superior to men nowadays in every way.

This is why online discourse is so terrible people rarely do anything the proper way and instead do this half-assed attempts at communication that does nothing but discourage other people from engaging in discourse.

To be truly by myself away from the inane thoughts and half completed sentiments of others. Truly I wish I could engage with others but the discourse in the digital age has eroded so much that I think it would be the equivalent of a well meaning priest preaching the triumvirate to a loincloth wearing savage.

Look up a summary of the integration process and the encounter with the shadow. Jung&#039;s psychoanalysis is a far better system of symbols for articulating the structure of the unconscious and the subject&#039;s productive encounters with it, because it allows for types of latent/unconscious knowledge to be designated which Freud is completely blind to as a materialist, biologist reductionist. <br><br>This doesn&#039;t even mean leaping to the opposite extreme and accepting them all as metaphysically real either. At minimum it simply allows one to avoid Freud&#039;s denial of them or blindness to them. <br><br>If all you have read is Freud and Freud influenced psychoanalysis or psychology for years, with its obsessive talk of neuroses and repression being the only motors of consciousness and its development, and its implicit presumption that the &quot;normal&quot; subject is the biological-material healthy rational consumer, so that the only psychoanalytic work that can be done is the healing of neuroses so one can get back to &quot;normal,&quot; then reading Jung can be a liberating experience. Instead of all this negative talk and instead of a stunted reductive view of the subject, he has a lot of positive talk. Instead of breaking down neuroses, one confronts and integrates personae, for example. Instead of merely being a normal subject who has become abnormal and fucked up due to trauma, one is a multifaceted human being with weaknesses and deficiencies but also strengths and conquests, it&#039;s just that these strengths and conquests require integration and self-knowledge or they can become monomanic or autistic. <br><br>Someone who becomes very strong to overcome abuse in childhood, for example, is no longer just a neurotic who needs to painstakingly deprogram all his traumas and neuroses, he is genuinely a very strong person, as he had to become, but that very strength may now be limiting him in other ways, so the goal is not to deprogram the &quot;bad&quot; coping mechanism but to integrate it with his still present desire to be able to be vulnerable. Moreover, we don&#039;t just have stock biologistic archetypes like the Oedipus complex, we form archetypes creatively by interacting with culture, based on our coping and growing needs.

But we don&#039;t even understand the physical brain, let alone its relation to actual mind. Psychoanalysis is called the &quot;talking cure&quot; for a reason. In a sense, it&#039;s all praxis. <br><br>Jungian psychoanalysis like all variants is also eclectic, with many schools and generations of accumulated wisdom from other fields. Many practicing psychologists read widely in gestalt psychology, depth psychology, etc., to try to understand the practical effects of the hermeneutic process of psychotherapy. <br><br>I&#039;m not even a Jungian or a psychoanalyst myself. But it is perfectly valid internally. All these therapies are built on presuppositions. Freud&#039;s was that gaining rational knowledge of trauma stopped its being sublimated in irrational tics, and rational knowledge of natural drives allowed them to express themselves naturally and be sublimated in healthy ways, because he was an Enlightenment atheist. Jung&#039;s is that uncorrelated personality structures are partly coping mechanisms for actual experiences (like trauma), but that they are also drawn from culture and have deep symbolic structures as a result. You don&#039;t even have to buy the latter to simply treat him as a less reductive Freudian. <br><br>I don&#039;t understand your complaints about there being no sources of this stuff.

My wife back in highschool was a &quot;Stacy&quot; and basically lead the charge to bully TF out of me. She isolated me from everyone and used to humiliate me so badly that there were times I wanted to kill myself. I finished highschool with no friendships or self esteem, then out of the blue after HS finished she was nice to me. I was so paranoid it was another extreme prank amongst her friends but I craved a friendship so bad that I just went along with it. Eventually it lead to us &quot;dating&quot; but I was constantly scared it was just a joke at the beginning. I love her and all but I can&#039;t shake this feeling that after all these years I&#039;m still somewhat scared of her. When she&#039;s upset with something I did she still reverts to how she treated me back in HS especially when it comes to her accusing me of being flirty with people like retail staff.

He mentioned somewhere, maybe to Milton Hindus, that slang is the language of hatred. The worker hates his boss so he invents his own lingo, his own form of verbal disgust. C\u00e9line transformed this into his protest against the cruelties of human nature. But now even the most respected C\u00e9liniens in France act as if he was a kind of language-theorist or a stylist somewhat akin to Nabokov or Updike. It\u2019s always the same, you talk to a Frenchman about C\u00e9line and they\u2019ll have to tell you\u2026 \u201cwell, the politics, sure I don\u2019t agree\u2026 but what amazing language! L\u2019argot!\u201d Okay, but they have nothing deeper to say, since either they are too afraid to praise the substance in his style or too stupid to realize it exists.<br><br>The C\u00e9line popularity transformed a lot. Voyage was of course major news in its day, beloved by some (mostly rebellious leftish types) and hated by Montherlant and the like, who considered it too ephemeral. Now nobody reads Montherlant, and his would-be reactionary fans read C\u00e9line! But after the war it all fell apart and he became a dirty name in France. Only the fascists and weirdos wanted anything to do with him (not a bad thing of course!). The \u201crehabilitation\u201d of a writer is different in France, as the idea of greatness still exists there, unlike in the US of A. By the 60s, just after he had died and successfully passed off his novels as stylistic exercises, all the big names began to praise him as a genius. You have that idiot Philippe Sollers, who will defend C\u00e9line\u2019s reputation to the end, \u201cour Joyce\u201d or something to that effect\u2026 now yes, he is everywhere, from Israel to Timbuktu to Singapore everyone thinks they\u2019re a little C\u00e9line. You go to a bookshop in Paris and there are fresh editions of C\u00e9line full of comic book illustrations, C\u00e9line-themed dildos, C\u00e9linien mechanical keyboards that\u2019ll glow beneath your tranny cat ears as you play the C\u00e9line Simulator 1936, the latest in antisemitic writing games\u2026 a circus, and the only way out of it is to read between his lines.<br><br>I will say the one place C\u00e9line is thankfully neglected is the USA. I recently read that stupid bitch Alice Kaplan talk about how she can barely read him anymore, that she only likes how he exposed colonialism in Africa, that he is too much. Good! Good riddance! Americans, with the exception amusingly enough of Bukowski, never really understood C\u00e9line for what he was.

He is part of the old European tradition of literature, one that dates back to Rabelais in France (and even earlier if we look at the medieval chroniclers he read late in life)... but he is distinctively apart from the classical, mannerly, pretty writers that were in vogue in the early 1900s. As such a lot of modern artists, like Dubuffet, and leftish types, like Sartre and Debord, came to love his spirit, whereas I do not think Brasillach&#039;s writing really lends itself to such a thing. Brasillach is not as good as Celine... that is one thing you have to understand. Celine is at the level of Dante in terms of what he can evoke with words, how it flows, the drama he can build in a single sentence, the severity of his statements. So naturally it would have been hard to ignore him, even without the non-fascists who came to like him. Celine was not a fascist himself, but that is another story...<br><br>France, as I&#039;ve said, has a reverence for greatness in a way that is unheard of in America and I assume the UK. To a Frenchman, literature is number one, and you can get away with a great deal of things as a writer... countless French writers were pederasts who went to Algeria to have their way with the local boys, but their names adorn the streets of Paris. Yet Americans won&#039;t read Lolita simply because it is ABOUT something they find disturbing. So in general, one has to do a lot to really lose out on immortality if one is a great writer in French. <br><br>Rebatet is an interesting case.

The comparisons with Joyce that the French make are so faulty, as if they need their own Ulysses to feel intellectual. Joyce gets lost in formal tricks and obscures the emotions of his characters (except in chapter 3 and the Molly monologue)... but Celine never fell for this. What the two were saying is essentially dissimilar... Celine is closest to Proust in his pessimism toward &quot;the good life,&quot; only instead of attacking the aristocrats and the nouveau riche he tore down the dignity of war and the mechanistic world that has entirely destroyed the human spirit. Joyce tried to find odd beauty in the everyday (still a great writer and genius!) and as such ignores the greater issues that Celine addressed...", "time": 1671908935, "resto": 21423897}, {"no": 21428840, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)14:10:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21428829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21428829</a><br>Is this based on his French writings or translations?

The Marks translation turned him into a disgruntled Victorian, but Ralph Mannheim captures a lot of his imagery without much of the flow. I will say that Mannheim&#039;s translations of the WW2 trilogy do indeed have the &quot;hateful whispering&quot; that you get from late Celine in French, but naturally some things were changed. The essence of Celine (as he himself said) was emotion via distortion, you have to distort with words to achieve the real feeling. Gide said something to the effect of &quot;Celine is not reality, but the residue of reality.&quot; If so, then yes, it works with Mannheim. My Italian friends have praised his translation into that language, though I have heard Germans complain that he doesn&#039;t work well in Deutsch. <br><br>That anonymous translation of Bagatelles is quite interesting - it has some of the frenzied hate of the original, but a lot of the puns don&#039;t work in English, of course. Henry Miller (an optimistic Celine knock-off who is not really worth reading) actually imitated some of his style quite well in English. Tropic of Cancer is all over the place, some chapters like Proust, others like Dos Passos, others like Celine, others like Joyce, others like Nietzsche... but somehow he placed some of Journey&#039;s style in English by 1934 or whenever.

It is the most grand of his works, his epic, the adventure gone wrong! Swift\u2019s cynicism upgraded with Dostoyevsky\u2019s deep investigations of the soul. But every era has its own merits. The German novels are the iconic C\u00e9line, the really fed-up C\u00e9line who is ready to insult every last man on earth for his gluttony. They are the funniest of his works, and I know many who find them to be the peak of his style (I somewhat agree with this). The pamphlets are also essential reading if you know French or want to try the quite good English rendition of Bagatelles. The whole Jew hate thing is unimportant, what matters is the message: the critiques of C\u00e9zanne, the love of dance, the standardization of life\u2026 his whole philosophy comes to being there, but it has been obscured by the sensitive types who menstruate whenever someone says anything about the Jews. And besides, the pamphlets themselves are not these hysterical rants of genocide-advocacy\u2026 the average /pol/ user is far more brutal than C\u00e9line in this regard (but with none of his elegant aggression!). If you know/are learning French, his interviews are also essential. He speaks with a great musical sense and comedic brilliance\u2026 they are like his later novels, full of cynicism yet simultaneously you find the doctor, the vegetarian, the mystic, the defeated humanist\u2026 in short, C\u00e9line.<br><br>Don\u2019t expect a translation of his \u201cnew\u201d work into English anytime soon.

I could be wrong of course\u2026 but unlike Pound, C\u00e9line isn\u2019t exactly iconic in American literature. He influenced a lot of people, but not in a way you can really dissect in a $200,000 \u201cliterature\u201d undergrad\u2026 so who is going to read him besides us? They\u2019d rather publish the latest Ashbery clones and homoerotic auto fiction than C\u00e9line. And in an age of Bola\u00f1o (and new Latin American fiction in general) and the countless Japanese translations, the idea of a French author just isn\u2019t exotic enough to appeal to the intelligentsia who crave to prove their worldliness by the books they pose next to their matcha lattes.

It\u2019s hard to put into words but getting a first hand account of how one of the great artistic presence saw art and life. I find the letters inseparable from the artwork. Vincent was a cankerous oddball that was poor socially so he pours his heart out to his brother and benefactor who always believed in him. It manages to be sad and inspiring at the same time. On one hand you have the starving artist who would not compromise his vision and sellout commercially to make money; his brother always believing in him and supporting him financially; the heartbreaks and breakdowns that Vincent suffered; his early death not knowing success or fame; his brother not giving up after his death and pushing his artwork; his brother\u2019s death 6 months after Vincent\u2019s with neither succeeding. On the other hand Vincent had some profound thoughts and saw the world in a beautiful way. He reminds me of a peasant savant. It is such a unique look through the lens of a great artist. I\u2019ve probably read it 5 or 6 times and it\u2019s worthwhile every time. One day I\u2019ll get the complete set though it is a bit pricey. I like the Penguin edition because it has a little blurb or summary before every letter explaining various situations and circumstances. I strongly recommend trying it out. Worst possibility is you don\u2019t like it and drop it.

There will be grief, but all the agonies that my progenitors might pass into (and they are the only people in this entire world who even know of my existence) will be underpinned by this indomitable truth: it is a mercy that he is gone. The quantity of my existence stands only as a component for perpetuating the tortuous quality of the cheap jest that constitutes its vapid manifestation. My virginity has become the gorgon against which all my faculties rise only to be turned to stone; but this is no silent stone, this is not the stone of Plotinus that stands as the antithesis of the Intellectual Principle--for while yet stone I still feel the mind&#039;s unscrupulous lacerations and all that grieves the very fibers of its being. The spirit is dimmed each time a girl passes before the mechanism of sight that some pitiless god has glued to my body. Even the ugly, unshaven, modernity enthralled women with clowns&#039; hair and bodies desecrated with tattoos which map out upon fastfood fed bodies the vapid cliches that coagulate to form their mind, even these paralyze the life in me. Masturbation has become merely the corpse of a habit that no longer instills pleasure, no longer even succeeds in distracting, but is only the dull libidinal twitch of a mind faced with the irrepressible impossibility of its reality, while lacking the courage to galvanize itself towards rectification. In the end I do not seek repentance. The decimated husk of my ego drifts towards the only gray shore its virginity-shackled mind can still vaguely form, still vaguely know as whisper or faint wriggling worm in an unclear wound--worm&#039;s whisper out of a wound that clears: Death. Here is the Telos to which the entirety of my Dasein has been speeding. Here I shall sink at last, unrequited, into the tentacles of Annihilation&#039;s amnesia. My humiliation slowly becomes seething hatred for all who embody that element of the opposite sex, and my soul&#039;s relentless cry for something beyond suicide slowly twists itself into ever more feverish fetishes that the internet can happily supply an outlet for. At last, the inconsequential blip that referenced Myself whenever it imagined &#039;I Am&#039; shall find, not rest, but an end to the sequence of caustic images that only ever taunted it into further depths of Hell&#039;s sardonic pitch.

It was a time of peace and happiness when he was with her, full of silent longing and quiet sadness when he did not see her. Later he told her of Camilla and of his past life, and it was almost with surprise that he looked back upon himself. Sometimes it seemed inconceivable to him that it was he who had thought, felt, and done all the strange things of which he told.<br><br>On an evening he and Thora stood on a height in the garden, and watched the sunset. William and his little sister were playing hide-and-seek around the hill. There were thousands of light, delicate colors, hundreds of strong radiant ones. Mogens turned away from them and looked at the dark figure by his side. How insignificant it looked in comparison with all this glowing splendor; he sighed, and looked up again at the gorgeously colored clouds. It was not like a real thought, but it came vague and fleeting, existed for a second and disappeared; it was as if it had been the eye that thought it.<br><br>\u201cThe elves in the green hill are happy now that the sun has gone down,\u201d said Thora.<br><br>\u201cOh\u2014are they?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that elves love darkness?\u201d<br><br>Mogens smiled.<br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in elves, but you should.

Old Mary gets angry when I tell her this; for to believe what I believe, she says is not God-fearing. Such things have nothing to do with people, but warnings and spirits are in the gospel, too.

And what, for instance, is there beautiful about the green hill of Berdbjerg, if you don\u2019t imagine, that inside very tiny creatures swarm and buzz, and sigh when the sun rises, but begin to dance and play with their beautiful treasure-troves, as soon as evening comes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow wonderfully beautiful that is!

And so would you, me, or anyone, including the most dogmatic atheists and skeptics, because it is VASTLY more self-evidently real than this brief little experience of life on Earth we have now. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams.

Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here. As NDErs say, everybody on Earth is a star on the other side for having the courage and endurance to come to this nightmare hellhole.<br><br>Best of luck on your spiritual awakening OP! &lt;3", "filename": "1615120187322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671918371303769, "time": 1671918371, "md5": "VSla6OBrWteYgUkZkobScA==", "fsize": 7568, "resto": 21428806}, {"no": 21429473, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:07:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21428828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21428828</a><br>Spbp", "time": 1671919629, "resto": 21428806}, {"no": 21429496, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:12:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21428806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21428806</a><br>Certainly do not read stoicism.

Very creative and unconventional world building, and all books have illustrations by the author himself.

Alchemaster&#039;s Apprentice and Ensel Und Krete (not sure if this one even has an English translation) I also recommend. imo they&#039;re Ideally read in the order they came out. Bluebear was the first, and some say a bit more aimed at a younger audience than what came later, but not in a way that&#039;s bothersome. It does perhaps the most world building out of all, it simply hasn&#039;t got much bloodspilling compared to Rumo, for example. Maybe some people would be better off read Dreaming Books and Rumo first. It&#039;s not like one spoilers the others. <br>If course the books, which all use language quite creatively and make new words, lose a little bit of their brilliance in translation, so those who can are well advised to read the German originals.

The abruptness and simplicity of the language is indeed an aesthetical tool to bring this about. However I believe you are wrong in the sense that the specific degree of apathy displayed by Merseault isn&#039;t itself indicative of the Absurd itself, but rather of his own response (in fact, the general outlook of his existence) toward the Absurd. You are mistaking the flow of the story for the &quot;feeling&quot; created specifically by the narration being that of the main character. You have to separate his autism being the story&#039;s subject matter from the genre&#039;s technicalities, and not only to properly evaluate the oeuvre itself, but also to understand the philosophical content of the book. If all Camus said about the Absurd was that life was meaningless and you can get crushed by a soulless bureaucracy because you shot some Algerian while fully within your rights, the bot threads you see spammed on this board all the time would be right about calling him a brainlet. My understanding of him is that his philosophy was much more nuanced than this 18 years old angsty shit, the Absurd was not an ontological fact for him like it was for Sartre. It isn&#039;t so much the rather idiotic position that all of existence and life is meaningless but that rather moments of existence and life fail to satisfy a natural sense of human dignity we have, and that those moments can open us up to the final indignity, death, and what is specifically insulting to us about death, being that we are left to speculate to what is beyond without any answers from the Universe (the term &quot;answer&quot; is important here, we have solutions, ideas of what happen, even a Revelation, but to Camus, even a Revelation seems unsatisfying unless it is revealed to us directly). There is a positively Catholic interpretation of Camus by Emmanuel Mounier which is one of the most beautiful and profound text written in the last 100 years, and no one ever talks about it. <br>Merseault get in the position he is because parts of existence are indeed meaningless and absurd and chaotic (Algerians). However he fails to get out of it because he chose to respond with a nihilistic passiveness, because he &quot;chose to not create meaning out of his mother&#039;s funeral&quot;, so to speak.", "filename": "Camuskneeling", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 462, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 96, "tim": 1671818151468861, "time": 1671818151, "md5": "IR1aXZySpY5qr4flA7ucRw==", "fsize": 66838, "resto": 21422204}, {"no": 21423832, "now": "12/23/22(Fri)12:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21423726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21423726</a><br>Damn you can&#039;t even have a conversation without throwing a bitch fit?
