She&#039;s on so many because she&#039;s a rare form of trusted patient. She&#039;s in the medical profession so they gave her zolpidem, clonazepam, diazapam, and lorazepam, when if you&#039;re a street junkie who is addicted to these things and will seize up and die if you don&#039;t get the next dose, doctors will find it hard to justify giving anyone of those.

And because they&#039;re trusted patients they aren&#039;t seen as overdose risks or being spiteful when they say the drugs haven&#039;t quite fixed anything, whereas someone who is younger, who has the wrong accent, who doesn&#039;t pass a drug test or has trouble holding down a job will get prescribed fewer individual drugs, but higher doses, especially of the antipsychotics in that list and other drugs which aren&#039;t known addictive substances.

That kind of system failure where neither she nor her doctors saw the obvious medical problem with two or more addictive drugs is the kind of system blindness that usually only happens with religious groups who believe in faith healing.

The north is the symbol of the physical because of its relation to ice (crystallized water) and to the body (crystallized spirit). In man the light shines toward the north but never from it, because the body has no light of its own but shines with the reflected glory of the divine life-particles concealed within physical substance. For this reason the moon is accepted as the symbol of man&#039;s physical nature. CHiram is the mysterious fiery, airy water which must be raised through the three grand centers symbolized by the ladder with three rungs and the sunburst flowers mentioned in the description of the Hindu painting. It must also pass upward by means of the ladder of seven rungs-the seven plexuses proximate to the spine. The nine segments of the sacrum and coccyx are pierced by ten foramina, through which pass the roots of the Tree of Life. Nine is the sacred number of man, and in the symbolism of the sacrum and coccyx a great mystery is concealed. That part of the body from the kidneys downward was termed by the early Qabbalists the Land of Egypt into which the children of Israel were taken during the captivity. Out of Egypt, Moses (the illuminated mind, as his name implies) led the tribes of Israel (the twelve faculties) by raising the brazen serpent in the wilderness upon the symbol of the Tau cross. Not only CHiram but the god-men of nearly every pagan Mystery ritual are personifications of the Spirit Fire in the human spinal cord.</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/st<wbr>a/sta18.htm", "filename": "restorednewtesta00pry_0031", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 325, "h": 507, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675396538859919, "time": 1675396538, "md5": "1X6o8627UoZymhMloKMqJg==", "fsize": 43156, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607424, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:05:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;<br><br>You have to believe on Jesus and then you will have the indwelling of the holy spirit to guide and teach you.<br><br>bannedpreaching.com/videos/BIBLEWAY<wbr>TOHEAVEN.mp4", "time": 1675397155, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607450, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607424</a><br>fuck off protestant smoothbrain, this thread is not for you", "time": 1675398010, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607476, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Here&#039;s the esoteric meaning of the Behemoth and Leviathan<br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg43.htm<br>Info on Moses<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MOSES AN INITIATE</span><br>https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cd<wbr>g/cdg45.htm", "time": 1675398771, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607521, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)23:51:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>Esoteric meaning just means you&#039;re coming up with your own thing.

Samson didn&#039;t literally gain strength simply from keeping his nazarite vows, after all there were other people who were also nazarites; rather it was God that did it. It was all done for a specific reason to show us some things, and there are many teachings that find their application here. The term dragon is used in the Bible interchangeably with serpent, so that&#039;s nothing out of the ordinary. And unicorns are the same as rhinocerous, according to the 1611 footnotes they even specifically told us that. Lastly, the &quot;serpent&quot; entity didn&#039;t become a full-on snake until after it was cursed. It may have looked like something else before the fall. But we also have a talking donkey in another place, so yes there are very unusual things that have happened, but they all did for a reason. Hope that helps anon. Something can literally happen and at the same time have important lessons for us in them.

By concealing such knowledge under the cloak of simple, allegorical tales all could read and understand, the compilers and authors of the Bible ensured the preservation of the hidden wisdom for posterity.</span><br>http://www.occult-mysteries.org/hid<wbr>den-wisdom-bible.html", "time": 1675405692, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607731, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)01:34:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607627</a><br>autism", "time": 1675406055, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607779, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:00:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>You? where can *you* learn it?

Like the number 40 keeps popping up. <br><br> <s>Moses stays on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights. Before his temptation, Jesus fasted &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; in the Judean desert. Forty days was the period from the resurrection of Jesus to the ascension of Jesus. According to Stephen, Moses&#039; life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people. In modern Christian practice, Lent consists of the 40 days preceding Easter. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count, there are 46 days in total of Lent; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included. The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Kirk Kilisse, &quot;Forty Churches&quot; in Eastern Thrace. Rain fell for &quot;forty days and forty nights&quot; during the deluge.</s> <br><br>And then there are all those bizarre parallels between classical Paganism and Christianity.<br><br><s>The virgin Persephone&#039;s son, who was conceived by her father Zeus, was Dionysus. Dionysus is the god of bread and wine, Jesus is the transformer of water into wine and the multiplier of loaves of bread, and his primary rite involves the consecration of bread and wine which are said to transmute into the literal presence of the Lord, like in the Eleusian mysteries where the stalk of grain was to represent the literal presence of Persephone. Jesus was the son of the Virgin Mary, just as Dionysus was the son of the virgin Persephone, and in both cases the father God of heaven conceived in the virgin to give birth to a god of bread and wine. In the Greek instance, it&#039;s the maiden mother who descended into the underworld; in the Christian, it&#039;s her son the culture hero. In the Greek, the mother is resurrected as the staple wheat crop; in the Christian, the son is resurrected as the physical bread of life. Even the primordial even that initiated the whole cycle in both stories was the lord of the underworld using a plant to tempt the maiden into his clutches. </s><br><br>So what do you make of all that, retard?", "filename": "Fm2uMIRaMAUWpkj", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3800, "h": 2500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 82, "tim": 1675408989905586, "time": 1675408989, "md5": "VA/5yQt+bIOVF0L4iF6u8Q==", "fsize": 617005, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607825, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:32:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605974</a><br>Neville Goddard (Law of Assumption [LOA]) did Biblical interpretation.", "time": 1675409560, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607855, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:48:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21605980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21605980</a><br>Based post-modernist", "time": 1675410515, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607864, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)02:55:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21607807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21607807</a><br>You might like this anon<br>https://pathofregeneration.org/sear<wbr>ch/The+return+of+persephone", "time": 1675410937, "resto": 21605974}, {"no": 21607890, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)03:03:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Initiation in St. John\u2019s Gospel</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first eleven verses in the second chapter contain the allegorical representation of the last and final Initiation; herein we find mention of all the divine and human \u201cprinciples\u201d veiled in allegorical language, and personified, and of the purification wrought in them by Initiation; the incident ends abruptly and mysteriously, so much so, that we have reason to suspect that more was originally added.

Contrary to what is usually thought, it is the man of excellence, not the common man who lives in essential servitude. Life has no savour for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendent. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of serving as an oppression.

The privileges of nobility are not in their origin concessions or favours; on the contrary, they are conquests. And their maintenance supposes, in principle, that the privileged individual is capable of reconquering them, at any moment, if it were necessary, and if anyone were to dispute them. ... It is annoying to see the degeneration suffered in today&#039;s speech by a word so inspiring as &quot;nobility.&quot; For, by coming to mean for many people hereditary &quot;noble blood,&quot; it is changed into something similar to common rights, into a static, passive quality which is received and transmitted, something inert.

(Real or Imaginary depending on who you ask.) </span><br>Keep in mind I&#039;m not saying one ripped off the other or anything like that. I was just noting some vague similarities to other texts I&#039;ve heard about from an amateur comparative mythology perspective. <br><br><a href=\"#p21612663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21612663</a><br>Thanks for the recommendation!

It&#039;s like they went from being protagonists of a movie about their life to being ordinary, invisible background characters like everybody else. <br><br>It&#039;s really as if they don&#039;t even have the mental categories to process not being the center of attention. They keep trying to fix the problem by changing their fashion or trying to find a new &quot;character type&quot; that fits their situation, but can&#039;t realize the real underlying problem is simply that nobody cares about your style or what twist on the dark academia archetype you are when you&#039;re a 29 year old wine aunt who just works a remote job. I&#039;ve seen them ruin really good relationships with men that frankly would have saved them and given them a new lease on life because the men weren&#039;t accepting the &quot;role&quot; they were forcing on them, of mirroring their dark academia academic girl archetype back at them. The men just saw a nice 29 year old girl and wanted to date her, not enable her play to a character. <br><br>I wonder how much of women&#039;s misery could be prevented if they just got having kids and starting a family out of the way while they were young, so they didn&#039;t base their entire identity on the perpetual edging session of &quot;dating.&quot; Their behavior reminds me of things I did in my preteen and early teen years, dumb shit that is just funny in hindsight, like how I thought I was going to run away and join the Foreign Legion, or how I wanted to be a cool drug dealer so I lied and told people I sold weed. Women don&#039;t have the same character types, but it&#039;s the same energy of trying too hard to be &quot;cool&quot; and nobody giving them any honest feedback. But the reason nobody gave me any feedback at 14 is because 14 year olds are stupid. It&#039;s normal to give them space to figure things out. These women are 23-27 years old and their entire sense of self comes from the attention they get while dressing up as characters in movies they haven&#039;t seen. I&#039;ve tried telling the women close to me that life gets both more mundane and paradoxically more exciting when you&#039;re no longer a twentyish person who thinks the world revolves around them, that somehow the other people on the bus know what movie soundtrack you&#039;re listening to on your &quot;earbuds.&quot; I&#039;ve told them that they could be any other college girl archetype and they would get just as much attention, that the attention is because of the &quot;college girl&quot; part of the equation and not the &quot;archetype&quot; part. But I&#039;m just one voice in a life full of social media and ephemeral boyfriends validating them. <br><br>If you&#039;re a man you can&#039;t really get how hard it is for women. A woman hitting her late 20s and realizing she&#039;s just some anonymous random worker now is like the pain of going bald in your 20s, times a thousand.

I think, to abstract away from what you&#039;re specifically saying about /lit/ type younger women who aestheticize being a intellectual &amp; &quot;indie&quot;, women especially as they age, have very different baggage from men. Whereas boys are always taught that they do not have intrinsic value, that their feelings do not matter, etc. girls are socialized to believe they do have intrinsic value because they are young, pretty and pure. As they age and become adult women I imagine it&#039;s quite painful to adjust to this, which is something that men cannot relate to at all because their pain comes from a completely different source.

Can we go?<br>Lorraine pauses in the untying of her apron.<br>I didn\u2019t realise we were in a rush, she says.<br>He puts his hands in his pockets and suppresses an irritable sigh, but suppresses it with an audible intake of breath, so that it still sounds like a sigh.<br>I just have to pop up and take a load out of the dryer, says Lorraine. And then we\u2019ll be off. Okay?<br>He says nothing, merely hanging his head while Lorraine leaves the room.<br>Do you want some of this? Marianne says.<br>She\u2019s holding out the jar of chocolate spread. He presses his hands down slightly further into his pockets, as if trying to store his entire body in his pockets all at once.<br>No, thanks, he says.<br>Did you get your French results today?<br>Yesterday.<br>He puts his back against the fridge and watches her lick the spoon. In school he and Marianne affect not to know each other. People know that Marianne lives in the white mansion with the driveway and that Connell\u2019s mother is a cleaner, but no one knows of the special relationship between these facts.<br>I got an A1, he says. What did you get in German?<br>An A1, she says. Are you bragging?<br>You\u2019re going to get six hundred, are you?<br>She shrugs. You probably will, she says.<br>Well, you\u2019re smarter than me.<br>Don\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m smarter than everyone.<br>Marianne is grinning now. She exercises an open contempt for people in school. She has no friends and spends her lunchtimes alone reading novels. A lot of people really hate her. Her father died when she was thirteen and Connell has heard she has a mental illness now or something. It\u2019s true she is the smartest person in school.

This doesn&#039;t mean that it always does everything 1st try but rather that the combination of its actions is ultimately successful.<br>But this is quite stale if you plan on making the whole thing the AI&#039;s perspective so I&#039;d recommend just treating it like a regular character whilst the super smart AI component being displayed in character flaws or quirks and the like, but it ultimately adheres to a character, code, restrictions, mission, etc.<br>If you don&#039;t plan on doing that then it should be ruthlessly logical and follow psychological machiavellianism: no interpersonal relationships, no morals, manipulative and egoist. If the AI has short term goals it executes them, period. If it has to kill someone it doesn&#039;t waste time talking, it just does it. If the goals are long term then it does everything in its power to achieve them even if that means appearing to be a well adjusted member of society with a family and friends, a backstory, a job, whatever, the point is that it will drop all of it once its goal has been reached. If there&#039;s nothing to be gained it doesn&#039;t do it, use &quot;What do I stand to gain?&quot; as an heuristic for literally anything the AI does. The downsides of this is that your AI doesn&#039;t ultimately make mistakes. This doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t inconvenience it, but unless you defeat it in a way that it couldn&#039;t see coming (it&#039;s so unlikely that it throws out the possibility) it might as well be God. So unless you get another AI or make it impossible for it to achieve its objectives it can&#039;t really be defeated. You can always dial the intelligence back and add margin for error, a chess engine for the real world would be incredibly complex so perfect solutions don&#039;t exist and all it does is try to reach the best possible outcome. Even the #1 chess player in the world has been defeated before and he&#039;s a genetic edge case.<br>So there&#039;s clearly a whole spectrum here, mishmash it as you like.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;supposedly</span><br>If it&#039;s not then it just pretends that it is, which isn&#039;t much different from what you&#039;d be doing to your readers by pretending that you&#039;re as smart as the smart AI.

Speaking of the ideal shape of the Greek statue, our great philosopher finely says: It is as if the artist were shewing Nature what she would, but never completely could; wherefore the artistic Ideal surpasses Nature. Of Greek theogony it may be said that, in touch with the artistic instinct of the nation, it always clung to anthropomorphism. Their gods were figures with distinctive names and plainest individuality; their names were used to mark specific groups of things (Gattungsbegriffe), just as the names of various coloured objects were used to denote the colours themselves, for which the Greeks employed no abstract terms like ours: &quot;gods&quot; were they called, to mark their nature as divine; but the Divine itself the Greeks called God, &quot;\u03cc \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.&quot; Never did it occur to them to think of &quot;God&quot; as a Person, or give to him artistic shape as to their named gods; he remained an idea, to be defined by their philosophers, though the Hellenic spirit strove in vain to clearly fix it\u2014till the wondrous inspiration of poor people spread abroad the incredible tidings that the &quot;Son of God&quot; had offered himself on the cross to redeem the world from deceit and sin.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have nothing here to do with the astoundingly varied attempts of speculative human reason to explain the nature of this Son of the God, who walked on earth and suffered shame: where the greater miracle had been revealed in train of that manifestation, the reversal of the will-to-live which all believers experienced in themselves, it already embraced that other marvel, the divinity of the herald of salvation. The very shape of the Divine had presented itself in anthropomorphic guise; it was the body of the quintessence of all pitying Love, stretched out upon the cross of pain and suffering. A\u2014symbol?\u2014beckoning to the highest pity, to worship of suffering, to imitation of this breaking of all self-seeking Will: nay, a picture, a very effigy!

Like 2+2=4 <br>&quot;Genealogy of Morals&quot; was awful and is basically him just hammering in the same point over and over that Christianity is all about love of weakness, which was actually just rooted in the Christians lack of social power. Trouble is he never really proves that empathy for the weak is so sick and life denying. When I help a small defenseless animal, and care for it it makes me feel pretty great. There&#039;s an element of power there: this creature is dependent upon me for sustenance, undoubtedly, but I fail to see the resentment or hatred for the powerful in caring for the weak.<br>I&#039;m also not convinced that Christoanity is inherenrly opposed to power, and loves weakness as much as he claims it does. Religion is malleable and there are lots of variations contained in it. There&#039;s extreme egalitarian sentiment, as with the Anabaptists, but there can easily be a worship of power as can be seen im the tangible political power &amp; wealth the Catholic Church wieled for centuries.<br>An additional issue is that empathy and concern for others can be observed outside of Christianity. For instance, recently a chimpanzee mother was observed taking care of its disabled child:<br>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sc<wbr>iencealert.com/for-the-first-time-c<wbr>himpanzees-have-been-observed-carin<wbr>g-for-a-disabled-infant/amp<br> Most humans would feel a pang of sympathy when observing needless cruelty to the weak or those that can&#039;t defend themselves.

Sleep in strip mall parking lots. Not eat any hot food (no kitchen). Shower at flying J&#039;s and other truck stops (the gym membership idea is a meme). And hate homeless people.<br><br>One great thing I learned from living in my car was gratitude. It taught me to be grateful for a bed, for a bathroom just across the hall, for a hot shower, and yes, for a stable 9 to 5 boring job.", "time": 1675486043, "resto": 21611831}, {"no": 21611905, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)23:48:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "By realizing that you need more than books to survive.

This initially took the relatively mild form of a deconstructive postmodernism and poststructuralism, which, in the work of thinkers like Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and Jacques Derrida, cast aside all grand historical narratives while embracing a philosophical antihumanism emanating principally from Heidegger. In contrast, today\u2019s new philosophies of immanence\u2014associated with posthumanism, vitalistic new materialism, actor-network theory, and object-oriented ontology\u2014constitute a deeper irrationalism, represented by such putatively left figures as Gilles Deleuze, F\u00e9lix Guattari, Bruno Latour, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton. These thinkers draw directly upon an irrationalist, antimodernist intellectual lineage going back to the reactionary antimodernism of Nietzsche, Bergson, and Heidegger. Lacanian-Hegelian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has ultimately taken sides with the antihumanist tradition stemming from left-Heideggerianism, generating in his work a carnival of irrationalism. All of these various tendencies are coupled with skepticism, nihilism, and a pessimistic, end-of-the-world outlook.</span><br><br>Is he right, bros?

In this text, magic is conceived as synonymous with the art of those who know how to reopen the path leading to the earthly paradise, in order to partake of the \u201cTree of Life\u201d found at its center. This obviously refers to the restoration of that primordial state, reintegration of power, and contact with the \u201ccenter\u201d which constitute the main goal of initiation as such. An interesting detail (the reason that it is interesting will be explained further on) is that according to della Riviera, the \u201cmagical world\u201d was one and the same as the \u201cworld of heroes,\u201d and those who pursue the magical path are called by him \u201cregal disciples of high Jupiter.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) According to an initiatic axiom, \u201cYou must not seek power; it is power that must seek you.\u201d In our tradition, power is feminine and seeks a center: he who knows how to give a center to this power through his own renunciation (hoping our use of the word will be understood) and hardness created by domination of his soul, by isolation and resistance\u2014power is unfailingly attracted to such a person and obeys him as her own male. Just as water naturally forms a vortex around a pillar standing steadfast in its current, likewise, in a spontaneous way, an aura forms around him who, like a force that presses on and does not stop at anything, appropriates the way of being. Being is the condition of power; an impassibility (we could even say a frigidity) that does not look at it, is what attracts it. Power eludes desire for power, like a woman shunning the lustful embrace of an impotent lover.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) Those who understand this also understand the nature of the continuous dangers connected to the powers. Every power is for the Self like a vertigo of subtle energy that is fixed and chained by its \u201ccentral\u201d quality. If one\u2019s inner resolution fails even for an instant (namely the being due to which a power is attracted by the initiate and subjected to him), this power will overwhelm one and cut one down. In such cases the consequence is usually a regression to a state that is even lower than the one from which he started. The powers are transformed into beings that possess him who has fallen.</span>", "time": 1675460137, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610409, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:38:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21610399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610399</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) Sometimes mention is made of a \u201crejection of powers.\u201d This is nonsense, just like that \u201crenunciation of nirvana\u201d spoken of in some Theosophical milieus. Nirvana is not like a dwelling place where one can enter or exit at will. Nirvana is a state of being; once it is realized, one cannot \u201cgive it up\u201d for the simple fact that it constitutes, once and for all, an integral part of the being. Likewise, it is possible to talk about a renunciation of the use of powers, which is the same thing as having power resting in the state of simple possibility; however, talk of a rejection of powers is nonsense, because they are connected in a natural way to the metaphysical dignity of the initiate, and are in a certain way its chrism. Powers could be rejected only if one could renounce that dignity; this, however, is impossible for the same reason as given in regard to nirvana.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At any rate, it is certain that powers, far from being the pleasant and desirable things that a profane person imagines them to be, are such that one who has them without having requested them would gladly and freely get rid of them if only one could. This can be felt in an analogous way by thinking of dignities and leadership positions in human society, which imply not only risks, but also a high degree of burdens and responsibilities: responsibility, first of all, toward oneself.</span><br>4) The attraction that the notion of magical powers exercises on the common mind is based on a gross misunderstanding. What is conceived is an ordinary person with his various desires, goals, passions, and interests, then he is imagined to be invested with powers. However, nothing is further from the truth. The subject invested with powers, or the magus, is a being who is substantially different from an ordinary person and has nothing in common with him; it is a real change of state that has endowed the magus with powers. (This is true at least for the domain of high magic; things may go otherwise in the magic that, without moralizing, we call \u201cblack magic,\u201d which is more or less the same as witchcraft.) What happens is that most of what an ordinary person would want to do and achieve through \u201cpowers\u201d ceases almost entirely to be of interest to those who have achieved the state that introduces them to the real possession of those powers. This is truer the more one ascends (or gains depth, which is another phrase for the same thing), and is the reason that those who can do the most show it the least.", "time": 1675460338, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610455, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)16:52:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21610409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610409</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5) Among many people one finds a fairly childish view of magical action, almost like that of a fact determined without a causal connection\u2014more or less as with the magic wands of fairy tales, which ipso facto automatically produce this or that effect. Even if one does not refer to magic wands but to mysterious formulas or secret signs that allegedly have an analogous power, the intellectual horizon remains unchanged. In passing, I note that for a similar example, one should turn not to the world of magic, but rather to modern technology. The power to blow up a rock by pushing a button, or even lighting a fire by striking a match, belongs to this type: I am here, an effect is produced there, automatically, \u201cmagically,\u201d by a power that is not mine, that is unintelligible and extraneous to me even though I may know well its modalities or its habits. Moreover, such magical technology allows for possibilities that high magic prefers to exclude, for reasons shown in the previous paragraph: one can make an indifferent use of it for any desire or purpose of any human individual.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On the contrary, the true magical act, from the point of view of inner experience, is exactly the opposite of the miracle, in its supposed sense as an incomprehensible and wonderful phenomenon. The magical act emanates from a state of absolute evidence-knowledge; the meaning of a direct, real causality, or of the power that immediately produces an effect, is inseparable from it. This effect is realized in function of its causes, and the cause is one and the same with the state of an integrated life and its achievements. The reader may recall that we have already dealt with this when talking about the initiatic view of knowledge.</span>", "time": 1675461158, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610498, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:05:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21610455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610455</a><br><a href=\"#p21610409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610409</a><br><a href=\"#p21610399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610399</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let us add that as a rule, magical operations cannot satisfy the conditions that the metapsychologists demand for their investigations, because the presence of profane people who are simply there to watch is an obstructive factor. An operative magical chain is totally active, and such intruders would produce the effect of a faulty conductor introduced into an electric circuit: they would somewhat paralyze and depotentize the whole thing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On another front, the same thing happens in mediumistic sittings, at their particular level of influences (very different from those of high magic and theurgy) and in their own psychic climate: they are known to succeed all the better when the participants are neither suspicious nor observant, but credulous and even superstitious.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the criticism that has given rise to these explanations, the positivist prejudice (which is equivalent to materialist) inherent in the metapsychological method is reaffirmed when it blames the importance that we give to the \u201cinternal experience,\u201d which, being unverifiable and inexpressible, is supposed to serve us as a convenient and inaccessible resort. Evidently, what the metapsychologists appreciate, because they can grasp it in their hands, is the mere caput mortuum (dead head): that which corresponds in an experiment to the crudest and dead \u201cprecipitate.\u201d For us, of course, things are the opposite. We have already justified a magical practice not by its results, but precisely and solely by the internal states beyond ordinary consciousness that one must rise to and actively possess (see Introduction to Magic, vol. I, 263\u201364). Initiatically speaking, it is by this criterion alone that operative magic is of any interest. This higher and decisive zone, consisting of pure internal experience, is naturally ineffable and \u201cexperimentally\u201d unverifiable by others. To want it to be otherwise is not to know what one is asking. As for the rest\u2014paths, disciplines, techniques, and determinisms of the magical field\u2014they can be expressed in language that is not \u201cmystical\u201d but intelligible and sufficiently exact. It seems to us that the present collection of essays, most of which treat of nothing else, is sufficient proof of that.</span>", "time": 1675461913, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610706, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:57:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600426</a><br>you are going to get filtered unless you are familiar with hermeticism/alchemy", "time": 1675465079, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610714, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)17:59:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21604198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21604198</a><br>interesting, thanks", "time": 1675465163, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21610872, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)18:44:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21608842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21608842</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;implying hinduism and buddhism are any less supernatural or lucid</span><br>There are loads of Buddhist handbooks which leave out the primitive mythological aspects and provide clear, logical guidelines on the various meditative states, how to reach them, pitfalls to avoid, stages of &#039;enlightenment&#039; etc. Maybe I&#039;m just one of them there braindead hylics, but I&#039;d much rather follow one of those texts than have Evola as a guide, who chucks in the spiritual baby with his own silly woo-woo bathwater.", "time": 1675467855, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611288, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:25:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600426</a><br>A lifetime of virginity", "time": 1675473929, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611371, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21610872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610872</a><br>Indeed, to understand Evola&#039;s esoteric work or just esotericism in general you have to understand the first thing abot symbolism.", "time": 1675475844, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611377, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)20:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21611288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21611288</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mad</span>", "time": 1675475905, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611421, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:10:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600426</a><br>If you&#039;re anything like Julius Evola then you&#039;re in for a lifetime of getting pussy.", "time": 1675476610, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611478, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)21:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21608053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21608053</a><br>If you take the anecdotes of Tomberg seriously, he once had someone come up to him in a private train car and show off his ability to levitate in a vain manner, so that isn&#039;t entirely the case.", "time": 1675477811, "resto": 21600426}, {"no": 21611629, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)22:25:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21610409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21610409</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one who has them without having requested them would gladly and freely get rid of them if only one could.

And I normally just shrug and say &quot;It&#039;s a hobby.&quot;, but that&#039;s a lie. Because when I&#039;m in game, I&#039;m at home. From the flames of cataclysm to the icy<br>mountains of Tamriel, anywhere I venture, is a place I love and know. My entire life people preach that I could be anything that I wanted to be. But when I told them I wanted to be the captain of a ship, a spaceship, THE spaceship<br>that saves humanity. That I wanted to be Commander Shepard they told me I need to get a grip on reality. And to them to them a grip on a reality means the American dream, working nine to five crammed up in a tiny cubicle<br>having two-point-five kids, a two story suburban house and a white picket fence. I divorce once, and I&#039;d have debt into my early thirties because I took some bullshit university degree that&#039;s suppose to help me in the end. <br>This isn&#039;t reality, this is just a dull outlook on it. Now I understand it&#039;s human nature to achieve greatness, but I can do this as Commander Shepard, I don&#039;t need a degree. And if I want to go on an adventure I don&#039;t ever have to leave<br>the comfort of my home. Yet, people spend an entire salary to travel and I can&#039;t help but laugh. I&#039;ve single-handedly stopped a reign of ancient wyverns from destroying a nation, but before I could do that do I had to:<br>\u2022 Learn their language<br>\u2022 Become a master in Swordsmanship, Smithing, Archery, Defense, Magic, Speech, Hunting and Thieving!<br>Not to mention I had to take down an entire fleet of assassins along with a brigade of smugglers before I could even START my lessons in Dragon&#039;s Speak. I&#039;ve always enjoyed an adventure, but I hated pawning my limbs to afford an<br>eighteen-hour car ride. And aside from being told that I can enjoy a white-picket fence at the end of my career, all my years as a student was balance between Fractal Formulas and believing I never be able to love which is literal INSANITY.<br>I&#039;ve saved Princess Peach. I wanted to be the guy, and I became the guy. I saved Bandage Girl. And I&#039;ve been Link for generations just to save Princess Zelda. But yet, I&#039;m the eternal virgin, I&#039;m the guy that&#039;s never going to love.<br>And sometimes this shit doesn&#039;t make sense to me, why people assume that I need to be out doing something and away from home to have fun when I have my own reality grasped between my hands. I have my own world at my fingertips, if I screw something <br>up I can rewind time. I can&#039;t do that in real life, but when I&#039;m in game I&#039;m free to what I please, when I please, I&#039;m free to enjoy things the way I want to.

They changed her room number and put her with some other girl. Other girl was about 27 and was very friendly, albeit completely drugged. She told me it was her first time in a psych ward and that they drugged her so much she had trouble walking and literally fell on the floor when it was taking effect. She made us laugh by telling us a story about the others resident (who are around for non-mental medical issues). Like apparently earlier in the day she had to help some guy with both arms broken by putting a cig between his lips and the guy kept complaining about a gay blabbermouth guy who was following him everywhere in the hospital. It made me fucking kek because she told us she saw the gay guy coming in the smokers place, invited him to talk (with the broken arms guy) and found an excuse to leave after a minute. The bitch couldn&#039;t stop cackling at her evil deeds.<br><br>Anyways. After that she put on her earbuds and let us talk. We watched Shrek and it was fun. I&#039;m probably not going to see her again until wednesday and she&#039;ll be out by then. I&#039;m resuming work on Monday so I guess I won&#039;t be telling another story about the psych ward cutie pie for a long time. All in all I&#039;m quite happy with how things turned out.

I don&#039;t want to make the whole &#039;visiting a cutie pie in a psych ward&#039; an habit because the whole suicide attempt thing and seeing her trembling like a crack addict scared the fuck out of me, but it&#039;s certainly a memory that I will learn from in the future.

It was horrible. He kept asking me these obtuse and confusing questions and then when I would say that I didn\u2019t know how to answer he would just sit there in silence for a long time looking at me intently. The prolonged silences made me more and more agitated, like I was a specimen being scrutinized under a microscope. I couldn\u2019t make eye contact with him. To distract myself I started compulsively scratching the skin on the backs of my wrists, over and over until my fingernails drew blood.<br><br>At one point he said that he didn\u2019t think talk therapy would even work for me because I didn\u2019t seem to want to talk, and asked me if I wanted to leave. But the whole reason that I made the appointment in the first place was that I wanted to talk. And I tried to tell him about some of what I was feeling and the problems I have been having but he didn\u2019t understand. He kept changing the subject and circling back to asking me what I was hoping to get out of the session. I kept saying that I didn\u2019t know what specific outcome I was looking for but that I was feeling really upset and like my life was falling apart and I needed help. Then he would stare at me again and say nothing, or give some condescending platitude. At the end he said he\u2019d refer me to one of his colleagues at some point next week. I don\u2019t know if I can wait that long. I don\u2019t know if the other counsellors will be any better anyway.<br><br>When I left I felt far worse than when I went in. Like, all upset and frantic. It was so cold out that the air made my chest hurt with every inhale. I got home and I still felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and then I couldn\u2019t calm down for hours. After I\u2019d stopped crying and relaxed a little bit, there was this loud knocking on my door and I started to panic. I crawled across the floor as quietly as I could and hid in the closet for a long time, heart racing, stomach churning. <br><br>Later I went out into the kitchen and saw that my roommate had left an open package on the table. The knock was probably just the Amazon delivery person leaving it outside. But I don\u2019t actually know.<br><br>It\u2019s my birthday tomorrow. I told my parents that I didn\u2019t want anything but they said that they ordered me cake and flowers and are going to have it delivered to my apartment. All I want is to sleep all day and forget that it\u2019s my birthday. But I\u2019ll have to go out early and hide somewhere in the library stacks, because if I\u2019m at home then I\u2019ll spend the whole day dreading a series of unknown knocks on the door that I\u2019ll be too afraid to answer. <br><br>I don\u2019t want the cake and flowers anyway. They\u2019re just going to rot until I throw them away. The whole last year of my life has been wasted, so there\u2019s nothing to celebrate. I\u2019m still hung up on the same things as I was last year. I\u2019ve made no progress. It\u2019s not getting better. Nothing feels good. Nothing feels real. I\u2019m so tired.

Term with both Platonic and Peripatetic provenance. When used Platonically, Substance refers to Intellect or to any distinct Being in the intelligible world; Substantiality refers to the essence of Intellect or of any distinct Being. Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect. When used Peripatetically , the term &#039;substance&#039; refers to an individual &#039;this something&#039;; &#039;substantiality&#039; refers to the essence of a substance, that is, its core reality or being. For Plotinus, true ontological primacy is found in Substance and Substantiality, not in substance and substantiality. Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world. The adjective substantial, Substantial usually indicate and implicit contrast.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between Plato\u2019s demiurge and one hypostasis and the demiurge is <s>the nous.
