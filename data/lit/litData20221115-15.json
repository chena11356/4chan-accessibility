But Adolf was sexually backward. Other boys made advances to girls, and the girls responded. Adolf was too shy, too uncertain of his manhood. And all the time incapable of steady work, at home only in the compensatory Other World of his fancy. There, at the very least, he was Michelangelo. Here, unfortunately, he couldn&#039;t draw. His only gifts were hatred, low cunning, a set of indefatigable vocal cords and a talent for nonstop talking at the top of his voice from the depths of his Peter-Panic paranoia.

I would rather they be the same age but that precludes Kant&#039;s important philosophy being written in old age, and Nietzsche&#039;s dying young (an old Nietzsche would have an altogether different thing). But Nietzsche has the edge of having read Kant, and being privy to a culture of Kant interpretation.<br><br>We can imagine that Kant would be intrigued to hear about how he is being understood, what the problems are considered to be, where the project was being taken. I think Nietzsche will be sufficiently interesting to Kant as an individual as well as a perspective from the future. But they are so opposed. I think I would rather seen Nietzsche adjust to Kant, allow some concreteness for truth and systemization. It&#039;s a happy outcome if metaphysics are possible or if German systems are a way to truth. It would be tremendously validating if Nietzsche decided to make a concession on that.

Survivors reported having unique lucid experiences, including a perception of separation from the body and observing events without pain or distress. They also reported a meaningful evaluation of life, including of their actions, intentions, and thoughts toward others. The researchers found these experiences of death to be different from hallucinations, dreams, delusions, illusions, or CPR-induced consciousness.<br><br>Tests for hidden brain activity were also included in the research. A key finding was the discovery of spikes of brain activity, including so-called gamma, delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves up to an hour into CPR. Some of these brain waves normally occur when people are conscious and performing higher mental functions, including thinking, memory retrieval, and conscious perception. &quot;These recalled experiences and brain wave changes may be the first signs of the so-called near-death experience, and we have captured them for the first time in a large study,&quot; says Sam Parnia, MD, PhD, the lead study investigator and an intensive care physician, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone Health, as well as the organization&#039;s director of critical care and resuscitation research.&quot;Our results offer evidence that while on the brink of death and in a coma, people undergo a unique inner conscious experience, including awareness without distress....&quot;<br><br>&quot;These lucid experiences cannot be considered a trick of a disordered or dying brain, but rather a unique human experience that emerges on the brink of death,&quot; says Parnia. As the brain is shutting down, many of its natural braking systems are released. Known as disinhibition, this provides access to the depths of a person&#039;s consciousness, including stored memories, thoughts from early childhood to death, and other aspects of reality. While no one knows the evolutionary purpose of this phenomenon, it clearly reveals &quot;intriguing questions about human consciousness, even at death,&quot; says Parnia.", "time": 1668529513, "resto": 21260351}], "last_modified": 1668529513}, {"no": 21257866, "now": "11/14/22(Mon)19:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "It was Geschwind Syndrome", "com": "Dostoevsky&#039;s religious awakening, deep insight, etc. are all attributable to his neurological condition.
