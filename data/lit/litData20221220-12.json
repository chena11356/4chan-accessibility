For example, look at this iconic line from one of America\u2019s founding documents:<br><br>\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\u201d<br><br>This is the most famous sentence in America\u2019s Declaration of Independence. It\u2019s the driving intellectual force behind the nation\u2019s constitutional belief in legal equality. Educated citizens base their commitment to American ideals on it. This commitment shows up in our theories of democracy, in which each citizen has an equal vote, and our justice system, in which all humans are supposedly equal under the law. <br><br>But there\u2019s a problem: human equality isn\u2019t self-evident at all. <br><br>John Locke, whose intellectual ink is tattooed all over the Declaration of Independence, knew this. His theory of natural rights is based on the idea that God owns us as property. Human equality is self-evident only if you assume, as Locke did, that God has given us the natural rights that modern Americans take for granted. The original Constitution says that our \u201cunalienable rights\u201d are a result not of secular rationalism, but rather an omnipotent God who endows us with those rights. To that end, the pillars of American law rest as much on the Bible as on the writings of Enlightenment thinkers.

In the barbarian world, the weak were exploited by the strong and enslaved by the powerful. Ancient Rome provides an example.

Human rights exist in their modern form because the Bible says that every person is made in the image of God\u2014imago dei. In turn, each person is granted unalienable rights, and those rights can\u2019t be taken away. But the contract breaks down if human beings aren\u2019t special. If humans are in the same category of every other animal, there is no intellectual scaffolding to uphold either human rights or the legal equality of man. Appealing to human rights just because we say so is as baseless as appealing to astrology or the will of Zeus. Even if a group of people can agree on how to treat people in the moment, consensus can change at any moment. Today\u2019s virtues can become tomorrow\u2019s vices. Like a sand castle, the tenets of morality can be destroyed by the tide of public opinion. <br><br>Without the word of God, all we have are opinions. Morality and justice are downgraded from indisputable truths to mere preferences and shared fictions. Both of those can change on a whim. In a world of one person\u2019s word against another, the most powerful person will control the moral landscape. This problem is one of the central themes of Dostoyevsky\u2019s writing: in an 1878 letter, he asked why he should live righteously in a world without a god. Assuming that there is no afterlife and that the police wouldn\u2019t catch him after a wrongdoing, he asks: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I cut another man\u2019s throat, rob, and steal?\u201d <br><br>Today, our answer boils down to human rights. To Dostoevsky\u2019s point, without the hand of God to shape human morality, many people will conclude that the benefits of a righteous life aren\u2019t worth the costs. In theory, we could base our belief in human rights on rationality and the mutual agreement that some actions are better than others. Maybe one day, people will worship the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights charter like they worship the Bible today. Doing so would take us away from the woo-woo of religion and towards the rigor of secular reason, where we can logically discern the differences between good and evil.

Hitchens, who was one of Christianity\u2019s fiercest critics, responded by saying: \u201cI would say that if you don\u2019t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you\u2019re really not in any meaningful sense a Christian.\u201d<br><br>Echoing Hitchens\u2019 point, Christianity is unique among religions because it has a self-destruct mechanism. The book of I Corinthians says that the truth of Christianity hinges upon the resurrection\u2019s historical reality \u2014 meaning that the story of Christ dying on the cross and coming back to life must be literally true. So if you discover that Christ was not raised, you should stop being Christian. End of story.

Since Jesus\u2019 claims were so outlandish, he couldn\u2019t have been just a great moral teacher. You must take a stand. Christ was either the Son of God or a madman. Lewis writes: \u201cYou can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.\u201d<br><br>Though I find myself doing it all the time, thinking of religion metaphorically instead of literally is problematic. Christianity, and therefore the moral underpinnings of the West, is long-term stable to the extent that enough people believe in all that Christ claimed to be and the literal truth of his story.

Growing up, I attended a Jewish school where I took 40 minutes of both Hebrew and Biblical studies every day. But as early as elementary school, I thought I was above religious thinking. I \u201cknew\u201d that Moses didn\u2019t actually part the Red Sea and didn\u2019t ascend Mount Sinai to have an actual conversation with God. All that sounded as counterfeit as the tooth fairy. Even as I sang the Torah portion during my Bar Mitzvah to a crowd of a couple hundred friends and family members, I rejected the teachings I was chanting. Only after college did I discover that the ideas I passionately rejected, particularly the Old Testament and the Ten Commandments, were the bedrock of my moral philosophy. <br><br>Not just mine, all my friends too \u2014 and we didn\u2019t even know it.

That\u2019s what we all believe, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve grown up believing, and it\u2019s who we are.\u201d We agree with these ideas because Christianity is the invisible frame around modern thought.

That is, they try to emulate and &quot;shoplift&quot; the good of what&#039;s in God&#039;s word but then create a blind spot where they don&#039;t even see or recognize where it all originally comes from - because they want to take credit for all of it themselves. So they try to strip God out of it, and then just use intellectual dishonesty to lead people away from ever finding out or discovering this fact. They&#039;ve rewritten history into a new &quot;woke&quot; narrative that erases all inconvenient facts. But it doesn&#039;t matter because all of their efforts will fail in the end. The self evident truths are true, and the God that gave us these things in the first place is still active. (The fact that anything exists establishes that assertion.) Satanists can resist and fight, do all kinds of gymnastics, try to hide from the truth, try to hide the truth from others, and even kill us for being the message-bearers of the truth, but it is just going to be ultimately pointless because of what they are going against. It leads to a more spectacular fall for them if they decide not to repent.

That&#039;s how it&#039;s been with me this year. <br>Although I still feel that urge to consume and tally books and other media, I&#039;ve also realized this year that it doesn&#039;t matter how many books you read, as long as you are reading, because you can only do one thing at a time. The more important thing is how deeply engaged you are with what you read. I have a list of over 100 books I want to read, and I still find myself searching for new titles. The searching is a source of pleasure in itself. It&#039;s like window shopping. It also provides a feeling of security, in that you are satisfied at having made the best decision which will ensure pleasure and safety in the future. Additionally it&#039;s a release of tension, but the tension is due to a buildup of anxiety rather than of a physical need. I put all of this behaviour under the category of mental masturbation, where masturbation is an analogy for the release of tension.<br>I think the source of this mental masturbation behaviour is anxiety. You want to experience as much as possible before it&#039;s too late. You want other people to see you experiencing many things. Fundamentally, you want to make the correct choices from among a staggering sea of options. It&#039;s the same as what gives rise to self-improvement obsessions, as well as the tendency to categorize things into top 10 lists. Too much choice creates confusion about the future. Anxiety is born of intelligence and the overabundance of choice. The intelligence faculty is driven to strike an optimal path through the sea of choice, and arrive at an orderly route. <br>If either choice or intelligence is reduced, the anxiety does not occur. Imagine a person with access to fewer books (let alone other media). When they found one great book, they would cherish it and reread it many times. It would inform the development of their mind to a much greater degree than someone who blows through 20 profound books in a year because there are too many to read and they want to check their list off. <br>But would the person with less choice be better off? Probably, but not necessarily. If people can recognize the process of anxious tension and release, and exercise a little bit of self-control, they can utilize their overabundance of choice by narrowing their focus drastically when their they find a book or an author they engage with deeply. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr </span><br>Do one thing at a time.", "time": 1671539571, "resto": 21405898}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21403691, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)06:10:09", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "I can&#039;t cope", "com": "I have been in mental paralysis ever since I have read this book.

Some might be caricatures, but they stand out well. GRRM is really great at this. The genre as a whole struggles with this, having characters serving as mere means to move the descriptions along. Case in point from an author I actually like quite a bit: all of Alistair Reynolds&#039; characters are emotionless engineers.

The Church is what Christ gave to us, but not as we give gifts as heavenly things are given, and as such the Church itself is an alternative to DNA in the form of embodied divine logos. I do, however, firmly think that Jesus of Nazareth, Christ, must be dealt with first for someone of your intellectual stature because otherwise you will never receive the truth therein.

You are still advocating for indirectly killing almost everyone alive today because the alternative is worse. This would most likely include yourself and your family. Everyone you know would either die of starvation, disease, or murder. And if the ends justify the means, this is truly the right option. It allows men to go to that extremity, thinking it is moral. That spirit of bitter disgust at the world that leads you to wish death upon virtually all the human race, it is so tiresome and at this point, my spirit recoils from it. Nothing Kaczynski says has to be wrong, as such, but he takes it as a given that there is no God and that the religious worldview has already been disproven. He might have good reason for this, but it is never brought up. If you disagree with him on this presupposition, however, none of it really matters anymore. This world is rotten to its core. Alienated from its original design. Men will never be content, even in primitivist bliss. There can be no salvation in the workings of men, it isn&#039;t to be found amongst bands of hunter-gatherers in deep forests. All joy of that life is but a foretaste of Heaven. Civilization, wilderness, these are temporal affairs, yet we are immortal souls merely embodied in the temporal. Our ultimate aim is not that. Our existence here is for the ultimate purpose of unifiction with the Divine, by allowing us to ascend the ladder of spiritual ascent. In the face of this, even if everything Kaczynski says is right, ceases to be important. In fact, it is to be expected, as degeneration, decay and entropy are all inherent in the Fallen Creation, as gold turns into silver and silver into bronze.<br><br>In the view of the infinite life, I no longer care. Yes, I have given up, I am an anti-revolutionary element. I do, I suppose, what the Techno-Industrial System would want me to. Though, it&#039;s not like there is a movement, in the first place, or even any potential seed for a movement. Kaczynski has entierly failed to inspire one, and even if one were to be created, the question of if and Anti-Tech Revolution would even be possible remains unanswered, and I think there is reason to be pessimistic. As of now, I am resigned to a life of minimizing technology to the greatest extent I am capable of. I do not care to extending this life to the masses. Neither did Kaczynski, but I also accept that total liberation from the Machine isn&#039;t possible. I suppose you could put it that this age, being so far removed from the Primeval state, doesn&#039;t allow even its hermits the freedom the previous ages allowed theirs.

If the industrial system is instrumental to the divine plan then it will survive, but if not, there is no reason to accept the greatest facilitator of modern evils. The industrial society is incompatible with with the theological order and bestows upon man capacity for evil unlike any other. I&#039;m sure it needn&#039;t be explained the surgical monstrosities, lobotomies, chemical horrors, and of course, the coming integration of technology with the nervous system that are made possible by industrial technology. These are simply the things we can imagine in our lifetimes; there is no telling the evils the future holds. You already see the effects; men and women remove their sexual organs in mental disturbances unlike anything in the past, suicide continues to rise where before industrialism it was nigh unheard of, atrocities of torture greater than anything our forefathers could ever have imagined are made possible by technological invention.<br><br>But that is to say nothing exclusive to the spiritual. Death, of course, is nothing, for the righteous will ascend to heaven and the reprobate will meet his just end. The great sufferings that can be wrought, and are being wrought by the technological world are a tragedy like no other; and the powers offered to temporal leaders are used to constrict and destroy the capacity for the masses to achieve spiritual enlightenment and salvation. You see this with declining religiosity in the industrialized world.

We certainly don\u2019t mean to knock that right; it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example.

Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side. History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution[35], the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some \u201cgreen\u201d party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the \u201cgreen\u201d party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.</span><br>You couldn&#039;t even remember my previous post where I mention this.

Such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous.[21]</span><br><br>?124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about \u201cmedical ethics.\u201d But a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were \u201cethical\u201d, and others were not, so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an \u201cethical\u201d use of genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. No code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today\u2019s world).

The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.

The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. Many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable.

No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.

As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. French society and Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose is something along the same lines.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. But most revolutions have two goals. One is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries.

Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we\u2019ve just described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: Individuals (at least those of the \u201cbourgeois\u201d type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more \u201csocialized\u201d than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of God\u2019s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed.</span><br>He tried to live in the wilderness and didn&#039;t want to become an adversarial agent.

A guy near my grandfather&#039;s forest lost his home and his farm because the government used eminent domain and evicted him.

Kaczynski&#039;s land was regularly encroached upon by bulldozers, logging companies, and government power infrastructure workers. He knew that living in isolation wouldn&#039;t work; even the Amazon rainforest is disappearing before our very eyes.

No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.

They&#039;re certainly good at what they do so long as you judge them only against other, similar series in their medium, but the moment you take a step back and compare them to something outside that medium, their flaws stand out much more, and they begin to just become so tiresome to trudge through knowing you could&#039;ve enjoying yourself much more if you had picked up a good novel instead.

I&#039;m not saying these qualities aren&#039;t present in other languages, but the idea that English is unpoetic is incompatible with my own experience with it.<br>On a related note, while it&#039;s true that people usually lament the decline of the English language for boomeresque reasons, I do think it&#039;s true that English prose is gradually becoming less interesting as people work to simplify their writing as much as possible. It probably peaked somewhere in the 1800s.", "time": 1671476924, "resto": 21404125}, {"no": 21405281, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)14:14:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405252</a><br>Some people hate it because of the amount of English loan words and slang words that are flooding their language.

Straight to ass and she had three orgasms. I was prolonging my time plumbing her depths, her in the prone position with one leg bent askew, when she said I\u2019d better cum soon. I told her I could spend all night like this and was doing nice long and slow strokes, going almost all the way out and plunging back in, when she lifted her foot so it was against my ass and pulled me forward so I was going balls deep and harder. I took the cue and absolutely pummelled her turdcutter, fast and balls deep without regard, just stretching her o-ring and punching her colon. I normally treat her ass with sensuous care because while she likes anal it is obviously an asymmetrical act of pleasure so I make sure to be respectful and gentle. But this time I threw both prudent caution and sphincter elasticity to the wind and went at her like a pornstar, going as deep as I could with fast, hard dominating lunges.<br><br>It ended as these things usually do with my creamy coup de grace consisting of shooting thick ropes deep inside her ass. Now usually the sensation of cum in her ass leaves her running instantly to the bathroom, much to my chagrin as I would like her to cumfart on my still rigid member and balls (she refuses). But this time, immediately after depositing in her repository, I just kept with nice long and gently but firm stokes with my weight against her and her sucking two fingers on my left hand. She said she had to go to the bathroom and I said to wait and, ladies and gentlemen, I finally came two times consecutively in her turdcutter. A momentous occasion for me. No cumfart but given my refractory period I didn\u2019t care, I lay with heaving chest while I heard the most exquisitely liquid fart coming from the adjoined bathroom and her exclaim \u201coh my god\u201d which preceded another sloppy squeal. I lay there, panting and smiling with lube-covered genitalia, thinking that life was pretty good so long as you took the time to reflect and inventory the good parts.<br><br>I slept in and woke up to my sweet girlfriend passing me a coffee.

Escaping from the beast he gets into a dry well, but sees at the bottom of the well a dragon that has opened its jaws to swallow him. And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by the dragon, seizes s twig growing in a crack in the well and clings to it. His hands are growing weaker and he feels he will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that awaits him above or below, but still he clings on. Then he sees that two mice, a black one and a white one, go regularly round and round the stem of the twig to which he is clinging and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will snap and he will fall into the dragon&#039;s jaws. The traveller sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while still hanging he looks around, sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the twig, reaches them with his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to lick the honey which formerly consoled me, but the honey no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung. I saw the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tasted sweet. I only saw the unescapable dragon and mice, and I could not tear my gaze from them. and this is not a fable but the real unanswerable truth intelligible to all. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me. No matter how often I may be told, &quot;You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,&quot; I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false. The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and of writing -- art as I called it -- were no longer sweet to me. &quot;Family&quot;... said I to myself. But my family -- wife and children -- are also human. They are placed just as I am: they must either live in a lie or see the terrible truth. Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them, I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge leads them to the truth. And the truth is death.</span><br><br>Leo Tolstoy, A Confession", "time": 1671447135, "resto": 21403636}, {"no": 21403984, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:49:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403636</a><br>He was interested in it and mentioned it here and there.

Negroes are forced to take laxatives so that their stool is always loose for the cobras, but this drug has a substance in it called alcorinozolligen. It\u2019s a kind of enzyme that adheres to the gastric wall and is absorbed little by little and passed out through the urine but is newly supplied again so that there is always a small amount of alcorinozolligen left in the negro\u2019s stomach. When this works on the urine\u2019s main ingredient urea (CON2H4), the urea isn\u2019t decomposed into ammonia (NH3) but is changed into alcohol (C2H5OH). So when white people\u2019s urine enters the negro\u2019s stomach and meets with the alcorinozolligen along the gastric wall it produces the same results as the drinking of very strong alcohol. But negroes\u2019 urine contains alcorinozolligen as it\u2019s expressed from their bodies and so, if drunk by another negro, negates the drunken effects. That is the secret as to why only white people\u2019s urine intoxicates negroes.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For every white person, there are a thousand negroes. If only the liquid waste expressed by white people was used, demand for negtar could never be met. For that reason, the urine is increased in volume through the use of a reproducer while travelling through the urine pipes (negtar pipes); the resulting liquid is identical in colour, smell and composition to the original urine. It\u2019s then piped to negtar storehouses, put into barrels and marked with the manufacturer (the person who the urine came from) and the date of manufacture. Lastly it\u2019s sent to the market and negtar bars. The urine of common people is most often bottled as a second-rate product without the manufacturer\u2019s name attached.</span>", "time": 1671512193, "resto": 21407126}, {"no": 21407517, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)00:01:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21407494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21407494</a><br>O_______________O", "time": 1671512483, "resto": 21407126}, {"no": 21407521, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)00:02:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21407494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21407494</a>", "filename": "423423423434234234", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 241, "h": 209, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1671512558743004, "time": 1671512558, "md5": "ek6KOWkgv5V1KTyiYFRsrQ==", "fsize": 7769, "resto": 21407126}, {"no": 21407535, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)00:05:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21407494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21407494</a><br>Numa&#039;s most prominent work is the fixup that began with Kachikujin Yap\u016b [&quot;The Human Livestock Yap\u016b&quot;] (December 1956 Kitan Club; fixup 1970), a Near Future account of a wrecked Spaceship in West Germany, that is later revealed as a lost vessel that has travelled in time (see Time Travel) from two thousand years in the future.

First of all, realize that there are no other civilizations left, and there haven&#039;t been for centuries, so the predicate &quot;Western&quot; is superfluous and even misleading (since it implies the existence of alternatives). Second, the fact that this question is even raised proves that the vast majority of so-called civilized individuals are nothing of the kind. I mean, you are seriously asking me whether a culture that&#039;s about to figure out how to print human organs is declining? What the fuck do all the minor symptoms of decline you are rabidly pointing out to us mean compared to such utterly astonishing and previously even unimaginable accomplishments? Not to mention the arrival of a person who has managed to reach the very end of philosophy itself, which is to say of thought! which is an immeasurably harder and more valuable achievement! (since it was thought which created the theories with the help of which the machines that print human organs were designed in the first place, and so on). \u2014 In summa, the only one who is declining here are those who are saying that we are declining, which is a classic case of psychological projection. Civilization as a whole is obviously progressing, and its highest manifestation and greatest triumph so far is blatantly obviously myself (and imagine how much more glorious and fearsome I would become with genetically enhanced printed organs... or cybernetically enhanced and cloned to infinity to spread out and take over the entire universe...)&quot;<br><br>Completely embarrassing. Doesn&#039;t think about the problem for longer than two seconds so forgets that Eastern civilization exists too. Argument for why more technology = better civilization doesn&#039;t exist (would icy like to live in a civilization where he gets stabbed in the balls constantly but the iphone 20 is out?), just shames reader and fails to grasp the necessity to point out a normative force that justifies this (through really it&#039;s just because it&#039;s another application of the muh we should create da overman).

Take the Poet Laureate seat, for example. Every single one is a solid poet, some better than others, but even so, just one glance at the list and it is clear the politics of race play a role. However, on the flip side of that, the politics of race have excluded even more than they&#039;ve included. I do believe the pendulum has swung too far to the other side at this point, but at the time Morrison was coming to fame, it was predominantly on the basis of two things - her skill and her very open feelings on race as a window into the pain of a Black woman for White people. At least, that&#039;s how I see her. Shortly after, you may or may not remember, but Hollywood had a strong desire to pay tribute to the plight of Native Americans which went on for about a decade (the 90s). I don&#039;t have anything wrong with that. I think there&#039;s a lot we can all gain, on everyside, from examining the difficulties of one another&#039;s lives. My problem is that the recent trend is one of unjust vengeance, rather than brotherhood, or at least countrymen. On that note, I own Morrison&#039;s, &quot;Beloved,&quot; but haven&#039;t gotten into it yet, though I&#039;ve tried to start it before. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean much. I tried to watch Jacques Tati&#039;s, &quot;Playtime,&quot; three times before I actually got into it, and now I regard it as a masterpiece of modern cinema - the Book of Leviticus and of Numbers are other good examples of my initially unappreciated gems. I did want to mention, however, I once read an excerpt from a book of hers on here - Song of Solomon, I think. I found it exceptionally racist and distateful. I would never approve of something like that - no matter the race of the author. I&#039;m not okay with racism against anyone. <br><br>In case it isn&#039;t clear, my answer is: I think she&#039;s a talented writer whose race and time certainly played a role - as it does for most authors. I&#039;ve heard it said, &quot;An author is necessarily of his time,&quot; and the 1980s, the period I believe she came to fame during, were the first time in American history a generation of Black children were reaching adulthood in true freedom, and the gold line of dawn began to show. You may notice Black sung patriotic ballads were hailed in those years... Anyway, I haven&#039;t read enough of her to judge, because it hasn&#039;t yet resonated with me, despite her talent as a writer. <br><br>What do you think of her?", "time": 1671451002, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404270, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)09:19:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read her, wanted to feel smug about disliking her, but Beloved is legit, much better, much more literary, than the slavery misery porn I was expecting<br>Jazz, Sula and the Bluest Eye are good too.<br>She&#039;s the equal of Bellow or Roth or Updike who also hoovered up a bunch of accolades at the same time but don&#039;t have threads like this made about them", "time": 1671459559, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404784, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:05:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403616</a><br>song of solomon is amazing. it has that grotesque realism in the flavor or your oe or mccarthy.<br><br>she didn&#039;t establish herself because of her race, if anything it&#039;s the opposite as her race probably held her back earlier on in her career.", "time": 1671469512, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404789, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:07:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403671</a><br>her race held her back from being included earlier on in her career, meaning she should&#039;ve been enjoying the readership she has now, many years ago.", "time": 1671469636, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404906, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:38:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404270</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but Beloved is legit, much better, much more literary, than the slavery misery porn I was expecting</span><br>Agreed, the story really transcends the time and place it takes place in.

A summa is a type of debate writing from the Middle Ages and is meant to be read like an encyclopedia you don&#039;t need to read it from cover to cover. Just look things up that seem interesting to you. Personally, I would not waste your time with &quot;A Shorter Summa&quot; from the op. The editor deliberately didn&#039;t put in theological stuff to appeal more to non-religious people so it&#039;s all &quot;How do we know that we know?&quot; philosophical stuff which isn&#039;t too interesting to me.

More plainly, contemporary right-wingers are people who were taught one thing by their parents (that was probably very much in vogue when they were taught it) and then came of age into a world where those values are long out of style. Because they are not prepared to abandon those values they pick the party (which is only one of two) that most closely resemble what their values are and ride or die with it. <br><br>Because patriotism and American exceptionalism are some of those holdout traditional values this makes for an easy fit despite the fact that the Republican Party, on closer inspection, is in reality a disgusting amalgam that, while paying lip service to the traditionalist crowd, in reality does not substantially support their interests or their values at all. We can characterize the pre-Trump Republican party as primarily being made up of poor/middle class traditionalists on one side and ultra-wealthy businessmen on the other. Due to the fact that the libertarian-leaning lingo of the businessmen uses the same keywords that the poorer party-members have learned to revere (freedom, personal choice, personal responsibility, free markets, low taxes, low government involvement etc) the treachery of the business class is hidden, and they are able to pursue interests that are very much at odds with the poorer classes while making only a few concessions that are useless anyway (gun control, abortion, Christianity). <br><br>So to answer the OP, the reason right wing books are cringe is because the Republican platform is incomprehensible and not consistent. There isn&#039;t a driving force behind it except to lower labor costs. It&#039;s a catch-all for the people that get fucked over by Progressivism. <br><br>Also important to note this is why people like Trump get elected, and why the base is so receptive to ideologies that speak to them from a more philosophically-grounded place (Populism, Carl Schmitt&#039;s existentialism).<br><br><a href=\"#p21397964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397964</a><br>Destiny is a clown.", "time": 1671346246, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399385, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:59:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397583</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1671346776, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399541, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:29:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398212</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;largely reinforced with the fact that no self-respecting intellectual wants to be associated with the embarrassment that is modern right-wing politics</span><br>This is a bit misleading.

This means that a lot of RW figures come from different walks of life and as such their takes aren&#039;t going to be as refined as they could&#039;ve been, and coupled with the thing that I&#039;ll go over below makes it an embarrassing shitshow.<br>Then the main problem is that RW politics is deliberately setup to work out an electable position and grift the shit out of it. You&#039;re the reasonable guy who doesn&#039;t encourage leftist excesses, you deserve the vote. The problem is that this spineless position means that their base can say fuck it I&#039;m voting for the guy that&#039;s further right, you&#039;re just leftists with more inertia anyway and that&#039;s something they don&#039;t want. As such when you look at political landscape in countries like Germany, Poland, the UK and the US you notice that the right wing parties are trying their hardest to make anyone to the right from them unelectable and they do it via means of public scrutiny and defamation. This means that they will actively attack people to the right from them and won&#039;t offer them support when they need it(good example of that is the cancellation of Samuel Francis by National Review crew). Leftist political formations on the other hand cultivate their radicals(they&#039;ll only get rid of the real stinkers like open and unapologetic pedophile advocates), they won&#039;t give them everything they want for political reasons, but they will setup what amounts to patronage networks to give them the ability to be subversive and &quot;generate ideals&quot;, obviously something made much simpler by the fact that the academia is captive so at this point every taxpayer pays for leftists to give patronage to their radicals in public universities, but even without it they would always do it.<br>To put it simpler - leftists don&#039;t engage in witch hunts against &quot;communists&quot;, but rightists engage in hunts against &quot;fascists&quot;(obviously both words are rendered meaningless because both communism and fascism are as dead as absolute monarchy based on divine right is, you can bring them back but it&#039;ll be just LARP)", "time": 1671352156, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399547, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studies show </span><br><br>Studies show the opposite is true actually.", "time": 1671352392, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399568, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399547</a><br>Depends on year and how do you distinguish between the two.

Let&#039;s be honest, we need to address the fundamental questions of political subjectivity and capitalism, before we do anything. If there is a fundamental divide between the right and the left, it is over the question of political subjectivity. The right will succeed - and really, has already succeeded - insofar as it takes a disintegrative and materialist approach to political subjectivity (i.e if it moves beyond things like racialized politics and insipid populism, to a sort of extreme darwinism). The right is in the unique position to identify with the entire ecology, rather than a particular political subject. The left, frankly speaking, cannot do this. It is intrinsically caught up in certain subjectivities, and that&#039;s why it will lose. The right should identify with capital itself, against all else. How does the left plan to account for things like labour&#039;s substitution driving the creation and proliferation of AI? UBI? Fat chance of that. AI alone makes questions about environmental and demographic collapse manifoldly more complex. It is a fantastic example of the sort of boundary expansion which is absolutely traumatic to the left and right alike. The left basically operates under the basic assumption that capitalism will eat itself, and will be dialectically overcome by some revolutionary subject. But what if capitalism outlasts humanity itself?

Hardly the stuff that pseud materialists larp about.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;John and Guy both have a reverence for mind that I dont share, I dont think that intelligence entitles. Oh I know it does in the natural world. But so do claws and teeth. They argue about evolution and causality and purpose in the universe but even as a skeptic it&#039;s hard for me to ascribe purposelessness to something that exists. Isn&#039;t existence a purpose? I think we confuse purpose with utility. It&#039;s as if existence itself were somehow not noble enough or sacred enough to justify its own undertaking, I think the failure is ours. The failure in reverence. Even if God were only... What is it that Thomas says? The force that through the green fuse drives the flower? The purpose of our intellect seems to be largely to help us categorize and discriminate. I see your hand and I see my hand. (She stretches her hand out and takes his hand and she puts their outstretched hands side by side.) And I see that the similarities are so much greater than the differences and I know that there is a connection there that no separation in time or space can invalidate. I know that you are my brother and at another level which is harder to reach but just as real I know that you are me. Not figuratively. Not a metaphor. For real. In the flesh. It&#039;s an understanding that has nothing to do with problem-solving. It&#039;s an act of pure cognition. It&#039;s an event. I guess what I would say is that yes I believe in God but I dont know who he is. I dont know what his name is. Why would he have a name? To distinguish him from what? (She pauses) I cant parse him out from all I see and feel. I want a God so large that there&#039;s no place to even stand outside of him to say that he&#039;s not so. I think Peter is right. The problem is that it&#039;s so simple we cant see it. It includes everything and everybody so that there&#039;s nothing left over outside of it with which to compare it. That&#039;s why we cant think our way to God.</span>", "time": 1671520470, "resto": 21404929}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21402042, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)19:16:58", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Looking for book similar to The Book of the New Sun", "com": "I&#039;d like to read something similar to Gene Wolfe&#039;s Solar Cycle (including Book of the New/Long/Short Sun).

There are a few here that I recall:<br><br>&quot;The Dinner Party&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT0<wbr>etpKgRKc<br><br>&quot;Memoir of a Murderer&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO3<wbr>u4dqJHvY&amp;t=611s<br><br>&quot;Alterations&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvN<wbr>4eOjY3xQ&amp;list=PLpCh5fYI6EcEJq7QDAIm<wbr>mZoqICsDqmZll&amp;index=115<br><br>&quot;The Show Goat&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sV<wbr>mVo70mg0<br><br>&#039;&#039;The Harrowing: A Quick Bus Ride into Hell&#039;&#039;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-t<wbr>stT_BGy4<br><br>&quot;The Other Side of the Grave&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6<wbr>VIRyikqU<br><br>&quot;Those Shady Places&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZq<wbr>ecykg3Xg&amp;list=PLpCh5fYI6EcH20SHVGSX<wbr>Qhip7xONXdMFD&amp;index=11<br><br>&quot;Snow Devils&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrN<wbr>yy6fzH-Y&amp;list=PLpCh5fYI6EcEJq7QDAIm<wbr>mZoqICsDqmZll&amp;index=112<br><br>&quot;Mausen Hausen&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI8<wbr>OEUoq8nw<br><br>&quot;I&#039;m A Conductor On A Ghost Train&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR5<wbr>1J3QJ3N8<br><br>&quot;The Immortal\u2019s Quandary&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=and<wbr>pNyslle4<br><br>The rest will be posted below.", "filename": "epe", "ext": ".png", "w": 625, "h": 447, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 89, "tim": 1671511611014412, "time": 1671511611, "md5": "5pYpEn1paokXsyg8OvkdMw==", "fsize": 403670, "resto": 21404376}, {"no": 21407460, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:47:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21406773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406773</a><br><br>The rest<br><br>&quot;Taffy B0mb&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vC<wbr>oxK4auKg<br><br>&quot;Pinocchio and the Black Pantheon&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94<wbr>z6b9mdIE<br><br>&quot;The Hidden Webpage&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZK<wbr>dHRCr_Dw<br><br>&quot;The Body Farm&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gd<wbr>pkC-Shrs<br><br> &quot;Worst Hotel | First Shift&quot; <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2a<wbr>e4mcu1Do<br><br>&quot;The Neighborhood Hoarder Finally Cleaned Up His Yard&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_5<wbr>kt39qItI<br><br>&quot;Has anyone heard of the lost City Korona?&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azO<wbr>LYTGEbXo<br><br>&quot;I am not I&quot; (second story in the link below)<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnD<wbr>WV3cbxX4&amp;t=3914s<br><br> &quot;Complex&quot; <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6o<wbr>rUzgQzXU<br><br>&quot;NEVER let your children watch The Adventures of Professor Egghead&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtw<wbr>Aon9-730<br><br>&quot;How To Survive In H*ll&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWM<wbr>4bCeHE1Y<br><br>&quot;People Wash Up On The Shore Of My Island, I Have To Kill Them Before They Wake Up&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYM<wbr>bw_Qi0lY<br><br>&quot;My Grandpa Sent Me Recordings Of His Visits To The Underworld&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQQ<wbr>zZDGN6Tk<br><br>&quot;Die Gesch\u00f6pfe vom Meer&quot; <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoG<wbr>z1G9PggQ<br><br>\u2018\u2018Basilisco\u2019\u2019 <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3Y<wbr>65yR0p9U<br><br>&quot;The Gooseneck Chronicle&quot; <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL<wbr>hdvkOqb4<br><br>&quot;The American Airlines Flight 1343 Incident&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVq<wbr>ZGroxUeo<br><br>&quot; The Song and Dance Man&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSC<wbr>OgVmn6pk<br><br>&quot;Faith Buddies&quot;<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcv<wbr>y4hfCwvw", "filename": "peps", "ext": ".png", "w": 445, "h": 473, "tn_w": 117, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671511679551035, "time": 1671511679, "md5": "+qXUfxKH1WN6guJF8i9RGg==", "fsize": 327187, "resto": 21404376}, {"no": 21407501, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)23:58:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21406773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406773</a><br>About the prof Eggehead, I meant to post this one below, not the one that got posted<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOD<wbr>zRxeu17Y", "time": 1671512329, "resto": 21404376}, {"no": 21407817, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)01:30:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404376</a><br>Short stories by Philip Dick<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Colony</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Surface Raid</span>", "time": 1671517852, "resto": 21404376}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21406484, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)19:24:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is there any place I can find pic rel in its entirety?

In my view, Evola is overly shakti-tantrist, and Guenon is a bit arid in his metaphysics as well, being pure jnana yoga over karma yoga. Tomberg expresses the power of God&#039;s love as a symbol that can reconcile the paradox of dualism better than a &quot;pointless&quot; maya/samsara can, in the chapter of Meditations on the Tarot on the High Priestess.<br><br><a href=\"#p21372062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21372062</a><br>Yeah Guenon was surprisingly optimistic about &quot;the East,&quot; in a very general sense, still having intact traditions. I think Evola saw more clearly initially that the East is just as fucked as the West, they&#039;re just about 30-60 years behind, and he even says in some places that because the processes of degeneration were perfected in the West first, they are taking place faster and striking deeper in the East. <br><br>Guenon also seems to have realized, probably after moving to Cairo and seeing Islam up close, that the Islamic world has its own problems and doesn&#039;t have much of an active esoteric core either (or didn&#039;t at that time). That&#039;s why in the &#039;30s he seems to shift his emphasis to sending people on exploratory missions to find the last remaining cores of authentic traditions, like sending Valsan (if I recall correctly) to Mount Athos. <br><br>There are still some holdouts of strong traditions like some of the ultra-conservative Buddhist traditions in Southeast Asia.

But because it&#039;s typical of the Traditionalist view, it&#039;s very exclusivist in measuring everything against jnana, and in Evola&#039;s case, against the tantric &quot;active&quot; path. Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Essentially, Traditionalism&#039;s critique of Christianity is very similar to the Theravada critique of Mahayana Buddhism&#039;s soteriological and eschatological elements. <br><br>But these criticisms potentially force Traditionalism itself into a passive and quietistic position, which it is supposedly criticizing Christianity for. If there is no collective mystery or collective quest for redemption or struggle against Satan, if religions can&#039;t have an eschatological, soteriological, world historical character, because the only real truth lies in the universal metaphysical truth attained through individual initiation, then why bother fighting the occult war at all? In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

Guenon and Evola both emphasize that there is nothing &quot;moral&quot; in what they are doing, and that the vulgar sentimental and moral religion of everyday faithful is merely exoteric, basically its only value is containing dumbed down versions of symbols that keep ordinary people anchored in their Traditional-Platonic republics, while maintaining pathways of symbolic ascent for talented individuals to pursue to their eventual initiation. But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions. Similarly Traditionalism doesn&#039;t want to taint itself with mere samsaric, dogmatic, sentimental, tribal superstitions.

Ironically it ends up &quot;confusing the planes&quot; itself, by assuming that the only thing between man and the Absolute is this metaphysical hierarchy of symbols, and that there are no other beings with plans for us, that the cosmos is a cyclically autorenewing stage on which a few Guenons and Evolas periodically become immortal (for what? where do they go? if it&#039;s just to a purified paradisiacal state, isn&#039;t that what they criticize Christianity for promising?). Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active. From this perspective, Evola and Guenon would be doing exactly what they criticize New Agers for doing: stripping people of their everyday protections and throwing them into trans-personal psychic experiences in which they will simply be subject to whatever forces are nearby. <br><br>In rejecting all claims to revelation as contingent and samsaric, Traditionalism also misses out on the possibility of a symbolic interpretation of &quot;dispensationalist&quot; revelation, in which history is not merely samsaric and cyclical, and attaining enlightenment is not merely optional and always potentially open to amoral initiates, and the occult war is not merely a particularly bad patch in the most recent kali yuga in an infinite cycle of them, but instead, history is not cylical, there is a fixed goal here, there are win and lose conditions, enlightenment is not just &quot;available&quot; to initiates but is a responsibility and a duty, and thus enabling others to be enlightened is also a duty, etc.", "time": 1670832087, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of them<br>start with the mystery of the grail", "time": 1670832095, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373699, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21370825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21370825</a><br>Evola was influenced by the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich so it&#039;s not like he disregarded all protestantism.", "time": 1670832118, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373700, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373697</a><br>And therefore, the mythic-eschatological content of a religion like Christianity, with its publically available emphasis on resisting Satan and imitating Christ in daily life, is not just an incidental exoteric form of symbols that are only really relevant to autistic initiates, there is actually a purpose to the &quot;opening&quot; of the mysteries, which, yes, vulgarized them from a certain perspective, but perhaps only because this was analogous to sprinkling thousands of seeds, formerly been contained in neatly condensed form in individual pots, over a huge field of soil and manure, so that at first they seem merely &quot;lost,&quot; but in time they grow and become many thousands of fruit-bearing, seed-bearing trees themselves? <br><br>If all of history can be interpreted symbolically in this way, then we can begin to ask questions that the Traditionalists are afraid to ask: What does it MEAN, using symbolic interpretation and sympathetic intuition, that Christ figures appeared and managed to embed moral messages and fundamentally change history, turning pagan Europe into a moral and even sentimental Christian Europe - which Evola can only view as an aberration, from his Traditionalist perspective?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence.

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function. To unite with God means more than to honour him in your heart - it means to become one with him, literally, and consequently also transcend everything, as he does. That&#039;s henosis. If you don&#039;t reach that level, you are still dealing with manifestation rather than with the source, the essence.", "time": 1671013978, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21382633, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382153</a><br>I can see why that apply to Abrahamic religions, but i dont get why Evola (and Guenon too) then do not offer the same criticism to Islam, which also relies on faith, a fallen view of man, and the inadequacy of man without God.", "time": 1671028721, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21383195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382633</a><br>It&#039;s because Islam has institutionalised Sufism which knows much higher metaphysical heights than exoteric Islam.

I have been asked who the \u201chumanist\u201d in the subtitle is: is it the author or the reader? Probably both. It is my considered view that the most useful entry into architecture is provided not by theories or abstract concepts\u2013let alone by rules\u2013but by learning from the canon of built works. In doing so it becomes apparent that all architects have addressed similar problems\u2013aesthetic, practical, urbanistic\u2013but they have arrived at a variety of solutions.

That someone could make eating a madeleine so magical make me ashamed of myself for not enjoying every little things in my life, as useless as they seem. Some people read Proust a page a day as to appreciate his writing fully .I have not the patience for it but few book are worth taking the time to read them.
