The discussion then shifted to the size of vaginas, with some arguing that they can stretch to 7 inches, while others argued that it was only 4.75 inches. The conversation then shifted to the physical features of white women, with some wishing they had hair like Latinas. The conversation then shifted to the size of penises, with some arguing that the average erect penis is 33% longer than the average vagina. The conversation then shifted to the beauty of Latinas, with some arguing that they are ugly and out of shape, while others argued that they are attractive.

It is a story about the end of the world in which the world ends.&quot; In other words, Clute&#039;s answer to my question is nothing, there&#039;s nothing at the end of the road. Such a statement &quot;in which the world ends&quot; strikes me as too categorical for The Road or for McCarthy&#039;s work as a whole, of which The Road, presaged over and again from The Orchard Keeper onward, is both a logical continuation and a kind of termination. I believe, with Edwin T. Arnold, that McCarthy&#039;s work is grounded in moral choice. Clute&#039;s statement &quot;you remove the Christ figure and you are left with virtually nothing&quot; leaves little room for choice, but I think the novel, in its own contradictory way, does. How then do we go about examining the relative evidence for and against God in The Road? We look directly at the text, at what McCarthy intentionally did or did not write. What and where is the textual evidence working against God, what and where is the evidence working for God? And how do they stack up? In the novel&#039;s second fragment we can begin to accumulate the evidence against God. There is a simple description of the setting as &quot;Barren, silent, godless&quot; (4). A few pages later a single snowflake sifts down: &quot;He caught it in his hand and watched it expire there like the last host of Christendom&quot; (16). It&#039;s the boy who catches the snowflake but the narrator&#039;s simile is hardly of the boy&#039;s imagining. Sometimes McCarthy reverses the religious reference for negative effect as in this un-writing of Genesis by the man: &quot;The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. [. . .] The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality&quot; (88-9). Subtract the idiom and you subtract the referent - the un-reification of God.", "time": 1676108966, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643859, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)04:49:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643832</a><br>that&#039;s good too. hadn&#039;t thought of that", "time": 1676108967, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643868, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)04:55:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643858</a><br>Beyond the pervasive horror and starkness and gloom that never cease, probably the most unimpeachable godlessness comes in this descriptive prose poem: &quot;He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world.

And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover.&quot; If there&#039;s a god out there somewhere, he&#039;s not very evident. The narrator or the man - it&#039;s often hard to distinguish between them - laments this state of affairs as irremediable: &quot;Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it&quot; (130). Relendess, intestate, implacable, blind, crushing, hunted, trembling - is there a more ferocious description anywhere of our borrowed world?<br><br>If that hyper-McCarthy prose poem is the most negative ponderation on God, the most intriguing is surely the father and son&#039;s encounter with the old man who calls himself Ely. Their conversation treats survival, death and God, but it raises more questions than it answers. Ely, whether it&#039;s real or some perverse nom de guerre, is the only person in the novel endowed with any sort of proper name. Why? What - beyond urging the critics to hustle - is the significance of the name? Some of the criticism takes Ely to allude to Elijah, a connection I fail to see except on the most superficial level - the wise old biblical prophet, other than caricature or intentional reversal, he is not; even less is he Melville&#039;s Elijah from Chapter 19 of Moby Dick - and I don&#039;t understand any link beyond some weird possible version of Elijah&#039;s sharing of the Passover meal, a flimsy tie, for what it&#039;s worth, seen also by Phillip A. Snyder (81) in the context of hospitality. <br><br>Why not Ely itself? I mean E-L-Y, but pronounced Eel-ee (possibly derived from eels), the city on the River Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire, the cathedral of which is called the Ship of Fens, popularly believed to be built on Cromwell&#039;s Rock, on a meteorite that may have helped put the dinosaurs out of business (Ely Ghosts).", "time": 1676109337, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643876, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:00:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643868</a><br>Most readers tend to think that the unspecified catastrophe in the novel is man-made, but if so, why does McCarthy deliberately fail to say so, either in the novel or in subsequent interviews? What if it&#039;s God-made or a catastrophic accident? McCarthy remarked somewhat facetiously in an interview in the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I don&#039;t have an opinion. At the Santa Fe Institute I&#039;m with scientists of all disciplines, and some of them in geology said it looked like a meteor to them,&quot; as if they were privy to information beyond his ken. &quot;But it could be anything - volcanic activity or it could be a nuclear war. It&#039;s not really important&quot; (Jurgensen). The only critic I have read so far who wants to keep the question open is Jay Ellis, who does not decide between &quot;nuclear winter, or the calamitous climate change sped up by a comet strike&quot; (28). The interview, even given McCarthy&#039;s well known propensity for hermetic or enigmatic pronouncements, only strengthens the possibility that the catastrophe was not necessarily man-made.<br><br>If we accept McCarthy&#039;s ingenuousness or ingeniousness, we also have to accept the somewhat outrageous notion that the only proper name in the novel (other than Rock City, of which Ely could be a reiteration, in which case Ely would be the rock of the un-church) coincides, at least in the popular mind, with a great physical disaster, which did to the dinosaurs what the current disaster in the novel is doing to man. And then we must ask if it&#039;s also coincidental that this character Ely, the only one with a name, is the one to tell us: &quot;There is no God,&quot; an utterly un-Elijah-like judgment that he promptly reiterates: &quot;There is no God and we are his prophets&quot; (170) - And why does he look like<br> &quot;a starved and threadbare buddha&quot; (168) and talk like the prophet Mohammed? That sort of multi-religious palimpsest is clearly contrived, but to what end? Is McCarthy deriding &quot;diversity&quot;? Are we meant to believe Ely? Maybe he&#039;s just crazy, or maybe he&#039;s right and crazy, or maybe he&#039;s trying to tell us in his own crazy Nietzschean way that God is so utterly removed from us as to be dead, an idea Jay Ellis flirts with when he writes of: &quot;[. . .] the larger philosophy we keep<br> determining in these novels - including McCarthy&#039;s sense of god as a kind of absent parent no longer able, or willing, to do anything&quot; (35), a sense that echoes tangentially Leo Daugherty&#039;s Gnostic reading of Blood Meridian. The disaster may not be caused by man, but the episode with Ely can only reinforce any case against any God other than a totally absent one, no matter how eccentric or contrived Ely himself may be.", "time": 1676109653, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643891, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643876</a><br>Another of those prose poems occurs in a kind of flashback or memory: &quot;Out on the roads the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond&quot; (181). The passage sounds like certain descriptions from Suttree and something like the first chapter of Ecclesiastes. The key word, for my purposes, is &quot;unremarked,&quot; which seems to indicate a nonexistent or uncaring God. The passage echoes one from early in the novel: &quot;The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air&quot; (11). These passages point convincingly to nothingness and doubtless are among the major reasons the novel has been labeled nihilistic or godless. There is also a brief fragment that would seem to deny any after life: &quot;Do you think your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledgerbook? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground&quot; (196). This denial seems to issue straight from the man as does a subsequent passage of the same type: &quot;I think maybe they are watching, he said. They are watching for a thing that even death cannot undo and if they do not see it they will turn away from us and they will not come back&quot; (210). Who are &quot;they,&quot; we are forced to ask, ghosts, angels, archons, aeons, gods? There is no answer and all that is clear is the quandary itself, yet the very nature of the question, at once rhetorical and pointed, seems to signal some Eliot-like turning, however bleakly. Is it some spark - &quot;the thing that even death cannot<br> undo&quot; - that they must see in order not to turn away? <br><br>The textual case for God, or more specifically a Christlike figure in<br> the boy, difficult to imagine without some a priori God, however aloof, comprises more evidence than the negative case, and more convincingly. We can understand much of the material by stringing it together, almost without explication, beginning with this passage, which is the first we hear of the boy: &quot;He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke&quot; (5). Shortly after they emerge from the mountains, the father, having left their camp, observes: &quot;When he rose and turned to go back the tarp was lit from within where the boy had wakened. Sited there in the darkness the frail blue shape of it looked like the pitch of some last venture at the edge of the world. Something all but unaccountable. And so it was&quot; (48). Except for being unaccountable, this phenomenon - whatever it describes - is wholly unremarked in the narrative or in the criticism, but it foreshadows much of what follows. That foreshadowing, while easily slipping by unnoticed here, cannot be anything other than explicit and intentional.", "time": 1676110251, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643898, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643891</a><br>Some twenty pages later, as the father washes the roadrat&#039;s gore from his son&#039;s hair, comes the first direct inkling of the boy&#039;s role: &quot;All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you&#039;ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them&quot; (74). Messiah, of course, means anointed one and while this passage does not proclaim a messiah, it does plant a seed of implication, especially when on the next page we read that the man &quot;sat beside him and stroked his pale and tangled hair. Golden chalice, good to house a god&quot; (75). Someone - the father, the narrator, the reader, the critic - is making suggestions we cannot simply ignore. Then the boy himself begins to make pronouncements. First he says that nothing bad will happen to them, &quot;Because we&#039;re carrying the<br> fire&quot; (83), when there is no fire and they&#039;re about to sleep in a car with only suit coats piled on for warmth. This figurative fire will become a central motif for the boy&#039;s sacred nature, which the man will continue to assert, as when he asks Ely: &quot;What if I said he&#039;s a god?&quot; (172), a role<br> the boy will eventually take for himself. When the boy answers the man, saying that he is the one &quot;who has to worry about everything,&quot; saying, &quot;Yes I am. . .I am the one&quot; (259), he is echoing Jesus in a number of instances - I am the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6); I am the door of the sheep (John 10:7); I am the light of the world (John 8:12); I am the alpha and the omega (Revelation 1:8), to mention a few of the most obvious. Suffice it to say the proclamation &quot;I am&quot; is among the strongest phrases in the Old and New Testaments, the latter inevitably an echo of God&#039;s pronouncement to Moses: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). Not only does the boy offer to take responsibility, he offers to do so in unmistakably religious language, with none of the equivocation or contradiction so evident in Ely&#039;s negative discourse. The boy, born after the disaster, has been raised, we must assume, without church or scripture, and his scriptural echoes must therefore issue forth from narrative design or divine inspiration. There cannot be - not in a Cormac McCarthy novel -inadvertent echoes or unintentional allusions.", "time": 1676110497, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643914, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>Later the boy asks: &quot;Is it real? The fire?&quot; and the man answers: &quot;It&#039;s inside you. It was always there. I can see it&quot; (278-9). Is that the figurative fire of civilization? I think it means - textually, in this novel - less something vaguely Promethean than the literal belief in or presence of God or at the very least some entrapped divine spark of the Gnostics. My reading stems not from any innate desire to interpret the text that way. Rather it seems the weightier of two intentionally conflicting possible readings or discourses, set out as though the narrator himself were engaged in some mono-dialogical debate meant to be attended and adjudged by the reader. Alongside the fire motif runs a light motif - when there is in this darkest of worlds no source of light - that only reinforces the sacred nature of the boy: &quot;There was light all about him&quot; and &quot;when he moved the light moved with him&quot; (277). The man is compelled to comment: &quot;There is no prophet in the earth&#039;s long chronicle who&#039;s not honored here today&quot; (277), an inference, by the father at least, that the boy incarnates some second coming. Finally, there are two poignant words that I believe strengthen the textual case for God. The first is salitter: word used rather exclusively by Jacob Boehme (or commentary on him, as by Hegel), the Lutheran mystic clearly familiar to McCarthy, to judge nowhere beyond the two citations, one used as epigraph and the other reversed as subtitle, for Blood Meridian. Salitter - there could be a dissertation on this usage eventually, as well as a study on the meaning of fire and light as God and Christ in Jacob Boehm and Cormac McCarthy - means divine essence, the stuff of God (not unlike the Tao or Brahman, or in quantum physics the matrix of Max Planck): &quot;He walked out into the road and stood. The silence. The salitter drying from the earth&quot; (261). John Clute properly underlines the vital importance of this sole word, acknowledging God&#039;s presence but believing that &quot;the Christ figure must somehow be seen - be felt - to transcend the drying of the divine out of the earth.&quot; I agree, at least to the point that Clute has put his finger in the wound. The central question would seem to be precisely that: Does the Christ-like figure of the boy transcend - or reverse or compensate for - such an absence or withdrawal? It is reasonable to argue, as Clute does, that the answer is no. But what are we to make of this passage, giving us the second poignant word, just before the father dies: . .he [the man] would raise his weeping eyes and see him [the boy] standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle&quot; (273)?", "time": 1676111035, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643920, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:25:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>I got 1 paragraph through this wall of complete shite and couldn&#039;t go on. <br>TLDR please and thx desu.", "time": 1676111150, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643928, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643914</a><br>Tabernacle: In general terms, a place of worship.

Is the father delirious or divinatory: &quot;from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacled If the father is in some mortal delirium - there is nothing in the text to so indicate - then Clute is still in cogent territory. But regardless, why tabernacle, why the singularly most ecumenical term imaginable to express the essence of God? And what if the man is seeing into the future, or what if the boy does indeed glow? What if McCarthy is not making a reasonable or cogent argument?<br><br>The last thing the father says is: &quot;Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again&quot; (281). The father dies, the boy stays with him the emblematic three days and then as if on cue or as if preordained or as if popped from a machine, Parka-man &quot;hove into view&quot; (281). The critics who say that Parka-man is a deus ex machina are right, and that is precisely the point. His woman, who welcomes the boy, doesn&#039;t talk to him of civilization, she talks to him about God and tells him that &quot;the breath of God was his breath&quot; (286). If McCarthy didn&#039;t want us to read it the way I just have, why did he write it that way? Why say goodness will find the boy and have goodness find the boy? Why drag out a deliberate and undisguised deus ex machina - no one could seriously argue that McCarthy was unaware of the fact - if what you want to do is deny any sort of deus? And it&#039;s not just goodness that finds the boy but a new and this time caring mother, the mother that does not exist for that long list of road warriors we started with, the mother absent or defective in all those novels, every single one of them, including most especially this one, and not just goodness but warm caring affectionate understanding maternal goodness - quite the opposite of the mother who abandons the boy - the only such maternal goodness, all one short paragraph of it, in virtually all of McCarthy&#039;s work. If the message is meant to be nothing more than the withdrawal of whatever Gnostic substance there is out there, why have as the subject of the last paragraph of the plotted novel a mother who is not only all of the foregoing, but also a mother who understands how to explain the unexplainable without attempting to force any belief on the boy? What&#039;s at the end of The Road? What textually, with no need to adduce scientific opinion from the ironically named Santa Fe Institute? Stabat mater, not yet dolorosa. And that mother who is there, standing there, not yet grieving, means that the pistol-packing, fire-carrying boy, the light-bearing boy, the golden chalice and glowing tabernacle of an anointed boy who honors all the prophets and whom goodness has found is who and what we have. He and she - mother and child reunion - are the final image of the plotted novel.", "time": 1676111393, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643935, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643928</a><br>It&#039;s not just that the novel&#039;s &quot;literary passion defies the very emptiness that it proclaims,&quot; as John Cant has written (197).

Here, I am reaffirming Jay Ellis&#039; optimistic reading of &quot;The ending [that] provides us for the first time in a McCarthy novel with a full family&quot; (37), but I want to go a step beyond that assertion and nail my reading in a text that is pure McCarthy: &quot;She would talk to him some times about God.&quot; That sentence describes an intentionally and pointedly repeated action, not the indefinite future of &quot;She would talk to him sometime about God,&quot; but &quot;She would talk to him sometimes about God,&quot; and that single letter &quot;s,&quot; showing us a continued and continuing action, opens us to the only remotely happy ending in all of McCarthy&#039;s work, scented as it is with the boy&#039;s breath that is the breath of God. <br><br>Could be the gypsy of The Crossing needs to make an exception.

The man who remembered the trout in the early mountain section of the novel is dead. Yet you, the reader, cannot help associating the trout here with those remembered trout. They are as iconic as Hemingway&#039;s trout, or more so, both early in the novel and intensely so now in this echoing epilogic vision of them, shared in the foreground between the complicit narrator and the willing reader and in the background with Hemingway and the dead father.<br><br>Native brook trout (technically a char, salvelinus fontinalis) are as perfect a species as exists in nature, yet they are delicate and susceptible to the effects of any kind of pollution.

On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.&quot; These miracle trout of becoming are at once real (the light wavy markings on the brook trout&#039;s dorsal area are called vermiculations) and intricately evolved, and they return us to once - what is now, from the current point of view of this narrator-after-the-fact, in illo tempore - to our as yet undestroyed world where the brookies still wimple and swim, while not releasing us from the recorded destruction in the novel: &quot;Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again.&quot; We are returned, briefly and ever so hypothetically, to the irreversibly fragile pristine mountain setting - a thing which could not be put back - of the sacred trout for the ultimate, possibly guilt-laden, possibly not, nostalgic and mystical pronouncement: &quot;In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery&quot; (286-87).", "time": 1676111991, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643952, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:41:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643946</a><br>In the deep mountain hollows and coves where the trout once lived, emblematic of the entire natural world, all of nature was older than man and all of it, everything, hummed with the essence of life.

Is Death even a Thing if there\u2019s no Afterlife? Didn\u2019t we establish that Memory causes Existance, Death can be only Painful if it is Remembered. For that to be True, You Must BE after Death. There must be a Place for you to BE. As Being is contraint by Space &amp; Time.<br>17. Is Ignorance Good? Doesn\u2019t Ignorance causes immense Suffering. How can it be Good?<br>18. Then can you be willingly Ignorant? You must be Insane to do that.<br>19. Isn\u2019t Ignorance Ignoring what\u2019s to come &amp; having no knowledge what\u2019s being Done or was Done not Good or even Bad. If it\u2019s Death that\u2019s coming at the end &amp; is inherently true for every being that lives &amp; had lived. How can Death be inherently true if we declared \u201cTo Live is Inherently True\u201d.<br>20. Is Death an Action/Experience, Does Death Happens. Action needs a Object on which it occurs. If Death is an Action, the Object must be after it has been Acted upon. But Death ends the Being. Then Death doesn\u2019t Occur.<br>21. Death Is. Then just any other (thing) that Is, is feeled/percieved by us. Any object that isn\u2019t percieved by us, Is Not. Like a Ball is percievable to our Touch &amp; Vision, Sadness is percievable to our Soul. Death must be Percievable to us. We must be after Death for Death to be Percievable. We Must Be - with Remembrance, in a Space &amp; Time. But Death is something that makes Being Cease to Be. Thus, Death Isn\u2019t. Not in the sense that it can affect us in any way possible.<br>22. Death Isn\u2019t. Then it can\u2019t affect us in any way possible, as it is not. Then no one experiences Death or no one Dies. Then where Existance Is, Death is not. Where Death Is, Existance is Not. <br>24. If Death Is. Then it must be Percieved or Affect Us in some way. Then We Must Die. We must Live for Death to occur, without Life, Death Isn\u2019t. To Die is from something. If Life is not, there\u2019s no Death. Just like a Ball to be in motion, it must have been in a rest. So for it being at rest, it must have been in motion. If Death is from Life. Life must be from Death. But we have no remembrance before Life. To Be is to have Remembrance. We Must have no Remembrance after Death. But if Death to be, we must have remembrance &amp; thus Death Isn\u2019t.<br>25. The Ball is at Motion with respect to Us, If we are moving at the same pace. It is not in Motion, but at Rest. Then there must be Death with respect to Living. Then we must Live to Know Death. Death can\u2019t ever occur directly to You, you can only be a spectator to Death of someone else. You can never know Death for yourself, you can only see someone else Cease to Be.<br>26. Is something even real, if it can never occur to you but only to someone else.<br>27.

I became more aware of what friends are supposed to be and why all of the friendships I&#039;ve ever had fell apart, despite me wanting my relationships with them to last forever and to love them without the thought of betrayal ever occuring to my mind. People are friends with you based on certain conditions. They become friends just like modern dating, systematically, by asking you the same questions NPCs do about yourself or they try to find something in common. Sure, that&#039;s not always the case and you can still find a certain level of deepness that you can share between yourselves. Even though you may have been together for a very long time, things always change and as such, conditions in your friendship change. The guy you&#039;ve been friends with for a long time changes so much that you start to not recognize him bit by bit and he starts alienating you, ignoring you and forget about you completely. What the fuck is the point of having friends when every single person on the planet is like this? No one actually cares for who you really are and what you think. Even when they care about who you are, it&#039;s either because they&#039;re a fan of you or they seek to gain something from you. They only think of you as a tool that can give them something of use. The only other name I could call a friendship would be a &#039;business relationship&#039; because that&#039;s what it is in the end. Only conditional. Loyalty is bullshit, the psychological support they give you is only in pretend or they don&#039;t want to, can&#039;t or don&#039;t know how to help you. I never wanted anything from my friends but just to feel loved forever. But everyone in this world is a douchebag who only loves what you offer, not who you are. I don&#039;t want to continue living on this planet if friendship between people is conditional. A slave is more loyal than a friend. I honestly am considering killing myself very soon.

Could tell right away that this was more catgirl immortality speak. While your content certainly isn&#039;t for me, I can try to help.<br>From watching your videos, I can tell you that the biggest issue isn&#039;t your scripting. While it is an issue, any amount of scripting won&#039;t cover the issues with your delivery. You waffle about without cutting your flubbed lines and your microphone quality is still not where it needs to be. Your mic is picking up an absurd amount of reverberation from your voice. This means that you are speaking too loudly in an untreated room with a microphone that does not handle background noise rejection. If you can&#039;t afford to throw $125 at acoustic foam then your next best option is to turn the gain down and move the microphone closer to your mouth. 6 inches away with the capsule and 15 degrees away from the front of your mouth to stop direct plosives.<br>As for your Vtuber avatar, upgrade or ditch it. People who put up with Vtube avatars don&#039;t really have patience for some VRchat model whose entire range of movement consists of craning its neck 10 degrees\u2014and that&#039;s without even accounting for the terrible lighting and schizophrenic eye tracking. It looks cheap, cheaper than if you had nothing at all there.<br>As for the scripting, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you. I&#039;ll second the other anon&#039;s observation that this appears to be less of a script and more an outline, but I&#039;m not sure expanding upon the outline can lead to an entertaining final product. Your content has always had this absurd clash in how you attempt to sound professional and how unhinged your actual argumentation is.

The combination of meditation being a good beginner ritual (If done right, the focus on the breath or the mantra or what ever type of meditation you are doing should keep you from staring too hard into the abyss) and modern mans tendency towards a scientific (mundane material processes) or christian (benevolent universe) world view tend to root most people pretty well, at least enough to be able to shrug any realization off as &quot;just some weird shit that happened to me.&quot; This is strengthened in post moderns even further since they tend to latch their pre existing world view onto there identity which makes which makes it that much harder to shake in the face of any challenge to it, but once it is shook it really fucks them up. It is a theory of mine that this natural aptitude to ward strongly contribute to modern and post modern mans crisis of meaning. Since being too good at warding shuts you off from any transcendent realization, good or bad, and I argue that its better to be able to strengthen or let down your wards at will in order to experience a balance of an enriched life with only a little danger that such a life will lay you low. Though some would disagree with me and say that the only way to experience any true meaning you need to abandon warding all together and have the courage to be damned, like some kind of William Blake type mystic but that doesn&#039;t seem to me like good advice to give everyone.

The philosophising which is most widespread among us does not go beyond the Kantian results, that Reason cannot acquire knowledge of any true content or subject matter and in regard to absolute truth must be directed to faith.</span>", "time": 1676176433, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647757, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:03:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is german idealism similiar to whimsymaxxing?", "time": 1676178235, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647767, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:07:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647757</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whimsymaxxing</span><br>?", "time": 1676178446, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647777, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:11:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21639734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21639734</a><br>i&#039;d get physical with her", "time": 1676178690, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647793, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:18:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Arguments for and against physicalism:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2-<wbr>m_qcH7f8", "filename": "consciousness theories descriptions", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 862, "h": 2428, "tn_w": 44, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676179118169701, "time": 1676179118, "md5": "oHP93IVUCi9km0kHVTLmJg==", "fsize": 598015, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647796, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:19:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21639734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21639734</a><br>Basically all of the objections against epiphenomenalism can be solved with reference to the separation of atman vs buddhi in Indian philosophy and the inhering of doership/agentship in the latter only", "time": 1676179167, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647797, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:19:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647777</a><br>Checked", "time": 1676179179, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21647800, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)00:20:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647793</a><br>Part 2:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4L<wbr>b1SR0Dlw", "time": 1676179240, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21648110, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)02:21:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647767</a><br>Some guy is trying to make that a thing, just ignore it.", "time": 1676186505, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21648398, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)05:13:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21639492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21639492</a><br>Learn alchemy, you&#039;ll realize. <br><br>Also if I&#039;m not misremembering, in one of the prefaces of the Encyclopedia of philosophical sciences he refers to another author who pretty much wrote a system centered around occultism and Kabbalah, and kept going on about how he intended instead to translate that knowledge into an exoteric rational philosophy.", "time": 1676196833, "resto": 21639064}, {"no": 21648621, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:17:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647224</a><br>if you graduated high school, yes, start with Hegel\u2019s \u201cLogic\u201d.", "time": 1676204244, "resto": 21639064}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21647897, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)01:07:32", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/sffg/ - Science Fiction and Fantasy General", "com": "Jedi Shadow Edition<br><br>Previous Thread:<a href=\"/lit/thread/21638744#p21638744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638744</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Recommended reading charts (Look here before asking for vague recs)</span><br>https://mega.nz/folder/kj5hWI6J#0cy<wbr>w0-ZdvZKOJW3fPI6RfQ/folder/guIyhAzS<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Archive</span><br>https://warosu.org/lit/?task=search<wbr>2&amp;search_subject=sffg<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goodreads</span><br>https://www.goodreads.com/group/sho<wbr>w/1029811-sffg", "filename": "Jedi Shadow", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1427, "h": 1005, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 176, "tim": 1676182052076618, "time": 1676182052, "md5": "dgMMaiKiBEJRigDGpUKz1A==", "fsize": 379442, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sffg-science-fiction-and-fantasy-general", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 15, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 21647903, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)01:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I made a new thread too 2 minutes ago. <br>Are we keeping this one?", "time": 1676182261, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21647906, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)01:11:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647897</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Star Wars</span><br>The only Star Wars books I ever read were the Revenge of the Sith and The Darth Plagueis novel.

Ambiguity can be found on each level, as with the joy in James Joyce, so with the catharsis in McCarthy. The two major MacGuffins in here were proclaimed in the pre-publication publicity. The symbolic salvaged plane crash at the start, the missing black box and the missing passenger--these turn out to be symbolic, important but not the driving plot line. But the greater MacGuffin is the over-hyped incest and family pedophilia which disappears before our sight on a close reading on the novels. This misdirection too is the author&#039;s aim, to show us how easily we are fooled by gossip and hearsay. The brother/sister love story that remains is agape love, and McCarthy knew that this shallow, materialist, hedonist culture--up to its chin in high school melodrama and tabloid celebrity gossip--would not recognize agape love when they saw it. The hedonist Sheddan says of Bobby, that &quot;all the time, he&#039;s banging his sister,&quot; which reads one way in the gossip, yet a far different way if we think of humanity banging sister/daughter/Mother Earth with nuclear tests, killing the wildlife and raping the land. Sheddan asks, &quot;What is it that we&#039;re looking for? It&#039;s not grace or salvation and it is droll beyond words to imagine that it&#039;s love.&quot; Ah, but it is Grace, and it is Salvation, and it is Love. What do you salvage? someone asks Bobby. Whatever&#039;s lost, Bobby replies. Salvation of what is lost. McCarthy melds/welds religion and ancient myth together with modernism, and says what he has been saying all along, that one story is all stories, that every man is a Child of God, but also part clay, of this earth, subject to naturalism despite all the proclamations of Marxists, Nazis, and other true believer utopians. On one level, Alice Western is symbolically naturalism, Mother Nature, Mother Earth, sister, daughter, the Eternal Feminine. Bobby Western is Humankind, just a passenger on this earth, but he carries the fire. The relationship between the two novels, on this level, is like that quote in McCarthy&#039;s THE ROAD: &quot;By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.&quot; <br><br>1/2", "time": 1676203851, "resto": 21647858}, {"no": 21648607, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)07:12:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For one level, Bobby and Alice are of one mind, different hemispheres of the individual human brain. For surely, Cormac McCarthy has read Iain McGilchrist&#039;s THE MASTER AND HIS EMISSARY: THE DIVIDED BRAIN AND THE MAKING OF THE WESTERN WORLD, from which sections could be source transposed, book to novel, fact to fiction. Chip Kidd&#039;s case cover design reflects this, with the slot dividing the two books representing the divided human brain. Bobby is the story-teller, the translator of the material word to language, a creation representing Everyman, all stories being one as in Joseph Campbell&#039;s THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES. Bobby tries to find the string in the maze, the linear story in everything, but he is lost without Alice and must be content to hold her in his imagination, as Dante held the face of Beatrice, as the man in McCarthy&#039;s THE ROAD saw the face of his son. Agape love. McCarthy melds/welds much of his personal history/travels with mathematical/scientific history and with literary scientific and philosophical works, and uses that under mythical and religious references, a New Orleans gumbo that is worth diving into again and again. I see one level as Judeo-Christian, the story of Genesis and the Tree of Knowledge, and Bobby Western is like biblical JOB 5:8, such as in &quot;Man is born of trouble as the sparks fall upward,&quot; that suffering is universal, but that misery is a choice. Bobby chooses the glass-half-full over the misery and the traps of addiction. Individual Job-like gratitude and faith in the face of all trouble and all paradox. Life as both a test and a gift, even if we don&#039;t understand the test nor can be certain of the Nature of the Giver. One level is the Prometheus interpretation. When Prometheus gave humans fire to help and comfort them, Zeus laughed, because Zeus knew that humans with their hubris could not handle this knowledge, and that it would lead to their destruction. Thus the sparks in stone from flint was also used to craft the arrowhead, then to greater and greater weaponry of war with which to kill each other, then now to nuclear weapons which threaten to lead to nuclear winter, perhaps to another extinction. In case you didn&#039;t know, McCarthy&#039;s early novels had animals aplenty, but as the novels progressed, more and more animals were killed off, novel by novel, fences and borders closing in, until they were all gone in THE ROAD, where there was nuclear winter.

Some of us may bizarrely owe our existence to Adolph Hitler, as the text says, and my father used to say that, as he was in the force getting ready to invade Japan when the atom bombs were dropped, he owed his existence to the atom bomb (and you should see Paul Fussell&#039;s excellent THANK GOD FOR THE ATOM BOMB). Yet there is order hidden in plain sight here too. Bell&#039;s Theorem, where Alice and Bob are connected through the bariatric welding (just as in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, Chigurh and Bell were connected by Moss, who was a welder). John Jeremiah Sullivan&#039;s review of THE PASSENGER in the NYT was close to the mark when he described this as Janus-faced. On that plane. A Janus-faced phrase, one referring to the different paradigms of existence; the physical plane is uncanny but it is Bob&#039;s nature to try to make a linear narrative out of everything; time is out of joint, per Hamlet, yet Hamlet (and our political hubris) always try to set it right, in idealist utopian folly--for this world/humanity has been flawed since the Fall and cannot be made right again. Bob is just a passenger here on Mother Earth, and he carries the fire, the soul. And to switch metaphors again, Bob is the storyteller, and the story he tells is all human stories, myth and religion co-joined. We are bits of water coming in on that blue wave from the Sea, we crash on the beach, alien there, and become separated into individual drops, and develop egos and start thinking we are exclusive seas, not recognizing our real nature or our common source. We are spiritual beings having a physical experience. The sole individual shrinks away but the soul is always reborn again in that wave. On another level, Alice is Plato, math, numbers, forms, and Bob is Aristotle, physics, science as perceived through the senses. Then on another level, it is Plato&#039;s Eternal Return, where Bob represents humanity and Alice represents Naturalism, Mother Nature, an Earth Mother, the Eternal Feminine (mother, sister, daughter). Human gets wiped out by his own hubris, crucifies himself, but the earth is eternal. Bob comes back from the sea, and yearns for God, Mother Mary, Stella Maris.

My ambition&#039;s not uncoloured by various sorts of shame and fear: previous extremely amateurish works of mine, the fact that I&#039;m not even twenty years old yet, my history of media consumption, not having read enough, not having written enough, standing generally on the fringes of literary circles (and not in a good way): I don&#039;t possess the sort of talent or intellect or linguistic nimbleness (linguistic dexterity, gracefulness, skilfulness) to write a truly great (or, let&#039;s tone that down: an even marginally good) novel. I don&#039;t even know if I spelt &quot;possess&quot; right. I constantly find myself referring to dictionaries, thesauruses, and grammar usage guides while reading and writing. Nevertheless for about a year I&#039;ve voyaged (even my use of the word &quot;voyaged&quot; here embarrasses me) on multiple attempts to write a novel, each of which have lead me into various branches of consciousness that terminate at nothing. It&#039;s like I&#039;m thrashing about in a pool of vaseline. I still have a sort of delusional optimism about these ambitions of mine. I think I&#039;ve got to.<br>But this delusional optimism&#039;s been shattered to bits, and I might have to lie down in bed for a while: I just read Barthelme&#039;s short story &quot;The Balloon,&quot; and I didn&#039;t understand it at all. I get that the story&#039;s about society&#039;s reaction to the balloon; society&#039;s positioning of itself in relation to the balloon as it takes over Manhattan, but I couldn&#039;t quite grasp what the balloon really was, even at the end, where the narrator explains to his lover [?] what the balloon was.

I&#039;m just insecure. <br>The earliest piece I remember writing was in kindergarten or first grade. I was 4 or 5. It was in response to a prompt that I don&#039;t remember. I think I described a white rabbit in blue clothing on skis in the snow. And I ended it with something along the lines of &quot;Just imagine! Wouldn&#039;t that be cute?&quot; I&#039;ve maintained some sort of a journal ever since I was seven. In the fourth grade I took to writing fiction about myself and my cousins and my elder sister going on adventures, saving friends from vegan giants (the only danger they posed was that they&#039;d keep you captive as &quot;pets&quot;), defeating Greek Gods, escaping boarding schools on blimps, etc.<br>I&#039;ve thrown most of those works out. Out of embarrassment. They were written as screenplays, not in prose, and the dialogue was incredibly children&#039;s film-ish. <br>I also wrote stories where most of the protagonists were self-inserts who served as insignificant observers (rarely movers) to the narrative. <br>A lot of these stories were illustrated, I remember. I&#039;d draw and write as I went, rarely going back to edit the plot. It was thrilling. I never showed anybody, not even the friends that I wrote about. I suppose my parents saw this stuff. Embarrassing.<br>Between the ages of 11 and 17 I also wrote and illustrated comics. I trashed most of the later work. <br>Between 14 and 18 I wrote a lot of poetry; from ugly adolescent whining in ninth grade to stupid, fun, sometimes vulgar little quatrains while in 12th grade. I have most of the quatrains saved to my phone. They&#039;d come to me in bursts of inspiration and I&#039;d write them in about less than a minute. Usually in iambic tetrameter. AABA-type stuff, but not always. I began and left incomplete two &quot;ballads,&quot; one meant to be a surreal narrative that was meant for children wanting to expand their vocabulary. I remember submitting two poems just for the hell of it to Poetry when I was in high school. One of these I think is still one of my favourite works. It was written after my grandfather died in 2021. I was rejected 8 months later, of course. <br>After my grandfather&#039;s death in the January of 2021 and I continued writing nonsensical poetry. The last two poems I wrote were written in December 2021 and September 2022 respectively. <br>In May 2021 I began keeping a private online notebook where I kept my entries short. I think this notebook&#039;s been my life for the past two years. In October 2021 I began growing restless. I wanted to write a screenplay of some sort. A long narrative. In December 2021 I finally decided that I wanted to write a novel. Playing with language appealed to me so much more. To me, art&#039;s always been a struggle against the flatness of the page. I began writing multiple short stories and &quot;humorous essays&quot; that really weren&#039;t very humorous, and regrettably deleted most of them.

There&#039;s three parts to making art. For everyone who wants to make art in whatever form it may be, listen carefully.<br><br>The first part is having an idea, a thought, an &#039;experience&#039;. If I asked you to describe what the color red looks like, how would you do it? You can&#039;t refer to other things like &quot;The color of a strawberry&quot; or &quot;A certain wavelength or light&quot;, I want you to describe the pure *experience* of the color red. If you had to explain it to a blind man and all. That first part is basically the intangible &#039;concept&#039; that our brain understands and generates. <br><br>The second part is the rules of the specific art you&#039;re trying to create. For novels and literature, it&#039;s all the relevant rules of grammar and all the other things that dictate what &#039;good language&#039; is. <br><br>The last part is actually *making* the art itself. You have to have that experience in your head, that no one is able to experience but you and that we have conceptualized into words, and use all of the rules to shape that intangible experience into something real that other people can use to get as close to experiencing your own experience as they can through your application of the rules of your chosen art.<br><br>Now you know all of this, I can actually make my point. In order for someone to actually make art, they need to master all three of those elements. When they do and by virtue of completing the third element, they&#039;ll have produced a piece of art. Now given how good you are at the individual elements, the piece of art will be better or worse. Here&#039;s the deal. Many people want to make a good piece of art, be it a painting or a novel, but they lack one of the parts. Many people hold the belief that if they can master and memorize the rules and simply applying the rules, that somehow a masterful work of art will come out of it. That&#039;s false. People go to college, read, analyze and do all sorts of things to master the rules, but don&#039;t actually either apply or have an idea they want to express. Because that&#039;s what art is. Like I have explained, art is the overarching term for having that intangible experience in your head to all the way of having someone else experience that same thing you had in your head.<br><br>Now, I quoted you at the beginning of this post. That&#039;s because you&#039;re one of those people who think that just knowing the rules will make you write a good piece of art. It won&#039;t. You can delve into books and think and analyze all you want, but if there&#039;s not an experience or thing you want to express, you&#039;ll never produce a good piece of art.<br><br>TL;DR: You don&#039;t want to write a good piece of art, you want to understand things. Don&#039;t write novels. Go be an academic who understands things, not an artist who expresses themselves.<br><br>1/?", "time": 1676162296, "resto": 21643546}, {"no": 21647017, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)19:44:06", "name": "NiFe", "com": "<a href=\"#p21646997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21646997</a><br>cont.<br><br>Besides, people who are talented at doing things just *do* the things they&#039;re talented at.

But I think that someone who wants to exhale should know how to inhale, and I was expressing my shame at being unable to grasp that essence. I was ashamed at being unable to experience the experience that Barthelme had designed (I say art is about designing human experience). I have thoughts and ideas that I want to express. Obviously I don&#039;t think a series of grammatically correct sentences is good art. I have thoughts and ideas and sensations that I want other human beings to experience. <br>I&#039;m sorry.

We who have been brought up in the English-speaking world have internalized the idea that law exists to do justice between individual parties, rather than to impose a uniform regime of commands. Other Western systems have also reinforced the attachment of citizens to the political order \u2013 notably Roman law and its many derivatives (the code napol\u00e9on among them). It was evident from the earliest days of Christianity that the New Testament was not an attempt to replace the law of the imperial power, but an attempt to make a space for spiritual growth within it. In his parables, Christ emphasized that the secular law is to be obeyed, and that our duty to God does not require us to defy or to replace it. Nor should we pay too much attention to the finicky edicts of the Torah, since \u2018the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To someone raised on the doctrine that legitimate law comes from God, and that obedience is owed to Him above all others, the claims of the secular jurisdiction are regarded as at best an irrelevance, at worst a usurpation. Such is the message of Sayyid Qutb\u2019s writings, and of Milestones (ma\u2018alim fi\u2019l tariq, 1964) in particular. In that book, Qutb denounces secular law, national identity and the attempt to establish a purely human political order without reference to the revealed will of God: all are blasphemous in Qutb\u2019s eyes. Qutb\u2019s followers have included Osama Bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahiri</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anybody who understands what is at stake in the global conflict that is developing today will, I believe, come to see that the nation is one of the things that we must keep.

Kek, I&#039;m an atheist antinatalist natalist. Let me tell you something. There is NO reason to keep gays around. Their lives are of extremely negative value from the misanthropic arguments against being alive as their lives by virtue of their wanton sexual acts and just the sheer ugliness and social incongruence of them existing is a profound harm to all others existing. They being gay does not inhibit the proliferation of life as women with gay male friends frequently sleep with them, often fathering children. Moreover, they are extremely deluded to their own assessment of quality of life through their sexual excesses and view it as better than it really is. The same argument actually could be extended to Muslims as well but I&#039;ll call a spade a spade, and say it&#039;s more from them being made of inferior genes, so in point of fact yes it is because they are inbred, brown and low IQ. As a broke clock is often right twice a day, the Muslims are correct in this situation and Roger is wrong. To probe this, I would wager it stems from him being a unwitting cuckhold from his wife introducing the fashionable gays she would sleep with on occasion mixed with counter culture mentality of his boomer era. You know the funny thing if I said this aloud in a coffee shop, people would start throwing rocks or chairs at me because they don&#039;t like it even though I&#039;m 100% correct.", "time": 1676128507, "resto": 21640988}, {"no": 21644803, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:08:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21641898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21641898</a><br>Still, it doesn&#039;t change the point of comparisson", "time": 1676131682, "resto": 21640988}, {"no": 21644813, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)11:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "aly0lkax9tga1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 640, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 62, "tim": 1676131851293933, "time": 1676131851, "md5": "MjkH7An8iQ0dgLdu79yYng==", "fsize": 88264, "resto": 21640988}, {"no": 21645318, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)13:22:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I like Scruton but Islam is tempting because of strict anti degeneracy stance and keeping women virgin, the latter part is especially good since nobody wants to pay a full price for a used car.", "time": 1676139737, "resto": 21640988}, {"no": 21645527, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)14:12:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21645318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21645318</a><br>Or you could just follow biblical truths instead of apostates and atheist jews, but you won&#039;t, you can&#039;t even talk about the bible on this kiked board either unless it&#039;s some low effort nigger thread for fedora whiners who are the same fucking niggers who are responsible for everything being fucking shit--they&#039;re all simps for feminist whores and get mad if you don&#039;t simp for fat old hags they post online and call you low T for wanting to marry a hot young cute and funny instead.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted.

Marx is truly a bourgeois thinker when he explains all of history by work, when he formulates man&#039;s whole relation to the world in terms of work, when he evaluates all thought in terms of its relation to work, and when he gives work as the creative source of value. Although he did not believe in values, he implies that work is a virtue when he condemns the classes that do not work. He was one of the most articulate interpreters of the bourgeois myth of work, and because he was a socialist and a defender of the working class, he was one of the most active agents in spreading the myth to this class. Besides, it was through work that this class would one day win power and freedom. For the post-Marxian working class, therefore, work meant both the explanation of its condition and the certainty of seeing it end. Once the motive of doctrine had been added to the motive of necessity, how could the workers fail to be imbued with this ideology? It was the bourgeois who invented the dogma of the eminent dignity of the worker, but it was Karl Marx who led the proletariat to this thenceforth ineradicable conviction. From then on, the myth of work became a myth of the left, and the bourgeois and the worker were united in the same commonplace: work is the be-all and end-all of life. The only difference is that for the bourgeois, work tends more and more to be the work of other people, while for the worker only he himself can bear the noble title of worker. Anyone who does not belong to the proletariat, being a nonworker, is a parasite.</span>", "filename": "59700", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 403, "h": 600, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675983305137530, "time": 1675983305, "md5": "sUuDfo2s7MR9wSMsM9FryA==", "fsize": 57827, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21637870, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:07:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21637279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637279</a><br>no, the implication is that a supposed hierarchy-less (classless) society would need constant correction to dissolve the naturally forming hierarchies, done by some agents with the power to implement those corrections and therefore forming the top of a hierarchy themselves.", "time": 1675984022, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21637878, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)18:09:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21637814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637814</a><br>Beyond fucking based Ellul as always.

Marx also said that the role of industrial capitalism was to cut costs of production so they could compete with industrial capitalists in other countries. You can do that if you lower wages (although that comes with downsides too). The U.S. later on during that century developed a system of higher wages which helped increase labor productivity, since it&#039;s good to have workers who are getting paid well and have enough to eat and are literate and so on.<br><br>A starving, uneducated workforce in a feudal society is not productive in comparison to that.<br><br>But then there&#039;s the problem of land and housing rent and private monopolies. So Marx saw (&quot;historically&quot;) &quot;progressive&quot; potential in industrial capitalism, but Marxism was also a critique of it, since you have financial monopolies which come into conflict with expanding productivity... like today. People read Marx and think he describes their world because they look around and everything seems to be getting shittier and poorer, but there&#039;s so much wealth that&#039;s just not being reinvested in actual production, because it&#039;s simply not profitable to do so. Marx meanwhile called for having the state to take over land and be the landlord instead of a hereditary landlord class. (Georgists favored a land tax.) Socialism would bring into public ownership (i.e. state ownership) the communications, transport, telephone services, education, healthcare and other basic needs instead of private monopolies, with these services provided freely (or basically subsidized). This sounds flatly totalitarian to people though. But China has done a lot of this and are indebted to his ideas and explicitly say they are.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It has since been thoroughly proven that collectivism cannot match the efficiency of the free market though</span><br>What makes Marxist socialism different from other socialisms is that it&#039;s supposed to be *superior* to capitalism (and not just &quot;better&quot; in a moral way like a Christian thing), and a lot of his writings were critiques of other socialists and anarchists and so on. That is, socialism is supposed to be more capable of &quot;scientifically&quot; and rationally allocating labor and resources, more efficient and more productive and so forth. You eliminate a lot of debt overhang and rents being charged by these private monopolists. <br><br>The 20th century communist countries like the USSR was not able to achieve that, though. It was very obvious by the 70s that they were falling behind. I think the Chinese drew the conclusion that it would be better to tolerate some sorta market economy (for now) in the absence of much greater &quot;productive forces&quot; necessary to allow a command economy to run efficiently.", "filename": "39580368904564", "ext": ".png", "w": 843, "h": 453, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 67, "tim": 1675988448229934, "time": 1675988448, "md5": "gRnbAUUOj5HSkjVPIL7UIA==", "fsize": 495701, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21638171, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)19:20:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21638076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638076</a><br>I understand the concept of surplus value, I&#039;m just not sure it makes sense and even if it does it seems to me like much less than is taken with taxes and currency dilution.

Barter economies naturally designate a commodity as money in order to facilitate trade. Not every thing can be easily traded for everything and as such people will tend to trade their goods for the more tradable goods, this creates a reciprocal effect where more people want the more tradable good which in turn increases its value which makes more people want it etc. and this is also how hyperinflation happens in the reverse, in fact hyperinflation can occur in the absence of inflation and inflation can go on without hyperinflation in theory. I think it was actually keynes who made the insightful remark that hyperinflation is the people revolting against the government, it wouldn&#039;t take much for it to get started either that is why they encourage people to save so much lately. As soon as people no longer save money, as soon as people prefer to stock up on goods rather than wait for their price to go up later the process is already in motion and prices will skyrocket and money loses its value.

The temptations to bribery and perjury and all other means of evasion beget a demoralization of opinion and they put a premium upon unscrupulousness and a tax upon conscience. And finally, just in proportion as the tax accomplishes its effect, there is a lessening in the incentive to accumulate wealth, which is one of the strong forces of industrial progress.

Which means, states are no longer important in the incentive of tech, it&#039;s all done by capital and competition.<br>Society is fragmented, social groupss are quarelling over identity politics and other petty issues as Fukuyama&#039;s predictions of a world united under the banner of neoliberalism is collapsing, nations are disputing their local hegemonies again and the world is beginning to separate as it was during the cold war era.<br>So, we have an economic problem (the issues of resource management), a geopolitical problem (nations not willingly to collab towards a common global goal) and finally a cultural problem (all the division and social angst that modernity is accelerating)<br>It&#039;s all about a bunch of corporations struggling to see who will have more power over the human spirit, and the regular plebeians such as me and you are just assets for this struggle.<br><br>With this said, I just conclude saying that we do not belong to the stars. We belong here. I remember when William Shatner got a lift to the stars with Bezos and he, who played the most famous star-explorer of TV fiction said he went desperate as he looked at the emptiness of space, not even stars were seen through the hatch window, just the infinite blackness. He said that he only felt comfort when he looked back on Earth, and saw the comfort of our planet, that seemed so lonely and so majestic.

What he means by \u201cEros\u201d is never clear to begin with: sexual activity (in the Freudian genital sense), or an aesthetic-sexual mixture of art, sex play, and creative effort, or the whole domain of instinct (which returns us to the age-old problem of reason versus instinct), or else \u201ceverything oppressed by civilization.\u201d How does one conclude that revolution will occur through Eros and also will liberate it? Of course, the vibrant call for sexual liberty and uninhibited emotions would appeal to young people. But is it not plain that this licensed pan-sexuality, made out to be the highway to revolution, is among the most effective propaganda weapons (the kind that hits below the belt, as Hitler himself put it) and also the most demagogic form of deceit? To redeem spontaneity by that means is senseless regression in terms of revolution\u2014\u201cPost coitum animal triste\u201d: that is all we can expect of it, unless an iron fist clamps down on the rampant irrationality, the results of which we have already seen. We ought not to forget the vast irrational movement of our time which produced public festivals and mindless emotionalism on an incredible scale: National Socialism. The practice of \u201cclassifying,\u201d and thus dismissing, Nazism should stop, for it represents a real Freudian repression on the part of intellectuals who refuse to recognize what it was. Others lump together Nazism, dictatorship, massacres, concentration camps, racism, and Hitler\u2019s folly. That about covers the subject. Nazism was a great revolution: against the bureaucracy, against senility, in behalf of youth; against the entrenched hierarchies, against capitalism, against the petit-bourgeois mentality, against comfort and security, against the consumer society, against traditional morality; for the liberation of instinct, desire, passions, hatred of cops (yes, indeed!), the will to power, and the creation of a higher order of freedom. When I read the following: \u201cThe mob disclaims all responsibility, either for those who join it, or for what will happen tomorrow. Their actions and words are free of traditional restraints. They believe what they are doing and saying is simply the truth at the moment. ... I do not represent anyone; I think what I say voices the feelings of the students as a whole. ...

Any orientation of that nature will have the same results. That is why current invocations to irrationalism and to the mystique of revolution fill me with dread.

Christ however acts as a ladder which infuses the sensuous world through his life and his teaching with divine lights/sparks which can be used as the base of the contemplation, this is especially necessary since sense perceptions are bound by time and potentiality and thus are admixed with non being, therefore lacking perfection.

For modern and contemporary poets, there is no uncontestable heavenly muse and no \u201ctribe\u201d that can be taken for granted like the bygone Epics. In The Tale of the Tribe: Ezra Pound and the Modern Verse Epic, Michael Andr\u00e9 Bernstein articulated this problem in his study of Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson: \u201cthe essential paradox of a modern verse epic,\u201d he says, is that \u201ca text that can be only the response of a particular individual writing from his own, partial and limited perspective [\u2026] must nonetheless give voice to historical forces transcending any single consciousness or moment\u201d (Bernstein 272). In Bending the Bow (where most of the Passages are contained), Robert Duncan writes<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the soul is the life-shape of the body, great stars, that are born and have their histories we read in the skies and will die, are souls. And this poetry, the ever forming of bodies in language in which breath moves, is a field of ensouling. Each line, intensely, a soul thing, a contribution; a locality of the living.</span><br>The passage illustrates Duncan&#039;s views on poetry and ethics. Duncan saw poetry and the body as interconnected, with the poem and the body both being sites of ethical responsibility during times of war. This responsibility goes beyond simple condemnation and instead involves a connection with the entire universe, which would bring all people together regardless of their political beliefs. This idea of interconnectedness is similar to the views of other poets, such as Charles Olson&#039;s proprioception and Louis Zukofsky&#039;s desire for totality. <br>Duncan disagrees with the idea that the universe is limited and fixed. Instead, he says in \u201cThe Multiversity, Passages 21,\u201d that it&#039;s made up of different parts that fit together but don&#039;t lock, meaning that what was previously closed can now be opened: \u201cThe part in its fitting does not lock but unlocks; what was closed is opened\u201d (iv). He believes that by going beyond what&#039;s expected, poetry can help heal people and bring love to those who are hurt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I have only the language of our commonness, alive with them as well as me, the speech of the audience in its refusal in which I would come into that confidence. The poem in which my heart beats speaks like to unlike, kind to unkind. The line of the poem itself confronts me where I must volunteer my love, and I saw, long before this war, wrath move in the music that troubles me. (iii) </span><br>In Duncan&#039;s poetry, the heart isn&#039;t just a figure of speech.

To that end the thing must be made unconscious: that is the aim of every holy lie.\u2014The order of castes, the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an order of nature, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary fiat, no &quot;modern idea,&quot; can exert any influence. In every healthy society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and feeling of perfection. It is not Manu but nature that sets off in one class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only mediocrity\u2014the last-named represents the great majority, and the first two the select. The superior caste\u2014I call it the fewest\u2014has, as the most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can goodness escape being weakness. Pulchrum est paucorum hominum: goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees ugliness\u2014or indignation against the general aspect of things. Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. &quot;The world is perfect&quot;\u2014so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the instinct of the man who says yes to life. &quot;Imperfection, whatever is inferior to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala themselves are parts of this perfection.&quot; The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others.... cont.</span>", "time": 1676121077, "resto": 21643328}, {"no": 21644288, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21644285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644285</a><br><a href=\"#p21644255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644255</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Knowledge\u2014a form of asceticism.\u2014They are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them being the most cheerful and most amiable.

The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals, the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is rough in the business of ruling\u2014their followers, their right hand, their most apt disciples.\u2014In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing &quot;made up&quot;; whatever is to the contrary is made up\u2014by it nature is brought to shame.... The order of castes, the order of rank, simply formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution of higher types, and the highest types\u2014the inequality of rights is essential to the existence of any rights at all.\u2014A right is a privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre. Life is always harder as one mounts the heights\u2014the cold increases, responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture, science, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of occupational activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not society, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines.

He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon during the war&#039;s final battle at the planet of Malachor V, which surrounded the planet with a destructive spatial phenomenon known as a mass shadow. Experiencing the shadow that obliterated almost everything on and around the planet made Nihilus crave Force energy. The affliction painfully ravaged his body while rendering him a wound in the Force. He was found by a seeker of these, the former Jedi Kreia, who became the Sith Lord Darth Traya and told him that she could teach him to feed his endless hunger.

Rather, both may be found in works from either culture.<br>Buddhism has had an influence on Japanese culture, but its parallels to Christianity are not to be denied. Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology are ultimately diametrically opposed to any system which declares real essences to be fixed and known for certain by humans through simple observation, but similar statements can be said about Pyrrhonism and the other skeptic philosophical schools that have arisen in the West.", "time": 1676084000, "resto": 21640206}, {"no": 21642979, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)22:13:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642847</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I became really depressed at the place their country and culture is in, and how it differed from expectations</span><br>how so?", "time": 1676085214, "resto": 21640206}, {"no": 21643039, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)22:30:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21642913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21642913</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Western ethics and codes of law stem back to the traditions and prohibitions of ancient polytheistic cultures of Europe</span><br><br>This.

A moral wrong brings guilt to the perpetrator as an individual for violating the sublime, to disappoint Heaven.<br><br>In essence, it is not that Japanese lacked symbolism or moral rigidity, it is that their culture emboldens interconnected worldliness and an ironically Atheistic and Spinozan Nature=God collective existence.

However, this preference makes it more difficult for older or less-educated workers to re-enter the job market and find stable employment, and thus prolongs any initial loss of employment opportunities.[17] One potential key reason why the Lost Generation in particular prompted a wider recognition of this &quot;youth employment problem&quot; was the generation&#039;s relatively large population size, as Japanese society was unable to withstand its considerable quantitative impact.[17]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan&#039;s birthrate is among the lowest in world. In 2020, the expected number of births per woman in Japan declined to 1.34. A major cause of the declining number of births is the fact that women are delaying marriage. According to the Health Ministry, the number of registered marriages fell 12.3% in 2020, to 525,490.[24] Since Japanese women traditionally expect men to be providers, men who do not make enough to support a family either cannot find partners or feel so underconfident that they do not bother. The result is the Japanese phenomenon called s\u014dshoku-kei danshi (&quot;grass-eaters&quot; or &quot;herbivore men&quot;), referring to 75% of Japanese males in their 20s to 40s who do not date or marry.[25]</span><br><br>A huge economic crisis creating a new caste of deplorables who are counted as unemployable in Japanese society, because they have never been employed, because when their employment circle was supposed to start there was the asset bubble burst in Japan.

The letter to Mathilde Wesendonck of 3 April 1858 attempts to clarify a heated argument the previous evening about the &#039;vers\u00e4umte Gelegenheit&#039; (&#039;missed opportunity&#039;) of Faust. Instead of remaining &#039;bei der ersten, so sch\u00f6nen Gelegenheit, der Liebe Gretchens&#039; (&#039;at the first, so beautiful opportunity, the love of Gretchen&#039;), Goethe extricated Faust from this love,<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;damit er nun die eigentliche gro\u00dfe Welt, die antike Kunstwelt, die praktisch-industrielle Welt, mit m\u00f6glichst Behagen vor seiner recht objektiven Betrachtung abspielen lassen k\u00f6nne.

(so that he can now let the actual great world, the antique art world, the practical industrial world, be played out with as much comfort as possible before his really objective observation. So for me this Faust is actually just the missed opportunity; and that opportunity was none other than the only one of salvation and redemption. Even the gray sinner finally feels this, and tries to make up for what he has missed with a final tableau - lying so outside, after death, where he is no longer embarrassed.)</span><br><br>Inherent in this criticism is a fundamental antithesis between the objective &#039;gro\u00dfe Welt&#039; (&#039;great world&#039;) and the subjective &#039;Seelentiefe der Liebe&#039; (&#039;soul depth of love&#039;): by objectifying Faust&#039;s striving, Goethe neglected - according to Wagner - the true realm of salvation, the subjective consciousness, since in Faust&#039;s episodic progress through the world, &#039;das Subject nie dazu kommt, das Object, die Welt in sich aufzunehmen&#039; (&#039;the subject never gets to absorb the object, the world&#039;).", "filename": "1652204116154", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 486, "h": 640, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676170661940136, "time": 1676170661, "md5": "tWyM8fyJ11Bl9d/LHvWgFA==", "fsize": 127739, "resto": 21647297}, {"no": 21647480, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)21:58:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647475</a><br>However, Wagner&#039;s opinion of Faust improved in later years:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The poet implies to us that an outrageous crime is perpetrated on Mignon; yet he transports his hero beyond the same sensation in order to lead him into a sphere liberated from all violence and tragic eccentricity towards a state of cultivated serenity. He has him look at pictures in a gallery. Music is made at Mignon\u2019s death, and Robert Schumann later composed music on this theme. It appears that Schiller was outraged by the last book of \u2018Wilhelm Meister\u2019; yet he did not know how to help his great friend out of his strange aberration; particularly since he had to assume that Goethe, who had invented Mignon and brought to life with this creation a wonderful new world, must have in his innermost self fallen into a distraction, from which his friend could not wake him. Only Goethe himself could awake from that distraction, and he awoke: for in extreme old age he completed his Faust. Whatever distracted him, he here combines into an archetype of all beauty: he conjures up Helen herself from the realm of shadows, the perfect ideal of antiquity, and marries her to his Faust. But these shadows are not to be completely banished; they evaporate into a transcendent cloud, and Faust\u2019s gaze follows it with sensuous yet painless sorrow. Only Gretchen could redeem him; the untimely sacrificial victim, she who eternally lived on unnoticed in his innermost soul stretches out her hand to him from the world of the blessed.</span><br>- Wagner&#039;s Beethoven 1870", "time": 1676170739, "resto": 21647297}, {"no": 21647483, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)22:00:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647480</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before us Germans lies an equally uncomprehended artwork [as Antique Tragedy and Shakespeare], a riddle still unsolved, in Goethe&#039;s Faust. It is manifest, as I have already insisted, that we possess in this work the most consequent outcome of the original German Play: if we compare it with the greatest creations of any nation, those of Shakespeare not excepted, it reveals an idiosyncrasy exclusively its own, ranking it for the present as theatrically-speaking impracticable, for simple reason that the German Stage itself has shamefully made away the originality of its own development. Only when this shall have been recovered, when we possess a Theatre, a stage and actors who can set this Germanest of all dramas completely properly before us, will our aesthetic Criticism also be able to rightly judge this work: whereas to-day the coryphaei of that Criticism presume to crack bad jokes and parodies upon its second part. We then shall perceive that no stage-piece in the world has such a scenic force and directness (Anschaulichkeit) to shew, as precisely this maligned (no matter what the pose adopted!) and un-understood second half of the tragedy. And this work, which roots in the plastic spirit of the German Theatre as ne&#039;er another, had to be written by the poet in the air: the only signs by which he could fix its type, or the &quot;example&quot; as I have called it, were rhyming metres taken chiefly from the rugged art of our old folk-poet, Hans Sachs. Yet if we want a witness to the supreme ideality whose germ lay lurking in the homeliest element of the German Folk, awaiting its development by a faithful chosen spirit, we have only to regard this wonder-building raised by Goethe on that so-called knittel-verse [doggerel]: he seems to never quit this basis of the most completely Popular, and yet he soars above it to the highest art of antique Metrics, filling link upon link with fresh inventions of a freedom unknown to the Greeks themselves, from smiles to grief, the wildest bluntness to the tenderest sublimity.

This also happened with several key Taoist texts, so some of the &quot;common&quot; translations are really fucking bad. The second is that these texts were only first translated into various vernacular languages during a period of Christian moral panic, so you end up with some translations intentionally censoring the texts to avoid topics that are found to be unbecoming (such as making Loki tie the goat&#039;s beard to his pants instead of his balls, or ignoring Freyja farting with shock). <br><br>But yes, you are right, it&#039;s not that big of a deal as long as you get a translation that doesn&#039;t censor and is made by an expert. The best translations have the original text beside the translation anyways, so you guide yourself through it (these texts, like all IE poetry, are absolutely jammed with wordplay and soundplay, which you miss if you just read a translation).<br><br><a href=\"#p21643771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643771</a><br>The two Eddas are the principle sources if you&#039;re interested in &quot;Norse Mythology&quot;, yes. Other smaller sagas or works may reference this or that, but there&#039;s not much of &quot;Norse Mythology&quot; that you&#039;ll miss if you only read those two. Having said that, the entire body of Germanic literature is obviously involved if you&#039;re interested in the Germanic end of Indo-Europeanism, but if you&#039;re into that I&#039;d recommend skipping the Eddas and just going right to stuff like How to Kill a Dragon, because Indo-Europeanism is dominated by high-IQ genius polyglots who have read and synthesized everything already (Georges Dumezil read every single thing in Latin and Greek on Roman religion in order to write Archaic Roman Religion, for example).", "time": 1676125694, "resto": 21642664}, {"no": 21644637, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)09:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643968</a><br>Also, some translators abridge.

Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is &quot;wrong&quot;; they can&#039;t be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains \u2014 in the brains of even the stupidest person \u2014 is as &quot;correct&quot; as what&#039;s in my mind or Nietzsche&#039;s or Baudrillard&#039;s. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the &quot;truth&quot; that&#039;s hiding inside even the dumbest person&#039;s brains. For example, when a Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, he is not wrong. It&#039;s just that the concepts he designates with the words &quot;God&quot;, &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word &quot;God&quot;, going by the Christian&#039;s definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says &quot;God&quot;, he doesn&#039;t really mean an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being&quot; (since he&#039;s so dumb he can&#039;t even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means &quot;a very powerful being&quot;. Similarly, when he says &quot;universe&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;universe&quot; (i.e. &quot;everything&quot;), he simply means &quot;the earth&quot; \u2014 or at most, if he&#039;s had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps &quot;the solar system&quot;. And finally, when he says &quot;love&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;love&quot; (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. &quot;help me&quot; (= shape me).<br>So basically, when the Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, what he&#039;s really saying, translated in our language, is &quot;A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me&quot; \u2014 which could very well be true!<br>All of this stems from Nietzsche&#039;s positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener. Ultimately, each person gives his own meaning to every word, which is only natural since this meaning is to be found inside each person&#039;s brain, and all brains are different.<br>57.

There are three tiers of thinkers. On the third tier you have people like Jordan Peterson.

This is merely common sense transcribed in a kind of formula that makes autistic people feel they&#039;ve understood something, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if Aristotle was on the spectrum somewhere. All &quot;analytic philosophers&quot; are in the same boat/spectrum, and all their writings are equally commonsensical and worthless. But if the universe functioned commonsensically, why would we need geniuses lol? So these people are superior to the base crowd-pleasers like Peterson because they at least make a concentrated attempt at grappling with the big issues, and the results are at least readable, if not exactly useful. Their main use, however, is to function as foils for the geniuses; to serve up the balls that the geniuses will hit out of the park, so to speak.<br>And finally, on the first tier, we have the bona fide geniuses. Consider Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;Truth is will to power&quot;. Doesn&#039;t it make Peterson&#039;s 20-hour verbal diarrhea on the subject seem ludicrous?

(And note that this is the tombstone of &quot;Eastern philosophies&quot; and of any kind of thinking whatsoever which STOPS at inner, spiritual effects, instead of STARTING OUT from them, and expanding from there, as our kind of thinking and our philosophy aims at and champions.)<br><br>431.

The idea here is that, because I call things as I see them, and recognize the fact that women are, on the whole, less intelligent than men, THAT I HATE THEM. This is the kind of inference that only subhumans would make: i.e. one that DOESN&#039;T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE. For there are billions of lifeforms in the universe which, on the whole, are less intelligent than men in general, and me in particular, but from this fact it in no way follows that I hate them. Take my dog, for example. Does the fact that I realize he is far less intelligent than me mean that I hate him? Am I a &quot;miscaninist&quot;, a &quot;misdogist&quot;, because I say that dogs are stupider than men? Am I not allowed then to love anything that is stupider than me? Is it necessary that I place everything I love on an equal basis with myself \u2014 even if all signs point to the fact that they aren&#039;t? And the same goes for &quot;homophobia&quot; (as if anyone would ever be afraid of a fag lol), &quot;race hatred&quot;, and the like.<br>But of course the subhumans&#039; inference DOES make sense, if you understand their language, and do not misinterpret what they are saying as I did above. For the only reason to hate someone is if you feel yourself inferior to them. When the subhumans charge me with hatred of women, or of fags, or of dogs or of trees or rocks or whatever, therefore, all they are saying is that I am inferior to them. I tell them that I am superior, and they reply &quot;But no, you are not superior, you are inferior&quot;, which though false, certainly makes perfect sense.

Once you have understood that power is more important than happiness (which latter is merely a tool of the former, and not the other way around, as it appears from the inverted perspective of sick, declining lifeforms), the next thing you need to understand is that phrases such as &quot;to seek power&quot;, &quot;to want power&quot;, &quot;to take power&quot; and the like are merely subhuman misunderstandings of how power actually works.<br>If you seek power, it simply means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore will never get it either, because power is something you give, not take).<br>If you want power, this once more means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore once more will never get it, for the exact same reason I explained in the previous parenthesis).<br>If you take power, it simply means that someone is giving it to you, and is therefore the more powerful of the two, and will remain so for as long as you are drawing your power from him instead of bestowing it on him.<br>So how does power actually work? Take an extremely simple example from the physical sphere, where the mechanics are easier to understand. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, and try to figure out how he became so physically strong. The subhuman theory of power as something to be taken would suggest that Arnold took his power from somewhere, but from where exactly? From the barbells, perhaps? In this view, barbells would be magical instruments with the capacity for bestowing power on all those who... try to lift them, I guess. But if you or I tried to lift the kinds of barbells Arnold typically lifts, we&#039;d get literally crushed. Not only would we not &quot;gain&quot; any power: we&#039;d have to be hospitalized. We could of course start from smaller weights and work our way up, the same way Arnold did: but I have bad news for you here, sonny: we&#039;d probably fail at getting to his level, or even anywhere near it, no matter how hard we tried. Far more genetically gifted individuals than us in this sphere have already tried this, after all, and failed: that&#039;s why Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times while scores of his closest competitors didn&#039;t. This means that the subhuman theory of magical power-bestowing barbells is false: if the barbells do indeed play a role in the strengthening of an individual, then at the very least this individual must be of a specific type that is CAPABLE of benefiting from their effect: he has, in other words, to be WORTHY of them, which is merely another way of saying that he has to be ALREADY STRONG.<br>QED: Power is not something you can take but something that you must give, and the only reason subhumans are adamant that it is the other way around is because they are so inherently and irremediably weak, that they don&#039;t have the slightest conception of it. <br><br>460.

Though it could be argued that the Overman is the only one who is able to manifest what he wishes, because he is the only one who truly thinks himself capable and deserving of it. If the average person tried to manifest their dreams, they might fail because subconsciously they know they aren\u2019t worth it, and since they don\u2019t want to manifest that guilt along with their dreams, they can\u2019t manifest the dream at all. Also, the belief in causality and determinism can be another hindrance, which the Overman is not susceptible to. He doesn\u2019t need to know precisely HOW he gets what he wants, the universe bends its rules for him, because he creates the universe. So these things might explain why some people are able to manifest thousands or millions of dollars while others can only manifest a free coffee. But you could also argue that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d doesn\u2019t occur at all, but that the people who are confident and believe that they can manifest are the ones who are already powerful enough to attain their goals naturally, and so they attribute their success to manifestation when it was just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Again, the subhuman doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth anything, and believes in strict laws of causality and science etc. so if he fails at manifesting then he will just blame his lack of belief \u2014 a clever way of preventing blasphemers of manifestation.

In this case the question is whether our everyday intuitions about what is possible or impossible are sensible. For example, for thousands of years people were trying their hand at the geometric problem of &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, i.e., constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straight edge. Eventually, it was proven that this was mathematically impossible. Because it&#039;s impossible, it would be pretty stupid to keep trying to do it.<br><br>On the other hand, some things seem &quot;possible&quot; but don&#039;t happen. Sticking with the example of mathematical theorems, a person might try to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem, but fail. But it is nevertheless possible to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem--people do it all the time. So a person will necessarily fail to square the circle, but only contingently fail at proving Fubini&#039;s theorem.<br><br>For a long time there was skepticism about these concepts of &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;possibility&quot;, expressed especially by Quine. There were specific technical problems with trying to show how they could be incorporated into logic (in particular, modal logics were not &quot;extensional&quot;). On this basis people began to seriously doubt that there was anything meaningful about statements of possibility and impossibility, despite how intuitive they were.<br><br>Kripke revolutionized the field by introducing so called &quot;possible world semantics&quot; which overcame the technical problems identified by Quine and others. Now there was a way to make formal distinctions between impossibilities (like squaring the circle) and contingent falsehoods.<br><br>Maybe you think this is all too academic, and who cares whether some particular math problem is &quot;impossible&quot; or simply difficult.

After all, Voltaire knows that other people are content with this world, and they have happy lives, whereas he doesn\u2019t. Nietzsche said \u201cthe best of all possible worlds\u201d really makes no sense, as no world can be objectively \u201cbest.\u201d It just depends on the person making the judgment, which has everything to do with their own experience and preferences. To want the world to be different, to want to live in an alternate reality, to want God to have made the entire past different, and to change even you, shows a lack of power, an inability to shape your environment for your own benefit.

Everyone who uses this website already knows you are.<br><a href=\"#p21634026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21634026</a><br>You are not going to rid oneself of resentment from reading philosophy. In fact I would say having to rid oneself of resentment is just as bad as having it in the first place. The feelings which created such resentiment still exist, you have only adopted the values which you were critical of, i.e a hypocrite.<br><br>Now what is resentment? Often it is confused as simply rationalizing one&#039;s feelings of inferiority by condemning an external object for the subject&#039;s impotence. But one component is missing in this simple categorization of resentiment. That is &#039;envy&#039;. Why is envy essential for resentiment? It is because in order to feel quantitively inferior, one most also value the same measure of the external object which is being blamed for the inferiority. For example, the individual resentful of wealth values poverty over money, he still values money however he values the inverse of wealth &#039;poverty is good&#039; , &#039;wealth is bad.<br><br>Now you are saying that you have grown out of anti-Semitism by ridding yourself of resentiment. That is, not only have you never opposed Jewish values, but that you were envious of them and adopted them yourself! This only means that you were a Jew yourself, and your resentiment was simply self hatred at your ineptitude at being a Jew. <br><br>It is spiritual Jews like yourself, and that Jew Walter Kaufman who accused the NSDAP of resentiment towards both monopoly capitalism, and of course the Jewish race. That is, in your Jewishness you extoll money to be an objective value, and that one can be a master and value it, or a slave who resents it.<br><br>But this is of course far from the truth, now when I speak of the values of the NSDAP I speak of it not in individuals, not even in it&#039;s programs, but in it&#039;s form. I can best summarize it in this quote from Hitler:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]we do not say to the rich people &quot;Please, give something to the poor.&quot; Instead we say &quot;German people, help yourself!&quot; Everyone must help, whether you are rich or poor. Everyone must have the belief that there&#039;s always someone in a much worse situation than I am, and this person I want to help as a comrade. If one should say, &quot;Yes, but do I have to sacrifice a lot?&quot; That is the glory of giving! When you sacrifice for your community, then you can walk with your head held up high.</span><br><br>Of course the Jew, in his self interest cannot see this. For the Jew, the spiritual Jew is only interested in himself. The concept of SACRIFICE is alien to them. For they are only interested in advancing themselves, in a community they are of course alien to, and do not belong.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now I don\u2019t really stress about these things</span><br>You have comfort!

The ultimate orgy of the will in full so you don&#039;t think I&#039;m full of shit:<br>Why is the Big Bang an explosion and thus a destruction of everything including therefore whatever/whoever caused it? It can&#039;t be compulsion because the Big Bang is the greatest power in the universe, hence there&#039;s nothing to compel it, ergo it must be will, and precisely this is the ultimate orgy of the will. &quot;Every great thing is the cause of its own destruction, via an act of self-cancellation...&quot; The Big Bang is the very mechanism of the Eternal Recurrence, and note that Nietzsche wrote this HALF A CENTURY before Big Bang theory was conceived. He wasn&#039;t trying to EXPLAIN some astrophysical phenomenon with this theory\u2014since nothing at the time had been observed that was demanding such an explanation\u2014so he didn&#039;t TAKE this theory from anywhere, he simply CREATED it out of thin air (out of cultural observations that could have been interpreted in countless other ways than how he interpreted them), and lo and behold, the astrophysicists &quot;discovered&quot; it half a century later, entirely independently, since they hadn&#039;t read a word of Nietzsche... So what&#039;s going on here? Whose will precisely is the ultimate orgy of the will if not the will of those who dreamt and thus &quot;discovered&quot; it?

Force versus power and the purpose of philosophy<br><br>What&#039;s the difference between force and power? Laymen and even philosophers use these terms interchangeably, and I&#039;ve probably been guilty of this in places where it doesn&#039;t matter (usually for literally purposes, to avoid repetition and make the text sound better), but ultimately it matters philosophically, not only in physics, and a lot, so we should clarify it. Have you seen those X-Men movies where Professor X stops time? He can still move around and do whatever he wants, but everyone and everything else is paused. Now imagine a fight between a midget and a massive bodybuilder. Of course the bodybuilder can generate tremendous amounts of force, but what if the midget could pause time like Professor X? He could take his time finding a stool, setting it in front of the bodybuilder, then climbing up there and pushing a needle in the bodybuilder&#039;s eye, then unpause time and win the fight. He doesn&#039;t even need to pause time; as long as he can move extremely faster than the bodybuilder, he can win despite the force disparity. That&#039;s a demonstration of a tiny amount of force\u2014whatever little it takes to push the needle in the bodybuilder&#039;s eye\u2014overcoming a massive amount of force: the bodybuilder&#039;s. Power equals work divided by time, and since work is force times distance, power is essentially force over time, so you can generate huge amounts of power even from a little force, if you can do it QUICKLY, i.e. faster than your opponent/environment (and your environment is ALWAYS your opponent at the end of the day, which is why environmentalism is a decadent movement). In fitness circles this effect is called &quot;explosiveness&quot;, and is the difference between the &quot;strengthlifting&quot; lifts like the bench press and deadlift, and the &quot;explosive&quot; lifts, like the Olympic lifts like the snatch and the clean and jerk. So a champion strengthlifter may be strong as an ox because he can generate massive forces, but a champion Olympic weightlifter is far more powerful because he can generate far more power, and these two related but distinct qualities are prized differently by different sports and types of physical activities: the faster-paced the sport or physical activity, the more that power and explosiveness matters. So a strong but slow friend of yours would be ideal to help you move house, but not to run a sprint or play a basketball game, and so on.", "filename": "Screenshot from 2023-02-11 23-09-53", "ext": ".png", "w": 1846, "h": 1173, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 79, "tim": 1676175193523183, "time": 1676175193, "md5": "gjRcvgtIjpW+EalybHzxpg==", "fsize": 443699, "resto": 21627772}, {"no": 21647637, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)23:14:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21647634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21647634</a><br><br><br>How does all that relate to philosophy? Well, for starters, it gives you an idea of why the Big Bang is so important: it&#039;s the most powerful unleashing of energy we are aware of as all energy we know of derives from there, and you can see that in the absurdly small time intervals in which it took place, unthinkably small intervals of the order of ten to the minus thirty or forty seconds. How much force caused the Big Bang? An absolutely tiny amount, &quot;a random quantum fluctuation in the void&quot; as quantum physicists hilariously put it; and yet that tiny amount was so explosive\u2014i.e. happened in such a short time\u2014that it created the four types of force we are now aware of: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. And if in the future we discover more types of force, those too will be found to have arisen from the Big Bang, because where else could they arise from lol?<br><br>So you can see everywhere in our culture, including in our best art, power being praised over and above force. Sheer force is sheer stupidity, and that&#039;s how David beat Goliath, or the Rebel Alliance blew up the Death Star: because, though they had a tiny amount of force at their disposal, they knew precisely how to apply it.<br><br>The moral of all this? Force is well and good, but you have to know HOW to use it: i.e. WHEN and WHERE to apply it, which is of course an analytical problem, i.e. an intellectual one.

Which is<br>your take on the remedy to the dissolution of today\u2019s civilisation?<br><br>Evola:<br>My answer is a negative one: nothing can be done. According to this doctrine of the philosophy of<br>history, or metaphysics of history which is the base of involutionary presuppositions I was referring to<br>in the previous question, we are at the end of a prosses of dissolution which did not actually start just<br>yesterday and does not consist in its more or less contingent aspects such as those linked to the<br>consumerist societies or the arise of technocracies et cetera, but that is rather acknowledged during<br>previous eras, with the progressive loss of all sense of reality regarding the supernatural and the rupture<br>of that link that connected men to that which transcends man himself. So, given this process that<br>occurred already centuries ago, we are now living in its last phases and it is absurd to search for a<br>detention of the process, it is as absurd as intending to stop an avalanche. The end of the cycle takes<br>place when the avalanche ends up in the valley and thus the only path available is the one exposed in<br>the doctrines of Ride the Tiger that one can easily understand. There is not much more to say than<br>stating here that what is important is this person (absolute individual) to be the aim in order to continue<br>even in a \u201csubterranean\u201d mode of existence. I often quote the great verses of the poet Hofmannsthal<br>who says: \u201cThe solution is that those who have been awaken during the long night to re-encounter those<br>that shall arrive with the new dawn\u201d<br><br>Basically the Kali Yuga will run its course no matter what we do. I suppose the &quot;end game&quot; is the beginning of a new cycle of ages, but this will come about completely independently of our actions or interventions.<br><br>With this in mind, it is left to the individual to remain on his feet among the ruins of the modern world. The spiritual quest becomes an almost entirely individual affair. No institutions remain to guide man, no collective effort can bring about change. The masses are simply moved mindlessly by the tide of modernity and so any appeal to the masses (the communist appeal to the proletariat or nationalist appeal to the nation) becomes meaningless.<br><br>Thus in works such as Ride the Tiger, Evola speaks of &quot;differenced men&quot;, or &quot;aristocrats of the soul&quot;, by which he means those few men left in the modern world who still feel drawn to the spiritual. Who, despite living in the depths of the modern world, may still achieve liberation.

If you\u2019re a writer, you will write a lot of unoriginal work before you write something original. And the time and effort expended on that unoriginal work isn\u2019t wasted; on the contrary, I would suggest that it is precisely what enables you to eventually create something original. The hours spent choosing the right word and rearranging sentences to better follow one another are what teach you how meaning is conveyed by prose. Having students write essays isn\u2019t merely a way to test their grasp of the material; it gives them experience in articulating their thoughts. If students never have to write essays that we have all read before, they will never gain the skills needed to write something that we have never read.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And it\u2019s not the case that, once you have ceased to be a student, you can safely use the template that a large language model provides. The struggle to express your thoughts doesn\u2019t disappear once you graduate\u2014it can take place every time you start drafting a new piece. Sometimes it\u2019s only in the process of writing that you discover your original ideas. Some might say that the output of large language models doesn\u2019t look all that different from a human writer\u2019s first draft, but, again, I think this is a superficial resemblance. Your first draft isn\u2019t an unoriginal idea expressed clearly; it\u2019s an original idea expressed poorly, and it is accompanied by your amorphous dissatisfaction, your awareness of the distance between what it says and what you want it to say. That\u2019s what directs you during rewriting, and that\u2019s one of the things lacking when you start with text generated by an A.I.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s nothing magical or mystical about writing, but it involves more than placing an existing document on an unreliable photocopier and pressing the Print button. It\u2019s possible that, in the future, we will build an A.I. that is capable of writing good prose based on nothing but its own experience of the world. The day we achieve that will be momentous indeed\u2014but that day lies far beyond our prediction horizon. In the meantime, it\u2019s reasonable to ask, What use is there in having something that rephrases the Web? If we were losing our access to the Internet forever and had to store a copy on a private server with limited space, a large language model like ChatGPT might be a good solution, assuming that it could be kept from fabricating. But we aren\u2019t losing our access to the Internet.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible.

One, that the Asymmetry argument for antinatalism fails. And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what about those who genuinely do regret having being born? One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller. It is fortunately the case that we are not in a world where suffering is a metaphysical necessity.</span>", "filename": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Ric\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez de la Puente", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675760209237578, "time": 1675760209, "md5": "3B+bAGQUBJJDhjV+canOfQ==", "fsize": 25268, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626956, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:01:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br>Cognitive dissonance", "time": 1675760481, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626962, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626867</a><br>OMG SO TRUE DUDE LIFE IS SOOO SOOO HARD OMG SO SAD, ANYWAYS LETS GO BACK TO PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND FORGETTING ABOUT FUTURE GENERATIONS HAHA.

Xenophon\u2019s Hellenica 3.4.19 records Spartan soldiers, on seeing that their enemies are \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, deciding that fighting against them would be \u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03be\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (like having to fight women). Euripides\u2019 Bacchae 457 has Pentheus describe Dionysus as \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, and also \u03bf\u03c5\u03ba \u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 [\u2026] \u2018\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (not ill-formed [\u2026] as unto women, 453-4). The association is quite consistent.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Meanwhile, Aristotle\u2019s Politics makes a \u2018golden mean\u2019 argument about geography and ethnicity, if not precisely skin colour, claiming that Europeans and people living in cold places are \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 (\u2018full of courage but lacking in intelligence and skill\u2019), and thus are too disorganised to conquer their neighbours, whilst Asians are \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd, \u1f04\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ad (\u2018intelligent and skilful, but without courage\u2019, Politics 7, 1327b), and that Greeks occupy the perfect mean between the two and thus have intelligence, skill, and courage.
