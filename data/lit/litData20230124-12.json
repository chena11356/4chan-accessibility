By Lev Tolstoy", "com": "Art is defined as external signs by means of which a man can transmit his feelings to others. Good art transmits those feelings well, bad art does not. This definition is likely the closest to an objective one, unlike aesthetic, metaphysical and theological definitions of art, which rely on fantastical supposition, vague arguments and subjective criteria. The moral content of said art is the subject of religion and philosophy, and universal humanitarian Christian sentiment is the best content.<br>However, most art in Tolstoy\u2019s time was made to entertain the upper classes. The upper classes were wary of religion. The art transmitted no content, let alone a feeling. Instead, it was whimsical, shocking and clever. Entire industries developed around producing this semblance of art, which was confusing to the general public but nevertheless extolled by the upper classes.<br>Fake art is created through a combination of 4 techniques: borrowing, imitation, effect-fulness and diversion. Borrowing relies on the viewer\u2019s recollection of an older well-known character or scene and makes do with the creation of those emotions. Imitation covers up emptiness through excess detail. Effect-fulness shocks the senses and creates the required emotions in the viewer. Diversion adds intellectual intrigue to the art, like an unnecessary sub-plot, or vivid descriptions of the mores of the times in which the art is set, or some incidental philosophical allusions, because of which viewers will believe it is deep. In Tolstoy\u2019s own words: Genuine art has no need for dressing up, like the wife of a loving husband. Counterfeit art, like a prostitute, must always be decked out.<br>As a result, borrowing from Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cOn Shakespeare\u201d, there are 3 parts of art. Content: the the deeper the subject, ie, the more important it is to the life of mankind, the higher is the work. Technique: the external beauty achieved by technical methods proper to the particular kind of art. Sincerity: that the author should himself keenly feel what he expresses. Without this condition there can be no work of art, as the essence of art consists in the contemplation of the work of art being infected with the author&#039;s feeling. If the author does not actually feel what he expresses, then the recipient can not become infected with the feeling of the author, does not experience any feeling, and the production can no longer be classified as a work of art.", "filename": "9780140446425", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 326, "h": 500, "tn_w": 163, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674547963647765, "time": 1674547963, "md5": "CnoiMqyh7PotWbKK0tUAzA==", "fsize": 120333, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "summary-of-what-is-art-by-lev-tolstoy", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 22, "images": 5, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21565577, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)03:16:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565571</a><br>I\u2019ve always completely agreed with Tolstoy\u2019s definition of art but disagreed with what he personally considered to be great art.

I might be a slightly atypical case, though, because my parents got me into educational video games in English before I even started school. Then browsing online, watching American YouTubers and gaming with international friends did the rest. In terms of English vs Bulgarian, for my preteen and teen years I probably got 50/50 input. Picking up the language was trivial for me. If anything, my issues are vocabulary and my increasing grammar autism, which is a consequence of me being ESL and wanting to &quot;get the grammar right&quot;. I am probably much more grammatically rigorous in English than in my native language. Also because I learnt English on the basis of interest, I am now in the strange situation of being able to have conversations about metaphysics and philosophy on the fly, but taking a moment or two to recall what a power socket is called. If you quizzed me on the names of every kitchen utensil in existence, I&#039;d probably fail, and possibly do worse than my mother who&#039;s pretty damn bad at English.<br>Anyway, if you&#039;re more interested in the language process, learning basic vocabulary at home and then basic grammar at elementary school was vital for me.

The progress of bioplastics has been slow and steady, but with increasing pressure from policy makers, brand owners, and consumers, the bioplastic industry is seeing increased patent activity, a strong indicator of innovation. Many green plastic technologies that have been in the research and development stages are either right now being commercialised on a large scale, or are on the cusp of being commercialised. Hopefully, we can change those woeful headlines that we have been seeing that claim plastic recycling is a myth or a sham.<br><br>Currently, 99% of all plastic recycling uses a mechanical recycling method. Mechanical recycling plants wash, shred, heat, and grind used plastics into reusable plastic pellets, however the term reusable should be used loosely. This process has severe limitations because it degrades the chemicals within the plastics, meaning plastics can undergo mechanical recycling only 1 \u2013 3 times before they are to be discarded. This is a huge obstacle in our pursuit of a circular economy. <br><br>Chemical recycling is our answer. Chemical recycling is starting to commercialise at a fast rate. The industry has seen huge investments, and major project announcements have been made. As of early 2022, we had around 20 chemical recycling plants that were mostly being used for research and development, but by 2025 there will be around 140 plants operating globally. <br><br>Key processes that fall under the chemical recycling umbrella term include depolymerisation, pyrolysis and dissolution. These processes can actually produce virgin-quality plastics indistinguishable from brand new plastics, and unlike the traditional mechanical recycling method, plastics that undergo these processes can be recycled repeatedly. <br><br>These three types of chemical recycling processes produce different end-products, all of which can be used to create virgin-plastics. Depolymerisation requires a relatively homogenous feedstock of plastics and works by splitting the plastics into single monomer molecules or short polymer chains with thermal, chemical or biological processes. Depolymerisation can only use condensation polymers like PET and polyamides. This, unfortunately, leaves out the more common types of plastics like PP and PE plastics.", "filename": "d3", "ext": ".png", "w": 850, "h": 861, "tn_w": 246, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674558498389723, "time": 1674558498, "md5": "sPkkGOIYo5mNdFZ1oS8yaw==", "fsize": 1466033, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-applied-for-a-job-and-they-asked-me-to-write-an", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 11, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 21565875, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)06:08:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pyrolysis closes the gaps left behind by depolymerisation, as the common PP and PE plastics are its primary feedstocks, along with PB, PS, and PMMA. Additionally, pyrolysis is able to better process mixed plastic waste, making it more cost-effective and in-line with current plastic recovery processes. This makes it an appealing new addition to our plastics recycling arsenal. The end products of pyrolysis are hydrocarbons in the form of oil, which can be used as feedstocks at plastic production plants and require no additional infrastructure. Alternatively, the oil can also be used to generate energy.<br><br>Finally, we have dissolution. This process uses solvents to either dissolve the target polymers and separate them, or dissolve the unwanted polymers, leaving behind the target polymers. Solvents need to be specifically chosen for the type of plastic being recycled, so it\u2019s a very delicate process. Since plastics are generally collected as mixed plastics, this type of chemical recycling has obstacles that need to be overcome before it\u2019s ready for larger-scale commercial use.<br><br>By 2030, chemical recycling processes will produce about a third of all recycled plastics, saving 20 million tonnes of plastic per year from ending up in oceans, landfills, or incineration plants. <br><br>Although this is a significant achievement and a step in the right direction, this still won\u2019t solve all of our problems. Plastic consumption is increasing rapidly. By 2030, plastic production is forecast to grow to 467 million tonnes per year from 360 million tonnes per year in 2020.<br><br>This ever-growing demand for plastics means that even if we recycled 100% of all plastics, there would still be a need for virgin plastics. This is where bioplastics (not to be confused with biodegradable plastics) could come in. <br><br>Bioplastics still have a long way to go. Developments are underway, but it is still too early to say when (not if) they are going to have the big impact that we have been waiting for.<br><br>In 2021 we produced around 2.4 million tonnes of bioplastics, making up 0.7% of all produced plastics. By 2027, bioplastics are forecast to amount to 1.5% of all produced plastics.

This shouldn\u2019t dampen our spirits, however, as failed projects and dead-ends are common in all fields of technology. Chemical recycling has suffered its own failures, but with continued effort and investment, it managed to achieve commercial viability and will continue to develop. With increasing demand from policy makers, brand-owners, and consumers, increased bioplastic patent activity indicates a revitalised interest in bioplastics. The industry is forecast to grow by 10.1% CAGR in the next ten years.<br><br>Like the end-products of chemical recycling, bioplastics can be used as drop-in feedstocks at plastic production plants, with no need for additional infrastructure. These bioplastics have similar or identical properties to the plastics they replace, with one major caveat, they cannot be recycled like regular plastics.

A letter and local papers from Dr. Howard tell the whole sad story\u2014which by this time you may have heard directly. If you have not received first-hand information from Cross Plains, I\u2019ll send you the material I received. Like you, I feel clubbed on the head\u2014or as if the whole thing were a nightmare from which one might suddenly awake. In case duplicate data hasn\u2019t reached you, I\u2019ll say briefly that grief about REH\u2019s mother was the cause. When he was told that she could not live more than 48 hours, he entered his car, closed the doors, and shot himself through the head\u2014never regaining consciousness and dying 8 hours later. That was June 11. His mother died the next day without regaining consciousness or knowing of his act. The shock to Dr. Howard must be devastating\u2014wife and splendid only child gone in one dread blow. I only hope he can weather it successfully. I\u2019ve just written him a letter of sympathy. His letter showed tremendous bravery, and the paper spoke of his being about to visit relatives in Missouri. One can imagine his suffering\u2014as well as the degree of grief which drove REH to his own desperate act. REH\u2019s library will go to his alma mater\u2014Howard Payne College in Brownwood\u2014as the nucleus of a Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection which will later include letters, mss., etc.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poor old Two-Gun! His sombre, moody side\u2014or else his general sensitiveness\u2014must have gone deeper than we ever realised. Heaven knows the loss of a cherished parent is bad enough, but most can accept it as part of the inevitable order of things. REH\u2019s idolisation of both his parents was always manifest, but the present sad extreme was hardly to be looked for\u2014although his father says he feared it for some time. I suppose that, in the last analysis, his desperate reaction to his grief came from the selfsame endowment of sensitiveness and imagination which made his stories stand out so. He saw everything in the heightened light of its dramatic relationships to things behind and around it, and subjectively felt the events of history, and the spirit and overtones of scenes and personalities, as very few are able to see and feel. Turned on the sorrow in his immediate life, this faculty must have given things an intolerable aspect and precipitated the fatal act.

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. <br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. Nothing but the codified New England berms on Janice lane. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle. He could hold onto her large ears as she bound over hill and river. They could mass with the stones and the leaves.

It was as cool and quiet and dim as when he had reconnoitered it the day before. The librarian didn&#039;t look up from her desktop game of solitaire as he walked toward the corner where the classic literature was shelved. Seeing that it too had maintained the state in which he initially observed it \u2013 desolate and inconspicuous \u2013 the trepidation which had been festering on the edges of his consciousness faded. Still under the influence of some anxiety, however, he absentmindedly groped at his genitals through his silver polyester athletic shorts. Scanning the shelves, he read and recognized the names of authors he had not and did not care to read. Balzac, Dickens, Faulkner, Mann, and so on. The problem with working through a book, he thought, was that he didn&#039;t have to. If the work contained any novel insight, the reading public would integrate those insights into their daily life; being a member of that same population, those insights would find their way to him eventually. His apish appearance belied the fact that the degrees of separation between him and this reading public was about three.<br> Now almost fully erect, he decided to sneak a quick ejaculation into the day&#039;s schedule. Kneeling down on the dark-blue carpet, he retrieved his member from his running shorts. Each stroke produced a sort of whispering sound; a sound no louder than that of actual whispering one might hear if this particular library was more popular. Not having the strongest pictorial imagination, he glanced around for something even tangentially erotic. Instead, all he saw was phalanxes of names of very famous and dead authors. He was unsure if they were bemused or amused or shocked or disgusted, but he felt as if they were all arrayed around him with unyielding eyes. Joyce and Jung and even Joubert, all gazing from the spines of their works in a sort of ghostly or immortal way. <br> The frictive heat on his member, the slow fatiguing of his arm, and the why-am-I-even-doing-this species of boredom all crept up on him and tapped on his shoulder in a dissuading way. He persisted, however, until his haunches tightened, and whitish phlegm spattered the carpet. The bookshelves glared with unison disapproval. Zola, who was only inches away from the clump of spermatozoa, stared with the greatest disdain. With anxiety still lingering, he wiped the dampness from his urethra on the carpet, stood up, and peeked around the bookcase toward the door. Just then, the sound of barking broke the silence. It grew louder until the glass door swung open, and a man with a chained pit bull invaded the library. <br> &quot;My God! Sir, you can&#039;t bring your dog in here,&quot; the librarian cried. <br> The dog walker scanned the entirety of the room, save the librarian&#039;s eyes.

Namely, in the frigid north there are trolls that cause problems because they&#039;re basically herds of silverbacked gorillas that just learned how to make fire. To have slain a troll in combat is a huge status symbol for men, partly because the only sane way to fight them is to outnumber them with arrows and spears.<br><br>Normally, they are in herds and family units and you can track them down because they basically howl at the moon every night. What can get dangerous is if, after a botched hunt or after a clash between herds, there is one troll left alive. One troll alone has no need to howl, so they might show up unexpectedly and kill a bunch of people/cows. Such creatures are sort of like bogeymen and their strength is probably above average but you can&#039;t quite be sure because anyone who kills them treats it like a fish story. Bigger and bigger, stronger and stronger.<br><br>The reason I post this all here, in a writing general instead of sffg or something, is because my momentary hangup is linguistic.

I&#039;m sure there are a number of very fine nonfiction books on chinese history that are well written and engaging, but people simply may not know about them. On the other hand, there may be any number of well written nonfiction books on chinese history, but they are written in such a way as to appeal to students of history and not the general public. In order to reach that larger group you can put together a story that basically adheres to what occurred while also making it exciting for the reader.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1674372637, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557138, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)02:31:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21557136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21557136</a><br>Dostoyevsky was a far superior writer if I&#039;m being honest.", "time": 1674372681, "resto": 21556609}, {"no": 21557404, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)04:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "At first I was lukewarm on Pale Fire (didnt even try to do that) cuz I thought its structure was just Nabokov showing off and I&#039;m generally apprehensive when it comes to praising books solely for being intricate, but its the final third or so of the book where all the small pieces really come together.

Dampening their boozy conversation is April\u2019s recent so-so lead performance in a miserable amateur theater production \u2013 a failed attempt to bring Bohemian flair to her and her inner circle\u2019s tedious lives. The couples, pressed for things to say, talk politics, bemoaning the \u201creactionary\u201d local schoolboard as Frank drifts off and remembers better evenings when they also talked politics, but with more zeal. He recalls spirited discussions of \u201cthe cancerous growth of Senator McCarthy\u201d and how \u201cafter politics had palled there had still been the elusive but endlessly absorbing topics of Conformity, or The Suburbs, or Madison Avenue, or American Society Today.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s all quite depressing, like the novel itself, a portrait of alcoholic self-delusion and emotional emptiness among the grasping, striving, forward-thinking, white American commuting class. It\u2019s a novel the Wheeler\u2019s themselves might read, that is, and for much the same elevating reasons that April acted in the sad play and that she and her circle clip political articles from the Manchester Guardian. Theirs is a culturally self-conscious milieu, roughly the one depicted in The Great Gatsby, everything ever written by JD Salinger, Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf by Edward Albee, and ninety per-cent of the work of the three Johns: O\u2019Hara, Cheever, and Updike. It\u2019s a milieu so pitilessly, exhaustively, and unendingly fictionalized and dramatized (even to this day; see Jonathan Franzen) that one is amazed it can still bear to exist, let alone take its own existence seriously, let alone expect that all America \u2013 and all the world, in fact -- should take it as seriously as it takes itself.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Folks, we have a paradox on our hands, and not just any old paradox. A paradox concerning a social class which deeply believes that its learning and sensitivity have equipped it to handle paradox at levels that its supposed inferiors can\u2019t comprehend. Democracy can be installed abroad by troops. It\u2019s fine to fly private jets across an ocean so long as they land at a conference on climate change.

To eager readers of New Yorker fiction about the superficial, frigid lives of readers of the New Yorker, it takes a thief to catch a thief, much as it takes opaque intelligence agencies to guarantee an open society. And huge corporations to rein in capitalism. And on and on and on and on. Like a vintage Carly Simon album abhorring the leisure-class depressives whose children helped turn her records into hits.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cLiberal guilt,\u201d conservatives used to call this, and some of the proudest liberals of the era plead guilty-as-charged, proving the accusation at the same time they paradoxically, dialectically, and (to plain-thinking types) maddeningly transcended it. It has since become their favorite magic trick, placing signs of welcome to minorities in front of houses few minorities can afford to purchase but often visit \u2013 as gardeners and maids. These homeowners clearly wish it weren\u2019t this way, of course, and one hears they are working to correct things by pressuring their vastly wealthy colleges to admit the children of their servants so they too can someday trade derivatives, move to Scarsdale, and quietly die inside.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Though maybe the new guard won\u2019t suffer like the old guard. Maybe the reason the Wheelers and their ilk were so unhappy in their leafy enclaves was that they suspected in their progressive souls that others deserved the good luck they found so numbing. Maybe their anxious sorrows were those of people doomed to maintain the roofs and yards and driveways that history, slowly tracing its arc of justice, would eventually award to mortgage-holders (or renters from Blackrock-like financial giants) more capable of feeling joy and gratitude.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s certainly a theory. But Yates\u2019 novel and countless others like it don\u2019t support it in the least. In Revolutionary Road, the dolor of the enlightened, liberal couple \u2013 the dolor the Wheeler\u2019s real-life peers so love to savor in stories about their class \u2013 stems from a rather simple source, one that still abounds today: fantastical entitled narcissism. The Wheelers believe they are interesting people, or potentially interesting people, and that their town, their country, and the whole system have stunted their souls and starved their intellects. Yates, their creator, suggests this isn\u2019t so \u2013 the Wheelers are living exactly as they\u2019ve chosen, in America\u2019s dreamy, steady-income shallows \u2013 but his characters know this only dimly. Mostly, they just hate themselves. And in this they resemble their counterparts today.

He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of information obtained; lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it, can make another in the suit. He recognizes what is played through feint, by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table.

Yet is it bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. &#039;Tis iron\u2014that I know\u2014not gold. &#039;Tis split, too\u2014that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain- battering fight! Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne&#039;er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise!

I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better.

Yet the necessity of Wagner&#039;s influence in his musical productivity at the end of tonality is unmistakeable. And this is the same for the other modernists. Schubert, Chopin and Schumann were not conservatives in the sense of my use (Wagner certainly wasn&#039;t opposed to them), but were innovators who belonged to the living tradition. There was no looking back, or opposing the &#039;new&#039;. The same is true for the most part of Mendelssohn, but whose relation to the tradition was already somewhat foreign, and in that, prefiguring the faults of the conservative movement. Notably the belief that music of equal worth, and belonging to, that tradition will just simply appear if one labours (not necessarily dutifully) in traditional forms. For this reason much of what Mendelssohn wrote has, again, rightfully, been forgotten. Yes, there is Brahms, the only productive member of the conservatives, but who eventually rejected this identity and thought his music kin with Wagner&#039;s. It is interesting, also, that these so-called conservatives belong to an entirely different era than the modernists. It is almost as if there&#039;s not a single worthwhile conservative composer in that era. Because where Strauss et al. were continuing that tradition, self described conservatives provided nothing of worth.<br><br>It is clear your thoughts on the matter are a dilettantish toying with assumed concepts, such as &#039;Traditional&#039;, &#039;decadent&#039;, etc. Calling Schumann a superior composer to Mahler is simply embarrassing. You cannot study Classical music and retain these capricious judgements which are characteristic of the beginner. You can still dislike the modernists, you can still dislike Mahler, but you cannot deny his technical mastery and monumental creativity. Which you unthinkingly do by elevating Schumann as the superior composer. Since it is only motivated by a bias.", "time": 1674552569, "resto": 21561321}, {"no": 21565743, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:53:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Truly decadent music!<br><br>https://youtu.be/Hdvw-ljjTI8?t=746<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8K<wbr>w6okcrks", "time": 1674554034, "resto": 21561321}, {"no": 21565781, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)05:12:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565697</a><br>I graduated piano at RCM, and I prefer Schumann. <br>Are you still in the &#039;my taste is the Truth phase&#039;?

The energy of mindfulness is a necessary ingredient in healthy communication. Mindfulness requires letting go of judgment, returning to an awareness of the breath and the body, and bringing your full attention to what is in you and around you. This helps you notice whether the thought you just produced is healthy or unhealthy, compassionate or unkind.<br><br>Conversation is a source of nourishment. We all get lonely and want to talk with someone. But when you have a conversation with another person, what that person says may be full of toxins, like hate, anger, and frustration. When you listen to what others say, you\u2019re consuming those toxins. You\u2019re bringing toxins into your consciousness and your body. That\u2019s why mindfulness of speaking and mindfulness of listening are very important.<br><br>Toxic conversation can be difficult to avoid, especially at work. If it is going on around you, be aware. You need to have enough mindful awareness not to absorb these kinds of suffering. You have to protect yourself with the energy of compassion so that when you listen, instead of consuming toxins, you\u2019re actively producing more compassion in yourself. When you listen in this way, compassion protects you and the other person suffers less.<br><br>You absorb the thoughts, speech, and actions you produce and those contained in the communications of those around you. That is a form of consumption. So when you read something, when you listen to someone, you should be careful not to allow the toxins to ruin your health and bring suffering to you and to the other person or group of people.<br><br>The Buddha used the graphic image of a cow that has a skin disease. The cow is attacked by all kinds of insects and microorganisms coming from the soil, coming from the trees, coming from the water. Without skin, a cow can\u2019t protect herself.

Seeing the awesome power of the word, we must understand what power comes out of our mouths. One fear or doubt planted in our mind can create an endless drama of events. One word is like a spell, and humans use the word like black magicians, thoughtlessly putting spells on each other.<br><br>Being impeccable with your word is not using the word against yourself. If I see you in the street and I call you stupid, it appears that I\u2019m using the word against you. But really I\u2019m using my word against myself, because you\u2019re going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me. Therefore, if I get angry and with my word send all that emotional poison to you, I\u2019m using the word against myself.<br><br>If I love myself I will express that love in my interactions with you, and then I am being impeccable with the word, because that action will produce a like reaction. If I love you, then you will love me. If I insult you, you will insult me. If I have gratitude for you, you will have gratitude for me. If I\u2019m selfish with you, you will be selfish with me. If I use the word to put a spell on you, you are going to put a spell on me.<br><br>Looking at everyday human interactions, imagine how many times we cast spells on each other with our word. Over time this interaction has become the worst form of black magic, and we call it gossip.", "time": 1674424652, "resto": 21558298}, {"no": 21559266, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:58:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559258</a><br>Gossip is black magic at its very worst because it is pure poison. We learned how to gossip by agreement. When we were children, we heard the adults around us gossiping all the time, openly giving their opinions about other people. They even had opinions about people they didn\u2019t know. Emotional poison was transferred along with the opinions, and we learned this as the normal way to communicate.<br><br>Gossiping has become the main form of communication in human society. It has become the way we feel close to each other, because it makes us feel better to see someone else feel as badly as we do. There is an old expression that says, \u201cMisery likes company,\u201d and people who are suffering in hell don\u2019t want to be all alone. Fear and suffering are an important part of the dream of the planet; they are how the dream of the planet keeps us down.<br><br>Using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. A computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. This code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. After this code has been introduced, your computer doesn\u2019t work quite right, or it doesn\u2019t function at all because the codes get so mixed up with so many conflicting messages that it stops producing good results.<br><br>Imagine that every single time others gossip to you, they insert a computer virus into your mind, causing you to think a little less clearly every time. Then imagine that in an effort to clean up your own confusion and get some relief from the poison, you gossip and spread these viruses to someone else.<br><br>Now imagine this pattern going on in a never-ending chain between all the humans on earth. The result is a world full of humans who can only read information through circuits that are clogged with a poisonous, contagious virus.", "time": 1674424730, "resto": 21558298}, {"no": 21559295, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)17:06:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What&#039;s the difference between calculus and analysis?", "time": 1674425213, "resto": 21558298}, {"no": 21559314, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)17:13:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019ve been thinking about graduate school to become a professor.

Healthy people generally don&#039;t write of substance about the world, their writing is a vector for personal gain IRL (see: academics). But when a sick person falls outside the world, and requires motivation to rejoin it, he tries to understand it. The problem is that when seen from the outside, the world honestly looks like shit.<br><br>But that&#039;s the problem. What -is- the outside? Maybe Schopenhauer only appeals to me because I am at the bottom, if I were a healthy man he might appear daft. So we are back at square one: There are sick philosophies (for guys like me), and healthy ones for healthy people. Can there be a system for both, where the sick and healthy both recognize its validity? Maybe all it comes down to: There are philosophies of life denial, and those of life embrasure -- neither is correct, but neither is wrong. The healthy side has no answer for the sick -- and the sick side has no answer for the healthy.

Learning formulas and applying formulas to get specific results, together with some arguments for why it makes &quot;physical&quot; or geometric sense. You might be taught a proof or two, but the focus of such a class is to drill in established results and how to correctly do calculations with this stuff, and how it can be useful. If you study math in more depth, to the point of majoring or minoring in it in college, you will start to hear about &quot;analysis&quot;. In math, the word &quot;analysis&quot; has a specific meaning, apart from its general sense. Again, it really just refers to looking at continuous things and using derivatives and integrals to model them, but is much more rigorous. Mathematical &quot;analysis&quot; is one of the major branches of math, and is distinguished from things like algebra and topology. A mathematician who specializes in one of these broad subjects might be called an analyst, an algebraist, or a topologist.<br><br>In short, analysis is &quot;harder&quot; because it&#039;s more rigorous. Calculus is learning formulas that actually work. When you learn calculus for the first time, you use what are called the &quot;elementary&quot; functions, so named because it turns out that they are remarkably &quot;friendly&quot; and easy to do calculus with.

And these two feelings are going hand in hand to where I simply cannot progress or refine anything because either nothing comes to mind or what does is drivel... or at least feels like it.<br><br>Tonight I sat down at 7pm to begin writing something and have put down literally zero words by what is now 2am. I must&#039;ve stared at either blank or in-progress pages for easily an altogether three of those 7 hours without putting even a single word down. And it just feels terrible. Especially since in general I&#039;m currently in a good mindset. But as soon as I try to apply it to my writing it feels like stepping off a cliff with no bottom. I even reverted back to poetry a few days ago to try to spark some metaphorical or symbolic mindsets.

Nobody ever seems to understand what I&#039;m explaining. And I can&#039;t afford therapy.<br><br>Yet rounding back from all that, all I want to do is write.

The German does not read aloud, not for the ear, but merely with his eyes. In the process he has put his ears away in a drawer. In antiquity a man read, when he read - and that happened rarely enough - to himself aloud and in a loud voice. People were amazed if someone read quietly, and they secretly asked themselves why. With a loud voice - that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, changes in tone, and shifts in tempo which the ancient public world enjoyed. At that time the principles of writing style were the same as those for the speaking style, and these principles depended in part on the astonishing development and the sophisticated needs of the ear and larynx and in part on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. A syntactic period is, as the ancients understood it, above all a physiological totality, insofar as it is held together by a single breath. Such periods, as they manifest themselves in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling up twice and sinking down twice, all within the single breath - that&#039;s what ancient men enjoyed.10 From their own schooling they knew how to value the virtue in such periods - how rare and difficult it was to deliver them. We really have no right to the great syntactical period, we moderns, we short-winded people in every sense! These ancient people were, in fact, themselves collectively dilettantes in public speaking - and as a result connoisseurs and thus critics. Hence, they drove their speakers to the utmost limits. In a similar way in the last century, once all Italian men and women understood how to sing, among them virtuoso singing (and with that the art of melody as well) reached its high point. But in Germany (right up until very recent times, when a sort of platform eloquence started flapping its young wings timidly and crudely enough) there was really only one form of public speaking which came close to being artistic: what came from the pulpit. In Germany only the preacher understood what a syllable or what a word weighs, how a sentence strikes, leaps, falls, runs, and ends; only he had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience. For there is no shortage of reasons why it&#039;s precisely the German who rarely, and almost always too late, achieves a proficiency in speaking. It is appropriate therefore that the masterwork of German prose is the masterwork of its greatest preacher: up to this point, the Bible has been the best German book. In comparison with Luther&#039;s Bible, almost everything else is mere &quot;literature&quot; - something that did not grow in Germany and hence also did not grow and does not grow into German hearts, as the Bible has.</span>", "time": 1674538100, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565210, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;he read the story</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t have brothers karamazov told orally in a group of people</span>", "time": 1674538113, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565256, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:42:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565072</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unable to synthesize abstract thought without inserting the medium of sound</span><br>brainlet", "time": 1674538922, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565274, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565072</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He require simulated auditory autoprocessing</span>", "filename": "laughen2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2544, "h": 4000, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674539146247115, "time": 1674539146, "md5": "4KjMgU9pOo3ycJUBIkQY0w==", "fsize": 391010, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565356, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:13:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565256</a><br><a href=\"#p21565274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565274</a><br>Oh yeah?

I strongly believe that Latin should be taught with medieval and early modern texts that actually interest the student and not with classical texts which are much more difficult. Some 2nd millennium texts are just as difficult as classical ones, like Saxo Grammaticus or certain Renaissance authors trying to resurrect pristine Latinitas. But a lot of early modern Latin is rough and ready, utilitarian, repetitive, etc., which is perfect for reading. Furthermore, if the text actually interests you, like you feel a little frisson at the fact that you&#039;re reading one of your favorite authors in the original Latin and being a patrician, you gain a 1000% boost to motivation and retention. <br><br>That&#039;s why I don&#039;t really like graded readers. It&#039;s just more work. It creates a mindset that one &quot;does X,&quot; where X is the textbook, or readers, until one is ready to &quot;do real Latin.&quot; But it&#039;s always real Latin, you&#039;re just reading it more slowly at first. I&#039;d rather slowly read Swedenborg than read a graded reader of Terrence I don&#039;t give a fuck about at medium speed because it&#039;s better laid out. <br><br>The only problem with this approach is that few people have the general historical/cultural knowledge to find 17th century early modern texts interesting or think of one to read off the top of their head. But if you have that knowledge then the world is your oyster. In the long run you will obviously want to read classical texts, since you don&#039;t want to be that medievalist or early modernist who can&#039;t read classical and get mogged. But your early reading can be basically anything you actually enjoy. Lots of people use the Vulgate. I&#039;ve started learning multiple languages by reading the Bible in them (not always a good idea, not all are as perspicuous as the Vulgate).<br><br>But if you mean doing it without any grammar knowledge whatsoever, you won&#039;t have much luck because Latin is a highly inflected language. You can&#039;t really even infer the basic senses of the utterly ubiquitous (especially in some authors) ablative just by reading - for example, is this an ablative of comparison or respect? How do you know if you don&#039;t even know what an ablative is? It gets much worse when you realize that as with any language, real Latin is not just this &quot;base&quot; layer of core grammar/syntax items like ablative absolutes and ablatives of respect, but several more layers of idiomatic quasi-morphemes above that, things that have taken on grammatical load-bearing functions from centuries of use despite technically being idioms or turns of phrase, and which no textbook can really teach you. You just have to experience them in the wild, look them up/take them apart, have the &quot;ohhh, that kind of makes sense&quot; moment and slowly absorb a working repertoire of them. And you can only do that once you have the base layer of grammar down pat to a reasonable degree.", "time": 1674505097, "resto": 21553731}, {"no": 21563178, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563173</a><br>I say a reasonable degree because the whole point of contention in these threads is what a reasonable degree is. Can you start &quot;reading real Latin&quot; &quot;without grammar&quot; right away, using some kind of radical immersion method? No, not really. Do you need to memorize grammar and stick with your textbook and graded readers for two years before you&#039;re allowed to just pick up an early modern text and give it a shot? No, in fact, you should pick up an early modern text (or anything that interests you, the key word being YOU) on your first week or day of Latin, or right now before even beginning to study Latin just to see what it looks and feels like. Anything that gives you motivation is good. But you have to find the right balance, for you, between learning things schematically and applying them in the wild. <br><br>In my opinion the best way to do that would be to steamroll the first 5-15 chapters of any standard Latin book, just so that you know what the present, passive, and ablative are, you at least know where to look up conjugations and declensions and you have some general sense of what you should ultimately be able to recognize and reproduce without looking it up (even if you don&#039;t at this point), etc. There&#039;s a point of diminishing returns that sets in after this initial knowledge. It&#039;s roughly the point where you go from intuitively understanding things, which makes them easy to learn, to the thought &quot;fuck, I have to memorize all THIS?&quot; At that point, you should take a breather and realize that yes there is going to be plenty of hard work ahead, but also you can take a break from the hard work and go read whatever you want, any time you want. The point is, find your personal diminishing returns moment, and then figure out what your personal ideal dialectic of &quot;fun actual reading, doesn&#039;t feel like work&quot; vs. &quot;I probably should do a chapter of the textbook per day/week.&quot; <br><br>I&#039;ve known people on both extremes of the spectrum between reading and drilling, and each extreme has its pros and cons. People who read too much can be bullshitting themselves that they&#039;re really learning anything, and waste years fiddling around in texts but never getting serious, thus never learning anything. But conversely people who do nothing but drill grammar and ace exams and classes often forget everything a few years later when they&#039;re no longer being forced to study it for exams. This goes for any language, I know many Sanskritists and classicists who have forgotten nearly everything because they never did really read it for fun.", "time": 1674505158, "resto": 21553731}, {"no": 21563181, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:20:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563178</a><br>I also know people who learned Latin extremely well by just immersing themselves in texts they barely understood because they loved it. They failed miserably to understand anything for a very long time, but simply didn&#039;t mind. 5% of the time they would go drag their balls through broken glass by consulting the grammar or textbook. Somehow this worked for them. Likewise I knew autistic Hebraists who couldn&#039;t fathom reading a single line of Hebrew until they had turned their brain into a universal Hebrew translator via perfect knowledge of grammar and thousands of hours of flashcards. Both of these methods would make me want to kill myself although personally I tend more toward the autistic Hebraist side of things, since Indo-European grammar becomes so reflexive after a while that it becomes like knowing pure mathematics and seeing everything else (economics, physics, engineering) as mere applied mathematics. <br><br>tldr, You can absolutely do that, but consider finding your 80/20 point or point of diminishing returns or however you want to conceive it, by doing at least some of a Latin textbook first. <br><br>Also, what you are proposing is perfectly possible PROVIDED you already know Indo-European grammar, which most people first achieve THROUGH learning Latin. Thus for example there are many stories of nineteenth and early twentieth century scholars simply taking a Persian or Sanskrit text off the shelf at the library, whatever was available to them, and having some barebones grammar (not a text for learners but a philologist&#039;s grammar) and a dictionary, and then painstakingly translating until they made headway. But again, the reason they could do this is because they didn&#039;t have to spend a thousand years wrestling with the grammar to understand what an ablative was. They could just look for the ablative analogues in Sanskrit, using Latin grammar as a skeleton key.

He said these changes were so deep and so profound that it was hard to really see them. When he tried to distill this down into a phrase, he explained that \u201cthe medium is the message.\u201d What he meant, I think, was that when a new technology comes along, you think of it as like a pipe\u2014somebody pours in information at one end, and you receive it unfiltered at the other. But it\u2019s not like that. Every time a new medium comes along\u2014whether it\u2019s the invention of the printed book, or TV, or Twitter\u2014and you start to use it, it\u2019s like you are putting on a new kind of goggles, with their own special colors and lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see things differently.<br><br>So (for example) when you start to watch television, before you absorb the message of any particular TV show\u2014whether it\u2019s Wheel of Fortune or The Wire\u2014you start to see the world as being shaped like television itself. That\u2019s why McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes along\u2014a new way for humans to communicate\u2014it has buried in it a message. It is gently guiding us to see the world according to a new set of codes. The way information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is fast; that it\u2019s about surfaces and appearances; that everything in the world is happening all at once.<br><br>This made me wonder what the message is that we absorb from social media, and how it compares to the message that we absorb from printed books. I thought first of Twitter. When you log in to that site\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Bubba the Love Sponge\u2014you are absorbing a message through that medium and sending it out to your followers. What is that message? First: you shouldn\u2019t focus on any one thing for long. The world can and should be understood in short, simple statements of 280 characters. Second: the world should be interpreted and confidently understood very quickly. Third: what matters most is whether people immediately agree with and applaud your short, simple, speedy statements. A successful statement is one that lots of people immediately applaud; an unsuccessful statement is one that people immediately ignore or condemn. When you tweet, before you say anything else, you are saying that at some level you agree with these three premises. You are putting on those goggles and seeing the world through them.", "filename": "stolen focus", "ext": ".png", "w": 1059, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 165, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674423068127167, "time": 1674423068, "md5": "znkpH4VxNwJyVe+7EFFD6g==", "fsize": 999783, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-like-the-person-i-become-when-i-read-a-lot-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 117, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 35}, {"no": 21559160, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559152</a><br>How about Facebook? What\u2019s the message in that medium? It seems to be first: your life exists to be displayed to other people, and you should be aiming every day to show your friends edited highlights of your life. Second: what matters is whether people immediately like these edited and carefully selected highlights that you spend your life crafting. Third: somebody is your \u201cfriend\u201d if you regularly look at their edited highlight reels, and they look at yours\u2014this is what friendship means.<br><br>How about Instagram? First: what matters is how you look on the outside. Second: what matters is how you look on the outside. Third: what matters is how you look on the outside. Fourth: what matters is whether people like how you look on the outside. (I don\u2019t mean this glibly or sarcastically; that really is the message the site offers.)<br><br>I realized one of the key reasons why social media makes me feel so out of joint with the world, and with myself. I think all of these ideas\u2014the messages implicit in these mediums\u2014are wrong. Let\u2019s think about Twitter. In fact, the world is complex. To reflect that honestly, you usually need to focus on one thing for a significant amount of time, and you need space to speak at length. Very few things worth saying can be explained in 280 characters. If your response to an idea is immediate, unless you have built up years of expertise on the broader topic, it\u2019s most likely going to be shallow and uninteresting. Whether people immediately agree with you is no marker of whether what you are saying is true or right\u2014you have to think for yourself. Reality can only be understood sensibly by adopting the opposite messages to Twitter. The world is complex and requires steady focus to be understood; it needs to be thought about and comprehended slowly; and most important truths will be unpopular when they are first articulated. I realized that the times in my own life when I\u2019ve been most successful on Twitter\u2014in terms of followers and retweets\u2014are the times when I have been least useful as a human being: when I\u2019ve been attention-deprived, simplistic, vituperative. Of course there are occasional nuggets of insight on the site\u2014but if this becomes your dominant mode of absorbing information, I believe the quality of your thinking will rapidly degrade.", "time": 1674423148, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559164, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559160</a><br>The same goes for Instagram. I like looking at pretty people, like everyone else. But to think that life is primarily about these surfaces\u2014getting approval for your six-pack or how you look in a bikini\u2014is a recipe for unhappiness. And the same goes for a lot of how we interact on Facebook too. It\u2019s not friendship to pore jealously over another person\u2019s photos and boasts and complaints, and to expect them to do the same for you. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much the opposite of friendship. Being friends is about looking into each other\u2019s eyes, doing things together in the world, an endless exchange of gut laughs and bear hugs, joy and grief and dancing. These are all the things Facebook will often drain from you by dominating your time with hollow parodies of friendship.<br><br>After thinking all this, I would return to the printed books I was piling up against the wall of my beach house. What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.<br><br>I realized that I agree with the messages in the medium of the book. I think they are true. I think they encourage the best parts of human nature\u2014that a life with lots of episodes of deep focus is a good life. It is why reading books nourishes me. And I don\u2019t agree with the messages in the medium of social media. I think they primarily feed the uglier and shallower parts of my nature. It is why spending time on these sites\u2014even when, by the rules of the game, I am doing well, gaining likes and followers\u2014leaves me feeling drained and unhappy. I like the person I become when I read a lot of books.

Self Help is bad because it exploits the suffering of others. There is often wisdom in it, and the author may genuinely be interested and wish to help, but the form of the industry, the flashy titles, blurbs, the insane promises they make, they all serve to draw in desperate people in order to raise their own power, generally. It is a business, like 10 minute Youtube videos padded out to waste your time. A book needs 200 pages and a flashy cover and some celebrity blurbs about how it will change your life. And it needs to sell enough to buy the author a beach house. And they need to make you think you can change your life nice and easily and quickly without hard work and suffering.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the three-step formula it uses to advance its claims is one that is widely used in the popular self-help movement: first, human failure and unhappiness are reduced to one simple cause; second, simple digestible solutions are offered for solving the problem at hand; and third, seductive promises are made as to what faithfully following these solutions will bring. Many books which use this formula are often couched in a literary style designed to sell and impress \u2013 one that tends to favour catchy titles and bullet points which summarise the redemptive path.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is also a marked tendency to evade the contradictions that these books can sometimes contain, for example, that significant insight and lasting change can be attained with little effort; that uncritically following the dictates of a book is compatible with independence of thought and critical reflection; that reading a book to attain social success and material wealth is consistent with liberation from egocentricity; that one can feel better and become better without undergoing any deep personality change or without changing certain oppressive social circumstances; that one may have a \u2018life of detachment\u2019 while reading a book which motivates its readers with promises of increased wealth and status; that a \u2018life of infinite advancement\u2019 can be achieved for those who possess few resources, and only limited access to social care and education. In short, the formula commonly used in many self-help regimes is designed for people whose lives (unfortunately) leave them with little time to think, for people who therefore wish to be told what to do, and for those who desire immediate results without expending too much effort to attain them.</span><br><br>--The Importance of Suffering by James Davies", "time": 1674438493, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560217, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:51:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes a thread on /lit/ about reading more</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REEEEEE I WANT TO CONSOOM ELECTRONICS INSTEAD</span>", "filename": "1645845544572", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 944, "h": 960, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674438668987524, "time": 1674438668, "md5": "3PAo2CrW2Peh8URlCuHlug==", "fsize": 86778, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560222, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:52:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainment technology is a net negative for mankind.</span><br><br>Entertainment is a positive IF you are already a whole and complete person with the right mindset.

Every character, every environment, every background detail, every minor personal trait, every sentence structure carries intention even if superficially the story appears as a bare soap opera or familial drama.

I believe the really good people would be reasonably successful in any circumstances; that to be very poor and very beautiful is probably a moral failure much more than an artistic success. Shakespeare would have done well in any generation, because he would have refused to die in a corner; he would have taken the false gods and made them over, he would have taken the current formulae and forced them into something lesser men would have thought them incapable of. Alive today he would undoubtedly have written and directed motion pictures, plays, and God knows what. Instead of saying \u2018This medium is not good,\u2019 he would have used it and made it good. If some people had called some of his work cheap (which some of it is), he wouldn&#039;t have cared a rap, because he would know that without some vulgarity there is no complete man. He would have hated refinement, as such, because it is always a withdrawal, a shrinking, and he was much too tough to shrink from anything.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The cult of failure is embedded in all highbrow aesthetics, and the current slang for this is probably the \u2018death-wish\u2019 ...

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

Around the Belle \u00c9poque, the quality of lit overall just dropped. How many classics from this period really exist? <br><br>Anyway, here are some things about 19th c. authors that may be relevant:<br><br>- Authors live more interesting lives, they tour Europe, fight in wars, get sent to gulag, have affairs, etc. which gives plenty to draw upon for literature<br>- Aristocracy &amp; aristocratic upbringings still exist (but are on the way out)<br>- Study of the classics is in sharp decline, French replaces latin as the lingua franca but overall intellectuals write in their native tongue<br>- Because educated men write in their native tongue, their audience expands, which means...<br>- ...You can earn a living as an author (!), this is huge - Dostoevsky didn&#039;t even sell very much but he largely lived off his novel income from what I recall<br>- Reversion from Latin to local languages inadvertently spurs local literature scenes centered in cities, London, Paris, St. Petersburg being the major ones<br>- Each city&#039;s scene more or less evolves independently of the others, London is highly focused on English societal problems while French lit is more expansive in scope, Russian lit is very Christian, etc.<br>- Universities are still full of charlatans (according to Schopenhauer), but not yet the soulless profit driven activist-filled hellholes they are today<br><br>My best guess, it happened because France, England, Russia, etc. had a massive # of newly-literate people who desired any book they could get their hands on.

The refutation of materialism is strong<br><br>The bottom line of Hegel is frustratingly elusive. &quot;Absolute Idealism&quot; is a bit of a misleading title, it&#039;s more than possible he&#039;s still in the Kantian framework where all these statements about how things are are really just speaking of what they are for us and how it&#039;s incoherent to speak any further than that. He&#039;s not saying stuff is made of ideas, and the best reading to put your money on, imo, is NOT reading &quot;absolute spirit&quot; as actually being a cosmic entity. He&#039;ll call it God... But it&#039;s &quot;God&quot; qua &quot;what God means to us as a concept&quot;. He&#039;s big into looking at religion as a bunch of philosophical intuitions presented with artistic liberties. &quot;Yeah Jesus is real... As a model for advancing consciousness&quot;. The cosmic reading is dying as far as I can tell. But this may just be some anglo bullshit, I&#039;m not even into analytic philosophy but it may be winning this round. People who argue for the cosmic reading appeal to a lot of religious-sounding rhetoric from Hegel but it never explicitly defies from that secular &quot;post Kantian&quot; account, it looks more like crowd pleasing - after all, it was not a safe time to be irreligious. Hegel was a little religious, but ultimately this does not look like a cosmic philosophy, he just kinda-sorta dresses it as such when he&#039;s addressing the audience that wants to hear that. God and divinity and all that are all radically reinterpreted for a philosophical content that involves nothing mythological whatsoever. /end rant", "filename": "cresva1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 593, "h": 540, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1674527819263490, "time": 1674527819, "md5": "O7fVjoE2gdwtS85Qt0SLmQ==", "fsize": 58937, "resto": 21561568}, {"no": 21564653, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:38:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21561594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21561594</a><br>Look into Hegel and Hermeticism - he doodled astrologically all over his work, it seems that he was.

One can find numerous points of agreement between these three translations. I have looked into this issue myself in some detail and I noticed that the Geneva Bible influence is greater than is commonly thought. Officially, the Authorized Version was supposed to be based on the Bishop&#039;s Bible as its primary source, then made more accurate in particular places where the Greek New Testament called for. The Bishop&#039;s Bible was based on the Great Bible, which in turn was modified by the CoE from a text that was most substantially influenced by Tyndale. However, the people weren&#039;t using it, as the Great Bible was seen as less accurate than the Geneva Bible, and it wasn&#039;t based entirely on the Hebrew, so they made the Bishop&#039;s. When puritans still weren&#039;t accepting that fifty years later, they made the KJV as the best attempt at a neutral translation that they could do. I have never seen an example where the KJV deviated from the original languages in favor of either the Vulgate text type or the Rheims. Several examples have been posited, but are rejected on the basis of a false premise; as an example Psalm 22:16 and the translation &quot;pierced&quot; is an accurate translation of the Hebrew word.

He probably also took quotes directly from the New Testament, which makes it look like it was quoting him, but it&#039;s actually the other way around.<br><br>As for the apocrypha, there have been various collections of apocrypha over the years. This seems to have been included at first as useful reference material by the editors, similar to other things that are sometimes included in Bibles today. They are certainly not standardized, as different parts of the apocrypha were included in different early documents. The earlier protestant translations in English for example included something called the &quot;Prayer of Manasses&quot; within their apocrypha (when they did include apocrypha) even though this isn&#039;t part of Catholicism&#039;s deuterocanon which was later declared to be scripture at Trent.", "filename": "d94900c20", "ext": ".png", "w": 290, "h": 462, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674505144205253, "time": 1674505144, "md5": "F8fCC8vJZK2HB7x66A45TA==", "fsize": 150817, "resto": 21562320}, {"no": 21563183, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:20:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563175</a><br>Yes, texts in the ancient world could only be passed down through copying them by hand.

He said he\u2019d followed his father through the streets of western cities and they collected odds of junk from the houses there and sold them. He said that sometimes in trunks and boxes they would come upon old photographs and tintypes. These likenesses had value only to the living who had known them and with the passage of years of such there were none. But his father was a gypsy and had a gypsy mind and he would hang these cracked and fading likenesses by clothespins from the crosswires above the cart. There they remained. No one ever asked about them. No one wished to buy them. After a while the boy took them for a cautionary tale and he would search those sepia faces for some secret thing they might divulge to him from the days of their mortality. The faces became very familiar to him. By their antique clothing they were long dead and he pondered them where they sat posed on porchsteps seated in chairs in a yard. All past and all future and all stillborn dreams cauterized in that brief encapture of light within the camera\u2019s closet. He searched those faces. Looks of vague discontent. Looks of rue. Perhaps some burgeoning bitterness at things in fact not yet come to be which yet were now forever past<br><br>The photographs that hung from the wire became for him a form of query to the world. He sensed in them a certain power and he guessed that the gorgios considered them bad luck for they would scarcely look at them but the truth was darker yet as truth is wont to be<br><br>What he came to see was that as the kinfolk in their fading stills could have no value save in another\u2019s heart so it was with that heart also in another\u2019s in a terrible and endless attrition and of any other value there was none. Every representation was an idol. Every likeness a heresy. In their images they had thought to find some small immortality but oblivion cannot be appeased. This was what his father meant to tell him and this was why they were men of the road. This was the why of the yellowing daguerreotypes swinging by their clothespegs from the crosswise of his father\u2019s cart<br><br>He said that journeys involving the company of the dead were notorious for their difficulty but that in truth every journey was so accompanied. He said that in his opinion it was imprudent to suppose that the dead have no power to act in the world for their power is great and their influence often most weighty with just those who suspect it least. He said that what men do not understand is that what the dead have quit is itself no world but is also only the picture of the world in mens hearts. He said that the world cannot be quit for it is eternal in whatever form as are all things within it. In those faces that shall now be forever nameless among their outworn chattels there is writ a message that can never be spoken because time would always slay the messenger before he could ever arrive", "filename": "TC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 388, "h": 600, "tn_w": 161, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674524847927673, "time": 1674524847, "md5": "rB7SwlTcfanWI0oBS1V07A==", "fsize": 33252, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-gypsy-smiled-and-said-that-as-a-child-he-had", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21564464, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)20:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21564461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21564461</a><br>I have dreams of strangling Cormac McCarthy", "time": 1674524889, "resto": 21564461}, {"no": 21564701, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:52:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21564464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21564464</a><br>Why?", "time": 1674528775, "resto": 21564461}, {"no": 21564703, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:53:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21564701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21564701</a><br>Because he&#039;s Cormac McCarthy", "time": 1674528811, "resto": 21564461}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21555409, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:21:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What am I in for?", "filename": "41DC+nuiFFL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674339676661865, "time": 1674339676, "md5": "8ky24RVx9v+NFaiJwEo/EQ==", "fsize": 23541, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-am-i-in-for", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 207, "images": 17, "unique_ips": 38}, {"no": 21555415, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555409</a><br>Some made up words.", "time": 1674339720, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555428, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:25:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555409</a><br>a world better than real one", "time": 1674339910, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555436, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:26:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555428</a><br>it is our wold anon", "filename": "Tolkien&#039;s_Imagined_Prehistory.svg", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 1210, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674340014974263, "time": 1674340014, "md5": "Hxzf8/tfIXzTummRjXpYTQ==", "fsize": 371367, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555445, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)17:29:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555409</a><br>Meonor the Strong, son of Peanor the Sad, had conquered the lands of the Sin\u00fbr since the Age of Silver, when the Milfinor lords sold their daughters to the Great God Ak\u00fblla and the River of Souls was full of the sacred tears of the elven princess Iluven.<br><br>And on and on.", "time": 1674340177, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555592, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:02:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555409</a><br>do NOT read chapter 21", "time": 1674342126, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555645, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:13:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555445</a><br>awww, you sound jealous! it&#039;s so cute", "time": 1674342832, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555659, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:16:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "How does it compare to the LotR appendices? <br>Easier or harder to read?", "time": 1674342990, "resto": 21555409}, {"no": 21555700, "now": "01/21/23(Sat)18:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21555645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21555645</a><br>Jealous of what?

Or, so that the reader can feel intellectually superior from having read it\u2014which seems to a main motivation for people here, particularly those who read the Classics.

What lies beyond all possibility of the ordinary man&#039;s experiencing in his own life, he lives it here; and lives it in himself, in his sympathy deep-harrowed by the wondrous duping. One may weaken this effect through the senseless abuse of a daily repetition (which draws after it a great perversion of the receptive powers), but never suppress the possibility of its fullest outburst; and finally, that outburst may be played on, according to the ruling interest of the day, for any manner of corruptive end. In awe and shuddering, have the greatest poets of all nations and all times approached this terrible abyss; &#039;twas they devised the aimful laws, the sacred conjurations, to bann the demon lurking there, by aid of the good genius; and Aeschylus with priestly rites led e&#039;en the chained Erinnyes, as divine and reverend Eumenides, to the seat of their redemption from a baneful curse. &#039;Twas this abyss great Calderon arched over with the heavenly rainbow, conducting to the country of the saints; from out its depths stupendous Shakespeare conjured up the demon&#039;s self, to set it plainly, fettered by his giant force, before the astonished world as its own essence, alike to be subdued; upon its wisely measured, calmly trodden verge, did Goethe build the temple of his Iphigenia, did Schiller plant God&#039;s miracle tree of his Jungfrau von Orleans. To this abyss have fared the wizards of the art of Tone, and shed the balm of heaven&#039;s melody into the gaping wounds of man; here Mozart shaped his masterworks, and hither yearned Beethoven&#039;s dreams of proving finally his utmost strength. But, once the great, the hallowed sorcerers yield place, the Furies of vulgarity, of lowest ribaldry, of vilest passions, the sottish Gnomes of most dishonouring delights, lead high their revels round its brink. Banish hence the kindly spirits\u2014(and little trouble will it cost you: ye merely need to not invoke them trustfully!)\u2014and ye leave the field, where Gods had wandered, to the filthiest spawn of Hell; and these will come uncalled, for there have they ever had a home whence naught could scare them but the advent of the Gods.", "filename": "pepe mouth", "ext": ".png", "w": 1106, "h": 830, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 187, "tim": 1674527033425315, "time": 1674527033, "md5": "zeLjHO+WW8AGwpngEaGxzQ==", "fsize": 706351, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-the-theatre-the-whole-man-with-his-lowest-and", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 0, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 1}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21563252, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:41:12", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Revised translations?", "com": "I have stumbled upon so-called &#039;classic&#039; books but in a translation that the publisher calls &#039;revised&#039;.
