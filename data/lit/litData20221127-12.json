This transmutation of the emotions will then help the transmutation of [higher energies] in the human organism. No serious growth, that is, no growth of higher bodies within the organism, is possible without this transmutation. The idea of this transmutation was known to many ancient teachings as well as to some comparatively recent ones, such as the alchemy of the Middle Ages. But the alchemists spoke of this transmutation in the allegorical forms of the transformation of base metals into precious ones. In reality, however, they meant the transformation of coarse [energies] into finer ones in the human organism, chiefly of the transformation of [a specific higher emotional/intellectual energy]. If this transformation is attained, a man can be said to have &#039;achieved what he was striving for, and it can also be said that, until this transformation is attained, all results attained by a man can be lost because they are not fixed in him in any way; moreover, they are attained only in the spheres of thought and emotion. &gt;Real, objective results can be obtained only after the transmutation of [this higher energy] has begun.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alchemists who spoke of this transmutation began directly with it. They knew nothing, or at least they said nothing, about the nature of the first volitional &#039;shock.&#039; It is upon this, however, that the whole thing depends. The second volitional &#039;shock&#039; and transmutation become physically possible only after long practice on the first volitional &#039;shock,&#039; which consists in self-remembering, and in observing the impressions received. On the way of the monk and on the way of the fakir [traditional religious ways, having to do with work on the emotions/development of religious devotion, and work on the body respectively (asceticism, fasting, and the like)] work on the second &#039;shock&#039; begins before work on the first &#039;shock,&#039; but as [a greater source of this higher energy] is created only as a result of the first &#039;shock,&#039; work, in the absence of other material, has of necessity to be concentrated on [a different type of energy], and it very often gives quite wrong results. Right development on the fourth way must begin with the first volitional &#039;shock&#039; and then pass on to the second &#039;shock&#039; ...</span>", "filename": "15310732-CD9F-4DC4-B665-5F33E1AB9606", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 768, "h": 1000, "tn_w": 96, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669568317227750, "time": 1669568317, "md5": "dWzvR6iTE8dHfhxn2t/VzQ==", "fsize": 282144, "resto": 21300527}, {"no": 21308698, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:02:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21308684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21308684</a><br>Gurdjieff further later claims, systems well known to students of Western esotericism and magic, have been veils over this type of \u201cwork\u201d.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[T]here exists also [besides the Cabbala] a symbology of magic, a symbology of alchemy, and a symbology of astrology as well as the system of the symbols of the Tarot which unites them into one whole.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Each one of these systems can serve as a means for transmitting the idea of unity. But in the hands of the incompetent and the ignorant, however full of good intentions, the same symbol becomes an &#039;instrument of delusion.&#039; The reason for this consists in the fact that a symbol can never be taken in a final and definite meaning. In expressing the laws of the unity of endless diversity a symbol itself possesses an endless number of aspects from which it can be examined and it demands from a man approaching it the ability to see it simultaneously from different points of view. Symbols which are transposed into the words of ordinary language become rigid in them, they grow dim and very easily become &#039;their own opposites,&#039; confining the meaning within narrow dogmatic frames, without giving it even the very relative freedom of a logical examination of a subject. The cause of this is in the literal understanding of symbols, in attributing to a symbol a single meaning. The truth is again veiled by an outer covering of lies and to discover it requires immense efforts of negation in which the idea of the symbol itself is lost. It is well known what delusions have arisen from the symbols of religion, of alchemy, and par ticularly of magic, in those who have taken them literally and only in one meaning.</span>", "filename": "6B795721-4580-4D00-B891-0A52D613BE68", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 252, "h": 340, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669568562898145, "time": 1669568562, "md5": "vtCZVZR33NQB5f15McdJOQ==", "fsize": 37045, "resto": 21300527}, {"no": 21308718, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:06:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21300527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21300527</a><br>Read the books and find out retard.

The Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in \u201cIn Search of the Miraculous\u201d and used as a basis for discussion and study. Gurdjieff\u2019s cosmology seems to include (to put it simply for now) the idea of neutral monism, that \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d are like sliding scales of the same primordial substance (or energy), in a more or less refined form, from the grossest matter to the finest intellect. Combined with this is a doctrine of emanationism, similar to the Neoplatonic and Cabbalistic teachings (that all flows from an underlying source, the Absolute or Godhead, and progressively descends in the creation, formation and evolution of the universe in a sort of ladder). Another analogy to this is found in the medieval theological conception of the Great Chain of Being.<br><br>In this cosmology, the \u201cfiner\u201d permeates and irradiates the \u201ccoarser\u201d. Mental and emotional energies from a higher, finer source permeate and animate baser matter, which I find similar to \u201chermetic principles relating to mind, vibration, cause and effect.\u201d<br><br>The higher emotional center and higher intellectual center of Gurdjieff, seems to correspond to Jung\u2019s ideas of the collective unconscious, as well as of archetypes. It is these two \u201ccenters\u201d which, properly, can \u201cread\u201d and understand symbols, myths, allegories and the like, on a deeper level than the merely verbal, rational, or sentimentally emotional. In some accounts of Gurdjieff\u2019s teachings, they could also be said to be involved in \u201csynchronicities,\u201d per Jung, although G. doesn\u2019t explicitly use that term. <br><br>Something like the \u201claw of attraction\u201d is indeed mentioned in Gurdjieff, although not entirely in the most cheery New Age sense \u2014 with a contention along the lines of, \u201cA person inevitably experiences what is on their level of \u2018being.\u2019 A degraded one experiences correspondingly degraded experiences, recurring life-situations, bad habits, and the like, while blaming it on the external universe.\u201d Maurice Nicoll, in fact, was a psychologist who was a disciple of both Jung, as well as of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, and wrote a beautiful work well-worth reading, which gets into topics you bring up: \u201cPsychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky.\u201d From his earlier work with Jung and subsequent interest in world religions, he also gathered an encyclopedic knowledge of:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Alchemy, Sufism, Greek philosophy, Jakob B\u00f6hme, William Blake, along with variety of Indian and Chinese traditions...</span>", "filename": "19438B08-33B3-4CBF-978E-FB895559DA92", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 525, "h": 765, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1669569753807471, "time": 1669569753, "md5": "81RbGgl9CJT7NbWOkjs2qg==", "fsize": 339183, "resto": 21300527}, {"no": 21308832, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)12:31:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21308654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21308654</a><br>And you did this through the teachings of the OP&#039;s books, or was it with something else?", "time": 1669570272, "resto": 21300527}], "last_modified": 1669570272}, {"no": 21302806, "now": "11/25/22(Fri)23:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Reminder", "com": "Keep this in mind, folks", "filename": "DACFDB9A-0A32-4A9D-8338-5D67A1A9E32E", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1242, "h": 848, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1669438705060053, "time": 1669438705, "md5": "8Aiow95Sdxitl/++qrkZvw==", "fsize": 204165, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "reminder", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 40, "images": 5, "omitted_posts": 35, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 21308188, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)08:55:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307642</a><br>Yeah, the bad unfunny /pol/-diseased posters overwhelmingly outnumber the good.

Human beings need collectives. They need to be initiated by a community into adulthood. Adulthood doesn&#039;t just happen. When everyone holds collectivism in disdain, community falls apart, and so does that initiatory process. There are fewer and fewer social rituals maintained or understood today and it&#039;s why there are so many &quot;manchildren&quot; and &quot;womanchildren&quot; running around.

The language I talked about designing would do the opposite of this, or at least try to, since the only purpose of the symbols would be to recall an immediate experience or an immediate experience of a concept or feeling, and not just refer to it but make me feel the same thing again. As soon as you turn a feeling into a concept, in my view, it no longer exists. Concepts have no essential Being and if you try to pin them down and define them or say what you are you always fail. So if you feel an emotion like faith then it\u2019s real. But if you try to think of what faith is, and worse, try to question whether you should feel it or not and how to make yourself feel it, you are thinking about something that doesn\u2019t exist and trying to grasp the meaning of something that has no meaning. This is why the way that can be named is not the eternal way. Because what is eternal is Being, or the substance of the present sensation, and nothing else exists, and the definition and understanding of it is not it. We say that substances are not predicated of anything, but still try to define them by pointing to the sensation and naming it, and we figure that as long as we have a name that refers to the sensation we\u2019ve defined it by referencing immediate experience. But as soon as you reference it you\u2019ve already lost it, the act of pointing annihilates it. But the Being or Substance isn\u2019t in the universals like Hegel thinks, because universals are thoughts that can be predicated and have logical structure besides their substantial experience.

He can be appreciated for not shirking from disgusting realities, but that is unequivocally overshadowed by those realities themselves. Id be surprised by someone finding a view of poverty to romanticize in his work, especially not his short stories. He describes a life of bitter contempt, and his vulgarity is impossible to view as anything but that. There&#039;s nothing romantic about, e.g, his description of his boil problem in ham on rye. I think you&#039;ve missed the mark in claiming there is a broad romantic perception of him, Bukowski cannot be misconstrued into a &quot;virtue of the worker,&quot; figure; he didn&#039;t give a shit about things like class consciousness and the subjects he was &quot;legit,&quot; about were pure hedonism rather than some sort of rugged bootstrap-pulling man. Prove me wrong by showing me someone who sees him that way, and merely appreciating someone&#039;s willingness to expose their vulgarity does not amount to a romantic view of the blue collar life. A better example of upper class people romantacizinf the lower class exists in pop culture&#039;s view of Orwell (im thinking road to wigan pier).<br><br>The only Bukowski writing I enjoyed, and related to, was his poem contrasting the complexity of technology with the relative simplicity of nature - and even that is only at face value (both the poem and Buwkoski&#039;s point in it). The people I know who&#039;ve liked him did so through a &quot;wow, my life really isn&#039;t so bad,&quot; perception. I never get that, not from Bukowski or any other depressing book.

These spacetime conceptions are purely memetic, there is precisely ZERO, none, ZILCH, relation to race, culture, ethnicity, or religion.

True, in most cases they might give themselves names which simply show superiority of power (such as \u2018the mighty\u2019, \u2018the masters\u2019, \u2018the commanders\u2019) or the most visible sign of this superiority, such as \u2018the rich\u2019, \u2018the propertied\u2019 (that is the meaning of arya; and the equivalent in Iranian and Slavic). But the names also show a typical character trait: and this is what concerns us here. For example, they call themselves \u2018the truthful\u2019: led by the Greek aristocracy, whose mouthpiece is the Megarian poet Theognis. The word used specifically for this purpose, e0sqlov, means, according to its root, one who is, who has reality, who really exists and is true; then, with a subjective transformation, it becomes the slogan and catch-phrase of the aristocracy and is completely assimilated with the sense of \u2018aristocratic\u2019, in contrast to the deceitful common man, as taken and shown by Theognis, \u2013 until, finally, with the decline of the aristocracy, the word remains as a term for spiritual noblesse, and, as it were, ripens and sweetens. Cowardice is underlined in the word xaxo, as in deilo (the plebeian in contrast to the a0gaqo): perhaps this gives a clue as to where we should look for the etymological derivation of the ambiguous term a0gaqo.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1/2</span>", "filename": "B868C1F2-B75E-4C7C-9AC9-6CF2C6AF6ACF", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 730, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 202, "tim": 1669533611122715, "time": 1669533611, "md5": "0eNMNvaXlz3aSZj3Y9z+bA==", "fsize": 275887, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "with-regard-to-our-problem-which-can-justifiably", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 4, "images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 21307388, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)02:21:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21307381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21307381</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2/2</span><br>In the Latin word malus (to which I juxtapose melav) the common man could be characterized as the dark-skinned and especially the dark-haired man (\u2018hic niger est \u2013\u2019), as the pre-Aryan occupant of Italian soil who could most easily be distinguished from the blond race which had become dominant, namely the Aryan conquering race, by its colour; at any rate, I have found exactly the same with Gaelic peoples, \u2013 fin (for example in Fin-gal), the word designating the aristocracy and finally the good, noble, pure, was originally a blond person in contrast to the dark-skinned, dark-haired native inhabitants. By the way, the Celts were a completely blond race; it is wrong to connect those traces of an essentially dark-haired population, which can be seen on carefully prepared ethnological maps in Germany, with any Celtic descent and mixing of blood in such a connection, as Virchow does: it is more a case of the pre-Aryan population of Germany emerging at these points. (The same holds good for virtually the whole of Europe: to all intents and purposes the subject race has ended up by regaining the upper hand in skin colour, shortness of forehead and perhaps even in intellectual and social instincts: who can give any guarantee that modern democracy, the even more modern anarchism, and indeed that predilection for the \u2018commune\u2019, the most primitive form of social structure which is common to all Europe\u2019s socialists, are not in essence a huge throw-back \u2013 and that the conquering master race, that of the Aryans, is not physiologically being defeated as well? . . .)

As a result of studying The Biocentric Worldview, a collection of Klages&#039; essays translated by Joseph D. Pyrce, I came prepared with a great deal of background knowledge. I also read the introduction by Paul Bishop multiple times, and I found watching his video interviews to be very helpful. In his vitalistic philosophy, Klages criticized &#039;logocentrism&#039;, which emphasizes the fixed and discrete and its need to segment, separate, and categorize everything.<br><br>Klages describes Eros as the ever-renewing cosmic force that generates life out of chaos. Like the Dao, Eros involves the complementing of polar opposites (i.e., coming and going, growing and fading, illuminating and extinguishing), and the continual transformation of bringing together and tearing apart primal images. During the ecstasy brought on by Eros, one&#039;s sense of self is shattered, and one experiences primordial images, which are metamorphoses that do not have conventional existence since they are non-corporeal, non-touchable, and non-conceptual. Ecstasy liberates the soul (the primordial image of life) from the shackles of spirit (reason, concepts, ideas, abstractions, will, purposefulness).In one of Bishop&#039;s interviews, he noted that while spirit has a monotonous machine-like beat, soul&#039;s primal images have variety built into the patterns of beats, the rhythm of push and pull, where elasticity is life. In authentic ecstasy, you are transported beyond yourself (&#039;unselfing&#039;) to experience the primordial image as a living and breathing ensouled universe where All is meaningful. Despite their transience, these experiences reveal a life-pulsing, ever-renewing reality of images.<br><br>Klages argues that the &quot;soul is the meaning of the body, the image is the manifestation of the soul&quot;. Elsewhere in his magnum opus The Spirit of Adversary of the Soul (not yet fully translated), he stated, &quot;Body and soul are poles of the life-cell which belong inseparably together, into which from outside the spirit, like a wedge, inserts itself, in the endeavour to split them apart, to &#039;de-soul the body, to disembody the soul, and in this way finally to kill all the life it can reach.&quot; The intellect devalues and mechanizes life, making it hostile (e.g., an administrative mindset that emphasizes statistics and a psychoanalytic mindset of slotting people into overarching categories). In Klages&#039; view, the pre-classical Pelasgians were the roots of Western civilization and a symbol for indigenous communities as far back as we can trace, and...

Its vitality, the active aspect of life, not aesthetical passive observation. Heidegger mentions this attitude. He speaks of the big city guys to come to the country side to enjoy nature. Its a passive observation. They enjoy the beauty, have a talk with the local peasants and feel quite cultured in doing so. Heidegger says &quot;when i sit in the hut with an old peasant, smoking a pipe, we sit in silence&quot;. They dont need to chit chat. He explains how for the peasants natur is a vital force, a hardship, cruel, how they are thrown in nature in the cold, in rain, in snow and the hot summer heat, doing hard labour. They are actively within nature. Well ofc soccer is also just competition. Not just the vital aspect of life. Also Heidegger, despite having a point, also has nonsense to his point as well. My point is rather than seeing soccer from an merely aesthetical pov you should look at soccer for what it is. There is still plenty room from critique of soccer - the competitive nature and the fan club culture (which may also have some positive aspects idk), the viewing and the playing and so forth. There is also the aspect of play. I think Huinziga sees culture as a form of play (remember the knights in medival age and their form of play). And the play has positive points (i think Schiller wrote on that too and Fink as well from a phenomenological pov - just look up homo ludens). If i remember correctly Huinziga says the highly professional character of sports takes away the playful aspect or something like that.", "time": 1669548431, "resto": 21298579}, {"no": 21307908, "now": "11/27/22(Sun)06:36:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Soccer is popular because its cheap <br>All you need is a ball and some open space.

The he used language to deceive even more by saying life is \u201cmeaningless,\u201d or whatever word he used in Hebrew which, no doubt, is also just an expression of his personal complaints. So he says \u201cwhat is the purpose of working every day for the rest of our lives? What do we gain?\u201d And then he went on to work, because we gain a LOT from work, otherwise we obviously wouldn\u2019t do it. Why care about the future of humanity? Why look after our society? He says all of this is meaningless because he will die and so eventually his actions will have no effect on him. But they have an effect on him while he is alive, which is why he acts. By his logic, eating food is meaningless since I will one day be dead. But I would prefer to eat because starving sucks. So it makes no sense for me to say eating is \u201cmeaningless\u201d or \u201cfutile.\u201d At best we can simply say that eating does not make me immortal. So what? It cures my hunger. That is meaningful enough. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the soul</span><br>I don\u2019t believe in some sort of immortal soul that is separate from the physical body. It is always related to someone\u2019s personality in some way. So the \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d is just a catch-all word to describe someone\u2019s energy and personality. \u201cSpirit\u201d literally means \u201cbreath,\u201d which is just your life force, which disappears when you die. Jews didn\u2019t believe in an afterlife, of course. We can still use the word \u201csoul\u201d because it is somewhat useful, but not in the Christian context, at least not for me. \u201cI felt that in my soul\u201d etc. But anyway I have no idea what you meant. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) it goes over my head 99% of the time</span><br>that\u2019s fair. Most philosophy is useless and wrong anyway. The fact that almost all philosophies contradict is proof that a lot of time has been wasted on reading and writing all those thoughts. And yes you\u2019re right, a lot of people that are into philosophy seem miserable. Philosophy is about wisdom, and wisdom is power, so philosophy is often a cope for a lack of power in one\u2019s life. \u201cAt least I know and understand the questions of existence and humans\u2019 pathetic attempts to solve them\u2026\u201d<br><br>I do not read much philosophy, because most philosophical writings are insufferable. But I like Nietzsche. The way he thinks is so appealing to me because I think the same way. And he isn\u2019t wordy and boring like most other philosophers, with their pointless \u201clogic.\u201d But if you want to engage yourself with philosophy, just watch some YouTube videos, read Wikipedia, etc. then think about the problems yourself.

Instead, it is created on an as-needed basis.<br><br>The most common reason for appointing an editor-at-large is when an editor with extensive experience and long association with the publication, who has been in the role of editor for a very long time, is replaced by a new editor but kept on board by being given the title of editor-at-large.<br><br>This can be because the editor desires to go back to writing rather than stay in a largely &#039;management&#039; role; because the long-time editor is burnt out and perhaps not performing; because a new editor with a different skillset or a different focus is needed; or a new publisher takes over and decides a new editor is called for.<br><br>The title of editor-at-large is offered as a way to keep the outgoing editor at the publication rather than lose his or her skills, connections and readership appeal, especially if the outgoing editor could be employed by a competing publication.
