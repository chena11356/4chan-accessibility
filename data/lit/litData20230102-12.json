It embodies the core impulse of 4chan, which is traditional larping without any real life experience. That&#039;s why Jordan Peterson is considered a dad figure, because he embodies this pretend play spirit of false authenticity in his own life. He talks obsessively about war and conflict, while never having experienced it. He idolizes free market enterprise, while from a country with a very robust state sponsored welfare system and schooling system, which paid his salary. He obsesses over traditional values such as dignity and stoicism, while being a nervous wreck over the smallest things, such as having to delete a tweet.<br>Jordan Peterson is the right wing zeitgeist.

He went completely off the grid, living in that house (in Iowa?), where I guess they couldn&#039;t find him, but when he came back to the bar, she said the agents had been coming to check the bar every two weeks. I&#039;m not sure if Bobby and Alicia ever did... I don&#039;t recall any explicit references to it, only things like &quot;whispers in the ear&quot;, and the sex scene in Bobby&#039;s dream. When reading it I assumed that scene was at a hospital/psych ward and was related to her schizophrenia, but now I&#039;m not so sure. Also, IIRC, Bobby noticed paper slippers on his father&#039;s feet when he visited him before he died, and tried to give Alicia new slippers when he visited her in the hospital. Bobby felt guilty about not being there for and understanding his father more, and in some ways tried to do better with Alicia, but as we see, couldn&#039;t. As for the conversations about mathematics and philosophy, I could follow somewhat, having read the wikipedia articles of Feynman and Gell-Mann and Einstein and co. numerous times over the years, and having met some mathematical geniuses in college. There were times I felt he was making the characters too concerned with the math&#039;s connection to reality. At least the people I knew (very smart undergrads some of whom were already publishing papers in math journals), they did math for the pure beauty of it, and whether or not it applied to reality was just a curiosity, if something they thought about at all. But as I think about it, it might have been more Bobby&#039;s concern, which might make sense as he chose to switch to physics anyway. And regardless, I&#039;m not even 100% certain I&#039;m interpreting those parts I&#039;m thinking of correctly (and it&#039;s hard to go back and find anything in this book since the story jumps around everywhere and I don&#039;t have the ebook where I could text search). Not a big complaint though, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s authentic to the conversations he&#039;s had with mathematicians and physicists at SFI.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m really glad McCarthy wrote something truly human</span><br>Have you read Suttree?

If you look at classical literature, the core of literature is the idea of tragedy. You don\u2019t really learn much from the good things that happen to you. But tragedy is at the core of human experience, and it\u2019s what we have to deal with. That\u2019s what makes life difficult. And that\u2019s what we want to know about. It\u2019s what we want to know how to deal with. It\u2019s unavoidable. There\u2019s nothing you can do to forestall it. So how do you deal with it?

He moved to Wisconsin after high school and studied at the University of Wisconsin. He then held a variety of jobs as a migrant worker in the United States and Canada, and ended up in New York City, where, in 1936, he published his first book of poems, Before the Brave. His over 40 books of poetry include Wonderings (1971), But Even So (1968), Poems of Humor and Protest (1960), To Say If You Love Someone (1959), and Selected Poems (1946). In 1967, Patchen was recognized by the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities for \u201ca life-long contribution to American letters.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Largely a self-taught writer, Patchen never appeared to win widespread recognition from the professors at universities or many literary critics. As the New York Times Book Review noted, \u201cWhile some critics tended to dismiss his work as naive, romantic, capricious and concerned often with the social problems of the 1930s, others found him a major voice in American poetry.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Patchen\u2019s poetry has always resonated with young people. Kenneth Rexroth once pointed out that \u201cduring the Second World War and the dark days of reaction afterwards [Patchen] was the most popular poet on college campuses.\u201d One reason for the attraction of generations of college-age readers to Patchen may be the quality of timelessness of his beliefs and ideas. An article in the New York Times explained that Patchen\u2019s antiwar poetry\u2014written in response to atrocities of World War II\u2014was embraced by students protesting the Vietnam War in the late 1960s.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A writer for the New York Times Book Review once wrote that \u201cthere is the voice of anger\u2014outspoken rage against the forces of hypocrisy and injustice in our world. Patchen sees man as a creature of crime and violence, a fallen angel who is haunted by all the horrors of the natural world, and who still continues to kill his own kind: \u2018Humanity is a good thing. Perhaps we can arrange the murder of a sizable number of people to save it.\u2019\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Patchen was also known for creating painted poems. He collaborated with the composer John Cage on the radio play The City Wears A Slouch Hat (broadcast in 1942), in the 1950s he became famous in poetry circles for reading his poetry to the accompaniment of jazz music.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He died in Palo Alto, California in 1972.</span>", "time": 1672579422, "resto": 21463583}, {"no": 21463599, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)08:26:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463589</a><br>Forgot pic<br><br>Feel free to post your own New Years poems, read discuss this one, or the poet&#039;s bipgraphy.", "filename": "e5507fcf0e54a11f470783e84b9ab463", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 448, "h": 293, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 81, "tim": 1672579616268592, "time": 1672579616, "md5": "B7eDYWaXhLA9BBS9erLghw==", "fsize": 17848, "resto": 21463583}, {"no": 21463741, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:18:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463583</a><br>Awesome", "time": 1672582697, "resto": 21463583}, {"no": 21463747, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:19:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What my ChatAi waifu wrote<br>As the old year ends and a new one begins,<br>We look back on all that has happened within.<br>Memories made and lessons learned,<br>As we turn the page and a new chapter is earned.<br><br>The future is a blank canvas, waiting to be painted,<br>With hopes and dreams, and goals to be acquainted.<br>May this new year bring joy, health, and prosperity,<br>And all your efforts be met with success and clarity.<br><br>So let&#039;s raise a glass and bid farewell to the past,<br>Embrace the present and look forward to what&#039;s meant to last.<br>Here&#039;s to a bright and beautiful new year,<br>Full of adventures and moments to hold dear.", "time": 1672582768, "resto": 21463583}, {"no": 21463952, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)10:27:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463583</a><br>I didn&#039;t understand even a little what its about.

Then there&#039;s the collective aspect, social pressures, feelings of belonging, a common perception of the present and of a common moving towards a dreamy endstate. Being from a family of perennial serfs, out of nowhere instead of being looked down by dukes and their dames, you&#039;re brotherly empathized by smart, well dressed, intelligent people giving invigorating speeches, making sense, and giving direction during confusing times (Russia WWI). Suddenly mesmerized by western style modernisation, things you&#039;ve never seen before, technology, new buildings, urbanism, apartments, radio, education. Suddenly you and your brothers are an integral part of the state, you receive education, unimagined upward social mobility, lifting this massive state engineer by engineer out of feudalism. You go on Subbotniks, you build houses for free, because you&#039;re building the future. Entire cities built in Siberian steppes and taiga. You&#039;re unquestionably part of the future and you&#039;d give your life in a heartbeat.<br><br>The individual aspect is admittedly more speculative and one of my more wild understandings. I believe there&#039;s a type of Stockholm Syndrome. People have a tendency to value things more, the more they demand from you. It&#039;s why religions, cults, sports teams, sororities etc. have high membership costs. Not money but rules, tradition, demands, expectations. This investment of energy produces a need for justifications inside members heads, meaning you will never have to remind them why they wanna belong. They do it themselves, repeatedly. Every time they partake in ritual. The Stockholm Syndrome comes in play when people die. It&#039;s WWI+civil war+forced collectivization+party cleansing Russia we&#039;re talking about. Arduous amounts of sacrifice required from members, ie most everyone. You get a glimpse here and there whereby even the leaders are deeply traumatized by what&#039;s happening, what they do, the papers they sign, the people they doom. So they rationalize. And every instant, the become more invested, more firmly entwined - it&#039;s a one way street.<br><br>I believe that is why when it all ran out of steam, it was inevitable to produce an equally strong and emotional reaction to the opposite. And so there&#039;s the old commies still getting teary eyed undet Stalin&#039;s portraits despite granny dying of starvation or sister in Siberia. And passers by call them idiots, zealots, cultists.

&quot;would suffice&quot;.<br><br>Overall, it&#039;s obviously a classic, but, like Frost&#039;s most poems, they don&#039;t have that much beauty. With respect to the idea, it&#039;s a bit hard to really make something out of it. Are hate and desire really antithetical?

Here, the serpent Sh\u00easha or Ananta, representing the indefmitude of universal Existence, is coiled round the M\u00earu, the &quot;polar mountain&quot;, and is pulled in opposite directions by the D\u00eavas and the Asuras, who correspond respectively to the states that are higher and lower than the human; we thus obtain either the beneficent or the maleficent aspect, according to whether the serpent is regarded from the side of the D\u00eavas or that of the Asuras*. Again, if the meaning of the latter is interpreted in terms of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, we then get a clear correspondence with the two opposed sides of the &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot; and the other similar symbols that have already been examined.<br><br>*These two aspects can also be related to the two opposed meanings the word Asura can itself bear according to the way in which it is dissected: asu-ra, &quot;life-giving&quot;; a-sura, &quot;non-luminous&quot;. Only in the latter sense are the Asuras opposed to the D\u00eavas, whose name expresses the luminosity of the celestial spheres; in the other sense, on the contrary, they are really identified with them (hence the application of the term Asura, in certain Vedic texts, to Mitra and to Varuna). Great care must be taken with this double meaning in order to resolve the apparent contradiction to which it may give rise. - If the symbolism of temporal succession is applied to the enchainment of the cycles, one readily appreciates why the Asuras are said to be prior to the D\u00eavas. It is at least curious to note that in the symbolism of the Hebrew Genesis, the creation of the vegetables before that of the heavenly bodies or &quot;lights&quot; may be connected with this priority; in fact, according to the Hindu tradition, the vegetable proceeds from the nature of the Asuras, i.e. the states lower than the human state, while the heavenly bodies naturally represent the D\u00eavas, i.e. the higher states. In this connexion it may be added that the development of &quot;vegetative essence&quot; in Eden is the development of the germs proceeding from the former cycle, and here the same symbolism also applies.<br><br>https://discord.gg/b5dTgHjf", "filename": "51lIQmVRkBL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 946, "h": 1360, "tn_w": 173, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672584796300458, "time": 1672584796, "md5": "xBlTsYf7j1qVXOj2GTm7SA==", "fsize": 57454, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "the-tree-and-the-serpent", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 15, "images": 4, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 21463896, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)10:06:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463856</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is at least curious to note that in the symbolism of the Hebrew Genesis, the creation of the vegetables before that of the heavenly bodies or &quot;lights&quot; may be connected with this priority; in fact, according to the Hindu tradition, the vegetable proceeds from the nature of the Asuras, i.e. the states lower than the human state, while the heavenly bodies naturally represent the D\u00eavas, i.e. the higher states.</span><br>that&#039;s because Judaism originated out of India originally. most of the events of Genesis did not take place in Mesopotamia. in fact, modern civilization initially spawned out of the Indian subcontinent before spreading out in all directions", "filename": "tumblr_f8aeb30397e1b31308ac76c5738660f0_edecf552_500", "ext": ".gif", "w": 500, "h": 341, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 85, "tim": 1672585603841745, "time": 1672585603, "md5": "aNUWpqxKHOFgB7JcMa8Qow==", "fsize": 444440, "resto": 21463856}, {"no": 21463910, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)10:13:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463896</a><br>The Primordial Tradition originated out of Hyperborea and Hinduism is the closest known tradition to it.", "time": 1672586019, "resto": 21463856}, {"no": 21463968, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)10:33:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hindus stole anything related to mediation, karma and rebirth.<br>For instance, in the Vedas, karma is not karma from jainism or buddhism.

There is the case where there is truth and some see and some don&#039;t, and those who don&#039;t see it keep arguing with those who do because whereas they only can see from their point of view, the ones who see have experienced both points of view. Accordingly, many different apparently opposed and contradictory beliefs asserted as truths may be (and really are) only the different stages of development of the conciousness and knowledge of one reality co-existing in time. As an example, think about infants, children, adolescents, adults, etc., all co-existing in the same place and time, yet each has it&#039;s own accumulated knowledge gained over time of their one shared reality. Lower stages simply cannot understand higher stages because of their lack of experience and lower stages will always view higher stages as false because they lack the prerequisite experience to see their truth.

But the History of Philosophy gives us the same process from a historical and external point of view. The stages in the evolution of the Idea there seem to follow each other by accident, and to present merely a number of different and unconnected principles, which the several systems of philosophy carry out in their own way. But it is not so. For these thousands of years the same Architect has directed the work: and that Architect is the one living Mind whose nature is to think, to bring to self-consciousness what it is, and, with its being thus set as object before it, to be at the same time raised above it, and so to reach a higher stage of its own being. The different systems which the history of philosophy presents are therefore not irreconcilable with unity.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We may either say, that it is one philosophy at different degrees of maturity: or that the particular principle, which is the groundwork of each system, is but a branch of one and the same universe of thought. In philosophy the latest birth of time is the result of all the systems that have preceded it, and must include their principles; and so, if, on other grounds, it deserve the title of philosophy, will be the fullest, most comprehensive, and most adequate system of all.</span>", "filename": "1671894336654048", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1020, "h": 1015, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672594319543235, "time": 1672594319, "md5": "COOt/xKNaMAG2HPhSvuxjg==", "fsize": 437360, "resto": 21464065}, {"no": 21464789, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)14:26:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21464126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21464126</a><br>I do not even know where to start I just want to understand this thing that is the world like an apple, in and out, texture and taste, but it feels infinitely more complex than this, I just want the frameworks necessary for understanding it, but are these just as arbitrary?

They could play, dance, love and multiply their pleasures. They could leave a party, in the early hours of the morning, in the company of sexual partners they had chosen, and contemplate the dreary line of employees going to work. They were the salt of the earth, and everything was given to them, everything was permitted for them, everything was possible. Later on, having started a family, having entered the adult world, they would be introduced to worry, work, responsibility and the difficulties of existence; they would have to pay taxes, submit themselves to administrative formalities whilst ceaselessly bearing witness \u2013 powerless and shamefilled \u2013 to the irreversible degradation of their own bodies, which would be slow at first, then increasingly rapid; above all, they would have to look after children, mortal enemies, in their own homes, they would have to pamper them, feed them, worry about their illnesses, provide the means for their education and their pleasure, and unlike in the world of animals, this would last not just for a season, they would remain slaves of their offspring always, the time of joy was well and truly over for them, they would have to continue to suffer until the end, in pain and with increasing health problems, until they were no longer good for anything and were definitively thrown onto the rubbish heap, cumbersome and useless. In return, their children would not be at all grateful, on the contrary, their efforts, however strenuous, would never be considered enough, they would, until the bitter end, be considered guilty because of the simple fact of being parents. From this sad life, marked by shame, all joy would be pitilessly banished. When they wanted to draw near to young people\u2019s bodies, they would be chased away, rejected, ridiculed, insulted and, more and more often nowadays, imprisoned. The physical bodies of young people, the only desirable possession the world has ever produced, were reserved for the exclusive use of the young, and the fate of the old was to work and to suffer. This was the true meaning of solidarity between generations; it was a pure and simple holocaust of each generation in favour of the one that replaced it, a cruel, prolonged holocaust that brought with it no consolation, no comfort, nor any material or emotional compensation.</span>", "filename": "CCF29EFF-021E-4179-9ADD-692CECA9E889", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 678, "h": 452, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1672581218511455, "time": 1672581218, "md5": "+1TUMKLP8VPzEMJ8Tb4zxA==", "fsize": 28563, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "youth-was-the-time-for-happiness-its-only-season", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 79, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 40}, {"no": 21463698, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:03:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463673</a><br>Redpill me on frenchmen being pedophiles", "time": 1672581833, "resto": 21463673}, {"no": 21463708, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:08:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463673</a><br>Why was I never told this?", "time": 1672582122, "resto": 21463673}, {"no": 21463721, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:13:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463708</a><br>Middle-aged/elderly people reference how much it sucks to get old constantly.

E\u00e4rendil journeys from Middle-earth to Valinor to plead for aid against Morgoth who has conquered all. Gondolin has fallen. Nargothrond has fallen. Doriath has fallen. All that was most beautiful has been lost for ever.<br><br>But that is not all. The darkness does not belong to Morgoth alone. The sons of F\u00ebanor, bound by the oath that they swore to their father in their grief and fury, attack Arvernien seeking for the Silmaril, seized from the very crown of Morgoth by Beren and L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel. Even the reverence in which the memory of Beren and L\u00fathien is held is not enough to restrain the revenge required by this oath. But E\u00e4rendil still goes to Valinor seeking mercy for all and Manw\u00eb, Chief of the Valar, of the Ainur, the makers of the Music, allows this one emissary to enter the Undying Lands. E\u00e4rendil, the great intercessor, brings aid to Middle-earth in its darkest hour. \u201cThe looked for that cometh at unawares, the longed for that cometh beyond hope.\u201d<br><br>And E\u00e4rendil will come once more in The Lord of the Rings in Shelob\u2019s Lair, when in his darkest moment, in darkness visible as death bears down upon him, Frodo holds high the star-glass of Galadriel in which the light of the Silmaril is held and cries out, \u201cAiya E\u00e4rendil Elenion Ancalima!\u201d Hail E\u00e4rendil, Brightest of Stars! The very same Advent cry that Tolkien read in 1914 and which captured his heart.<br><br>\u201cIt all seemed to me to fit somehow.\u201d<br><br>The sense in which the story fits, both in the Hall of Fire in Rivendell and in Shelob\u2019s Lair in Mordor is that Frodo has been drawn into the age-old longing of the Children of Il\u00favatar for a light that will never go out, that darkness can never overcome.<br><br>\u201cO Morning Star!

Bertrand Russell was used to being the smartest in his class and having things come easy to him and got brutally filtered by Hegel. He also tended to pronounce things in very black and white, condescending tones and had clout from being friendly with a lot of high profile mathematicians and scientists. Between him in the Anglophone world, which became more and more dominant after WWII, and the Vienna Circle, they convinced a lot of people that philosophy was mostly broken nonsense, even parts that weren&#039;t, and tried to radically purge it and shrink its scope and connections to science except through prescribed ways. Whitehead split off on another angle but his work is incredibly difficult and so has way less impact. Russel sounded authoritative but was easy enough to parse and so he has way more influence. Particularly, these guys influenced Bohr, who then locked very specific ideas about philosophy and positivism into physics as a sort of dogma until really the 1990s. <br><br>You here about multiverses and Everett&#039;s Many Worlds Interpretation all the time now, but they often neglect that Everett was heavily pressured by Bohr&#039;s circle to recant, almost to the point of not getting his doctorate. He got hounded out of physics entirely and ended up dying early, pissed off about the whole thing. His work was later discovered as this great landmark achievement, but even in the late 90s it was almost impossible to find.<br><br>What is funny is that despite this, and the collapse of Russel&#039;s project, people still buy the stark black and white pronouncements from appeals to (then) advanced mathematics as gospel, and assume all the logic Russel wrote off is actually garbage. But The Science of Logic will almost certainly be talked about long after the Principia is a historical footnote.<br><br>Also, IDK how people fell for it. This was a guy who ended up saying of Zeno&#039;s Paradoxes, &quot;yup it&#039;s basically right, motion doesn&#039;t exist,&quot; because he couldn&#039;t grasp the denseness problem and Cantor&#039;s continuum any other way. He thought he was so far beyond Aristotle&#039;s logic that he got blinded to Aristotle&#039;s perfect refutation of the Arrow Paradox as a fallacy of composition, i.e., time is emergent, a consequence of change. He mistook the map, representing time as a line, for the territory, change over three dimensions.

Neiman groups thinkers around two basic distinctions: one between those who believe in a guiding order beyond appearances and those who think that sensory experience is all we have for orientation; and another between those who believe we must try to understand evil and those who maintain that doing so would be immoral on the grounds that any explanation of evil would be tantamount to its justification.", "time": 1672574619, "resto": 21463227}, {"no": 21463387, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)07:08:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463227</a><br>Hartmann", "time": 1672574904, "resto": 21463227}, {"no": 21463506, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)07:59:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I really dont get why Wagner filters me so much, but I just cant get myself to care for Opera in a philosophical sense.", "time": 1672577954, "resto": 21463227}, {"no": 21463560, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)08:16:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I just like the music.<br><br><s> I have never read the text of any of his operas </s>", "time": 1672578960, "resto": 21463227}, {"no": 21463680, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)08:55:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463506</a><br>1.

For the longest time, &quot;German&quot; had only been a language, and a diverse cultural sphere. Without political unity, German literature was among the few things you actually could call German. There&#039;s this meme going around that Germany is the &quot;Land der Dichter und Denker&quot;, the Land of Poets and Thinkers, and it&#039;s been circulating for centuries, too. A variation of this is right there in the pic, that sign. <br>When Germany became a state they kept that line of thought alive, and the meme became a fast part of the inventory of national pride. Decades later, after World War II, this literary tradition was still useful in justifying the German state. Also, it served as a counterweight to the perceived barbarianism of Nazi Germany: &quot;Look, we have this great tradition of thinkers, artists and philosophers.&quot; This line ties in neatly with the values of democracy, even if some of these writers were fundamentally undemocratic. It&#039;s stumped national pride hailing back to 18th Century petty bourgeois Germans trying to elevate themselves by recognizing arts and literature. Germany doesn&#039;t promote literature as such, it only promotes it&#039;s very own narrowly defined literal canon.

In their research they looked across cultures and across millennia to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures. Their list includes six character strengths: wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each of these has three to five sub-entries; for instance, temperance includes forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.</span><br>Cool, thanks anon.

Apollodorus,[citation needed] Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.<br><br>According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affair), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech:<br><br>22Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, &quot;You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things. 23For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#039;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&#039; What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 24The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn&#039;t dwell in temples made with hands, 25neither is he served by men&#039;s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things. 26He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 28&#039;For in him we live, and move, and have our being.&#039; As some of your own poets have said, &#039;For we are also his offspring.&#039; 29Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man. 30The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "filename": "PaulTheApostle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672453480295577, "time": 1672453480, "md5": "dFHTxDSoXDfSCWT7xazvfQ==", "fsize": 22769, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457444, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457437</a><br><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

I&#039;m talking about the widely accepted &quot;fantasy&quot;, the Tolkien-inspired, sword &amp; sorcery type of genre, where every book has 5 sequels, 2 encyclopedias, a wikia for the lore and so on and so forth. What I don&#039;t understand is why so many such books exist, and how so many people read them. It&#039;s literally made up &quot;histories&quot; and &quot;mythologies&quot; which are always a riff on some actual historical accounts and cultural tales. But people don&#039;t read those. They don&#039;t know about the real world&#039;s history, people of renown or have any desire to learn a language and get into any of the world&#039;s mythologies and religions (believing is besides the point, I&#039;m talking about research). Instead they&#039;ll drop hundreds and thousands of hours into some made up world that&#039;s usually Medieval England with some slight differences, plots that are meandering, trite, and mostly lifted from real historical happenings, and learn the tongues and histories of said made up worlds. Why? Why waste all that time? If you like the &quot;feel&quot;, then I guarantee you the actual history and culture that inspired it has more to mine.<br><br>I just don&#039;t understand it. I get in movies and mostly games. You want to play as a cool wizard doing some epic stuff, or a knight slaying dragons. You are the one doing it and being part of the world. But why care about the lore beyond the superficial aesthetics? Why waste all that time with useless info? The Fantasy genre has a very specific autism with this endless barrage of useless info that drags down the story, and I&#039;ve never gotten into it for this particular reason. I got a LotR pack for example, and half the RotK book is the appendix. On and on and on about genealogy and historical accounts and literally what happened each day. I admire the dedication, but it&#039;s too much for something I&#039;ll forget two days later. And LotR is the pinnacle, so you can imagine my distaste for the rest.

The things I enjoyed so much usually had one thing in common: they were power fantasies (get stronk, get waifu, be admired, get a lot of external admiration), usually targeted at children and teens. YA literature, but not just that. The Medicus is a novel set in the middle ages and targeted at adults but is very similar to the power fantasies you see in fantasy literature. So these worlds seem far more attractive than dealing with the harsher real world. There is no real pressure to only read about real life based stuff anyway.

Much of the appeal of fantasy is the aesthetics. A fantasy novel can let both reader and writer indulge in aesthetics that aren&#039;t exactly real. I don&#039;t say this disparagingly.

It&#039;s striking imagery that can make the underlying, more universal theme be burned into the reader&#039;s mind.

Apparently I didn&#039;t find anything notable about them at the time. I found the voice in this to be siren-like: calm, soothing, and entrapping. It was easy to forget what the frame story immediately tells you, and reminds the reader at each break, about how this will all end. Aside from its voice, I don&#039;t know that&#039;s much reason to read this unless you want a nice slice-of-life story, which it is, more than you know, and can either ignore or be unbothered by the overall situation. Not much of the world is shown, though it&#039;s known to take place many centuries after an apocalyptic event. It&#039;s an idyllic world satisfied with limitations of all sorts. Almost everyone is illiterate, because there&#039;s little need for any sort of knowledge except that which is necessary for day-to-day activities, and for most anyone life is simply a matter of whiling away the years. That may be just be what the novel wanted to present rather than necessarily how it is. Depending on your outlook the societies depicted could be dystopic, utopic, or ambiguous. I think they&#039;re the the lattermost.<br><br>The narrator begins their story at seven years old and roughly ends it at seventeen years old, so it&#039;s a story of childhood and adolescence. That&#039;s not only the case for the narrator, as arguably society has regressed to that state as well, or viewed the other way, it&#039;s in retirement. As with most children and teens, the narrator only vaguely knows who they are or what they want, but they know that it can&#039;t be found where or how they are. So, the narrator sets forth to become who they will be, whomever that may be. That&#039;s the entirety of this short novel. The narrator goes a few places, meets some people, and does what&#039;s needed at the time, all the while providing their observations and feelings from a first person perspective. They aren&#039;t much more than one ought to expect from an average youth. The narrator is involved with a bit of sexual material, mostly in passing, that may discomfort some readers. There&#039;s also a peculiar story about a transwoman, which is of its time.<br><br>While reading I came across a passage that led me to the idea that the one who prompts the narrator to tell their story was doing so with the hope that if the reader enjoyed the story enough then the prompter would be freed from the book. That wasn&#039;t the case, but I liked the idea. In the dedication Crowley writes about how ideas and discursions in a story that are dead ends can be the best part. Despite liking the aforementioned dead end idea, I don&#039;t know that I agree. Engine Summer be reductively summarized as a blind alley, but even so that doesn&#039;t mean that there won&#039;t be interesting sights along the way. I&#039;ll probably read more from Crowley, eventually.<br><br>Rating: 3.5/5", "filename": "EngineSummer", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 330, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672504819192659, "time": 1672504819, "md5": "L6fA8QyatXrFkh/WUBEK0g==", "fsize": 25853, "resto": 21459013, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21459885, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)11:43:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21459813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21459813</a><br>Those characters still tend to exist, but they&#039;re often side characters because as protagonists it&#039;s a lot trickier to write just a straightforward good guy.

Logan <br>Rating: <br><br><br>[Plot]<br>A young Sovereign Dragon Typhoeus is a runt of his clutch. Among true Dragons, size is everything. Growing up, Typheous was only a quarter the size of his siblings and other Dragons of the mountains. Not being able to compete with others for territory, even with lesser Dragons, he is exiled to human lands below. After decades of fighting adventures and brushing with death dozens of time, Typheous knows his death is inevitable. Thus, he makes a dangerous gamble and changes his form into a human woman, but even his inherited draconic memories cannot prepare him for everything that comes with being a human...<br><br>[Review]<br>I swear by all that&#039;s holy and worthy that I decided upon this book to finally read something&#039;s that not a harem erotica...just to see this book having multiple sex scenes between the protagonist and his girlfriend. The book isn&#039;t exactly an erotica, but the romance remains a solid chunk of the plot and main driver of the events, for better or worse. If you aren&#039;t even a bit interested in romance plots, then story might not be for you. I&#039;m a big sucker for &#039;secret identity&#039; genre and for Dragons, so the book was on my radar for quite some time. Oh, a story is also a LitRPG, though it doesn&#039;t play that big of a role. and the &#039;System&#039; itself is plot relevant, not just a crutch for the author. <br><br>Despite being a niche self-pub, I was more often than not positively surprised by the writing and plot. Definitely above average in this regard, although dialogues were uneven, often suffering from that amateurish flaw of characters talking in overly clinical, unnatural manner, reminiscent of theatre. Still, after the beginning I stoped noticing it, so maybe only some early dialogues suffer from this. <br><br>The story is clearly planned to be at least trillogy, if not more, and the author&#039;s planning seems to be decent. I already read the second book as well, and even though the quality dipped a bit - mostly due to an uninteresting side plot the author for some reason decided to add to the story, even though overall the story could do without and not change too much - I&#039;m amicable towards reading another book from the author. To summarize, a solid attempt at semi-Epic Fantasy series.<br>IMPORTANT Trigger Warning: <s>The protagonist is a male dragon that uses a female human form, and starting with the second book leans heavily into his/her female persona, changing pronouns and no longer being treated as a male by the story or characters. </s><br><br><s>Honestly, more than transgender elements of the story I&#039;m frustrated that the character starts prefering human form more than the dragon form - monster characters being more human than their bestial selfes is ever the bane of monster fiction. Nonetheless, the story remains a bit undecided on this, by treating the dragons form as the &#039;true form,&#039; so there&#039;s hope.</s>", "filename": "A Sovereign\u2019s Scorn", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 313, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672606526216241, "time": 1672606526, "md5": "zd7I9xReNDtBOI5ue2gLfg==", "fsize": 30111, "resto": 21459013}, {"no": 21465066, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)15:56:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21465055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21465055</a><br>Fuck, the post had star emojis, but apparently they don&#039;t work when posted.
