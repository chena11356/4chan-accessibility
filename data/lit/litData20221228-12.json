That is &#039;Work in Progress&#039;. The important thing is not what we write, but how we write, and in my opinion the modern writer must be an adventurer above all, willing to take every risk, and be prepared to founder in his effort if need be. in other words we must write dangerously: everything is inclined to flux and change nowadays and modern literature, to be valid, must express that flux....A book, in my opinion, should not be planned out beforehand, but as one writes it will form itself, subject, as I say, to the constant emotional promptings of one&#039;s personality.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, it doesn&#039;t have a title yet.

The first part of the book deals with history and the second part politics, although the first 100 or so pages it just a breakdown of Spengler&#039;s Decline of the West.<br><br>The rest of the book is mostly analysis of different political philosophies, their historical impact, their end-goals and their flaws. It contains chapters focusing on Liberalism, Marxism, Darwinism and Freudianism (giving scathing critiques of all).<br><br>The best part of the book is in the latter part of the second half where he gives a geopolitical analysis of the world as it was in 1947 (or in 1960 which is when the revised second edition came out although there is only a few changes from the 47&#039; version). There is several chapters dedicated to the US and USSR and singular chapters for certain countries like Japan. He gives a very detailed and well-thought out analysis of the world&#039;s geopolitical situation and makes accurate predictions (many of which came true).<br><br>The centre-point of his book is the &quot;Imperium&quot; the idea that Europe must be united into a single white Aryan superstate (perhaps with some level of federation) to be able to pursue its&#039; destiny (Imperialising the whole world and spreading &quot;ethical socialism&quot; which is what he considers the ideology of NatSoc Germany).<br><br>As he explains in several chapters there are two groups opposing this unification. One is the USA which he views as a semitic perversion of European culture with negroid barbarity mixed in.

And apparently it was a common practice to bury stillborn and miscarriages in shallow graves while calling to this Coyote Mother as a way to appease it.<br>The problem is I can&#039;t find anything to verify it and normally that would put it in the realm of bullshit.

Ulster in Northern Ireland and the West and North of Scotland were at the time essentially under the same tribal conflicts and had a unified dialect and dynasties which resided in both modern countries, and so they were kind of viewed as a unified country/race/linguistic set. The Irish part refers more to the division within Scotland between language groups, with the East speaking Scots, an Anglic language, and the West and North usually having Gaelic speakers in greater amounts. <br>I stopped reading your post so I don&#039;t have to give grammar notes on an old form of a very small modern language group. Both Irish and Scots are largely mutually intelligible to the point that Scottish Gaelic and Irish Gaelic in the North at the time we&#039;re basically the same dialect. There&#039;s influence of both that dialect and the other dialects of Irish on US and Canadian English at the time, to varying degrees depending on the area. Newfoundland for example has a greater incidence of Irish immigrants from the very south of Ireland, and shares not just that dialect of Irish, but also maintain the accent of their origin from English to the point modern Irish people who speak only English from the south of Ireland will assume their accent and dialect in English is local. Some of what you&#039;re talking about would have been present in English spoken in Scotland by people who could barely understand Gaelic, because they had learnt English from people who spoke it as a second language and formed a unique dialect. <br>For example, in English calling someone a red neck or red leg at the time of it&#039;s imperial expansion would have been understood as &quot;Irish&quot;, but Irish included anyone in Scotland who was too Celtic in appearance or actions or geography to count as Germanic speaking, not just people in Ireland. <br>Politics around the time forms an English distinction, where hillbilly becomes a separate distinction from Irish rednecks, because Scottish Protestants who were more likely to speak only English took up more places in the colonies as companies and governors began to fear Irish Catholic insurrection both at home and in the colonies. Once the red coats become a mutual enemy, the distinction between a red neck and a hillbilly small holder largely disappears, especially as most of them spoke a common hybrid of English which had melded with a lot of other new local accents and dialects.<br>t.

This confusion moreover appears in two contrary forms: in the first, the spiritual is brought down to the level of the psychic, and this is what happens more particularly in the kind of psychological explanations already referred to; in the second, the psychic is on the other hand ~ mistaken for the spiritual; of this the most popular example is spiritualism, though the other more complex forms of \u2018neo-spiritualism\u2019 all proceed from the very same error. In either case it is clearly the spiritual that is misconceived; but the first case concerns those who simply deny it, at least in practice if not always explicitly, whereas the second concerns those who are subject to the delusion of a false spirituality; and it is this second case that is now more particularly in view. The reason why so many people allow themselves to be led astray by this delusion is fundamentally quite simple: some of them seek above all for imagined \u2018powers\u2019, or broadly speaking and in one form or another, for the production of more or less extraordinary \u2018phenomena\u2019; others constrain themselves to \u2018centralize\u2019 their consciousness on inferior \u2018prolongations\u2019 of the human individuality, mistaking them for superior states simply because they are outside the limits within which the activities of the \u2018average\u2019 man are generally enclosed, the limits in question being, in the state corresponding to the profane point of view of the present period, those of what is commonly called \u2018ordinary life\u2019, into which no possibility of an extra-corporeal order can enter. Even within the latter group it is the lure of the \u2018phenomenon\u2019, that is to say in the final analysis the \u2018experimental\u2019 tendency in the modern spirit, which is most frequently at the root of the error; what these people are in fact trying to obtain is always results that are in some way \u2018sensational\u2019, and they mistake such results for \u2018realization\u2019; but this again amounts to saying that everything belonging to the spiritual order escapes them completely, that they are unable even to conceive of anything of the kind, however remotely; and it would be very much better for them, since they are entirely lacking in spiritual \u2018qualification\u2019, if they were content to remain enclosed in the commonplace and mediocre security of \u2018ordinary life\u2019. Of course there can be no question of denying the reality as such of the \u2018phenomena\u2019 concerned; in fact they can be said to be only too real, and for that reason all the more dangerous. What is now being formally contested is their value and their interest, particularly from the point of view of spiritual development, and the delusion itself concerns the very nature of spiritual development.

But there is still something more, for a sort of \u2018inverted\u2019 development can take place, not only conferring no useful advantage, but taking the being ever further away from spiritual \u2018realization\u2019, until it is irretrievably astray in the inferior \u2018prolongations\u2019 of its individuality recently mentioned, and through these it can only come into contact with the \u2018infra-human\u2019.

The conversation Josef has with his landlady makes clear that standards of propriety, between men and women, were fairly high back then. She comments about being embarrassed that one of her tenants, Fraulein burstner, was seen with random men late at night. Of course the landlady was saying what she thought Josef wanted to hear, but still, the standard of propriety is high. Josef himself considered it rude for him to call on a woman he barely knows late at night. Now he does anyway since he&#039;s lonely and doesn&#039;t have any friends. And she reinforced this sense of high expectations for manners and custom by pushing back against him asking to speak with her.<br><br>Yet, towards the end of their chat, Josef is kissing her on the forehead and grabbing her hands. When he leaves, Kafka describes him like a dehydrated dog, kissing the woman on the lips, neck, and all over her face. This would be seen as totally uncouth now, and seems to contradict all the customary rigidity Kafka had described previously. How can it be true, at the same time, that Fraulein Burstner resisted Josef talking to her at all, but didn&#039;t even react for him acting so intimate??? I&#039;m confused. Maybe kissing in that setting is no different from a handshake, but when I searched my question the only thing returned was that he was indeed acting lustily. It just felt so out of place given everything else, and not in a way that remotely fits with the overall sense of weirdness of his situation. So was Josef acting I appropriately?

However, the originals survive and can be viewed today, some of the confusion comes from there being two versions, an original rough diary and a second, neater version Anne wrote, hoping to publish it once the war was over (she lived to 1944 when it was clear the allies would win). The originals can be read in full in The Critical Edition which used both manuscripts.<br><br>From the forward to the Everyman&#039;s edition (1995):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his daughter&#039;s wish and publish her diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editing them into a shorter version later referred to as version c. Readers all over the world know this as The Diary of a Young Girl. In making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, the book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a series put out by the Dutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing with Anne&#039;s sexuality were omitted; at the time of the diary&#039;s initial publication, in 1947, it was not customary to write openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young adults. Out of respect for the dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering passages about his wife and the other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was thirteen when she began her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about her likes and dislikes.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Otto Frank died in 1980, he willed his daughter&#039;s manuscripts to the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam. Because the authenticity of the diary had been challenged ever since its publication, the Institute for War Documentation ordered a thorough investigation. Once the diary was proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to be genuine, it was published in its entirety, along with the results of an exhaustive study. The Critical Edition contains not only versions a, band c, but also articles on the background of the Frank family, the circumstances surrounding their arrest and deportation, and the examination into Anne&#039;s handwriting, the document and the materials used.</span><br><br>As for the claim that it was written ball-point pen, you can simply look at the originals to see they were written with a fountain pen (pic attached).", "filename": "HXCW6X", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 728, "h": 504, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 86, "tim": 1672224839546739, "time": 1672224839, "md5": "S1sXjYxQtQg2Emo0ZwoIzg==", "fsize": 109208, "resto": 21443033}, {"no": 21443780, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)05:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443703</a><br>seems like your typical 13 yo smart girl thing to write in your diary desu", "time": 1672224845, "resto": 21443033}, {"no": 21443785, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)05:56:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443770</a><br>I&#039;m looking at your screenshot and calling you a retard because of it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 it&#039;s not my screenshot</span><br>Timestamp in the filename.", "time": 1672224968, "resto": 21443033}, {"no": 21443802, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)05:59:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443785</a><br>It&#039;s not my screenshot <br><a href=\"#p21443780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443780</a><br>It&#039;s not impossible but the quotes don&#039;t seem genuine to me.", "time": 1672225180, "resto": 21443033}, {"no": 21443860, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:16:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443802</a><br>That&#039;s totally subjective though isn&#039;t it?

Among the best moments, a curious genealogy of the Dark polo gang&#039;s sound, the journey into chemistry written by one of the authors (and it seems that this is merely the &quot;side hustle&quot; of her career as a chemistry, which is impressive, and it&#039;s always good contaminating science and philosophy).

When I&#039;m in Naples I don&#039;t think about the imminent destruction of Vesuvius, and the human and joyful warmth of the city exorcises it. Pynchon exorcizes in &quot;entrhopy&quot;, and in his subsequent writings, the most extreme moments of abandonment and disintegration with strong moving &quot;human&quot; moments. Well I must exorcise this nihilism to which I have been so obscenely exposed. I reject its universality, and at the same time I want to reject all this current of thought. Deleuze is taken from behind and inseminated to generate Landian monsters of deterritorialization (without -ri). Speculative realism etc. it is something of a laughing stock of contemporary philosophy. Fisher is much closer to communism than Negri and the workerists he admired (a l/accelerationism in my opinion, but following much more traditional and mature philosophical thinking, not like the uber-racist Land whose ass is still kissed). I therefore claim the Fisher of acid communism instead of the edgy version of him. Even Plant understood that one should have nothing to do with all &quot;this&quot;. The part where this movement seems to have had the most success is Twitter, where at least it&#039;s fun to follow it (and where you can also find a high component of schizophrenia and psychosis). I therefore want to disown these false idols and turn away as have many high philosophers whom I admire much more. I do it because I think I would grow more by following this more &quot;institutional&quot; path, without indulging in the divertissements of lemurs, numonologies, and other facetsmm&#039;, but I also do it for myself, because I don&#039;t think I can support this so extreme, macabre, nihilism between exaltation of suicide and the coping mechanism, which almost wants Lovecraft&#039;s demons to be real. Here, to protect myself I want to deny all this and consider it very imaginative literature, also because it is absolutely useless in terms of practice, to be placed next to books for bored and rebellious young people, for mall-goth adolescent phases from which one enters and exits.</span><br><br>review: nice book but I wish it didn&#039;t exist", "time": 1672169252, "resto": 21440044}, {"no": 21440519, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)14:28:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21440505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21440505</a><br>Unadulterated cringe, guaranteed to be written by a millenial dyke.", "time": 1672169286, "resto": 21440044}, {"no": 21440524, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)14:28:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21440501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21440501</a><br>schizobabble can be fun to read sometimes I&#039;ll read this if I can do it for free<br><a href=\"#p21440519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21440519</a><br>why tho", "time": 1672169320, "resto": 21440044}, {"no": 21440536, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)14:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21440524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21440524</a><br>I&#039;m not good enough at writing to explain why, something about the &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; style reminds me of a rick and morty-watching dyke in her 30s with a useless degree, and all her eggs drying up.

People&#039;s functions start leaping out at you all the time, and sometimes you&#039;ll recognize correlation between persons you wouldn&#039;t necessarily want mentally associated, and it can have emotional effect.

Jung would be excited. Personality Types was a major part of his work, yet most of it was relegated to the past, and he was largely eclipsed by Freud in mainstream psychology. It&#039;s only with advanced development of his theories that the correlations to modern neurology will become fully clear. Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences.

And when finally a brain stops acting altogether, or decays, that special stream of consciousness which it subserved will vanish entirely from this natural world.

I&#039;ll try to sum this up in how my Asian Studies department head and text books summed this up. .....Except for Mohism, which is not studied much in the West. <br><br>Okay, for Taoism, Confucianism, and Legalism they are summed up from two events in Chinese history. Taoism and Confucianism are religions, and I&#039;ll touch on that, but they are also philosophies (that you can&#039;t really separate from their religious aspects, but atheist Westerners do anyway). These three were shaped by the Waring States Period, which was basically Mad Max Beyond the Thunder Dome for Ancient Chinese. Then the second thing was the Qin dynasty, which took an ultra fascist position that individuals are meant to serve the state in all ways, and be punished and killed in the most brutal ways. This was the philosophy of Legalism. This is basically Hitlerism, Stalinism, North Korea, and Joe Biden vaxx policies wrapped into one. <br><br>Taoism and Confucianism were forming around the same time. Actually, Taoism is much more ancient, if you take out it&#039;s philosophy. It&#039;s basically Shamanism for Chinese and how to control your ghostly energy. But it started to develop a side philosophy because of politics. It politics were anarchist and libertarian. I was to fuck off into the woods, and eat mushrooms and fuck bitches, while you cultivate your ghostly energy. But also to fuck the beast system of government, in anyway you could. Most rebellions against the Chinese governments in China took on Taoist flavor. <br><br>Confucianism was sort of the middle ground. The state was important, but more important was the family. And then scholars came next. Learning and family. The dad was head of the family, but he shared that position with his wife. Older sibling over younger sibling was another tier. It was a two tier system over every other step, five steps in total. The King and the citizen were at the bottom. Confucianism is the centrists of Chinese history, but they have been co-oped by Commies into &quot;Neo-Confucianism which is like Neo Liberalism. ... Oh, Confucians also believe in a monotheistic God called Tian/Heaven, but it&#039;s much more ethereal and is both a God and a place at the same time. They don&#039;t worship him though, but worship their ancestors and learning, which is basically their idea of worshiping God. They rarely mention him or it. Most Confucians are also Taoist. There is a popular Chinese saying that basically goes like this, Confucianist in the weekday, Taoist in private on the Weekend, and Buddhist at death. <br><br>continued....", "filename": "1666440488938822", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1080, "h": 950, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 109, "tim": 1672219475877407, "time": 1672219475, "md5": "EEzWz54ojdMsEgw1RaNJ2Q==", "fsize": 133848, "resto": 21441490}, {"no": 21443566, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:28:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443547</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Agriculture is the devil.</span><br>But are we all going there?

Buddhism has certain &quot;don&#039;t fuck with me characteristics&quot; that Christianity and Islam does, but in a different manner. It also adapts to societies well and can easily change, since it&#039;s not a religion that has many heresies like Christianity or Islam against it&#039;s core tenants. Christianity and Islam have break aways, Prots, Cath, Orthobros, ... and then Shiites and Shias, etc. ... Which Buddhists, this is even more fluid. <br><br>They are Theravada (The core Buddhism tenets to the south, in places that like Thailand.

Going into it&#039;s religious aspects would get insane. But for Philosophy, all you need to know is that it&#039;s a Salvation religion for Chinese seeking to purify their sins through other ways than fire and war, but through peace and serenity. It&#039;s also a religion of their death. It answers where Chinese go when they die, which Taoism and Confucianism, much more worldly religions are not good at answering. <br><br>All of these are religions, and you would be foolish to see them as neutered philosophies. ....

Not saying you&#039;re wrong. You got the facts, but not the interpretation. For one thing, China doesn&#039;t really view religion the same way the west does with christianity. The religious aspects of Daoism are often intermingled with Zen Buddhism, and most people take it very pragmatically (ie. when we need it, we do the rituals and everyone is happy, otherwise who cares). The religious aspects are mostly retained in Taiwan, but even there young people these days see them as superstitions that only dumb people attend to (mostly kids who fail at the education rat race. There&#039;s a derogatory term called &quot;8+9&quot; which denotes temple apprentices made up of delinquents). Confucianism has its religious aspect yes, but most Chinese do not experience it that way at all. The most popular criticism against Confucianism among the youth in China/Taiwan is precisely the kind of Nietzschean critique <a href=\"#p21441490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21441490</a> was asking for, ie. it&#039;s a political tool used to enslave people into submission etc etc., and this of course annoys neo-confucians to no end. Nonetheless, these &#039;religions&#039; in China are better seen as cultural assets similar to how christianity has seeped itself into the foundation of western civilization, as in even though people disavow it, nonetheless they are still conditioned by it through various social and cultural institutions. Precisely owing to this, it&#039;s very difficult for a westerner to have any in depth understanding of China. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. chinese anon</span>", "time": 1672226626, "resto": 21441490}, {"no": 21443885, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)06:26:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443854</a><br>Well, I never read Han Fei.

The reason she chose this specific town is unknown, she was quite an enigma. She tells little about her decisions, but they were always extreme. She was not talented in her speech, much like Moses, but also like Moses, her choices were always favorable with God. All that is known is that she hated the heaviness of her native soil. When she moved, the people of Al-Riyadhah were so accepting (they are so even to this day) a stranger could mistake her for a native.</span><br>You can delete like 1/2 of that. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She found an occupation by fixing broken electrical appliances and selling them.

They were mainly tools like saw machines and drills or conveniences such as lights and fans.</span><br>Pacing bro pacing. You&#039;re just listing exposition after exposition.

Mohammad had taken the whole jar of sweets down from the kitchen shelf for him.

Henry: he can take a cousin too; she pretty, make him man. You good man, good Papa, strong home, good greens. <br>Jamal patted Henry&#039;s father on the cheek and started yelling at Mohammad who fell through the dining room door, a plate of spinach he had carried flying into the air while the crowd snatched at every airborne leaf. <br>Henry&#039;s father, through the ruckus, for a moment, saw a small white hand through the dining room door raised in the distance, waving, with each white finger glazed with sticky red sugar and chocolate, caramel, marshmallow.", "time": 1671918802, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21429445, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:03:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21429397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21429397</a><br>It&#039;s funny; not overly racist even if you yourself are.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he saw Henry stood</span><br>Standing, right?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His father had tried to protest but...</span><br>Comma is needed before &quot;but&quot;.", "time": 1671919383, "resto": 21425594}, {"no": 21429446, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)17:03:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I can&#039;t think of anything to write...

A good analogue for an imaginary person is: a person in your dreams. You know they are a part of you and come from within, but you wouldn&#039;t think of them as yourself if you were talking to them; and you can tell they have somewhat separate wills from yours. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t much different from these dream people, except you can be aware of them while you are awake. In practice, imaginary friends can provide many benefits. They can provide companionship, motivation, love, understanding, or all these at once. It is up to each person to figure out why they are making an imaginary friend, and what void are they hoping to fill with them.<br><br>I also want to be abundantly clear about the following: there is nothing paranormal about this. There is no mysticism or magic here. Imaginary friends aren&#039;t demons or entities from another realm, and they certainly can&#039;t directly change the world around you. That being said, some of these interpretations can be fun\u2014even useful\u2014to play with, when you consider anything is possible within your inner realm; just as long as you remember that this is the only realm where these things are true.<br><br>To summarize the process: our goal is to create a character and get to know them, and play with them in our heads well enough that eventually our subconscious begins taking the lead. In the meantime, we will also be using concentration techniques to help us tune in to our imagined senses, so we can interact with our friend in a richer way within our mind.

I stand at the stop on my morning route to work, watching the approaching bus. Will she notice? Will she remember me? I step through it&#039;s automatic door. She&#039;s there, as always; long brunette hair and a beautiful somber face peering down at her phone. I quickly pass her by and take a seat near the back. This is the second year since I began taking this bus and, aside from the brief occasion here and there, it feels as though we have always been together. Though she doesn&#039;t know my name, I know hers; May. I thought that name fitting-- today is the thirty-first of April, and tomorrow-- it will be May. I lean my head on the seat in front of me. The day goes by as usual; she gets off after two stops at K. S. Library on E.M. Street, and I get off the next stop over to work at M. Automotives. After work I take the bus back home, alone.<br><br>The time is ten-forty P.M. I pull the journal from under my mattress and set it on the desk. Sixty-seven pages, all addressed to May. I open the journal and begin writing.<br>&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve become quite bored if you&#039;ve made it this far. The good news is that this will be the last entry. I want to speak with you tomorrow, but, as usual, I am afraid. It dawns on me just how creepy I was, how disgusting I have been observing you in this one-sided relationship. Tomorrow will be my lowest point yet, perhaps, but also my highest. Will it hurt you? I tried to think of any other way. I didn&#039;t want to become what I am now. Every day hurts me, every moment that I am alone sends me into conniptions of pain and sorrow. I&#039;m being melodramatic, I suppose. The truth is that I know what I&#039;m doing now and what I am soon to do is inexcusable. I cannot escape the simple fact that I am alone for no other reason than this: that I am a monster.

Of the four pairs of examples offered<br>to show readers what to avoid and how to correct it, a staggering three out of the four are mistaken diagnoses. &quot;At<br>dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard&quot; is correctly identified as a passive clause, but the other three are all<br>errors:<br>&quot;There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground&quot; has no sign of the passive in it anywhere.<br>&quot;It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had&quot; also contains nothing that is<br>even reminiscent of the passive construction.<br>&quot;The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired&quot; is presumably fingered as passive<br>because of &quot;impaired,&quot; but that&#039;s a mistake. It&#039;s an adjective here. &quot;Become&quot; doesn&#039;t allow a following<br>passive clause. (Notice, for example, that &quot;A new edition became issued by the publishers&quot; is not<br>grammatical.)<br>These examples can be found all over the Web in study guides for freshman composition classes. (Try a Google<br>search on &quot;great number of dead leaves lying.&quot;) I have been told several times, by both students and<br>linguistics-faculty members, about writing instructors who think every occurrence of &quot;be&quot; is to be condemned for<br>being &quot;passive.&quot; No wonder, if Elements is their grammar bible. It is typical for college graduates today to be<br>unable to distinguish active from passive clauses. They often equate the grammatical notion of being passive with<br>the semantic one of not specifying the agent of an action. (They think &quot;a bus exploded&quot; is passive because it<br>doesn&#039;t say whether terrorists did it.)<br>The treatment of the passive is not an isolated slip. It is typical of Elements. The book&#039;s toxic mix of purism,<br>atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in English grammar. It is often so<br>misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1672198546, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442489, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:35:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the real tripcode</span><br>...", "time": 1672198558, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442492, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:36:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442482</a><br>The Divine Comedy<br>The Bible<br>Don Quixote", "time": 1672198593, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442514, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:43:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442423</a><br>where is this from?", "time": 1672199023, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442517, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all four James Joyce books</span><br>holy BASED", "time": 1672199072, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442538, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442461</a><br>Same /tv/boomer spamming genre shit all over the board.", "time": 1672199542, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442555, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:56:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br>I know Journey didn&#039;t make the list, and Demons has.

I was locked away in a prison cell when I first looked to literature for comfort, in a juvenile *prison*, filled with child murderers, shit eaters, maniacs. My only solace was literature, and when, on occasion, I couldn&#039;t read the works my mother had sent to me, I had to read other things, whatever was in the little book cart they&#039;d shuffle down the aisle. There is a certain point you reach when you read great works, where you can&#039;t go back. I won&#039;t say that I&#039;m the happiest person in the world because I&#039;ve been exposed to literature, but I wouldn&#039;t be alive, probably robbing or killing or a relentless addict doing all and more. <br>To some of us, literature is a way of life, and I think it might be a mistake to push so many people to follow it as closely as I have, you have your stages of development in this life, and I have mine. It&#039;s much better to remember this. Me bullying you won&#039;t change your mind, and you won&#039;t change mine.<br>Bloom is someone i feel a kinship with. Seeing people deride him simply for holding the torch of the canon boils my blood, because that very canon saved my life. Seeing people praise books like harry potter fills me with dread, because I see how narrowly I escaped such a fate, that if i had to rely on Harry&#039;s adventures to console me in my most dejected moments, I would not have lasted. Books, Literature, these phantoms who have left their words on the page for people like me, they are my dearest of friends, and I will not smile and nod whilst people burn them to ash, replace them with meaningless forgeries. I know you might sneer at this and I don&#039;t mind it. <br>Keep reading, anon. challenge yourself one of these days, you might be surprised.

It was his explosive power which shattered the Victorian novel with its simpering maidens and ordered commonplaces; books which were without imagination or violence. I know that some people think he was fantastic, mad even, but the motives he employed in his work, violence and desire, are the very breath of literature. Much as we know has been made of his sentence to execution, which was commuted as he was waiting for his turn to be shot, and of his subsequent four years&#039; imprisonment in Siberia. But those events did not form his temperament though they may have intensified it, for he was always enamoured of violence, which makes him so modern. Also it made him distasteful to many of his contemporaries, Turgeniev for instance, who hated violence. Tolstoy admired him but he thought that he had little artistic accomplishment or mind. Yet, as he said, &#039;he admired his heart&#039;, a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... The Brothers Karamozov... made a deep impression on me... he created some unforgettable scenes [detail]... Madness you may call it, but therein may be the secret of his genius...

What&#039;s important is that his daughter as an only and first born daughter is vowed to the Goddess to begin with: she has a responsibility to become a sacred prostitute (ie: priest). Jephthah is admirable before the Lord because he has smote his daughter&#039;s lusting after other gods and circumcised her for the lord. You can see this in that she goes up into the hills to the gardens and asherahs anyway, and that a secret female ritual survives the imposition of El/YHWH.<br><br>Regarding the admirability:<br>Vows to YHWH are unbreakable.<br>YHWH *redeems* the first born with burnt offerings: they are still his.

He spoke in the heat of the moment and later on regretted it. However, it also shows the importance of following through with a vow even if it is against you. If making an impulsive vow and then living with the consequences of that vow is painful, how much worse is someone who not only vows against the Lord impulsively but then disregards later?<br><br>This serves as a confirmation of what it says elsewhere in the Bible such as Deuteronomy:<br><br>&quot;When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.<br>22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.&quot;<br>(Deut. 23:21-22)<br><br>&quot;When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.<br>5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.<br>6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?&quot;<br>(Eccl. 3:4-6)<br><br>&quot;Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br>34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God&#039;s throne:<br>35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.<br>36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br>37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.&quot;<br>- Matthew 5:33-37<br><br>From the POV of Jephthah&#039;s daughter, it&#039;s unambiguously positive. The daughter of Jephthah willingly accepts the result of what her father swore, and this can be seen as an act not only of obedience to a parent (and thus following the commandment to honor one&#039;s father and mother) but also of bravery and faith. One can imagine how a different person who had no faith might have reacted to such a situation quite differently, as compared to the reaction we see from Jephthah&#039;s daughter. One also sees some incidental insights about views of virginity in women at the time. Recall that from the prophecy in Genesis 3:15 (and subsequent prophecies about this same person, e.g. Gen. 22:17, Gen. 49:10, Deut. 18:18-19) comes the belief that the redeemer of men would one day be born, so it was always hoped for a woman in that time that their child or their descendant would be the savior represented in prophecies about the foretold Messiah. Jesus Christ in the Gospels would often refer to Himself as the Son of man, which is seen as a reference to Himself as the person who fulfills this prophecy. Hopefully that makes sense to explain these events, anon.", "time": 1672198739, "resto": 21441612}, {"no": 21442834, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)00:10:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442500</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, it also shows the importance of following through with a vow even if it is against you.</span><br>You cite Deut, Eccl on timeliness: why 4 days, why 2 months, why is her virginity important?<br><br>Otherwise good mainline post Henry 8 exegesis.

We can be sure, fortunately, however, that if any greater detail about this were important to the account then we would have it. These four days must have just been a custom that became established for some unknown amount of time, although we hear no further direct mention of it in another biblical account, suggesting that it didn&#039;t become a &quot;perpetual custom&quot; as we see of some other customs that came into play later.<br><br>The two months seems to be a request made by the daughter to both the father and implicitly to the Lord - to whom the vow was made. As the father is the authority figure, so Jephthah giving leave to his daughter would be sufficient justification for her to spend those two months in mourning. Some have suggested that Jephthah would be able to trade out his daughter for a substitute sacrifice according to the law, but that doesn&#039;t explain the wording of Judges which is that Jephthah did precisely as he said; nor does this explain his reaction upon seeing his daughter. Indeed, there is no concept anywhere of a &quot;celibacy&quot; requirement for those dedicated in service to the Lord (e.g. Samson, Samuel), so the only reason why Jephthah&#039;s daughter would bewail her virginity would have to be her impending death in a burnt sacrifice. While this is indeed a monstrous act, we must extend the monstrosity of that act back to Jephthah&#039;s original vow. This whole situation also serves to emphasize that &quot;going back on a vow&quot; would be even worse still than this act. As mentioned before, this is a cautionary tale, which God has often placed in the Old Testament for our admonition. See for instance Jude 1:7,<br><br>&quot;Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.&quot;<br><br>In this case, Sodom and Gomorrha are set forth for an example to us of the Lord&#039;s vengeance against their particular type of wickedness. So too here is an example of the true weight and magnitude of one&#039;s words and that which can result from having to carry through a vow. Like James says, &quot;Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!&quot; (James 3:5)<br><br>So then, Jephthah&#039;s daughter was indeed offered as a burnt offering.

Jesus says: &quot;When you have done all that is commanded. . . .&quot; Jesus is not evading the problem of law and order. There is a divine law, which is a commandment, and which is addressed to us. Hence we have to fulfill it to the letter. We have to do all that is commanded. The sense or conviction of the utter futility of the work we do must not prevent us from doing it. The judgment of uselessness is no excuse for inaction. It is not before doing or praying or preaching that we are to proclaim their inutility. It is not before their work that Elisha, Jehu, and Hezekiah proclaim the uselessness of their work, which is only a fulfillment of God\u2019s action. Pronounced in advance, futility becomes justification of scorn of God and his word and work. It is after doing what is commanded, when everything has been done in the sphere of human decisions and means, when in terms of the relation to God every effort has been made to know the will of God and to obey it, when in the arena of life there has been full acceptance of all responsibilities and interpretations and commitments and conflicts, it is then and only then that the judgment takes on meaning: all this (that we had to do) is useless; all this we cast from us to put it in thy hands, O Lord; all this belongs no more to the human order but to the order of thy kingdom. Thou mayest use this or that work to build up the kingdom thou art preparing. In thy liberty thou mayest make as barren as the fig-tree any of the works which we have undertaken to thy glory. This is no longer our concern. It is no longer in our hands. What belonged to our sphere we have done. Now, 0 Lord, we may set it aside, having done all that was commanded.

It is we ourselves who must pronounce it on our work: &quot;We are unprofitable servants.&quot; God does not judge us thus. He does not reject either us or our works. Or rather, he does not echo the verdict if we have passed it ourselves. If (as Christ demands) we judge ourselves in this way when we have done all we could do and accepted all our responsibilities, if we are able to view our own works and most enthusiastic enterprises with the distance and detachment and humor that enable us to pronounce them useless, then we may be assured of hearing God say: &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant&quot; (Matthew 25:21). But if we pass in advance this bitter judgment of uselessness that paralyzes and discourages us, if we are thus completely lacking in love for God, or if on the other hand we magnify our works and regard them as important and successful (Jesus, little Jesus, I have so wonderfully exalted you, but if I had attacked you in your defenselessness your shame would have been as great as your glory. . . .), if we come before God decked out in the glory of these lofty, grandiose, and successful works, then . . . &quot;Woe to you that are rich&quot; (Luke 6:24), for the rich man today is the successful man. Everything is useless, and we are thus tempted to add: Everything, then, is vanity. We are tempted, for it is a temptation to do only what is useful and to assimilate the judgment of Ecclesiastes on vanity (1:2ff.) to the inutility which we have been briefly sketching. Now this spontaneous reaction raises a question. Why are we so concerned about utility? Why do we regard what is not useful as worthless? In reality, we are obsessed at this point by the views of our age and century and technology. Everything has to serve some purpose. If it does not, it is not worth doing.

As Ellul explains, humanity was once directed to tend to the garden for no apparent reason. Mankind rebelled by consuming the fruit that allowed us to judge, to leave the protection of God and supply those reasons for ourselves, and now we have no choice but to be enslaved to the necessity of work. And, in this way, faith in Christ&#039;s sacrifice is a way of abdicating this responsibility back to God and returning to the &quot;purposeless&quot; freedom found in the Garden of Eden. I can see why Ellul loves Ecclesiastes so much as well.

I would like to go back to what we discussed earlier, namely, the matter of declaring good and evil by saying: This is good and that is bad. What this really means is to put oneself in the place of God. Only God speaks the good. Either you say what God says or you say something else, and that is a problem. Putting yourself in God\u2019s place inevitably involves breaking the relationship with him; and since he is the living one (the totality of all being), any claim of replacing him involves cutting oneself off from life, which results in death. The text is commonly translated as: On (or from) the day you eat of it, you will die. However, the Hebrew text is in the imperfect tense; consequently, the future tense should not be used. It is not at all a punishment or penalty that is imposed. What the text is literally saying is that from the very day you ate of it you would be dead. It is not that you will die sometime in the future. What this means is that from the very moment you would wish to decree what is good and what is evil, it would mean that you are already dead. It is not a matter of a punishment, but of a process of breaking off with God by no longer listening to him, putting yourself in his place, from then on saying by yourself what is good and evil in his place; and you have begun to be dead. At this point, living in freedom is impossible.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The situation is analogous to one in which a parent warns a child not to touch a hot stove because she will burn her hand. Burning her hand is not a punishment. There is only a punishment if the parent says: If you try to touch the stove, you must go to your room. The parent warns the child of the reality: to touch something hot is to burn your hand. We have hopelessly confused God\u2019s warnings with commandments. In the entire Old Testament, God only warns his people of what will happen if they do this or that.</span>", "time": 1671995211, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432643, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432639</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What our text reveals, therefore, is that the freedom of humanity exists only if they remain in communion with God, this communion being a relationship of love. All along we have seen the importance of love and sexual communion and so on, and all this is directed at the relationship of love between God and humanity, even in the most physical sense. Hence, what is commonly understood as a commandment is not at all a law imposed on humanity; it is not an imperative, a constraint, or something negative, but a condition for being alive. Humanity is told that in order to continue to live, it is not enough to eat from the tree of life, but you must remain in your relationship with God and receive the spirit, the spirit that comes and goes as an element of freedom; and because of this, you cannot claim the right of deciding what is good and evil in God\u2019s place, instead of listening to the Word of God. It is the very condition of freedom, because God reserves for humanity the possibility to do otherwise.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next comes the question of service. In the fifteenth verse we read that Yahweh takes humanity and puts them in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. It is rather amusing that many commentaries say something to the effect that this is ridiculous. Why work in a garden when it has already been explained that the soil produced all kinds of fruit by itself? Why did the garden have to be guarded? Father Chaine, in his commentary, concludes that the writer had a bad day and even a lapse of memory. I think, on the contrary, that this text is full of meaning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humanity is called to render a service, but one that is useless. Of course, the garden did not need to be cultivated since it was fruitful, and it did not need to be guarded since there were no external enemies. This is exactly the point: there is no necessity to work and there is no necessity to be productive. All there is, is the Word of God. God tells humanity that they are there to cultivate and keep the garden. What humanity is therefore faced with is: \u2018God says that I should do this, it serves no purpose, but I will do it.\u2019 What God says is the good. If, on the other hand, humanity begins to say, \u2018Of what use is it?\u2019 that is like the tree of knowledge of good and evil. \u2018Since the garden doesn\u2019t require cultivation, I do not need to work, and since there are no enemies, I do not need to guard it, so I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 That is the evil. This response may be morally legitimate: \u2018Since it serves no purpose, I will not do it.\u2019 But God said: \u2018Do it\u2019; and that is the trouble, to have confidence or not in the Word of God. This is the situation humanity had to face. In any case, it is clear that it is impossible to derive from these well-known texts the law of work. Work as such does not exist for humanity as a law of creation.</span>", "time": 1671995271, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21432653, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)14:09:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21432643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21432643</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That this text isn\u2019t about real work is confirmed by the use of the Hebrew word used for working the garden, namely, avoda, which means worship. In other words: \u2018You will worship God through working and guarding it, knowing very well that these actions are unnecessary; but it is simply a form of worship, and you honour and adore him by it. It is not in order to produce, but to honour in reciprocity.\u2019 All the early Jewish commentaries have strongly suggested that what this means is that God did not create humanity for nothing. He did not launch humanity into an emptiness. Humanity has a role to play. Leisure is not a life, and empty leisure is not good. This role, according to the Hebrew word avoda, is to bring the whole of the garden of Eden before God so that all of creation will adore God through this human service. When humanity serves God for nothing and without an objective, they bring the creation to worship God.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The above, I believe, is the meaning of verses 15 to 17. We begin to see where the story of good and evil comes from.

Not that I&#039;m against conservative morality, I live my life conservatively, but I want a better foundation for it that makes sense with both the OT and the NT. The problem is the fact that the NT is antinomian which makes it so easy for Christian churches to turn progressive in the name of &quot;love&quot;, especially when we try to consider the cosmological implications of the fact that some people are born attracted to the same sex. God has infinite love for these people, and yet made them the way they are. That raises the question: what is it about homosexuality (and not just the particular act of sodomy) that makes it reprehensible to all that is good? Is it all bad, or is only some of its tendencies (e.g. what we see peddled in LGBT pride parades, schools, and orgies) bad? We need better answers to this question or else we will continue to cede ground. <br><br>Here is what Ellul has to say about homosexuality in Freedom, Love, and Power, arguing that it homosexuality perverts the natural union that God created for humans to enjoy:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This brings me to the second question. When God says that \u2018it is not good,\u2019 it is the exact opposite of \u2018it is good,\u2019 which we find throughout the first creation account where everything is approved by the declaration that it is good. In other words, this is the first \u2018not good\u2019 in creation, \u2018it\u2019 being the solitude of man. Consequently, the evil is the break between man and woman; and this throughout the Bible remains absolutely fundamental. It is based on what could be considered as a kind of ontology or an overall conception of humanity. Because man does not know himself except by knowing the woman and vice versa, we can now understand why the Bible is so harsh with adultery and homosexuality \u2013 as flawed conceptions of what it is to be human. We have failed to understand this because we have made it into a simple question of morality; and once this is done we are lost, because neither morality nor nature can give us any firm guidance. In the Bible it is not a question of morality but a question of what humanity is, and this can only be discovered through the relationship isch\u2013ischah. Making a moral issue out of adultery or homosexuality continues to permit Christians to judge and condemn others, which is a double error. The text affirms monogamous relationships, which during the tenth century B.C. was highly unusual since there was not a single monogamous society in existence. Certainly the Jews were surrounded by completely polygamous societies. There is no question that this affirmation of monogamy on their part, as well as their establishment of cities of refuge, made them stand out. In the case of monogamy, the Jews were clear: it is a question of becoming human, and this complements what we have learned about humanity being in the image of God.</span>", "time": 1672066290, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436010, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:49:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435440</a><br>take that back based retard", "time": 1672073341, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436016, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:53:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431886</a><br>he was right about everything you christcuck faggot", "time": 1672073585, "resto": 21431886}, {"no": 21436021, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:55:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21436016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21436016</a><br>Who was right about everything?

Poor nutrition, xenoestrogens everywhere, secular nihilism rampant, freedom and desire worshiped to a fault, traditional gender roles undermined, masculinity under assault everywhere, etc. There&#039;s tons of trannies today who would probably have been fine if they lived a century ago, or at least would have been forced to (and maybe have been satisfied with) express themselves by lesser means like cross-dressing and thus avoid the worst of transgenderism. I feel bad for people who thought that they would finally have purpose and meaning by transitioning, only to find nothing and thus must live life coping as a Frankenstein experiment. They were duped hard, just like all of us. <br><br>Because really, if we try too hard to dig deep into what is purposeful and meaningful from a secular perspective, what will we find?

There is no instrumental use of humanity by God, so in a way it&#039;s nihilistic. The only difference between that and our secular nihilism is that the nihilism was sanctioned by God, like a playground for his children to play in as long as they remained in communion, and thus all was good. There&#039;s something kabbalistic about this kind of interpretation of the meaning of life. <br><br>I&#039;m rambling on now, but I hope that I gave some food for thought.

It&#039;s not that zoomers have no fight in them, it&#039;s that they cannot identify the sources of their discontent because they are so widely dispersed and integrated into the fabric of modern society. In some ways what zoomers face is more terrifying to me than what the silent generation faced, let&#039;s say, when they were carted off to WWI. At least the anxiety they experienced was concrete and had a definite cause: the war, the enemy. Zoomers seem to be going crazy because they cannot pinpoint what exactly is stressing them out because it is so ubiquitous as to be undetectable. So they&#039;re skittish, defenseless, on edge. <br><br>Culturally zoomers are the most destabilized generation in recent memory if not of all time. For most of history there could be a reasonable expectation that the birthing generation could transfer their way of life to the next generation relatively completely. Technological change was gradual and information reservoirs used to transmit the way of life was more manageable and controllable. These customs have been disrupted utterly. So older generations cannot guide the younger generations even if they wanted to. This leaves zoomers isolated and alienated from the cultural transmission of stabilizing traditions, customs, norms, and conventions. This would make anyone a bit crazy.<br><br>Add to this cultural disruption the cognitively damaging side effects of the new, disorderly digital culture with its declines in literacy, assaults on attention spans, and fragmentary , scattered impersonal milieus and it is not hard to understand zoomer&#039;s predicament. Many of them don&#039;t even know life without it.<br><br>To make matters of worse, the vast social experiments to which zoomers have been subjected include the covid shutdown during their pivotal years of development. With many recent college graduates shifted into a further dehumanized and alienating remote work culture where they essentially have minimal opportunties for the in-person social interactions which are fundamental to human nature. <br><br>Zoomers are also subject to personalized content feeds, which fragment and individualize the media they consume, making it hard for them to find common ground. They&#039;re used to everything being personalized for them and therefore have a difficult time conceiving of community or the common good. <br><br>More can be said.

To be clear I believe in the human powers for adaptation. What&#039;s troubling is that zoomers have been exposed to so much change across so many dimensions simultaneously, with no context or education to keep them up to pace with it. Indeed their ability to absorb this context is diminished by these technological changes even if it were up to date.<br><br>And up until now we haven&#039;t even gotten started with AI promising to possibly cause far more profound disruptions than anything that&#039;s come before. <br><br>Zoomers are cut out of time.

They are technologically encouraged to live in the present, which on its own has tremendous limitations for bearing the full psyche. And the future is a writhing mass of uncertainty and anxiety, with portents of doom and chaos being its only readable signs.<br><br>What zoomers need is some universal, collective focusing event which snaps them out of the tech induced hypnosis and allows them to find discover themselves unmediated by digital interlopings. Their problem is that their experience is too mediated, too indirect, and so they cannot connect with what&#039;s real and true to themselves. Instead they are adapted to being coupled to a digital interface which is tampering with their minds.

It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said \u2018Se\u00f1or\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019 or even \u2018Usted\u2019; everyone called everyone else \u2018Comrade\u2019 and \u2018Thou\u2019, and said \u2018Salud!\u2019 instead of \u2018Buenos dias\u2019. Tipping was forbidden by law; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and all the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the loudspeakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were no \u2018well-dressed\u2019 people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some variant of the militia uniform. All this was queer and moving.

He examined my papers with the most courteous interest, and weighed the whole matter with as much thoughtful consideration as if it had been something of vital concern to him. Waiving several Bavarian customs, for my convenience, and setting me straight in every possible direction, he was about ending the interview, when he suddenly caught sight of something which prolonged my audience with him for two of the most delightful hours which were ever owed to royal clemency. Leaving France, as I did, a day earlier than I had intended, in my haste I accidentally packed with my legal documents the proof-sheets of a paper which I had been writing for Figaro on Edgar Allan Poe. The proofs were left unnoticed with the other papers until the whole package was opened and spread out on the king&#039;s table. Until then his manner had been quiet and gentle, almost to effeminacy; but the moment he saw Poe&#039;s name he became all eagerness and animation. His magnificent eyes lit up, his lips quivered, his cheeks glowed, and his whole face was beaming and radiant.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Is it a personal account of him?&quot; he asked. &quot;Did you know Poe? Of course you did not, though: you are too young. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am. Just for a moment I thought I was in the presence of someone who had actually known that most wonderful of all writers, and who could, accordingly, tell me something definite and authentic about his inner life. To me he was the greatest man ever born, -greatest in every particular. But, like many rare gems, he was fated to have his brilliancy tarnished and marred by constant clashings and chafings against common stone. How he must have suffered under the coarse, mean indignities which the world heaped on him ! And what harsh, heartless things were said of him when death had dulled the sharpness of his trenchant pen ! You will better understand my enthusiasm when I tell you that I would sacrifice my right to my royal crown to have him on earth for a single hour, if in that hour he would unbosom to me those rare and exquisite thoughts and feelings which so manifestly were the major part of his life.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His voice softened into a low monotone-almost a wail-as he approached the end of his sentence, and his head kept settling forward until his chin rested upon his breast.

At first, because of my respect for his genius and greatness, the lightest thought of what I am going to tell you would make my cheeks bum with shame at my presumption. After a time, I would occasionally write out my fancy, only to burn it, always, as soon as finished. Eventually I confided it to two trusted and valued friends; and now, in some unaccountably strange way, moved, perhaps, by the sympathy born of our common interest in Poe, I am going to take you into my confidence in this particular, stranger though you are. What I have to say is this : I believe, for reasons which I will give you, that there is a distinct parallel between Poe&#039;s nature and mine. Do not be misled by assuming that I mean more than I have said. I but compared our natures: beyond that the parallel does not hold. Poe had both genius and greatness. I have neither. He had, also, force and strength, so much of both that he could defy the world, sensitive and shrinking as be was. That I never can do. Not that I am a coward, as the word is generally understood, because pain and death can neither shake nor terrify me. Yet any contact with the world hurts me. The same as Poe&#039;s, my nature is abnormally sensitive. Injuries wound me so deeply that I cannot resent them : they crush me, and I have no doubt that in time they will destroy me. Even the laceration my heart received from indignities which I suffered as a child are still uneffaceable. A sharp or prying glance from the eyes of a stranger, even though he be only same coarse peasant, will annoy me for hours; and a newspaper criticism occasions me endless torture and misery. The impressionable part of me seems to be as sensitive as a photographer&#039;s plate : everything with which I come in contact stamps me indelibly with its proportions. My impulses, it can be no egotism to say, are generous and kindly; yet I never, in my whole life, have done an act of charity that the recipient did not in some way make me regret it. People disappoint me; life disappoints me. I meet some man with a fine face and fine manner, and believe in the sincerity of his smile. Just as I begin to feel certain of his lasting love and fidelity, I detect him in some act of treachery, or overhear him calling me a fool, or worse.&quot;</span>", "filename": "0000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 994, "h": 558, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1672190675792840, "time": 1672190675, "md5": "T8VMVAg9meArQPycZ2+71A==", "fsize": 106031, "resto": 21442028}, {"no": 21442048, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)20:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Arising, he began to walk slowly up and down the room.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Apparently,&quot; he continued, after a brief silence, &quot;there is no place in the economy of life except for one kind of man. If one would be respected, he must be coarse, harsh, and phlegmatic. Let him be anything else, and friends and foes alike unite in declaring him eccentric. Much as I despise the gross, sensual creatures who wear the form and receive the appellation of man, I sometimes regret that I am not more like them, and, so, more at ease. They plunge into excesses with no more concern than a duck feels in plunging into a lake. With me the thought, or rather the dread, that I may some day so far forget myself as to debase and degrade myself, according to the common custom of man, is in itself sufficient cause for the most excruciating torture. When I look upon men as they average and see the perfect nonchalance with which they commit this, that, or the other abuse from which I would recoil with utter repugnance, I wonder if, after all, they are not really to be envied. My condition is as much of a puzzle to me as it possibly can be to you. Logically, there is no reason for it. My father and mother were neither abnormally sensitive nor excessively moral. So far as I am able to ascertain, they regarded things in life very much as every one else does. It was the same, I believe, with the parents of Poe. Things he has written prove to me that he felt the same disgust for whatever demoralizes that I have always felt, only he saw how the world would behave towards him if he did not seem in sanction and approve of its rottenness. I do not blame him. His way was wisest. Deceit is best in such a case, if it can only be assumed. With his sensitiveness were associated force and defiance,-two traits which I seriously lack. Perhaps, though, he could endure the world more easily than I can, because his childhood was less dreadful than mine. All through my infancy things were done which stung and wounded me. Not that I was treated more harshly than children commonly are, but because my nature was so unlike that of children in general that the things which never disturbed them were offensive to me. I soon learned that companionship meant pain, and that I could never know or feel anything like content unless I held myself aloof from every one. This, for a man, is hard enough to do; for a child it is next to impossible.</span>", "filename": "0000", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 700, "tn_w": 114, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672190915703129, "time": 1672190915, "md5": "jOnQ38ZzOlFh6OJDfePjNg==", "fsize": 72690, "resto": 21442028}, {"no": 21442058, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)20:31:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "&quot;I was forced to subject myself to the will of harsh, unfeeling teachers, and to the society of those who, scarcely more than animals themselves, accredited me with no instincts finer than their own.

For hours I would sit and dream beautiful day-dreams; and that won for me similar epithets. It is a misfortune to be organized as I am; yet I am what I am because a stronger will and power than mine made me so. In that lie my so]e solace and comfort for having lived at all. If my reading and observation have not been in the wrong direction, much of the phenomenon which is called insanity is really over-sensitiveness. It is often hinted, and sometimes openly declared, that I am a madman. Perhaps I am; but I doubt it. Insanity may be self-hiding. An insane man may be the only person on earth who is not aware of his insanity. Of course I, for such reasons, may not be able to comprehend my own mental condition, except in an exaggerated and unnatural way. But I believe myself a rational being. That, though, may be proof of my insanity. Yet I doubt if any insane person could study and analyze himself as I have done and still do. I am simply out of tune with the majority of my race. I do not enter into man&#039;s common pleasures, because they disgust me and would destroy me. Society hurts me, and I keep out of it. Women court me, and for my safety I avoid them.

Every other manifestation of goodness or power is stained by evil and weakness, no matter for how long it lasts or how high it reaches. If the source of a man&#039;s happiness is his faith in God, no human power can take his happiness away, yet not everyone that is faithful is good, since the faithful cannot harness the absolute power of God. Since no man can be all powerful, no man can be all good, unless goodness was not related to power at all. Would God be as good as he is for us if he held no power? Apparently, he did that once by incarnating in the form of his own son. Still we aknowledge that incarnation as God himself so God without power proved to us that he was still capable of being all good. If it is was possible to God to be good without power, would that work for humans too? According to Jesus, absolutely yes. According to Nietzsche, absolutely not.

It is easy to confuse order of precedence (both in time and in dependency) when you have not isolated the entities you are dealing with intellectually. As a rule of thumb, you should consider a statement problematic whenever it goes something like this: &quot;X comes from [negation of X]&quot;, as this directly violates one of the most fundamental principles of reality, which, in very simple terms, is that nothing comes from nothing, and the contrapositive that something comes from something (where these two somethings are related in their quiddity). There are at least two methods for dealing with this dilemma, however, neither of which you have admitted: Either we say that consciousness is caused by consciousness, thereby erasing the negation, or we say that consciousness is caused by something which is superior to consciousness (known as a &quot;virtual cause&quot;), in other words, &quot;supra-consciousness&quot;, in that it is not the same as consciousness (thereby is a negation of consciousness) yet possesses the power to actualize it and is superior in that it has this power, whereas consciousness itself does not. In other words, the &quot;unconscious&quot; only comes first when considered relatively, in isolation from reality as a whole. This is equivalent to a &quot;chicken-and-the-egg&quot; dilemma which cannot be resolved unless there is recourse to principles, which would clearly affirm the primacy of the chicken, at the very least in contingency.<br><br>Also, riddle me this: What is the difference between an unconscious mind and a computer, or any other mechanical contraption which performs computations?

Lol. I\u2019m not just saying that to clap back. You\u2019re playing with words and choosing the interpretation that makes the least sense. There are indeed instances where one meets resistance with irritation and not joy. In fact that\u2019s possibly most of the time. Nietzsche says it\u2019s an uncommon quality to actually relish this. He means something different in this quote.<br><br>Needless to say, you\u2019re not talking about anything resembling \u201cpower\u201d. You described it as stupid and irritating. You can curl more, that\u2019s an increase in \u201cpower\u201d on some level you could argue. But compare it to what Nietzsche means and see which makes more sense.<br><br>do you feel in control? Does your environment bend to your will? Do your words and actions leave significant impressions on the world, do people follow after you and your creations?<br><br>That\u2019s power. The capacity to make and take what you will, especially in direct or immediate ways. Nietzsche will also say that there\u2019s something distorted in the concept of withheld power or latent potential. There may be energy in tension ready to release like Heraclitus\u2019 Bow, but it isn\u2019t power until that release. Until the *effect*. I don\u2019t know how much Nietzsche commits his way of speaking about power to this sentiment (I have certain remarks from the genealogy of morals in mind here), but it should be kept in sight\u2026 Power is something that involves some sort of positive emanation, some consequence. If it doesn\u2019t emanate then it\u2019s status as \u201cpower\u201d is suspect.<br><br>As for the proof behind all this\u2026 that\u2019s elsewhere. It\u2019s a borderline naturalism, framed in some parts as a riposte against Darwinism. Contest for power as opposed to contest for survival. He goes on to say that it is the weak who tend to win this - like in Plato\u2019s Gorgias, the many, weak but colluding masses - are ultimately the stronger. The weak tend to win. They\u2019ve won history, as it stands. <br><br>Now this is probably the problem. Nietzsche spitting on something we consider important, supposing something unhealthy and cruel in its place. Endorsing selfishness and domineering over fellowship and altruism. It\u2019s subversive, maybe a bit ugly, but he will tell you in the very beginning of most of his works: He\u2019s putting these ideas, and his audience, to the test.<br> The seed of the Genealogy of Morals: \u201cwhat happens if we question the morality of compassion?\u201d<br>The seed of twilight of the idols: \u201cwhat sound will philosophy make as we hit it with a hammer [as with a tuning fork], will it ring hollow?\u201d<br><br>That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all hypothetical. He means more than enough of it. But the essence of any given argument is a step subtler than the bombastic and villainous rhetoric. He\u2019s fucking with you. Lightheartedness is what Nietzsche declares to be one his absolute operating principles.

Part of the entire point of his philosophical project is providing a new model of thought, known as the rhizome, which conceived of thinking/enacts thinking as a matrix of connections/differences (he\u2019s probably more particular about terminology), in which conceptual \u201croots\u201d (such as platonic forms) or general arborescent models of thought are negated in favor of free floating unities made by analyzing differences and similarities. Everything is connected and very few hierarchies or unilateral thought progressions are established. This is perhaps his most profound and interesting concept of all.

He had a simple explanation of when and why this surge had started. It was all because of the Protestant Reformation: &#039;Whereas thirty years ago religion was flourishing everywhere, and we were all in agreement about the common and customary worship of God, without any controversy, now ungodliness and contempt for God are breaking out on all sides.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An awkward admission for a Protestant leader to make; but Calvin could explain it. Before the Reformation the devil had kept Christendom in darkness, &#039;benumbed in conscience. The dawn of the true gospel had merely exposed the unbelief that had always been there. Calvin was forced to concede, however, that these unbelievers were not simply Catholics revealed in their true colours. They were people who had &#039;sampled the gospel, even if it were only a contemptuous nibble&#039;. Protestantism had taught them to &#039;make witty mockery of the absurdities of the papists, which in itself was a good thing, but they then proceeded to &#039;pour out the poison of their ungodliness in all directions, so that they fill the world with atheism&#039;. In particular, Calvin believed, they had drunk too deeply from one intoxicating Protestant doctrine: gospel freedom, the heady claim that Christians ought to be liberated from the laws and regulations of formal piety. A great many people&#039;, Calvin feared, were using that principle to &#039;emancipate themselves from obeying God himself.&quot;</span>", "time": 1672070466, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21435892, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)11:07:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21435874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21435874</a><br>The original Reformation was understood to be magisterial in nature, which is to say that it was understood as being national. You might consider it something similar to how the Orthodox churches function, that there was supposed to be a singular Reformed Church of England, and a singular Reformed Church of Scotland, etc. This is how the Presbyterial system is supposed to actually function, and the original Westminster Confession states that the civil leader has the right to call church councils (this has generally been removed by Presbyterian denominations in America).<br><br>Ultimately the only thing that truly keeps people in line is violence, and this is how it was done by the Roman Empire, and later by the Pope (and also in Orthodox countries by their respective governments, be they Orthodox or Islamic). As soon as that violence is removed things start to move apart. I don&#039;t think this is a good argument for state violence being a necessary component of Christian ecclesiology, though.

Here&#039;s a full quote from Basil, with the context needed to actually understand what it&#039;s about:<br><br>&quot;... we have never, even at the present time, heard of a second God. Worshipping as we do God of God, we both confess the distinction of the Persons, and at the same time abide by the Monarchy. We do not fritter away the theology in a divided plurality, because one Form, so to say, united in the invariableness of the Godhead, is beheld in God the Father, and in God the Only begotten. For the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; since such as is the latter, such is the former, and such as is the former, such is the latter; and herein is the Unity. So that according to the distinction of Persons, both are one and one, and according to the community of Nature, one. How, then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a king, and of the king&#039;s image, and not of two kings. The majesty is not cloven in two, nor the glory divided. The sovereignty and authority over us is one, and so the doxology ascribed by us is not plural but one; because the honour paid to the image passes on to the prototype. Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the other case the Son is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is dependent on the form, so in the case of the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in the communion of the Godhead. One, moreover, is the Holy Spirit, and we speak of Him singly, conjoined as He is to the one Father through the one Son, and through Himself completing the adorable and blessed Trinity. Of Him the intimate relationship to the Father and the Son is sufficiently declared by the fact of His not being ranked in the plurality of the creation, but being spoken of singly; for he is not one of many, but One. For as there is one Father and one Son, so is there one Holy Ghost. ... &quot;<br><br>https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3<wbr>203.htm", "time": 1672073863, "resto": 21435005}, {"no": 21436039, "now": "12/26/22(Mon)12:00:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Epiphanius (d. 403), Bishop of Salamis, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem<br><br>&quot;I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there.

It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was.

Even today, the icons of Orthodox Christians are not the center of worship, but the altar and the eucharist is.

Keep Classical and Modern pronunciations separate. Learning any language requires effort. Only learn one if you really want to. Getting around Greece with just English is pretty easy. And let me tell you, Greece is an amazing country to visit, except for the Gypsies. If you haven&#039;t encountered Gypsies before, you&#039;ll know why Hitler tried to exterminate them when you do. No one likes Gypsies but themselves and delusional leftists. I&#039;m not far right by 4chan standards. I just hate Gypsies. The Greeks do too. To be clear, normal, integrated, non-criminal Gypsies are fine.", "time": 1671624325, "resto": 21409393}, {"no": 21413300, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)07:07:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413233</a><br>Gerd R.

Firstly, a PhD in philosophy is already going to be a very niche affair, respective applicants will all likely be expected to be researching rather niche topics so I would suggest you pivot towards researching a niche that plays to your background in English literature. Secondly, some publications in journals relating to your niche topic and a thorough understanding of the literature will give you an advantage and is a necessary requirement for the more selective institutions. Thirdly you\u2019ll need to have prewritten your thesis, different institutions ask for different requirements, but normally it\u2019s the first 20 pages, which mainly comprises the introduction and a rough preliminary draft of everything else. Lastly, consider carefully where you want to study a PhD and if you really want to study a PhD, try to be as well acquainted with the institution and supervisors you\u2019re going to be researching under, be a face they know and see if the institution works for you, PhDs aren&#039;t career mills, they want applicants that will be lifelong contributors to the scholarly and social community they\u2019ve applied to enter, does that sound like you and is that what you want to be, if you study a PhD you\u2019ll likely be entering into a career in academia. Finally, a PhD in English Literature could be what you\u2019re after, no matter what you\u2019re studying it gets very philosophic when you\u2019re studying as a doctor of philosophy, duh, know your prospective supervisors academic background and see if your interests align, if they don&#039;t align then no matter your academic merit they probably wont understand where you\u2019re coming from, but if they do align they\u2019ll probably be very understanding of your lack of formal academic merit, especially if you have strong undergrad and postgrad grades.", "time": 1672195896, "resto": 21442167}, {"no": 21442342, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)21:58:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442319</a><br>Also, doing a PhD exposes you to a whole set of institutions and authorities particular to doing a PhD, things like university publishing houses, academic journals, online research portals, think-tanks and research institutions and a WHOLE lot of beaurocracy, you need to become familiar will ALL of this before entering into a PhD, it will give you a serious advantage and help you really excel.", "time": 1672196290, "resto": 21442167}, {"no": 21442361, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:03:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442319</a><br>do you think it&#039;s worth trying if i don&#039;t have a background in phil at all and no good letters? i just feel like it&#039;s hopeless.", "time": 1672196603, "resto": 21442167}, {"no": 21442430, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:20:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442361</a><br>if you have a real passion for it and have the requisite knowledge it\u2019s definitely possible, if it\u2019s really what you want then go all out and try your best, do everything you could possibly imagine could give you an advantage, find ways of demonstrating your proficiency above and beyond the requirements, if it\u2019s what you truly want, why not ?

In some ways the life of certain earlier periods had marked advantages over life today, but there were compensating disadvantages which would make many hesitate about a choice. Some of the most literarily attractive ages had a coarseness, stridency, &amp; squalor which we would find insupportable . . . Modern neurotics, lolling in stuffed easy chairs, merely make a myth of these old periods &amp; use them as the nuclei of escapist daydreams whose substance resembles but little the stern actualities of yesterday. That is undoubtedly the case with me\u2014only I&#039;m fully aware of it. Except in certain selected circles, I would undoubtedly find my own 18th century insufferably coarse, orthodox, arrogant, narrow, &amp; artificial. What I look back upon nostalgically is a dream-world which I invented at the age of four from picture books &amp; the Georgian hill streets of Old Providence. . . . There is something artificial &amp; hollow &amp; unconvincing about self-conscious intellectual traditionalism\u2014this being, of course, the only valid objection against it. The best sort of traditionalism is that easy-going eclectic sort which indulges in no frenzied pulmotor stunts, but courses naturally down from generation to generation; bequeathing such elements as really are sound, losing such as have lost value, &amp; adding any which new conditions may make necessary. . . . In short, young man, I have no quarrel with the principle of traditionalism as such, but I have a decided quarrel with everything that is insincere, inappropriate, &amp; disproportionate; for these qualities mean ugliness &amp; weakness in the most offensive degree. I object to the feigning of artificial moods on the part of literary moderns who cannot even begin to enter into the life &amp; feelings of the past which they claim to represent . . . If there were any reality or depth of feeling involved, the case would be different; but almost invariably the neotraditionalists are sequestered persons remote from any real contacts or experience with life . . .

People also seem to miss that Bunny is a talking piece for what the group is actually like, he just made them look bad for being upfront about it. Secondly, Bunny was the only person kind to Richard in the beginning, regardless of if he tried to take advantage of him later at the dinner, he\u2019s the only reason Richard was able to make it \u201cin\u201d to the elite group. The book would have been much different if instead of Henry finding Richard in the cold, it was Bun, I really wonder what an alternative like that would look like. Also, Bunny was the only person who reacted appropriately to the farmer. You can see him breaking down over the morality issues he\u2019s facing over knowing when he talks to Richard about it, I really don\u2019t blame him for mooching off everyone during that as 1.) he was losing it 2.) those rich assholes <s>covered up a murder[spoiler/] as if that\u2019s not justification enough he was the only one who suggested they tell authorities what they had done. I notice when I talk to other queer people of colour we share the same opinions on this, when white queer and white straight people who read this book fully back the group and defend them and turn Bun into some type of villain when he was just a foil. Frances isn\u2019t innocent either, he enabled the group. The only person I have sympathy for to an extent is Richard, because he really did not know that the fuck he was getting into it what to do. He was out of his element and had never been around a class of people like that, he was most likely more underprivileged than just being of a working class family. His dad ran a gas station and he was from Plano, he\u2019s the only character who\u2019s skin colour isn\u2019t described in detail too. I don\u2019t care if Dartt herself told me to my face he is white, it would just make him so much less if a do-nothing character to imagine he was a normal Chicano from California who got mixed up with white kids who thought money made them invincible.</s>", "time": 1672198385, "resto": 21439677}, {"no": 21443534, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)04:13:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Anyone read \u201cIf we were villains\u201d yet?

For example, a friend recently observed that in old photos at the pool, I&#039;m covering my chest when photographed. From when I was about 5, I refused to cut my hair at all, and when my mum combed my hair at one point and trimmed the ends a little bit I freaked the fuck out. I had fantasies about being transformed, sometimes into a girl, sometimes losing parts of my body and becoming a cyborg, or having my mind uploaded. I fantasized about being someone you couldn&#039;t tel the gender of. When I was in 6th or 7th grade I tried to look up a spell on the Internet to turn myself into a girl. (I was also unusually accepting of the word &quot;witch&quot; for myself, which even if it&#039;s gender-neutral in Wiccan usage is not in general English.) And a few years before that when I was 9 or so, a female friend mentioned she was having a girls-only sleepover and I offered to brew a potion and transform myself into a girl (this is something that she recalled and mentioned to me recently).

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don&#039;t like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.", "time": 1671972899, "resto": 21431659}, {"no": 21431760, "now": "12/25/22(Sun)07:56:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21431745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431745</a><br><a href=\"#p21431758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21431758</a><br>Then there is the fact that every character you meet in the story turns up again, hundreds of miles away, to reveal that they are someone else and have been secretly controlling the action of the plot. It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

I might vet female erotica harder next time, to read one focused on romance or adventure with romance, rather than this reverse harem stuff.<br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>------------------<br><br>Title: A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor<br>Author: Kathryn Moon<br>Rating: 4/10<br><br><br>[Plot]<br>The premise of the book is simple - a young and pretty maid in victorian London(?) is a wicked, lustful girl, fucking and ruting with pretty boys at every opportunity, which cost her multiple jobs. Eventually, a tall and handsome doctor with broad shoulders invites her to his office for obvious reasons, where they immediately fuck. However, in the middle of the coitus the man turns into a big monster. She doesn&#039;t mind much, which leads for her being invited to work in a Rooksgrave Manor, place where adventurous young women &#039;service&#039; monster men. <br><br>[Review]<br>This book is almost exclusively porn. Seriously, there is very little plot, if at all. Majority of it is just the main character being fucked in different positions or combination of partners. Despite how well-written the book is (on a technical level), it did raise my opinion of typical male Harem Erotica. In a typical male erotica book the protagonist has adventure, rivarly, fights for what he believes, etc. Fucking is an addition to that, the girls have to be given at least symbolic courting. In this book the protagonist is wanted and desired from the get-go.<br><br>Female sexuality is different from male, that is obvious for everyone with three brain cells. However, the protagonist in this book has no real character traits or personality aside of being a whore. Her character starts and ends with wanting to fuck handsome men, multiple at times, especially monster men. There is nothing more to say about her. Every handsome, powerful man metaphorically falls to his knees in front of her due to her being so fuckable; it&#039;s not even about beauty, I don&#039;t think the author called the protagonist beautiful or pretty even once. Still, she is extremely desired by everyone, all men care about is spoiling her and talking how her constant urge to fuck makes her special. <br><br>This might be the most radical Female Fantasy you will ever read - woman just has to exist and want to fuck, and everyone calls her queen and love of their life. Maybe it&#039;s because lately I&#039;ve taken significant amount of mental damage due to loneliness and going into the Blackpill rabbithole, but reading this book literally drained life from me. There are male equivalents of this book, but they are extremely niche.
