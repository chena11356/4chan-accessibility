Heavy-hearted Magyar, my editor calls it. She may well be right. These words rest lightly on my page, but this heaviness pressing on me is perhaps the weight of all the words I have still not written. And the heaviness pressing on me is what first urged me to write.<br>Or the heaviness pressing on me could be the weight of all the days I have still not lived. My heaviness will urge me in a little while to get up from this table and to walk to the windows; but the same heaviness will urge me afterwards to sit down again at this table. Then, if I begin to write: I walked just now to the windows and looked across my estates... my reader will learn how little I see around me, with this heaviness pressing on me. Of all the wide landscapes around my manor-house, I can never bring to mind any more than the nearest field and the long line of poplar trees on the far side of it.<br>Is that really all? Sometimes I am aware of more fields behind the first field, and of grasslands behind everything \u2013 indistinct grasslands under grey, sagging clouds. And I could repeat a sentence or two from my schooldays: Szolnok County, on the Great Alfold...I have forgotten for the moment what I once read in my schoolbook. But I remember the sweep-arm well in the first field behind the poplar trees.<br>If you, my reader, could step with me to the windows, you would notice it at once \u2013 the long pole pointing at the sky. You would notice the well-pole, but why should I? A long pole points at the sky in every view from every window in this manor-house, and in every view from every manor-house in Szolnok County. Yet again, neither you nor I might see a particular well-pole on the far side of the poplars; one of my overseers was ordered to block the well and to pull down the pole last year \u2013 or it may have been another year.<br>Now, something other than heaviness urges me to leave this table and to walk to the windows. I have to walk to the windows in order to learn whether I remembered, just now, the sight of a certain well, or whether I was dreaming.<br>But perhaps I could say without leaving this table that I only dreamed of the sight of my well. If you recall, reader, I had not left my table when I began this inquiry. I had only dreamed of myself leaving my table and then returning to my table and then trying to recall what I might have seen through my windows.

Thomas and Scalia both believe the 8th Amendment has no guarantee of proportionality, which is at odds with pretty much everyone else on the Court (other conservative justices like Alito and O&#039;conner reject their arguments; I think O&#039;Conner&#039;s plurality opinion in Ewing gives the best argument against Thomas&#039;s theory from a somewhat originalist/textualist perspective). There&#039;s about a dozen dissenting opinions where Thomas and Scalia cite each other about how the majority is constantly exceeding its authority, which are funny to read, particularly Scalia&#039;s.<br><br>Thomas actually does think proportionality exists, but is only relevant in capital cases, or (maybe) fines/bail/whippings. Also worth noting that his upper bound for what would be proportionate is something like executing a seven year old for stealing 50 dollars worth of merchandise. Maybe adjusted for inflation if he were feeling particularly generous. The gist of the argument as I understand it is that (a) the framers never used any language to indicate proportionality in sentencing, (b) the 8th Amendment was meant to protect against torture and little else, and (c) prison sentences were never really covered under the 8th Amendment since they didn&#039;t exist in 1790; only of relevance is executions, whippings, public shaming, etc. Honestly I might be somewhat incorrect here, but yes, it&#039;s exactly as insane as it sounds.<br><br>Honestly it&#039;s a mediocre argument in my opinion, since the actual text of the 8th Amendment implies proportionality in fines and bail (&quot;excessive&quot; implies proportionality), other historically relevant documents like the English Bill of Rights contain explicit proportionality guarantees, and when dealing with how cruel any punishment is the idea of proportionality is implicit.<br><br>Thomas goes over the argument in his dissent in Graham v. Florida. You can ignore everything about how unusual the punishment is (number of states, etc.) since he doesn&#039;t think the analysis the majority is using should exist at all, unless you find that debate interesting in its own right.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/f<wbr>ederal/us/560/48/</span>", "time": 1670740213, "resto": 21364471}, {"no": 21369935, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:38:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m a software engineer.

Provoked and inspired by T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that was difficult, highly stylized, and ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem, in the vein of The Waste Land, that expressed a more optimistic view of modern, urban culture than the one that he found in Eliot&#039;s work. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has been hailed by playwrights, poets, and literary critics alike (including Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold Bloom), as being one of the most influential poets of his generation.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crane was admired by artists such as Allen Tate, Eugene O&#039;Neill, Kenneth Burke, Edmund Wilson, E. E. Cummings and William Carlos Williams. Although Hart had his sharp critics, among them Marianne Moore and Ezra Pound, Moore did publish his work, as did T. S. Eliot, who, moving even further out of Pound&#039;s sphere, may have borrowed some of Crane&#039;s imagery for Four Quartets, in the beginning of East Coker, which is reminiscent of the final section of &quot;The River&quot;, from The Bridge.</span>", "filename": "Hart Crane", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 221, "h": 322, "tn_w": 85, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670703109427037, "time": 1670703109, "md5": "Pqwqlq2xvTpHphd3eEU+Lw==", "fsize": 6373, "resto": 21367451}, {"no": 21368598, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)20:17:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1670721438, "resto": 21367451}, {"no": 21368854, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)21:50:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21367451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21367451</a><br>I\u2019m not going to post it in the other poetry thread cause I wouldn\u2019t find an answer. where do I post my poetry?

The Infinite, according to the etymology of the term which designates it, is that which has no limits; and if we are to preserve this word in its strict sense we must rigorously limit its use to the designation of that which has absolutely no limits whatsoever, excluding here everything that only escapes from certain particular limiting conditions while remaining subject to other limitations by virtue of its very nature, in which these limitations are essentially inherent - as, from the logical point of view which simply translates in its fashion the point of view that can be called &quot;ontological&quot;, are those elements implicated in the very definition of the things in question. As we have already mentioned on many occasions, these latter include number, space, and time, even in the most general and extended conceptions we can possibly form of them, which far exceed our ordinary notions;* all of this can really only be in the domain of the indefinite. It is to the indefinitude, when it is of a quantitative order as in the examples just mentioned, that some people improperly apply the term &quot;mathematical infinity&quot;, as if adding a fixed epithet or qualification to the world &quot;infinity&quot; did not itself imply a contradiction pure and simple. In fact, this indefinitude, proceeding from the finite of which it is only an extension or development (and therefore always reducible to the finite), has no common measure with the true Infinite, any more than an individuality, human or otherwise, even considered in the integrality of the indefinite prolongations of which it is capable, can ever be commensurate with the total being. This formation of the indefinite from the finite, of which we have a very clear example in the production of the series of numbers, is only possible on condition that the finite already contain the indefinite potentially, and even were teh limits extended so far as to be lost sight, so to speak - that is , to the point at which they escape our ordinary means of measurement - they certainly are not abolished thereby; by reason of the very nature of the causal relation it is quite obvious that the &quot;greater&quot; cannot come from the &quot;lesser&quot;, nor the Infinite from the finite.<br><br>*It should be observed that we are careful to say &#039;general&#039; and not &#039;universal&#039;, for here it is nothing more than a question of the particular conditions of certain states of existence, which should suffice to show that there is no question of infinity since these conditions are obviously as limited as the states to which they apply, and which they help to define.", "filename": "1583125391719", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 400, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1670749001694170, "time": 1670749001, "md5": "w+tuBVXtmrMVHe9flXh6lg==", "fsize": 48900, "resto": 21355678}], "last_modified": 1670749001}, {"no": 21368933, "now": "12/10/22(Sat)22:16:30", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "This is good writing in 2022", "filename": "Fjqn_6iUoAE3XlP[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 519, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1670728590483121, "time": 1670728590, "md5": "WlZzDB1yDQVLpxSnkMGn7A==", "fsize": 163853, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-is-good-writing-in-2022", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 20, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 15, "omitted_images": 1, "last_replies": [{"no": 21369491, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)01:40:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve noticed a lot of this dissident right writing is just over the top vulgarity.

It is the cause of war and the end of peace, the basis of what is serious, and the aim of the jest, the inexhaustible source of wit, the key to all allusions, and the meaning of all mysterious hints, of all unspoken offers and all stolen glances, the daily meditation of the young, and often also of the old, the hourly thought of the unchaste, and even against their will the constantly recurring imagination of the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just because the profoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the piquant element and the joke of life that the chief concern of all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored [pg 314] as much as possible. But, in fact, we see it every moment seat itself, as the true and hereditary lord of the world, out of the fulness of its own strength, upon the ancestral throne, and looking down from thence with scornful glances, laugh at the preparations which have been made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it and wherever it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to master it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary concern of life. But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual passion is the kernel of the will to live, and consequently the concentration of all desire; therefore in the text I have called the genital organs the focus of the will. Indeed, one may say man is concrete sexual desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and his wish of wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone perpetuates and holds together his whole phenomenal existence. The will to live manifests itself indeed primarily as an effort to sustain the individual; yet this is only a step to the effort to sustain the species, and the latter endeavour must be more powerful in proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of the individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual passion is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the individual in it, and its primacy over all other desires of the natural man, are both in complete agreement with this.", "time": 1670745667, "resto": 21367712}, {"no": 21369678, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)03:08:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21367712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21367712</a><br>I set it aside after a few chapters.

They want to be liked, and will trample upon you to prevent themselves from being seen as weird.

multiplicity of the states of the being, it is necessary before considering anything else to return to the most primordial notion of all, that of metaphysical Infinity, evisaged in its relationship with universal Possibility. The Infinite, according to the etymology of the term which designates it, is that which has no limits; and if we are to preserve this word in its strict sense we must rigorously limit its use to the designation of that which has absolutely no limits whatsoever, excluding here everything that only escapes from certain particular limiting conditions while remaining subject to other limitations by virtue of its very nature, in which these limitations are essentially inherent - as, from the logical point of view which simply translates in its fashion the point of view that can be called &quot;ontological&quot;, are those elements implicated in the very definition of the things in question. As we have already mentioned on many occasions, these latter include number, space, and time, even in the most general and extended conceptions we can possibly form of them, which far exceed our ordinary notions;* all of this can really only be in the domain of the indefinite. It is to the indefinitude, when it is of a quantitative order as in the examples just mentioned, that some people improperly apply the term &quot;mathematical infinity&quot;, as if adding a fixed epithet or qualification to the world &quot;infinity&quot; did not itself imply a contradiction pure and simple. In fact, this indefinitude, proceeding from the finite of which it is only an extension or development (and therefore always reducible to the finite), has no common measure with the true Infinite, any more than an individuality, human or otherwise, even considered in the integrality of the indefinite prolongations of which it is capable, can ever be commensurate with the total being.
