I&#039;m being exposed to Strauss via Carl Schmitt&#039;s Concept of the Political. The edition I have (the common orange-covered one) has a collection of notes on Schmitt&#039;s work by Strauss, and from what I glean from the foreward and introduction of the work, as well as what I&#039;ve read up on Schmitt (and now Strauss) on SEP, people seem to regard Strauss&#039; critiques in those notes as pretty strong damning and conclusive.<br><br>To me though, his critique does not seem nearly as profound or as damaging to Schmitt&#039;s work as others apparently find it. But I don&#039;t know whether this is because I misunderstand Strauss (his notes and writings are very difficult to parse in a way that Schmitt&#039;s are not) or because of some other reason.<br><br>For example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We said that Schmitt undertakes the critique of liberalism in a liberal world; and we meant thereby that his critique of liberalism occurs in the horizon of liberalism; his unliberal tendency is restrained by the still unvanquished \u201csystematics of liberal thought.\u201d The critique introduced by Schmitt against liberalism can therefore be completed only if one succeeds in gaining a horizon beyond liberalism. In such a horizon Hobbes completed the foundation of liberalism.</span><br><br>What exactly does something not restrained by the &quot;systematics of liberal thought&quot; look like? What are those systematics? I understand Strauss is evaluating Schmitt towards his own ends, and that Strauss spent his life fascinated specifically by thinkers at the dawn of the liberal tradition (Hobbes, Machiavelli, etc), but for this to be a searching critique of Schmitt you&#039;d have to be prepared as Strauss is to discard those systematics of liberal thought, right? But that seems to me to be missing the point; Schmitt&#039;s project is much &quot;narrower&quot; in scope than Strauss&#039;, and Schmitt is not interested in formulating a brand new, to use your words, comprehensive account of the Whole, which is exactly Strauss&#039; project as I understand it right now. Am I wrong about that?<br><br>It seems to me that the analogs for what Strauss is working towards are those major traditions that were dominant before liberalism; religion.

I met him once, many years ago at a local comic con and he was so quiet and unassuming. I was young, not used to meeting celebrities at the time and so was super awkward. I wish I could go back to that day and tell myself to talk with him more. To really engage and talk Paganism, gothic literature, and more.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Slewfoot is just like Brom\u2019s other books I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s got gore, violence, injustice, beauty, love, and above all else a loyalty to the tenants of Paganism that only someone who practices could capture on the page.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This narrative is really about how we can all become devils and demons when pushed hard enough. Present enough ridiculous, scary, life threatening circumstances and anyone can lash out. Additionally humans can also be pushed to say untrue things under enough duress.

Only because our drive to survive and live is so powerful.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ending of Slewfoot is perfect and the reason I believe Brom and I must be part of the same. He exactly narrates and identifies what I have long believed; that all gods and devils are one and the same. Our ability to perceive or define them is only limited by our lack of understanding, imagination, or fake human rules (in this case those the Catholic/Christian church preach). Beautifully written, in such a way that I dare someone to tell me they are not cheering for Abitha, Slewfoot and others to preserver.</span><br>https://www.goodreads.com/review/sh<wbr>ow/4214210806?book_show_action=true<wbr>&amp;from_review_page=1<br><br>Not my cuppa.", "time": 1669318979, "resto": 21296777}], "last_modified": 1669318979}, {"no": 21293979, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)19:27:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What exactly is the Overman?

As for Leviathan, God asks, &quot;Canst thou pull him with the hook, and bind his tongue with a rope?&quot; ( Job, 40:21 ), making it evident that the force of revolt is in the tongue, while the power of Behemot, as stated in 40:11, resides in the womb.

Fascism seeks to regain a national unity by being socialist as *class collaborationists*, not *class conflictionary.* This is the point of Corporatism (no not what you&#039;re thinking that&#039;s corporatocracy) and the point of the social socialism, aka nationalism. <br><br>Definitions like this are completely absent from Marxist readings (aka dominant readings) of fascism and why its so important to read them on their own terms. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfH<wbr>GLcRz-P8&amp;t=3s", "filename": "reflections", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 488, "h": 488, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1669316830057103, "time": 1669316830, "md5": "gbFZDmRCYxpsXtNCjV9f5g==", "fsize": 36482, "resto": 21281611}, {"no": 21297137, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:11:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Isn&#039;t fascism just collectivism?", "time": 1669317082, "resto": 21281611}, {"no": 21297142, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:12:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Hobbes", "time": 1669317147, "resto": 21281611}, {"no": 21297146, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21297137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21297137</a><br>In many ways yes", "filename": "Gabriele D&#039;Annunzio and his Arditi", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 856, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 71, "tim": 1669317172330155, "time": 1669317172, "md5": "bVPKcLoNPch4Qa8ujfV91g==", "fsize": 1046342, "resto": 21281611}], "last_modified": 1669317172}, {"no": 21293620, "now": "11/23/22(Wed)17:55:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What books does one need to read in order to claim one has read French literature?", "filename": "1669231392260817", "ext": ".webm", "w": 1351, "h": 760, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1669244120014609, "time": 1669244120, "md5": "Ck9Vx5LE015rnvSBQJBSpQ==", "fsize": 3139444, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-books-does-one-need-to-read-in-order-to", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 64, "images": 4, "omitted_posts": 59, "omitted_images": 4, "last_replies": [{"no": 21296853, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)12:51:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21293620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21293620</a><br>GODDESS", "time": 1669312309, "resto": 21293620}, {"no": 21296859, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)12:53:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21293620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21293620</a><br>The 120 days of Sodom is quintessential french literature", "time": 1669312426, "resto": 21293620}, {"no": 21296942, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:15:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21296548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21296548</a><br>Women at their core are disgusting beasts, they should all be locked up.", "time": 1669313751, "resto": 21293620}, {"no": 21296995, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)13:31:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21293620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21293620</a><br>Jules Verne and Asterix", "time": 1669314693, "resto": 21293620}, {"no": 21297139, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)14:11:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21296798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21296798</a><br>Let&#039;s not act like he&#039;s KNOWN anywhere outside the realm of francophile autists such as yourself", "time": 1669317115, "resto": 21293620}], "last_modified": 1669317115}, {"no": 21296785, "now": "11/24/22(Thu)12:27:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "And behind him was a trail of death and destruction.

The explosion of the Russians will make the nations tremble; already, they have introduced the Absolute into politics. That is the challenge they fling at a humanity gnawed by doubts and to which they will not fail to administer the coup de grace. If we no longer have much soul, they have enough and to spare. Close to their origins, to that affective universe in which the mind still clings to the soil, to flesh and blood, they feel what they think; their truths, like their mistakes, are sensations, stimulants, acts. In fact, they do not think, they erupt. Still at the stage where the intelligence neither attenuates nor dissolves obsessions, they are as ignorant of the harmful effects of reflection as of those extremities of consciousness when it becomes the agent of uprootedness and anemia.

Personally don&#039;t know very much about this stuff yet, but it seems like relatively few aromatic blends feature &quot;artificial&quot; chemicals-- most of them seem to use &quot;all-natural&quot; ingredients. That said, while pipe tobacco generally seems to have way fewer additives than, say, cigarettes, there are still some you have to look out for. Aromatic or otherwise, pipe tobacco can feature propylene glycol, anti-fungal agents, and humectants, among others... some of this shit is what makes pipe sludge... and of course, sometimes the tobacco itself has been treated with insecticides. It does seem easy to figure out what is being added to which blends, and I assume that&#039;s by design. Overall, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much, but it&#039;s worth looking into.<br><br><a href=\"#p21295820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21295820</a><br><br>I think the aversion to &quot;ceremonies&quot; (ie: &quot;cultural rituals&quot;) comes as a result of the modern trend of the people practicing them being mostly boomers, obese beardbabies, and the faggots trying to corrupt them... and the additional fact that simply going outside and smoking a pipe, for instance, does not accomplish anything &quot;productive&quot; that will save our people. Will the re-embracement of these rituals save the West? Certainly not-- however, I am separately a living proof that the root of white power lay in such things as oaths, strict tradition-keeping, etc... Our cultural traditions, anachronistic though they may be, can help focus the mind and spirit towards difficult ends. It is by the honing of these elements that great accomplishments are born. If you have a dog in this fight, and smoking a pipe or whatever encourages you to do better thinking, then I&#039;d actually encourage moderate indulgence over strict abstinence...

When you&#039;re alone in bed at night thinking horny thoughts before you sleep you&#039;re not thinking about sex anymore, you&#039;re just thinking about how you wish you had someone to hold or someone to hold you back because now you KNOW what that feels like, it&#039;s not just some abstract idea, and you know how it felt to doze off in someone&#039;s arms with your head tucked under theirs while it rained outside - about that one guy who you actually like on an actually personal - interpersonal - level, and you start wondering how you can start dating someone you&#039;re already fucking without making it weird but you can&#039;t, you can&#039;t do that anon. You can&#039;t not make it weird. So you keep fucking him even though you&#039;d rather just TALK to him and he keeps LEAVING. You keep making appointments like it&#039;s a fucking prostate exam when you&#039;d rather catch a movie or something or ANYTHING else. And you start wondering about dating, but it&#039;s too late for dating, you&#039;re almost out of your 20s and you can fit a Chance XL up your arse but you can&#039;t think of a single thing to say to another human being in a conversation that takes place with clothes on because working at an abattoir doesn&#039;t make you good with animals it just gives you an eye for meat.<br><br>The only way that getting regular sex has made my life better is in the way that ticking something off your to-do list makes your life better.

That&#039;s not to say I wasn&#039;t over the moon when I lost my V-plates, of course I was - I didn&#039;t believe it would ever happen for me - but simply getting sex is never going to be enough.
