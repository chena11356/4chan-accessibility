As soon as it is no longer a matter of preserving nations, but rather of producing the strongest possible mixed European race, the Jew becomes as useful and desirable an ingredient as any other national quantity. Every nation, every man has disagreeable, even dangerous characteristics; it is cruel to demand that the Jew should be an exception. Those characteristics may even be especially dangerous and frightful in him, and perhaps the youthful Jew of the stock exchange is the most repugnant invention of the whole human race.

Or where was he?<br><br>He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life.

She seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender bare legs were delicate as a crane\u2019s and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her bosom was as a bird\u2019s, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.<br><br>She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither and thither; and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.<br><br>\u2014Heavenly God! cried Stephen\u2019s soul, in an outburst of profane joy.<br><br>He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand.

I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better.

The German does not read aloud, not for the ear, but merely with his eyes. In the process he has put his ears away in a drawer. In antiquity a man read, when he read - and that happened rarely enough - to himself aloud and in a loud voice. People were amazed if someone read quietly, and they secretly asked themselves why. With a loud voice - that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, changes in tone, and shifts in tempo which the ancient public world enjoyed. At that time the principles of writing style were the same as those for the speaking style, and these principles depended in part on the astonishing development and the sophisticated needs of the ear and larynx and in part on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. A syntactic period is, as the ancients understood it, above all a physiological totality, insofar as it is held together by a single breath. Such periods, as they manifest themselves in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling up twice and sinking down twice, all within the single breath - that&#039;s what ancient men enjoyed.10 From their own schooling they knew how to value the virtue in such periods - how rare and difficult it was to deliver them. We really have no right to the great syntactical period, we moderns, we short-winded people in every sense! These ancient people were, in fact, themselves collectively dilettantes in public speaking - and as a result connoisseurs and thus critics. Hence, they drove their speakers to the utmost limits. In a similar way in the last century, once all Italian men and women understood how to sing, among them virtuoso singing (and with that the art of melody as well) reached its high point. But in Germany (right up until very recent times, when a sort of platform eloquence started flapping its young wings timidly and crudely enough) there was really only one form of public speaking which came close to being artistic: what came from the pulpit. In Germany only the preacher understood what a syllable or what a word weighs, how a sentence strikes, leaps, falls, runs, and ends; only he had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience. For there is no shortage of reasons why it&#039;s precisely the German who rarely, and almost always too late, achieves a proficiency in speaking. It is appropriate therefore that the masterwork of German prose is the masterwork of its greatest preacher: up to this point, the Bible has been the best German book. In comparison with Luther&#039;s Bible, almost everything else is mere &quot;literature&quot; - something that did not grow in Germany and hence also did not grow and does not grow into German hearts, as the Bible has.</span>", "time": 1674538100, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565210, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;he read the story</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t have brothers karamazov told orally in a group of people</span>", "time": 1674538113, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565256, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:42:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565072</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unable to synthesize abstract thought without inserting the medium of sound</span><br>brainlet", "time": 1674538922, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565274, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)00:45:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565072</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He require simulated auditory autoprocessing</span>", "filename": "laughen2", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2544, "h": 4000, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674539146247115, "time": 1674539146, "md5": "4KjMgU9pOo3ycJUBIkQY0w==", "fsize": 391010, "resto": 21565072}, {"no": 21565356, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)01:13:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21565256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565256</a><br><a href=\"#p21565274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21565274</a><br>Oh yeah?

Now force yourself to write 250 words based on that prompt. It\u2019s one page. You aren\u2019t writing a novel in one page. It\u2019s like maybe 25-20 sentences. Now take a sheet of paper and rewrite what you types from that prompt. The act of writing will make you realize shit or god forbid you get inspiration or a great idea. You are a comedian writing jokes except it\u2019s not humor it\u2019s whatever bullshit genres you like. If you can\u2019t emulate an author you like or work within a genre, create your own genre or style. If you can\u2019t do that, maybe you need to meditate on writing or maybe consider this that you want to be a writer which is cool.

In academia Hegel seems to be on an upswing, and it&#039;s not a dramatic issue. There is a surge of analytic work with Hegel, the controversy is just about the extent to which the useful Hegel is a matter of accounting for what he really meant, extracting the usefulness, or interpreting him for analytic purposes in such a way that may not be fair to what he really meant.

That&#039;s fucking stupid, if you believe that you straight up shouldn&#039;t even be in philosophy.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, Hegel bros, let&#039;s get a thread going on valuable insights you&#039;ve had by reading Hegel.</span><br><br>1. The updated aristotelian naturalism is absolutely fascinating. I reccommend trying to score a copy of Pinkard&#039;s &quot;Hegel&#039;s Naturalism&quot;<br>2. The development of absolute spirit (esp. bearing the Jesus analogy in mind), and the theory of freedom, are beautiful concepts that are worth getting to know<br>3. The refutation of materialism is strong<br><br>The bottom line of Hegel is frustratingly elusive. &quot;Absolute Idealism&quot; is a bit of a misleading title, it&#039;s more than possible he&#039;s still in the Kantian framework where all these statements about how things are are really just speaking of what they are for us and how it&#039;s incoherent to speak any further than that. He&#039;s not saying stuff is made of ideas, and the best reading to put your money on, imo, is NOT reading &quot;absolute spirit&quot; as actually being a cosmic entity. He&#039;ll call it God... But it&#039;s &quot;God&quot; qua &quot;what God means to us as a concept&quot;. He&#039;s big into looking at religion as a bunch of philosophical intuitions presented with artistic liberties. &quot;Yeah Jesus is real... As a model for advancing consciousness&quot;. The cosmic reading is dying as far as I can tell. But this may just be some anglo bullshit, I&#039;m not even into analytic philosophy but it may be winning this round. People who argue for the cosmic reading appeal to a lot of religious-sounding rhetoric from Hegel but it never explicitly defies from that secular &quot;post Kantian&quot; account, it looks more like crowd pleasing - after all, it was not a safe time to be irreligious. Hegel was a little religious, but ultimately this does not look like a cosmic philosophy, he just kinda-sorta dresses it as such when he&#039;s addressing the audience that wants to hear that. God and divinity and all that are all radically reinterpreted for a philosophical content that involves nothing mythological whatsoever. /end rant", "filename": "cresva1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 593, "h": 540, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 113, "tim": 1674527819263490, "time": 1674527819, "md5": "O7fVjoE2gdwtS85Qt0SLmQ==", "fsize": 58937, "resto": 21561568}, {"no": 21564653, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)21:38:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21561594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21561594</a><br>Look into Hegel and Hermeticism - he doodled astrologically all over his work, it seems that he was.

When I went, I was just forced to regurgitate the politicised criticism of my professors&#039; choosing, ranging so diversely from one progressive liberal position to the next! I actually had to read on my own after I graduated to even get a semblance of education, sadly, but that is entirely due to my department; other universities are probably fantastic.

But you&#039;re right that readership has plummeted relative to people who call themselves writers, which is just the sad state of self-publishing and a culture of &quot;everyone can be a multi-millionaire like Stephen King.&quot; I don&#039;t think the majority of writers even care about writing at this point; it&#039;s just a desire to be published and read, not a desire to write back to the masters before you.<br>I probably posted those masters&#039; stories out of frustration because people will tell you something is &quot;grammatically incorrect&quot; because their high school teacher told them some bullshit rule of thumb like &quot;don&#039;t start a sentence with and,&quot; or &quot;no connectives after a semi-colon,&quot; which shows neither those teachers nor those students read very widely. If I try to even vary sentence structure, people will try to make it the most bare bones linear sentence ever, for the whole story. It&#039;s like they need the entirety of the story to line up in a &quot;X then Y then Z&quot; fashion.

A nice long paragraph with a logical beginning and end, with branches of thought that flesh out the character or the setting in-between, all of which lead naturally to the next paragraph, demonstrates, to me, that the writer is capable of an exploration of themes and emotions in a more complex way than a writer who lacks long paragraphs. When I look at a new book, and just by flicking through I can see that there are essentially no long paragraphs, with all the paragraphs taking up no more than five lines in an already large font, I feel doubtful about how good the book can be. It makes the impression that the writer never stops to explore something on a deeper level. I think practicing writing good long paragraphs about certain things is worthwhile.<br>Related to this, I absolutely hate those dramatic short one line sentences. I don&#039;t really know how to describe them. They seem like a cheap way of making something dramatic or building tension. Recently I read the first chapter of Fight Club, and these dramatic short sentences are used so egregiously that I decided I didn&#039;t want to continue the book (I knew the story anyway).

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. <br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. Nothing but the codified New England berms on Janice lane. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle. He could hold onto her large ears as she bound o&#039;er hill and river. Behold! Ptolemist! That which lies under brow unbeaten. Massing with the stones and the leaves.

She wore a polished stone threaded on a thin silver chain and certain movements made it knock against her sternum. The knock rang through the other sounds. When I first saw her I thought, If I grip you hard you&#039;ll bruise violet. I tried but she had no give at all. My fingertips ached for two days after that.<br><br>The context in which we first started talking was the network of paths that ran between the buildings on campus. The paths were lit at night by solar-powered lamps studded in the soil. The lamps were spaced too far, so the paths were more dark than not. They covered miles in total and she knew them well. She must have walked them alone many times. But she devised false shortcuts, and selected the moment, below an unmarked breezeblock building or on the far edge of the artificial lake, to turn to me and say, I believe we&#039;re lost.<br><br>After university we lived together off campus and getting lost was harder. So we found online a place you could rent for a weekend. The woman who owned it was called Greta and she gave us a code for the gate. I repeated the code in my head while we stopped for petrol, while we waited for sheep to clear the road, while she found a stone wall to pee behind.<br><br>But when it came to punching it in the buttons felt like loose teeth. Eventually Greta was there with a flashlight, her face behind the bars of the gate. Chunky pearls gripped the flab of her neck. She owned the land right up to the oaks it was now too dark to see. She unlocked and said, Is your friend arriving later? I turned round and my girlfriend wasn&#039;t there.<br><br>She showed up ten minutes later, wet, when Greta was explaining the rug to me. Above us was the high space of black timber and we stood in the middle of the rug&#039;s vegetal pattern. Beyond the rug my dripping girlfriend darkened flagstones. She grinned too wide and said, So warm in here! When Greta was facing the wine fridge, my girlfriend put a wet hand on the back of my neck and her mouth close to my ear and said, I&#039;ve made a discovery.<br><br>[Unfinished.

Masturbation is something that constantly keeps me stuck in a state of addiction. It&#039;s always been a cycle for me that consists of abstinence \u2014&gt; relapse \u2013&gt; indulgence. The only real difference is that my period of abstinence might range from 2 days to 10 days, but I inevitably end up relapsing and starting the cycle all over again. <br><br>I&#039;ve always believed I was a pervert or rapist of some kind who does not have any degree of self-control because of the fact that I&#039;ve never been in control of my sexual activity. I only indulge when my temptations take me over completely, which almost feels like being possessed by a devil. On the other hand, I&#039;ve met people who have told me that their experience with masturbation was similar to mine, and that masturbation is something you&#039;re not supposed to ever be able to quit. What can be surmised is that my cyclical experience with masturbation is not something that&#039;s unique and is actually universal. <br><br>The truth is that I&#039;ve never been able to relate to the general mainstream conversation around masturbation. On one side there are hardcore religious fundamentalists who call you a biological abomination for indulging in so-called self-abuse. I always believed this was a ridiculous and over the top reaction, because I&#039;ve always had pity for people who just like me try to stop masturbating and get caught up in the cycle. On the other side, there are people part of the sexual liberation movement who consider the sex drive to be innocent and fundamentally a force for good. This is also frankly not something I can relate to, because my sexual feelings have always been monstrously powerful and my fantasies are things that I should never act on. <br><br>The comedian Louis CK has a bit where he talks about walking into a library and seeing a pretty girl, and even though he wants to feel like a normal person, seeing her immediately invokes a lot of intrusive thoughts in his mind that he simply cannot ever say out loud.

According to him, virtue is the golden mean between having the excess and deficiency of a particular trait. For example, an excess of the trait of modesty can make you shy and withdrawn, whereas too little of it can make you irritating and boastful. He extends this same argument to the trait of abstinence. Too much of it becomes ascetism (the same thing you advocate for is to him a negative trait), too little of it makes you addictive. The golden mean, according to him, is being &quot;temperate&quot;, which to him is a virtue.

Magic can and does influence the profane, unbeknownst to them. However, not all that are profane are prone to its influence.

The children in the audience, at the end of the trick, applaud at the miracle they just seen before them. The parents know, even if they can&#039;t explain, that the trick isn&#039;t real; they saw it happen, but don&#039;t understand how. Some might even get frustrated, even envious, of the prowess demonstrated. The parents will probably clap as well, although some will not be convinced to do so as they know it is &quot;only a trick&quot;, not real magic. In the crowd present there is also some magic connoisseurs and apprentices. After seeing the trick, they applaud more fervently than either children or their parents. This because, even tho they know how the trick was employed, they saw the mastery behind it. The perfect movement. Had they not known the trick before, they&#039;d have been tricked themselves. The connoisseurs might be content in their knowledge without the need to practice it and the apprentices might be inspired to perfect their own movements.

It is important, therefore, before trying to contact magic, to prepare the mind. <br>In case (1), the profane might be too attached to the concrete world to see past its illusions or has not had the correct preparation in order to do so. To resolve this, he must open is mind to the unknown and come to terms that he does not indeed possess all there is to know.<br>In case (2), he becomes overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge present in the material world and by the amount he still as no suspicion of. This can be cured by letting go, by going with the flow. Not all pieces of a puzzle are necessary to understand the whole picture. It is important, however, choose which parts of the puzzle to resolve first in order to take the first glimpses at the image.<br>In case (3), the profane after gaining a small glimpse into the symbols becomes convicted that he has seen the whole picture, leading to false assumptions.

Conyo on the east, Kon-Cha on the west. Both civilizations have an army of a comparable size, therefore, one can\u2019t conquer the other. Both cultures claim they were the origin of the other but no historian knows which one came first. Conyo people prefer to be hairless and cleaner while Kon-Cha people prefer to proudly sport their hairy nature and don\u2019t shower too much. Both have negative stereotypes about each other for this and other reasons.<br><br>Conyo people love Pollas, their capital, and treat it as a sacred city because it\u2019s home to their priest caste known as the Pajas and the nun caste known as the Manwellas (both equally respected), while Kon-Cha people don\u2019t think too much of their capital city, Ver-Gas, as it\u2019s the same size as many other cities in the land (such as Shu-Pas on the south and Shu-Pas-Mas on the southwest) and it\u2019s full of criminals and sorcerers. One could even say that the average Kon-Cha person dislikes Ver-Gas.<br><br>When it comes to religion both follow the faith of the Great Palo (spelt \u201cPallo\u201d in modern Conyo culture), a male creator god, but each focuses on different aspects of the deity. Conyo people have erected a giant obelisk right in the center of Pollas in honor of the Great Palo and the Manwellas are expected to worship the monument every night while the Pajas pray in solitude. Kon-Cha people dislike to represent the deity in physical form and prefer to worship the manifestation of the deity in nature such as the massive river Lefa whose waters hydrate all the Kon-Cha people, as well as the volcano Shin-Gas and the mountain Atuma-Tre.<br><br>They also share a language known as Kakah (spelt Kah-Kah in Kon-Cha culture) which means \u201csubstance that comes from the mouth\u201d or \u201cthe word\u201d. All their literature and philosophy is written in a variant of the language known as literary Kakah (Kakah melala) which differs from oral Kakah and is considered more rigorous and hard. A common farewell in Kon-Cha culture is Ololoy pololoy mir Palo shamel which means \u201cMay the Great Palo bless your face, [sibling]\u201d while people from Conyo prefer Ufafa ma Palo (\u201cAll Hail Palo\u201d) or Fafa ma mir Palo (\u201cHail the Great Palo\u201d).<br><br>The monarch in Kon-Cha culture is known as the Mam-Ah Palo which can be translated as \u201cmajor servant of Palo\u201d or \u201cfirst servant of Palo\u201d while Conyo monarchs are simply called kings (&quot;Yalos-walos&quot;) or queens (&quot;Pan Oshas&quot;).<br><br>These are just the first steps but I will be adding more details to the world.

Around the Belle \u00c9poque, the quality of lit overall just dropped. How many classics from this period really exist? <br><br>Anyway, here are some things about 19th c. authors that may be relevant:<br><br>- Authors live more interesting lives, they tour Europe, fight in wars, get sent to gulag, have affairs, etc. which gives plenty to draw upon for literature<br>- Aristocracy &amp; aristocratic upbringings still exist (but are on the way out)<br>- Study of the classics is in sharp decline, French replaces latin as the lingua franca but overall intellectuals write in their native tongue<br>- Because educated men write in their native tongue, their audience expands, which means...<br>- ...You can earn a living as an author (!), this is huge - Dostoevsky didn&#039;t even sell very much but he largely lived off his novel income from what I recall<br>- Reversion from Latin to local languages inadvertently spurs local literature scenes centered in cities, London, Paris, St. Petersburg being the major ones<br>- Each city&#039;s scene more or less evolves independently of the others, London is highly focused on English societal problems while French lit is more expansive in scope, Russian lit is very Christian, etc.<br>- Universities are still full of charlatans (according to Schopenhauer), but not yet the soulless profit driven activist-filled hellholes they are today<br><br>My best guess, it happened because France, England, Russia, etc. had a massive # of newly-literate people who desired any book they could get their hands on.

He said these changes were so deep and so profound that it was hard to really see them. When he tried to distill this down into a phrase, he explained that \u201cthe medium is the message.\u201d What he meant, I think, was that when a new technology comes along, you think of it as like a pipe\u2014somebody pours in information at one end, and you receive it unfiltered at the other. But it\u2019s not like that. Every time a new medium comes along\u2014whether it\u2019s the invention of the printed book, or TV, or Twitter\u2014and you start to use it, it\u2019s like you are putting on a new kind of goggles, with their own special colors and lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see things differently.<br><br>So (for example) when you start to watch television, before you absorb the message of any particular TV show\u2014whether it\u2019s Wheel of Fortune or The Wire\u2014you start to see the world as being shaped like television itself. That\u2019s why McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes along\u2014a new way for humans to communicate\u2014it has buried in it a message. It is gently guiding us to see the world according to a new set of codes. The way information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is fast; that it\u2019s about surfaces and appearances; that everything in the world is happening all at once.<br><br>This made me wonder what the message is that we absorb from social media, and how it compares to the message that we absorb from printed books. I thought first of Twitter. When you log in to that site\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Bubba the Love Sponge\u2014you are absorbing a message through that medium and sending it out to your followers. What is that message? First: you shouldn\u2019t focus on any one thing for long. The world can and should be understood in short, simple statements of 280 characters. Second: the world should be interpreted and confidently understood very quickly. Third: what matters most is whether people immediately agree with and applaud your short, simple, speedy statements. A successful statement is one that lots of people immediately applaud; an unsuccessful statement is one that people immediately ignore or condemn. When you tweet, before you say anything else, you are saying that at some level you agree with these three premises. You are putting on those goggles and seeing the world through them.", "filename": "stolen focus", "ext": ".png", "w": 1059, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 165, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674423068127167, "time": 1674423068, "md5": "znkpH4VxNwJyVe+7EFFD6g==", "fsize": 999783, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-like-the-person-i-become-when-i-read-a-lot-of", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 124, "images": 13, "unique_ips": 40}, {"no": 21559160, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:32:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559152</a><br>How about Facebook? What\u2019s the message in that medium? It seems to be first: your life exists to be displayed to other people, and you should be aiming every day to show your friends edited highlights of your life. Second: what matters is whether people immediately like these edited and carefully selected highlights that you spend your life crafting. Third: somebody is your \u201cfriend\u201d if you regularly look at their edited highlight reels, and they look at yours\u2014this is what friendship means.<br><br>How about Instagram? First: what matters is how you look on the outside. Second: what matters is how you look on the outside. Third: what matters is how you look on the outside. Fourth: what matters is whether people like how you look on the outside. (I don\u2019t mean this glibly or sarcastically; that really is the message the site offers.)<br><br>I realized one of the key reasons why social media makes me feel so out of joint with the world, and with myself. I think all of these ideas\u2014the messages implicit in these mediums\u2014are wrong. Let\u2019s think about Twitter. In fact, the world is complex. To reflect that honestly, you usually need to focus on one thing for a significant amount of time, and you need space to speak at length. Very few things worth saying can be explained in 280 characters. If your response to an idea is immediate, unless you have built up years of expertise on the broader topic, it\u2019s most likely going to be shallow and uninteresting. Whether people immediately agree with you is no marker of whether what you are saying is true or right\u2014you have to think for yourself. Reality can only be understood sensibly by adopting the opposite messages to Twitter. The world is complex and requires steady focus to be understood; it needs to be thought about and comprehended slowly; and most important truths will be unpopular when they are first articulated. I realized that the times in my own life when I\u2019ve been most successful on Twitter\u2014in terms of followers and retweets\u2014are the times when I have been least useful as a human being: when I\u2019ve been attention-deprived, simplistic, vituperative. Of course there are occasional nuggets of insight on the site\u2014but if this becomes your dominant mode of absorbing information, I believe the quality of your thinking will rapidly degrade.", "time": 1674423148, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21559164, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)16:33:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559160</a><br>The same goes for Instagram. I like looking at pretty people, like everyone else. But to think that life is primarily about these surfaces\u2014getting approval for your six-pack or how you look in a bikini\u2014is a recipe for unhappiness. And the same goes for a lot of how we interact on Facebook too. It\u2019s not friendship to pore jealously over another person\u2019s photos and boasts and complaints, and to expect them to do the same for you. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much the opposite of friendship. Being friends is about looking into each other\u2019s eyes, doing things together in the world, an endless exchange of gut laughs and bear hugs, joy and grief and dancing. These are all the things Facebook will often drain from you by dominating your time with hollow parodies of friendship.<br><br>After thinking all this, I would return to the printed books I was piling up against the wall of my beach house. What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.<br><br>I realized that I agree with the messages in the medium of the book. I think they are true. I think they encourage the best parts of human nature\u2014that a life with lots of episodes of deep focus is a good life. It is why reading books nourishes me. And I don\u2019t agree with the messages in the medium of social media. I think they primarily feed the uglier and shallower parts of my nature. It is why spending time on these sites\u2014even when, by the rules of the game, I am doing well, gaining likes and followers\u2014leaves me feeling drained and unhappy.

Self Help is bad because it exploits the suffering of others. There is often wisdom in it, and the author may genuinely be interested and wish to help, but the form of the industry, the flashy titles, blurbs, the insane promises they make, they all serve to draw in desperate people in order to raise their own power, generally. It is a business, like 10 minute Youtube videos padded out to waste your time. A book needs 200 pages and a flashy cover and some celebrity blurbs about how it will change your life. And it needs to sell enough to buy the author a beach house. And they need to make you think you can change your life nice and easily and quickly without hard work and suffering.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the three-step formula it uses to advance its claims is one that is widely used in the popular self-help movement: first, human failure and unhappiness are reduced to one simple cause; second, simple digestible solutions are offered for solving the problem at hand; and third, seductive promises are made as to what faithfully following these solutions will bring. Many books which use this formula are often couched in a literary style designed to sell and impress \u2013 one that tends to favour catchy titles and bullet points which summarise the redemptive path.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is also a marked tendency to evade the contradictions that these books can sometimes contain, for example, that significant insight and lasting change can be attained with little effort; that uncritically following the dictates of a book is compatible with independence of thought and critical reflection; that reading a book to attain social success and material wealth is consistent with liberation from egocentricity; that one can feel better and become better without undergoing any deep personality change or without changing certain oppressive social circumstances; that one may have a \u2018life of detachment\u2019 while reading a book which motivates its readers with promises of increased wealth and status; that a \u2018life of infinite advancement\u2019 can be achieved for those who possess few resources, and only limited access to social care and education. In short, the formula commonly used in many self-help regimes is designed for people whose lives (unfortunately) leave them with little time to think, for people who therefore wish to be told what to do, and for those who desire immediate results without expending too much effort to attain them.</span><br><br>--The Importance of Suffering by James Davies", "time": 1674438493, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560217, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:51:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes a thread on /lit/ about reading more</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REEEEEE I WANT TO CONSOOM ELECTRONICS INSTEAD</span>", "filename": "1645845544572", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 944, "h": 960, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674438668987524, "time": 1674438668, "md5": "3PAo2CrW2Peh8URlCuHlug==", "fsize": 86778, "resto": 21559152}, {"no": 21560222, "now": "01/22/23(Sun)20:52:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21559718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21559718</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entertainment technology is a net negative for mankind.</span><br><br>Entertainment is a positive IF you are already a whole and complete person with the right mindset.

For Calvinism the best place to start is the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms. Start with the Shorter Catechism, then Larger, and finally the Confession of Faith. These documents were drawn up in the 1640s by the English Puritans at the Westminster Assembly and will help give you the foundation necessary for understanding Calvinist literature and sermons. <br><br>For a more Continental introduction to Calvinist theology you could read the Heidelberg Catechism, the Belgic Confession, and the Canons of Dort. These documents are known collectively as the Three Forms of Unity.", "filename": "785AA335-04B8-4FF9-8D85-C31F982B0A87", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3638, "h": 2045, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674619283166453, "time": 1674619283, "md5": "mbJEhGsS0tJqQzZL9zSZ8w==", "fsize": 1869902, "resto": 21569409}, {"no": 21569656, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)23:29:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21569537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21569537</a><br>Thank you very much, anon.", "time": 1674620941, "resto": 21569409}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21532622, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:53:44", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Abberation in the Heartland of the Real", "com": "Holy shit.", "filename": "Aberration in the Heartland of the Real", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1794, "tn_w": 167, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673855624804234, "time": 1673855624, "md5": "3uUtbRFw12vTgG4SmlZc5A==", "fsize": 334021, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "abberation-in-the-heartland-of-the-real", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 218, "images": 43, "unique_ips": 66}, {"no": 21532695, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:37:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21532622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532622</a><br>shame on you for not actually saying anything about the book, OP.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away.

But make no mistake. This &#039;studying&#039; cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who &#039;feel for the people.&#039; In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all instinct, are capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own amazement, the result of their social &#039;efforts&#039; is always nil, frequently, in fact, an indignant rebuff, though this, of course, is passed off as a proof of the people&#039;s ingratitude.<br><br>Such minds are most reluctant to realize that social endeavor has nothing in common with this sort of thing; that above all it can raise no claim to gratitude, since its function is not to distribute favors but to restore rights.<br><br>I was preserved from studying the social question in such a way.

Later SS works clearly translated this in 4 so called life laws which made up the &#039;&#039;racist worldview&#039;&#039; which is more accurately called a natural worldview since it is largely based on biological concepts.

I strongly believe that Latin should be taught with medieval and early modern texts that actually interest the student and not with classical texts which are much more difficult. Some 2nd millennium texts are just as difficult as classical ones, like Saxo Grammaticus or certain Renaissance authors trying to resurrect pristine Latinitas. But a lot of early modern Latin is rough and ready, utilitarian, repetitive, etc., which is perfect for reading. Furthermore, if the text actually interests you, like you feel a little frisson at the fact that you&#039;re reading one of your favorite authors in the original Latin and being a patrician, you gain a 1000% boost to motivation and retention. <br><br>That&#039;s why I don&#039;t really like graded readers. It&#039;s just more work. It creates a mindset that one &quot;does X,&quot; where X is the textbook, or readers, until one is ready to &quot;do real Latin.&quot; But it&#039;s always real Latin, you&#039;re just reading it more slowly at first. I&#039;d rather slowly read Swedenborg than read a graded reader of Terrence I don&#039;t give a fuck about at medium speed because it&#039;s better laid out. <br><br>The only problem with this approach is that few people have the general historical/cultural knowledge to find 17th century early modern texts interesting or think of one to read off the top of their head. But if you have that knowledge then the world is your oyster. In the long run you will obviously want to read classical texts, since you don&#039;t want to be that medievalist or early modernist who can&#039;t read classical and get mogged. But your early reading can be basically anything you actually enjoy. Lots of people use the Vulgate. I&#039;ve started learning multiple languages by reading the Bible in them (not always a good idea, not all are as perspicuous as the Vulgate).<br><br>But if you mean doing it without any grammar knowledge whatsoever, you won&#039;t have much luck because Latin is a highly inflected language. You can&#039;t really even infer the basic senses of the utterly ubiquitous (especially in some authors) ablative just by reading - for example, is this an ablative of comparison or respect? How do you know if you don&#039;t even know what an ablative is? It gets much worse when you realize that as with any language, real Latin is not just this &quot;base&quot; layer of core grammar/syntax items like ablative absolutes and ablatives of respect, but several more layers of idiomatic quasi-morphemes above that, things that have taken on grammatical load-bearing functions from centuries of use despite technically being idioms or turns of phrase, and which no textbook can really teach you. You just have to experience them in the wild, look them up/take them apart, have the &quot;ohhh, that kind of makes sense&quot; moment and slowly absorb a working repertoire of them. And you can only do that once you have the base layer of grammar down pat to a reasonable degree.", "time": 1674505097, "resto": 21553731}, {"no": 21563178, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:19:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563173</a><br>I say a reasonable degree because the whole point of contention in these threads is what a reasonable degree is. Can you start &quot;reading real Latin&quot; &quot;without grammar&quot; right away, using some kind of radical immersion method? No, not really. Do you need to memorize grammar and stick with your textbook and graded readers for two years before you&#039;re allowed to just pick up an early modern text and give it a shot? No, in fact, you should pick up an early modern text (or anything that interests you, the key word being YOU) on your first week or day of Latin, or right now before even beginning to study Latin just to see what it looks and feels like. Anything that gives you motivation is good. But you have to find the right balance, for you, between learning things schematically and applying them in the wild. <br><br>In my opinion the best way to do that would be to steamroll the first 5-15 chapters of any standard Latin book, just so that you know what the present, passive, and ablative are, you at least know where to look up conjugations and declensions and you have some general sense of what you should ultimately be able to recognize and reproduce without looking it up (even if you don&#039;t at this point), etc. There&#039;s a point of diminishing returns that sets in after this initial knowledge. It&#039;s roughly the point where you go from intuitively understanding things, which makes them easy to learn, to the thought &quot;fuck, I have to memorize all THIS?&quot; At that point, you should take a breather and realize that yes there is going to be plenty of hard work ahead, but also you can take a break from the hard work and go read whatever you want, any time you want. The point is, find your personal diminishing returns moment, and then figure out what your personal ideal dialectic of &quot;fun actual reading, doesn&#039;t feel like work&quot; vs. &quot;I probably should do a chapter of the textbook per day/week.&quot; <br><br>I&#039;ve known people on both extremes of the spectrum between reading and drilling, and each extreme has its pros and cons. People who read too much can be bullshitting themselves that they&#039;re really learning anything, and waste years fiddling around in texts but never getting serious, thus never learning anything. But conversely people who do nothing but drill grammar and ace exams and classes often forget everything a few years later when they&#039;re no longer being forced to study it for exams. This goes for any language, I know many Sanskritists and classicists who have forgotten nearly everything because they never did really read it for fun.", "time": 1674505158, "resto": 21553731}, {"no": 21563181, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:20:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563178</a><br>I also know people who learned Latin extremely well by just immersing themselves in texts they barely understood because they loved it. They failed miserably to understand anything for a very long time, but simply didn&#039;t mind. 5% of the time they would go drag their balls through broken glass by consulting the grammar or textbook. Somehow this worked for them. Likewise I knew autistic Hebraists who couldn&#039;t fathom reading a single line of Hebrew until they had turned their brain into a universal Hebrew translator via perfect knowledge of grammar and thousands of hours of flashcards. Both of these methods would make me want to kill myself although personally I tend more toward the autistic Hebraist side of things, since Indo-European grammar becomes so reflexive after a while that it becomes like knowing pure mathematics and seeing everything else (economics, physics, engineering) as mere applied mathematics. <br><br>tldr, You can absolutely do that, but consider finding your 80/20 point or point of diminishing returns or however you want to conceive it, by doing at least some of a Latin textbook first. <br><br>Also, what you are proposing is perfectly possible PROVIDED you already know Indo-European grammar, which most people first achieve THROUGH learning Latin. Thus for example there are many stories of nineteenth and early twentieth century scholars simply taking a Persian or Sanskrit text off the shelf at the library, whatever was available to them, and having some barebones grammar (not a text for learners but a philologist&#039;s grammar) and a dictionary, and then painstakingly translating until they made headway. But again, the reason they could do this is because they didn&#039;t have to spend a thousand years wrestling with the grammar to understand what an ablative was. They could just look for the ablative analogues in Sanskrit, using Latin grammar as a skeleton key. Theoretically if you already had decent knowledge of another highly inflected classical language, say, Sanskrit or Greek, or grammar in general for some reason, you could do the same with Latin and just start reading with a textbook and a general grammar.", "time": 1674505219, "resto": 21553731}, {"no": 21563234, "now": "01/23/23(Mon)15:37:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21563173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21563173</a><br>I think Augustine is a good option for this strategy.
