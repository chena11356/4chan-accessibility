As to your question, you&#039;re exhibiting a fatalistic mindset.

Radical anti-natalism as a recipe for human extinction will fail because any predisposition to share that bias will be weeded out of the population. Radical anti-natalist ethics is self-defeating: there will always be selection pressure against its practitioners. Complications aside, any predisposition not to have children or to adopt is genetically maladaptive. On a personal level, the decision not to bring more suffering into the world and forgo having children is morally admirable. But voluntary childlessness or adoption is not a global solution to the problem of suffering. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet how should rational moral agents behave if - hypothetically - some variant of Benatar&#039;s diagnosis as distinct from policy prescription was correct? </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In an era of biotechnology and unnatural selection, an alternative to anti-natalism is the world-wide adoption of genetically preprogrammed well-being. For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness.</span>", "filename": "Can Biotechnology Abolish Suffering?", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 314, "h": 500, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674806176420654, "time": 1674806176, "md5": "7IV6DBZFsJMa3RP/vSo0SA==", "fsize": 32987, "resto": 21577872}, {"no": 21578025, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)02:59:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21577878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21577878</a><br>This but unironically.

People have brain damage and become different people because certain parts of the brain are injured or destroyed--however, plenty of people who experience memory disorders don&#039;t fundementally change in character.

In Acts Chapter 8, the disciple Philip meets an Ethiopian eunuch (a black man) sitting in a chariot, to whom he explains a passage from the Book of Isaiah, and then converts him to Christianity.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dick further notes that eight years after writing the book, he himself uncharacteristically came to the aid of a black stranger who had run out of gas. After giving the man some money and then driving away, he returned to help the man reach a gas station. Dick was then struck by the similarity between this incident and that described in his book.</span><br><br>Taverner\u2019s dream scene was also inspired by his own dream. He also claims it prophetically, and unbeknownst to him at the time, prefigured the United States becoming a totalitarian police state.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dick also recounts an unusual dream he had when writing the book, and how he felt compelled to get it into the text of the novel.[7][8] Years later, he came to interpret this dream as the key to understanding the real meaning of the story, stating:</span><br><br>Deciphered, my novel tells a quite different story from the surface story (\u2026). The real story is simply this: the return of Christ, now king rather than suffering servant. Judge rather than victim of unfair judgment. Everything is reversed. The core message of my novel, without my knowing it, was a warning to the powerful: You will shortly be judged and condemned.<br><br>Reading Dick\u2019s works as a young man, including VALIS and passages of his Exegesis (a monumental and monolithic tome) actually inspired me to become a Phildickian Gnostic Christian.

Its right in front of all our faces yet it takes a drug like mushrooms to make you actually see it. <br>The reason it sounds so boring or obvious to state that this system is so bad, is because everyone around you is asleep. Their eyes are open, but they are not awake. They exist in a dreamy haze of man made society, living for artificial dopamine hits, and many of them are impossible to wake up. The NPC meme is not far from the truth, and like in that movie the Matrix, many of them will become hostile and fight you when you expose to them just how big of a lie this society is. To the NPC, exposing the lie of society shows them that their identity is fake, and that they have done their whole life wrong.

He considers them surrogate activities because they are meaningless filler to detract from the, in his eyes, horror of not being capable of fulfilling the power process in a &quot;natural&quot; way - i.e., to the best of my interpretative abilities, sheer, primitive survival - the only end worth pursuing for Ted.<br><br>This is fatal for his thought. He is stuck in the means-ends reasoning of modernity. Reading rigorous philosophical analyses of technological encroachment, such as those by Adorno (or Heidegger who says much the same thing, if you have retarded gripes about Adorno), I think it is very convincingly demonstrated that the problem with technology is the way it colonizes minds to only accept means-ends reasoning, without ever reflecting on what ends are chosen, or whether there might be such a thing as an end-in-itself (by the way, this is the exact reason why the caricature of a STEM bugman cannot appreciate art - he is incapable of seeing art as an end-in-itself).", "time": 1674904440, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582414</a><br>2/2<br>This is the true danger of technology, and Kazcynski does not escape it - he REITERATES IT, but in an even more radical way.

I&#039;m going to point out the three most glaring issues and differences, and the reason that although Kaczynski was initially sympathetic to Marxism, he ultimately decided it was the same system:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Marxism does not address the advancement of technology.</span><br>Technological development is dangerous on its own. Even careful, well planned developments cannot account for the full range of its effects, and the lack of capitalism will not stop the bourgeois from seeking to develop new technologies to further &quot;improve&quot; living conditions. In a very simple example, akin to persistent pharmaceutical and microplastic contaminationn imagine the proletariat discovers a highly effective drug to cure aging. Because they aren&#039;t dirty capitalists, they don&#039;t release it immediately for profit but test it thoroughly in a lab for decades to ensure that it&#039;s safe. Lo and behold, it is! The proletariat found no negative effects and an end and slight reversal to aging. Furthermore, the drug decays in the environment into harmless water, carbon, and nitrogen.<br>They release the drug and everyone is happy- until 40 years later, when the children of those who were tested on in the initial lab experiments show an extreme decay in cognitive function. The proletariat is not concerned with profit! They immediately withdraw all of the drugs and begin investigations.<br>Long story short, the drug causes the development of prions in neo-natal cells that develop slowly over the course of decades. The mothers in the lab experiments did not show signs because it didn&#039;t effect them, and their children didn&#039;t for the decade of experiments becauee the prion didn&#039;t have enough time to develop.<br>By this time, it&#039;s too late. The prion spreads rapidly and persists in the water and enviromment for hundreds of years. Entire cities are contaminated with an unstoppable protein that will guarantee extinction within three generations. They couldn&#039;t have predicted this.<br>The tale is dramatic, but similar (albiet not as drastic) developments have taken place. No matter how responsible humans try to be, any new development could lead to an irreversible apocalypse.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.</span>", "time": 1674910711, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582641, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:00:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21580579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21580579</a><br>read Hegel", "time": 1674910838, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582643, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:01:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582556</a><br><a href=\"#p21582561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582561</a><br><a href=\"#p21582584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582584</a><br><a href=\"#p21582636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582636</a><br>Getting tired ofnphoneposting, will write the rest later", "time": 1674910877, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582659, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:04:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "read Society of Spectacle or watchi it on youtube", "time": 1674911097, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582679, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:14:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582636</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;marxism does not address the advancement of technology </span><br><br>what about historical materialism", "time": 1674911694, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582688, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:18:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582679</a><br>Marx has commentary on it, but he has no solution because he doesn&#039;t see it as an issue.

You couldn&#039;t respond to this and just tried to say that playing the cello is meaningless because it is not a goal ultimately related to survival.

What I and that other poster are asking you to do is come up with an argument that doesn&#039;t rely on parroting Ted and doesn&#039;t arbitrarily shut down the conversation by saying that industrial society will ultimately dehumanize everyone and preclude something like a power process of the soul.", "time": 1674919727, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21583127, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:44:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582801</a><br>how can an intelligent human being who found his way to this place actually type the words &quot;there is no problem with the system&quot; if you&#039;re a real human being, i have enormous pity and sympathy for you. this is exactly what i mean when i say division is one of the systems greatest weapons. it has set human beings against human beings in a myriad of subtle and unloving ways. i&#039;m not saying you should love everybody and can&#039;t make shitposts on the internet, but this post is indicative of a larger trend of hatemongering and pure division. left vs right, vax vs antivax, marxism vs capitalism, immigration, abortion, myriad of little petty squables that really are completely meaningless but people cling to it because they&#039;ve become so engrained in the system (the people). there&#039;s almost no room for silly goofy shit on the internet anymore, every single place on the internet is either purely profit driven soulless gunk or petty squables. the internet is dead though, we know that, what i&#039;m more interested in is real life. there is dvision there too, complete erosion of community. i think homogeneity of our society thanks to immigration plays a big part. endless streams of entertainment and parasocial relationships also play a big part. i look around at people my age and i see loneliness, people wanting to bond with other people, but there being something in the way, something invisible blocking people from bonding. i see a subtle distrust towards other people in my peers, and it&#039;s terrible to see. i remember a statistic that went along the lines of &quot;20 years ago people had 5 close friends, now that number is 0&quot; the numbers are off cause i can&#039;t remember, but it sorta proves my point and my instincts tell me that it&#039;s right. culturally we are extremely divided, when&#039;s the last time people bonded over a movie like Lord of the rings, that shit was EVERYWHERE, it sort of binded us as a society, there was a sense of culturally being bounded to other people because you watched the same stuff and had a sense of togetherness with them. nowadays nothing binds us anymore, everybody is trapped in their own algorithmic bubble of entertainment and it seperates us culturally. and if we&#039;re seperated culturally, what else do we have? <br><a href=\"#p21582659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582659</a><br>thank you, heard about this before, will read<br><a href=\"#p21582251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582251</a><br>thanks for compiling this stuff, really interested in Leviathan and its enemies, all this stuffs going on my to read list<br><a href=\"#p21582736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582736</a><br>i appreciate YOU man, feels nice to hear this<br><a href=\"#p21582278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582278</a><br>yeeaaah i&#039;ve been wanting to watch the shivering truth, and xavier renegade is the good shit, thanks :)<br><a href=\"#p21582250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582250</a><br>Giant Humanoids with 6 Fingers and 6 Toes found :OOOOO wowie", "time": 1674920682, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21583151, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)10:52:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21583091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21583091</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he&#039;s just pointing out the most basic flaw with ted&#039;s autistic anti-tech ideology, which is that, under the best of conditions, we can use industrial tech to provide us with the resources we need without dehumanizing us</span><br>I&#039;m humoring you far more than any sane man would, but this line alone is enough to demonstrate that you don&#039;t even understand the argument.

Whether you have the autonomy to bang funko-pops together is irrelevant. In this massive global industrial complex, the individual has effectively no power, influence, or autonomy. How? All of your actions and nearly everything that happens to you is dictated by events entirely outside of your control. Are you a wage worker? Your livelihood depends on semiconductors from Taiwan, plastics from China, oil from Iran, corn from Ukraine, and so on. A small bureaucratic decision in China could result in your starvation. A minor technological development in Bangladesh could make you irrelevant. A cloud of air balloons could cause global thermonuclear war and vaporize you instantly.<br><br>You can say that humans in the past were subject to events outside of their control, and that is true- but humans today are subject to those very same events, yet they are also subject to much more. Corrupt monarchies in the past were frequent, but they could not project their laws across their realm, monitor civilians at all hours of day, send knights to a tiny mountain village within a matter of hours, or drone strike a target hiding in a desert cave. The amount of marginalization of individuals and small groups is so staggering that for the most part they are irrelevant. Humans are replaceable parts in a machine.<br><br>Everyone is replaceable.

It is not implausible that a technology will be developed that makes all human labor irrelevant, and again, AI may cause human thought to become irrelevant.<br>When such a time comes, society will no longer require humans for any function whatsoever. At that point, the small locations where society has &quot;transcended&quot; the requirement to support human matter will outgrow those that do, and the areas where humans reduce the efficiency of the system will not be able to compete.

As William James says somewhere, we&#039;re &quot;almost born hard-headed now,&quot; meaning hard-headed, sceptical, earthy scientific empiricists and materialists. Even when we want to believe in higher realities or dimensions of reality and are radically open to it, we &quot;default&quot; and painfully snap back to sober atomistic materialism and individualism in any given analysis that fails to decisively and radically prove an alternative. This is fine, it&#039;s a good heuristic for doing certain scientific inquiries, but the prestige and past efficacy of such inquiries has been used as a deceptive justification for making this sort of thinking the overall human default. What this means: any time you look at things, you tend to see the &quot;default&quot; &quot;most reasonable&quot; assemblage of &quot;at least inarguably real&quot; things, like: [individual, selfishly hedonistic and merely materialistically evolved until proven otherwise, basically mundane human beings] grouped together in [&quot;societies,&quot; i.e., mere happenstance assemblages of humans due to historical accident and socio-economic push-and-pull factors with no moral or metaphysical content], etc. <br><br>You do this with one eye while the other eye is trying to find a &quot;place&quot; or &quot;space&quot; to put things like morality, purpose, the struggle against evil, hope, hidden forces that might be working toward the good, etc. And naturally you find nothing, because the very premises of your way of seeing, the theory built into your &quot;theory-laden perception,&quot; all about rule out any such possibility - you could only see or imagine a moral or metaphysical counter-force against mere hedonistic individualism and evil itself if it were a giant, stark, obvious rupture with the former. <br><br>In short, you look out onto a universe you presume to be dead, flat, material, and empty, with a few rationicating self-interest following algorithmically evolved ape-beings meaninglessly harming each other due to blind forces that for some reason always seem to add up to evil, and you wonder where the good is, or where it could come from or ever enter into the system. As Rudolf Steiner says, &quot;we only see dead things,&quot; we only see things in their downward-tending aspect, their materializing/concretizing aspect, i.e. not the underlying wellsprings of life and spontaneity that produced them SO THAT we could see them on their &quot;way down&quot; into mere inertia and materiality in the first place. <br><br>Making you see in this way is the greatest weapon the system has. It&#039;s depriving YOU of your natural weapons, namely the ability to see otherwise, hope, and faith in the essential good of things. This is Ahriman&#039;s greatest ploy.", "time": 1674939394, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21584194, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)16:00:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21584104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21584104</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where is the resistance?</span><br>https://www.bitchute.com/video/MqxS<wbr>o4RGkXQh/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe, and they want to know all this.

The succession of Commodus and the establishment of the Severan dinasty brought too much corruption to the Empire. Provinces didn&#039;t feel as accountable to Rome as much as before and after the fall of the Severan the corrupt the Praetorian Guard even managed to sell the throne of Rome for the highest bid after the death of Pertinax. So, after reaching its highest, Rome became corrupt, bureaucratic and unable to maintain control of its borders. The crisis of the Third Century resulted in terrible outcomes that we can see in the decline of the arts and architecture.<br><br>What people don&#039;t realize is that the aftermath of the crisis meant also a sort of &quot;energy crisis&quot; in Rome. Firstly, because the empire could no longer maintain coinage as before and archeologists can see that Rome was already having problems with bullions even before Constantine. Another reason was the environmental destruction, considering the importance of charcoal and the lack of this essential resource crippled Roman metal works. The other and more efficient resource was charcoal, that came primarily from Britain and became more pricy, since mining this resource became more expensive, problems of corruption and of course, barbarian incursions in that region. This lead to a poorer infrastructure, soldiers wouldn&#039;t have access to weapons and armors of quality, petty disputes paved way to barbarians to strike and last but not least, environmental factors brought more barbarian migrations and the arrival of the Huns.<br><br>My point is, with energy crisis, a growing population, the current corruption of establishment politics and the dependency of foreign markets make both the West and China (the bastions of technology btw) weak. It gives us opportunities to strike.<br>The current goal should be exporting Kaczynski&#039;s ideas to Chinese misfits.

There&#039;s basically only three soteriological systems as far as I&#039;m concerned, dogmatic, praxial and gnostic. I thunk Platonism falls into the gnostic category. Aristotelianism would be more a mixture of praxial and gnostic I think. Abrahamists are clearly dogmatists. Things like Shinto seem praxial I guess as would have been the mundane interpretations of classical Mediterranean polytheism. Anyway, yes I agree specific sects like the Sethians and such are silly but I think gnostic as a term gets a bad wrap. I always just think of it as liberation or salvation through knowledge.

The house-butler smuggled a bottle of cherry-whisky in for me \u2014 I would shorten the fights on that. <br><br>I had never drunk anything alcoholic before in my life. At seven years old my mother persuaded me to sign a pledge card, which bound me to abstain by the grace of God from all spirituous liquors so long as I retained it. But my mother took the card away and put it safely in the box-room, with the Queen Anne silver inherited from my Cheyne grandmother, Bishop Graves\u2019s diamond ring which Queen Victoria gave him when he preached before her at Dublin, our christening mugs, and the heavy early-Victorian jewellery bequeathed by Miss Britain. And since box-room treasures never left the box-room, I regarded myself as permanently parted from my pledge. This cherry-whisky delighted me. <br><br>The competitions began at about one o\u2019clock on a Saturday afternoon, and went on until seven. I was drawn for the very first fight and my opponent, by ill luck, was Alan. Alan wanted me to scratch. I told him it would look bad to do so. We consulted Jack Young, who said: \u2018No, the most sporting thing will be to box it out, and let the decision be given on points; but don\u2019t either of you hurt each other!\u2019 So we boxed. Alan started showing off to his friends, who were sitting in the front row. I muttered: \u2018Stop that, we\u2019re boxing, not fighting!\u2019 but a few seconds later he hit me again, unnecessarily hard. I got angry and knocked him out with a right swing on the side of his neck. This was the first time I had ever knocked anyone out, and the feeling combined well with my cherry-whisky exaltation.<br><br>\u2014 Robert Graves, &#039;Goodbye To All That&#039;", "filename": "Graves - Greek Myths", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 260, "h": 400, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674991749978764, "time": 1674991749, "md5": "tCZC384ziCDTqmNhw4SSrg==", "fsize": 28346, "resto": 21585196}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21586338, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This was about a Physicist searching for God, but cannot find him.", "filename": "the passenger", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 900, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674982941799755, "time": 1674982941, "md5": "cIJDwLNDwh/rLdy/TdkGiw==", "fsize": 153389, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "this-was-about-a-physicist-searching-for-god-but", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 21586346, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:05:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "This was about a Sheriff searching for God, but cannot find him.", "filename": "82429839838929", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1560, "h": 2400, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674983140885330, "time": 1674983140, "md5": "IU+pMUt4lu9Qplmg220tqQ==", "fsize": 864189, "resto": 21586338}, {"no": 21586564, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)06:16:57", "name": "Anonymou\u1e61", "com": "This was about a Couple waiting for Godot, but not meeting him.", "filename": "Waiting For Godot", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 419, "tn_w": 89, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1674991017804116, "time": 1674991017, "md5": "TLtjvoEHAsHcQMvP2Ss+KQ==", "fsize": 29560, "resto": 21586338}, {"no": 21586578, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)06:27:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21586564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21586564</a><br>Godot was a red herring.

I wanted to know what memories of joy or sorrow were already stored in the children\u2019s hearts. I wondered what my favourite children dreamed about when I caught them gazing into the air.<br><br>One day I announced to my class that I had found a pen-friend for each of them in New Zealand. I announced that each child in my class would prepare during English periods for the next two weeks a long letter to be sent to his or her pen-friend. Each child would prepare as well, for sending with the letter to New Zealand, drawings and perhaps a photograph of the writer of the letter with family and friends and pets. When every child of the forty-eight children in the class had prepared his or her letter and accompanying material, I announced, I would make up a parcel and post it to a certain teacher in a large school in New Zealand. That teacher would distribute our letters among the children in his school. A few weeks later I would receive from New Zealand a parcel comprising a letter for each child in my class from a child in New Zealand, together with drawings and perhaps photographs.<br><br>The teacher in New Zealand was a man I had met two years before when he had been in Melbourne under the terms of a teacher-exchange scheme. Just before he had left Melbourne he had given me his address in New Zealand and had suggested that we should pair our pupils as pen-friends each year. In the first year after the man had gone back to New Zealand I had not taken his suggestion, but in the second year I suddenly thought of all the words that my pupils would write about themselves after I had told them that a class of children in New Zealand was waiting to read letters from them.<br><br>I ought to have checked first with the teacher in New Zealand before I began the project, but I was eager for my children to begin writing. After they had been writing for a week, I wrote a note to the New Zealand teacher to tell him that a parcel of children\u2019s letters would soon reach him. When I was ready to post the note to New Zealand I could not find the address of the teacher in New Zealand. I found in the notebook where I kept addresses the names and addresses of people I could not remember having met, but I could not find the address of the teacher in New Zealand, and he was the only person I knew who lived in New Zealand.", "filename": "2575790045679", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 452, "h": 678, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674914191762965, "time": 1674914191, "md5": "D9F9b6B0Xm5xzx73V23h8A==", "fsize": 38082, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-my-classroom-fourteen-years-before-my-sons", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 21, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 10}, {"no": 21582830, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)08:59:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582820</a><br>I ought to have told my class next day to put aside their letters and their sketches for the time being, even if I had not told them that I could not find the address of the New Zealand teacher. Then I ought to have found out the addresses of periodicals published for teachers in New Zealand and to have sent to the editor of each periodical for publication in the periodical a notice asking for pen-friends in New Zealand for a class of children in an outer suburb of Melbourne, Australia. But when I saw my children next day editing and rewriting their letters I could not bring myself to tell them that they might have been writing to nobody.<br><br>After that, I knew I could never tell my children what I had done. I could not even take steps to find another class in New Zealand for my children to write to. Each day for five days I read through the children\u2019s letters, correcting with light pencil marks their mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Each day I watched the children rewriting words and adding punctuation marks and then erasing my light pencil marks from their pages. Each day I watched children decorating with their coloured pencils the sketches they had made of their houses, their bicycles, the places where they went for their holidays. Each day I helped children to mount securely the photographs they had brought from home. Then, at the end of the week, I packed all the children\u2019s letters into my bag and took them to my flat and emptied them into a cardboard box on the floor of the built-in wardrobe in my bedroom.<br><br>When I had taken the children\u2019s letters from them I had warned the children not to expect replies for many weeks. I had told the children that they ought to forget that they had posted their letters, so that the replies would be all the more surprising when they arrived at last. And I had even said in class that I hoped my teacher-friend had not moved from his address and had not met with an accident since the year when he had given me his address in New Zealand.<br><br>The month when the children had given their letters to me was June. The school year did not end until December. From June until December of that year I offered my class every day some new diversion that would help them forget, I hoped, the letters that they had written to New Zealand. Some of the children seemed to have forgotten the letters after only a few weeks. Other children remembered the letters almost every day and reminded me that no answers had yet come back.<br>In September of that year I applied for a transfer to a school in a suburb on the other side of Melbourne. On the day after the last school day of that year I packed my clothes and my books ready for sending by taxi truck to my new address.

I did not want to read any name of any child or any word written by any of my children to one of the unknown children of New Zealand. When I had torn all the pieces of paper and when I was pressing the pieces into the box before sealing it, I remembered myself eight years before tearing paper into shreds and pushing the torn paper into the small cardboard boxes that served as breeding boxes for the mice that I kept in the shed behind my parents\u2019 house.<br><br>I had torn up the children\u2019s letters because I had thought of the box of letters falling from the taxi truck on the way from the children\u2019s suburb to my new address. I had thought of someone finding the box in the street and reading the names on the backs of the envelopes and then sending the envelopes back to the children who had been in my class, and I had thought of the children and their parents beginning to understand what had happened to the letters.<br>When I had begun to pack my belongings in my flat, I had thought I would light a fire in the small yard behind my flat and would burn the envelopes and their contents. But then I had thought of pieces of burnt paper being lifted by the wind over the fence around the block of flats and being carried by the wind eastwards towards the houses of the children who had been my pupils. I saw in my mind piece after piece of grey paper with black penstrokes showing clearly against the grey, and all the grey pieces drifting towards the same children who had written messages on the pieces when they had been parts of white pages.<br><br>*************************", "time": 1674914476, "resto": 21582820}, {"no": 21582851, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:04:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582837</a><br>My son stood and drank his cocoa while I arranged his wet clothes on the horse.

He was safe and dry in his own house after the storm; his machine had relieved his asthma; he could sit with me in the loungeroom and watch the last of the storm passing over the house.<br><br>My son told me that he had not had a hard day. He claimed to have had a rather pleasant day. His class at the high school had had almost a free afternoon. First, one of their teachers had been away sick, and then their science teacher had given them a free period in the last hour because the mice had not arrived.<br><br>For three or four weeks, my son said, the science class had been looking forward to the coming of the mice. The science teacher had told them she had ordered fifty mice from a laboratory. She had planned with the class beforehand a series of experiments. Small numbers of mice would be put into separate cages. Some mice would be allowed to breed. Each child in the class would be responsible for feeding and observing one of the cages of mice.<br><br>The mice had been due to arrive at the school, so my son told me, on that very morning, but they had failed to arrive. My son had cleaned the cage where his mice were going to be kept. He had set out a small heap of torn paper for the mice to use as lining for their cardboard nest-box. But the science teacher had announced to the class at the beginning of the last period of the day that the people supplying the mice had let her down. The mice had not come, and she was going to have to spend most of the science period telephoning to find out what had happened to the mice. While she was out of the room, the teacher had said, the class could use the time for private study. And then, so my son had told me, the teacher had left the room and he had spent the rest of the period talking with his friends or watching the approach of the storm.<br><br>While I listened to my son I felt a sorrow for some person or some thing that I could not have named. I might have been sorry for my son and his friends because they had waited so long for the mice that had not come. Or I might have been sorry for the teacher because she had had to disappoint her class, or because she had had to lie to the class (because she had neglected to order the mice, or because she had learned many days before that the mice would never arrive but had been afraid to tell her class). Or I might have been sorry for the mice because the taxi truck bringing them to the school had overturned during the storm, and the boxes containing the mice had tumbled out onto the road and had burst open, after which the mice had crawled around on the wet grey road, confused and bedraggled, or had been swept away in the fast-flowing water in the gutters.", "time": 1674914650, "resto": 21582820}, {"no": 21582862, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:07:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582851</a><br>Each time my son had said the word mice he had made faint signs with his eyes and his mouth and his shoulders. <br>Probably no one but myself would have noticed the signs.

When I had seen that my son was making these faint signs, I had found occasion myself to speak the word mice and to make faint signs in return when I spoke the word.<br><br>The faint signs were the last traces of the signs that my son and I had made to one another during earlier years of his childhood whenever either of us had talked about mice or other small furred animals. During those years, whenever he or I had spoken the word mouse or the word mice in the other\u2019s hearing, each of us would have peered from the sides of his eyes and hunched his shoulders close to his head and stretched his mouth wide and held his hands in front of his chest in the shape of paws.<br><br>In earlier years I had always understood my son\u2019s signs as telling me that he was a mouse at heart. He was telling me that he was smaller than other children and made weak by his asthma. When I made my own signs in return in those years, I was telling my son that I recognised his mouseness and that I would never forget to put into his saucer each day a little heap of rolled oats and a cube of bread spread with vegemite and a scrap of lettuce, or to put a heap of torn paper into a corner of his cage when nights turned chilly.<br><br>When my son had made his faint signs to me on the afternoon of the storm, he seemed to be saying that he would always be partly mouse.

He seemed to be saying that he remembered every day what I had told him five years before; he had remembered it while he wheezed and gasped on his way home during the storm that had just passed over; but he knew that I had told him what I had told him only so that he could believe in earlier years that he would one day cease to be a mouse.<br><br>On the afternoon of the storm my son seemed to be telling me also that his life as a mouse was not unbearable; he had not been unhappy while he walked home through the rain; he was not unhappy now while he sat with me and watched the last of the clouds drifting towards the hills north-east of Melbourne.

Most of the mice were white or grey or fawn. A few mice were pied. I bred the mice selectively with the aim of producing only the pied sort. I kept the dozen or so female mice in one large cage, and the four or five males each in a small cage on the opposite side of the shed from the females. I had also two small breeding cages where a male and a female would be kept together until the female was swollen with young, at which time the male would be returned to his solitary cage. From each litter I kept only the one or two pied mice. The others I drowned. I put the unwanted mice in an old sock with a handful of pebbles and lowered them into a bucket of water. While I held the sock in the water I did not once look down at what my hands were doing.<br><br>I spent at least an hour every day in the shed alone with the mice. I fed the mice and cleaned their cages and set out torn paper for their nests. Then I studied the charts and tables showing the pedigrees of the mice, and I tried to decide which female and which male would be the next breeding pair.<br><br>During the hours while I was watching the mice I was also listening for certain sounds from the other side of one of the grey walls of the shed. I was listening in order to know when the woman from the house next door was in her backyard. <br><br>The woman was aged about thirty. She lived with her husband and her mother and her infant daughter. All of the family were Latvians and spoke to one another in a language that I supposed was Latvian. Whenever I heard the voice of the woman through the wall of the shed, I locked the door of the shed and crouched in the corner behind some of the cages of mice. I did in the corner what was all I could do as a solitary male who wanted to be one of a breeding pair. While I crouched in the corner I did not once look down at my hands. Instead, I pressed my ear to the cement-sheet in order to hear the voice of the woman talking in her own language. When I heard the voice I persuaded myself that the woman was talking only to me and talking without shyness or shame.<br><br>*****************************", "time": 1674915232, "resto": 21582820}, {"no": 21582892, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582883</a><br>During November and December, most of the children seemed to have forgotten having written letters to New Zealand. Only one boy still asked me quietly every few days what I supposed might have happened to the parcel of letters. The boy was not one of my favourites, although he was one of the most intelligent in the class. He was not among my favourites because he was too often restless and talkative. One of his previous teachers told me that the boy was what he was because his father had been too anxious about the boy. The father was a teacher himself and had watched over the boy too closely.<br><br>Sometimes when this boy asked me about the letters during the last weeks of the school year, I thought he might have suspected me of having not sent the letters to New Zealand. I was thinking of this boy when I decided to tear the letters into small pieces before putting them into the taxi truck.<br><br>The place that I moved to was an upstairs flat with no yard where I could burn large quantities of paper. But soon after I had moved to the new place, I began to visit a man and his wife in the hill-country north-east of Melbourne. One Saturday when I visited these people, my bag was stuffed with the torn pieces of the letters to New Zealand.<br><br>I burned the pieces of the letters on a cloudy afternoon with a cool breeze blowing. The breeze, like nearly every breeze or wind in the districts around Melbourne, went from west to east. When all the scraps of the letters had been burned, I pounded the ashes with a stick. I wanted no fragment of charred paper to be left lying on the ground with a few blackened words still visible. Yet I had noticed, while the fire was burning, a few pieces of grey paper being lifted up and carried by the breeze over the nearest treetops.<br><br>The district where I stood, in the hills north-east of Melbourne, was at the edge of the mountains that were burned, in the summer when I was born, by the worst fires since details of the weather were first recorded in the state of Victoria.

I had read also that fragments of burnt leaves and twigs fell on some cities of New Zealand from the dark clouds that had drifted from the burning forests of Victoria, far away to the west. When I saw the fragments of grey paper being carried from my fire eastwards across the treetops, I thought of the fragments drifting down at last on New Zealand and one of the fragments happening to catch the eye of a boy or a girl of nine or ten years and of the boy or the girl making out a few words of a child\u2019s handwriting on the fragment.<br><br>******************************", "time": 1674915336, "resto": 21582820}, {"no": 21582898, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:17:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582892</a><br>Towards the end of my fifteenth year, my father told me we would soon be leaving the house that had behind it the shed with the walls of grey cement-sheet.

While I was looking through the records I noticed that one of the male mice had not yet been used for breeding. Each of the other males had been moved at least once from his solitary cage to a breeding cage where he had been allowed to remain with a female until she was swollen with young. But one male mouse had been kept as a solitary male from the time when he had been taken as a half-grown male from his mother and his litter-mates.<br><br>I looked into the cage of the mouse that had been kept always solitary. The mouse was standing at the small panel of flyscreen wire at the front of the cage. I supposed that the mouse saw only a grey blur while he stood in the darkness of the cage with the fine mesh of wire in front of him and on the other side of the wire the half-light of the shed where I stood watching him.<br><br>The mouse pressed his nose against the wire and sniffed the air.I knew that the solitary mouse had seen no other mouse, either male or female, in all the time since I had put him into his cage. But I wondered whether the mouse had sometimes smelled the smell of another mouse, either male or female, or had sometimes heard the squeaking of another mouse, especially the squeaking that came from a breeding cage whenever I first put a male and a female together there.<br><br>While I stood in front of the cage, I understood that I might leave the solitary mouse alone in its cage until the day when I drowned all the mice, and that I might keep the mouse alone even while I killed it. I understood also that I might take the mouse from its cage at that moment and put it into the cage where a dozen female mice were kept together and leave it in that cage, the one male among a dozen females, until the day when I drowned all the mice. And I understood that I might carry the cage of the solitary mouse to the other side of the shed. I might then place the cage so that the panel of flyscreen wire at the front of it rested against the panel of flyscreen wire at the front of the cage where the twelve female mice were kept together. I might then leave the cages in that position until the day when I took all the mice from their separate cages and drowned them.<br><br>*END*", "time": 1674915447, "resto": 21582820}, {"no": 21582928, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)09:26:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Very neurotic.

Her supple calves slope lightly together, down to her small dovish feet in their pink velvet flats. I can feel her weight upon me - light as Heaven&#039;s gaze. Altogether too conscious of her curves, too much aware of the tiny hand around my neck, I take a silent calming breath. Cradling her gently, my mighty legs lift us both smoothly, permitting her to clearly see the top shelf. With my other arm, I hold for her any book she delights to read - dexterously turning pages with my thumb, and not needing to move a muscle anywhere else. My senses are as rigidly aware as my form; nothing escapes my knightly notice. As she is clearly a genteel lady of great worth, I will carry her throughout the library, that the drab sows which waddle there in droves might see her splendor and recall their lowly station. Should any besotted suitors be so engrossed in her beauty as to be captivated to the point of failing to recognize the great danger I pose them - an error even I am want to forgive - I will grasp their faces in my free hand, crushing their brainy mass between my fingers, and with a light toss make a ruin of them all upon the nearest wall. At my command, the librarians finish off any unfortunates still clinging to life, and heap their carcasses outside as a warning to would-be love-struck fools. When my lady has made her selection, I will bare her softly to the ground upon my Atlassian arm and hold the volumes in the other.

She only brought out food from the kitchen and returned the dishes. When a customer directed a request towards her, she had to pass it on to one of the veterans. She wasn&#039;t hot and she seemed uncomfortable amidst the cramped pub. Then there was the pleasent 45 year old lady. She was a real pro. She was probably the shift manager. She took my order. Then there was the 35 year old most unnoticable waitress. She seemed to know what she was doing, but she had a plain face. She was short and had fat legs. She also spoke Russian. Lastly, there was the tall, young and beautiful mademoiselle (victim in French). She was hot and cute at the same time. She had braces. She navigated the pub in a quick and graceful manner. Let&#039;s call her Lizy. I larped as a polite young gentleman who was busy and wanted a quick bite. As I was waiting for my order I played sudoku on my phone because this makes me less self-conscious. As I was waiting and playing, Lizy had just received an order and was pouring 2 glasses of beer and two glasses of juice (mixed juice) in front of me. I pretended not to notice her. As she was pouring juice into the last glass, she dropped the juice box, but caught it quickly so she didn&#039;t make a mess. I tried to think of a witty comforting remark but pretended not to have noticed the whole ordeal instead. I timed the finishing of my meal in a way that only Lizy would be behind the counter, so she would have to deal with me about settling the bill. I paid in cash and asked her, what are these seeds called that were in my duck salad. She said she knows what they&#039;re called but can&#039;t remember. She asked me if I wanted her to go ask from the kitchen. I said if it&#039;s no bother. She ran to the kitchen and ran back and told me what the seeds are called.

I tried to find more info about it, scientific studies, i.e., during sex couples usually bite each other, but I wondered how far can this instinct go. There was a young wealthy guy who ate a man&#039;s face and body parts while high on acid, cops found him over a body as he was biting off pieces of flesh like a predator. I don&#039;t take acid or alcohol, just feel an increasing hunger to eat out her slender throat and feel last impulses of life with my teeth and tongue, just want to rip off her tiny budding pies until ribs show up, then tear off her soft kitty. I understand why pitbulls never ease their jaws once they get a bite, they go deeper and deeper, feeling every heartbeat of their prey with their jaws. There&#039;s a reason why nature made us this way, but we have to hide our true natural needs and suppress them, which only makes them more uncontrollable.

Do and Do Not. When the Law prescribes &quot;thou shalt not covet&quot; it immediately generates its opposite which is to covet. The opposite of the Law is sin, which indwells the flesh. Supplement this reading with Galatians. By partaking of the Spirit and grace we are no longer under the law, hence the dualism no longer condemns us. The sin dies to us with the flesh upon redemption. This is easily signified by the two trees in the Garden. When under the law we live according to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. When under grace we live according to the Tree of Life. <br>In any case, dont feel bad about the continued sinning. Redemption is a regenerative process. It slowly brings us out of the Law and condemns the sin in flesh independent of our own being. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2 Corinthians 4:16</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cFor which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</span>", "time": 1674946345, "resto": 21581759}, {"no": 21584611, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)17:54:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21584538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21584538</a><br>Me too, but for the past month or so.<br>Everything went uncomfy and each night when I go to sleep, no matter how exhausted I am, I always ruminate for another hour and have a bad sleep.

The problem is that even though the period from when you start something like Epic Greek to the point that you can understand it fluently is much shorter, the overall study time it takes you to master Modern Greek, then Byzantine, then Koine, Attic, etc before you get to Homer will be a grueling grind if you don&#039;t actually give a fuck about modern Greece or Byzantium and you just wanted to read the Illiad and Odyssey.

Good thing nobody else heard the squeals of Waifu-chan ---- his two hundred dollar Apple Airbuds made sure of that, but Tom couldn&#039;t hide the grin from his face. Waifu-chan was everything he wanted. A cute black haired girl with great bouncy breasts, slim hips. long legs, hips that shook a perfect rounded bottom, and most importantly? A charm akin to that of love; a devotion that no girl could ever match. <br><br>3D girls, also known as the bane of existence, or more colloquially on the internet, 3DPD, or 3D pig-disgusting. They repelled Tom. Every single word that spewed out of their mouths caused him to seethe with anger. Their cackles, laughs, and shrill voices made his heart recoil. The complete opposite of Waifu-Chan. <br><br>&quot;Ara ara nii-san! Keikaku dori!&quot; Waifu Chan said again. How could anyone understand Tom? They couldn&#039;t. Waifu-Chan was his and only his. She was there with him throughout the day.

A lecher that he sadly was all too familiar with. It was Kyleigh. <br><br>Tom shifted his phone to keep her gaze away from Waifu-Chan, but it was a failure.

After I tell you of my sordid tale, of which I alone am left to tell, you will see why it is so unreasonable to keep me in this institution for long. <br><br>In the summer of 2019, I was a young man who had been disinherited of my Grandfather&#039;s immense fortune. Destitute, and near deprived of everything that should have rightfully been mine\u2014save for snub-nosed revolver my Grandfather always carried on him; I had little choice for work. <br><br>It was to my then considerable fortune that I had chanced upon the old Kosher deli, and seeing that they had little in means of workers and were hiring, I figured that I would apply in spite of my reservations at the sight of the place. I did not know then, but my hesitation was a sign that I should have stayed well away from that cursed deli. <br><br>I walked into the deli with nothing but the clothes on my back and a near-empty wallet, and upon seeing the old proprietor of the deli, my hopes for any chance of employment collapsed entirely. <br><br>The old proprietor, known as Cohen, was as Jewish a man descended matrilineally of old Roman stock could get. His curled hair had long gone grey, yet his build was still stocky and powerful. He spoke with a overwhelmingly powerful Yiddish accent, and upon seeing me, greeted me in Yiddish, assuming me for one of his own. <br><br>I spoke to him, and told him that I was not there to purchase anything, but that I had seen his notice for employment and had come in to the shop, with little qualification save for my will to work for an honest wage, for the purpose of gaining employment within. His dark, indiscernable gaze fell upon me for but a moment, no doubt calculating the gains that could be squeezed out of a desperate young man, and the losses he could no doubt cheat me out of.<br><br>He then spoke to me, \u201cWhen can you work?\u201d<br><br>I told him, \u201cNow or tomorrow.\u201d <br><br>As it was very late in the day when I had come upon his shop, he bid me to come behind the counter, and as I did, the striking countenance of an ancient, decrepit wine box greeted me.

I could understand the meaning of the old Jew, and I inwardly scoffed at his worse nature overtaking him. I said that I would return, and I walked out of the establishment to my car to get my possibles and spare clothing. <br><br>I should have driven away when I could have. <br><br>After I stowed my few belongings away into the unused office, where a spare, squeaky mattress had been taken out from somewhere and laid out for me, the old Jew showed me around the stations of butchery, and taught me the tricks of deep Jewry for cutting meat in a kosher way, and much else, before he told me to come with him and observe. <br><br>As he left the room, the once sterile and boring room seemed to come alive with a malicious intent. The hanging butcher hooks sank lower, the wet knives gleamed sharper, and the soaked concrete floor was all the more slippery. Each component of the Butchery, vital in their lonely use, had all come together in a secret covenant against my personage. Yet in spite of the maliciousness of the carving knives and cleavers haphazardly laid out on wet pink rags, there was nothing more desolate than the feeling of Jewishness that permeated the back. I shuddered and swiftly followed after the old Jew.<br><br>He stood there behind the counter, both hands laid flat on the clear glass pane, and slightly leaning forwards, waited for his next customer with a distinct eagerness that was altogether disturbingly familiar to me. It was the love of money that so ingrained itself to the Jewish race, that it was part of their soul, other than loud arguments over nothing and the propensity to being exiled from places of living. I stood there beside him, and beside the warped dusty wine box that remained tightly closed in spite of its disuse.

Nothing long winded; not even any suggestions, really, unless you want to. The goal of the chapter is to create a sense uneasiness that ends in horror. But even I do feel that I didn&#039;t give enough time nor details to build the uneasiness needed for the horror to be impactful. Which is precisely why I&#039;d like insight. <br><br>To whomever may choose to do so, all I ask is that you must actually: enjoy reading fiction, in particular high fantasy; that you understand what is being asked of you and that you are reading something built off of more than 15k words before it; and that it is rough and roughly edited just enough to hopefully keep the reading mostly smooth--meaning you must understand that I&#039;m asking an assessment of the delivery of content in words, not their structuring nor depth of language. The latter two come with editing. <br><br><br>Thanks in advance to any takers.", "filename": "Screenshot_20221212_033237", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1438, "h": 2163, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674981452447764, "time": 1674981452, "md5": "NGUZHtqwkuk5F1kFY5KYzQ==", "fsize": 1340511, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21586456, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)05:13:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "are there any stories in antiquity where a magician turns a staff into a sort of vapor or other inanimate objects? similar to how moses turned his staff into a snake and back", "time": 1674987203, "resto": 21576520}, {"no": 21586463, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)05:15:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21586456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21586456</a><br>I once paid a magician to turn my staff into a snake if you know what I mean", "time": 1674987315, "resto": 21576520}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21586427, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)04:51:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is leftism just a beta cuck uprising.

Sutcliffe of the BBC&#039;s schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton&#039;s ability to churn out &quot;mediocre material&quot;, noting that &quot;her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago&quot;.[138] Michael Rosen, Children&#039;s Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that &quot;I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books.&quot;[123] The children&#039;s author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton&#039;s work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the &quot;drip, drip, drip of disapproval&quot; associated with the books.[139] Blyton&#039;s response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, stating that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from &quot;stupid people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about because they&#039;ve never read any of my books&quot;.[140]</span>", "filename": "Enid Blyton - Wikipedia", "ext": ".png", "w": 918, "h": 971, "tn_w": 236, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674968131726075, "time": 1674968131, "md5": "GbBqkmeMjGyd0fUwxl3Lxw==", "fsize": 2109259, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "was-the-backlash-against-enid-blyton-warrented", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 21585788, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:55:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite criticism by contemporaries that her work&#039;s quality began to suffer in the 1950s at the expense of its increasing volume, Blyton nevertheless capitalised on being generally regarded at the time as &quot;a more &#039;savoury&#039;, English alternative&quot; to what some considered an &quot;invasion&quot; of Britain by American culture, in the form of &quot;rock music, horror comics, television, teenage culture, delinquency, and Disney&quot;.[15]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to British academic Nicholas Tucker, the works of Enid Blyton have been &quot;banned from more public libraries over the years than is the case with any other adult or children&#039;s author&quot;, though such attempts to quell the popularity of her books over the years seem to have been largely unsuccessful, and &quot;she still remains very widely read&quot;.[141]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Simplicity</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some librarians felt that Blyton&#039;s restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in Encounter in 1958, the journalist Colin Welch remarked that it was &quot;hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11-plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos&quot;,[7] but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton&#039;s Noddy, describing him as an &quot;unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.&quot;[57]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The author and educational psychologist Nicholas Tucker notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people&#039;s favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an &quot;encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification&quot;.[142] Fred Inglis considers Blyton&#039;s books to be technically easy to read, but to also be &quot;emotionally and cognitively easy&quot;. He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton &quot;was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her.&quot;[143] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in &quot;representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership&quot;.[143] Blyton&#039;s daughter Imogen has stated that she &quot;loved a relationship with children through her books&quot;, but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.[144]</span>", "time": 1674968141, "resto": 21585786}, {"no": 21585790, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:56:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Accusations of racism, xenophobia and sexism</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Accusations of racism in Blyton&#039;s books were first made by Lena Jeger in a Guardian article published in 1966. In the context of discussing possible moves to restrict publications inciting racial hatred, Jeger was critical of Blyton&#039;s The Little Black Doll, originally published in 1937.[145][146] Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and other toys owing to his &quot;ugly black face&quot;, and runs away. A shower of &quot;magic rain&quot; washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face.[147] Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be &quot;deeply racist&quot; because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs.[148] In Blyton&#039;s 1944 novel The Island of Adventure, a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.[149]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Accusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, &quot;Enid was very much part of that between the wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both&quot;.[150] The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton&#039;s The Mystery That Never Was, submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view &quot;There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author&#039;s attitude to the thieves; they are &#039;foreign&#039; ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality.&quot; Macmillan rejected the manuscript,[151] but it was published by William Collins in 1961,[152] and then again in 1965 and 1983.[151]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blyton&#039;s depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist.[153][154] In a Guardian article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: &quot;it&#039;s really time you gave up thinking you&#039;re as good as a boy&quot;.[155]</span>", "time": 1674968172, "resto": 21585786}, {"no": 21585791, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)23:56:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Revisions to later editions</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To address criticisms levelled at Blyton&#039;s work, some later editions have been altered to reflect more politically progressive attitudes towards issues such as race, gender, violence between young persons, the treatment of children by adults, and legal changes in Britain as to what is allowable for young children to do in the years since the stories were originally written (e.g. purchasing fireworks); modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance.[156] The golliwogs who steal Noddy&#039;s car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in Here Comes Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.[157]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Faraway Tree&#039;s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie.[158] Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare&#039;s series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George&#039;s short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal.[159] Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girls&#039; dolls was removed.[160] In The Adventurous Four, the names of the young twin girls were changed from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe.[161]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2010 Hodder, the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as &quot;subtle&quot;, mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, &quot;school tunic&quot; becomes &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;mother and father&quot; and &quot;mother and daddy&quot; (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become &quot;mum and dad&quot;,[162] &quot;bathing&quot; is replaced by &quot;swimming&quot;, and &quot;jersey&quot; by &quot;jumper&quot;.[158] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[162] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[158] In 2016 Hodder&#039;s parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[163]</span>", "time": 1674968204, "resto": 21585786}, {"no": 21586134, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:27:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585786</a><br><a href=\"#p21585788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585788</a><br><a href=\"#p21585790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585790</a><br><a href=\"#p21585791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585791</a><br>You&#039;re using a simple prose with limited words for a kid&#039;s book?

Police never act professional or like public servants, they act like they&#039;re part of big daddy government come to chastise you and tsk-tsk at you.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued.

But it is not possible to escape metaphysics and cease to trace nature back to terms of thought, by throwing ourselves into the arms of Atomism. The atom, in fact, is itself a thought; and hence the theory which holds matter to consist of atoms is a metaphysical theory.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newton gave physics an express warning to beware of metaphysics, it is true, but to his honour be it said, he did not by any means obey his own warning. The only mere physicists are the animals: they alone do not think: while man is a thinking being and a born metaphysician. The real question is not whether we shall apply metaphysics, but whether our metaphysics are of the right kind: in other words, whether we are not, instead of the concrete logical Idea, adopting one-sided forms of thought, rigidly fixed by understanding, and making these the basis of our theoretical as well as our practical work. It is on this ground that one objects to the Atomic philosophy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The old Atomists viewed the world as a many, as their successors often do to this day. On chance they laid the task of collecting the atoms which float about in the void. But, after all, the nexus binding the many with one another is by no means a mere accident: as we have already remarked, the nexus founded on their very nature.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To Kant we owe the completed theory of matter as the unity of repulsion and attraction. The theory is correct, so far as it recognises attraction to be the other of the two elements involved in the notion of being-for-self: and to be an element no less essential than repulsion to constitute matter. Still, this dynamic construction of matter, as it is termed, has the fault of taking for granted, instead of deducing, attraction and repulsion.

Paraguay, a small country in South America, has 100% of it&#039;s electricity generated by hydro, which they actually purchase from Brazil and Argentina, countries with immense rivers if compared to rivers in North America/Europe. However, recently Paraguay started to face problems, since a drought in the region forced these dams to operate at a low capacity, increasing much of the energy prices for landlocked Paraguay.

I don\u2019t think Nietzsche\u2019s main point is that \u2018good and evil\u2019 do or do not exist in some metaphysical or ontological sense. Instead, I think it might be helpful to contrast \u2018good and evil\u2019 with \u2018good and bad\u2019. I can\u2019t recall if it\u2019s in BGE or in the Genealogy, but in one or the other N. Says that \u2018beyond good and evil\u2019 certainly doesn\u2019t mean \u2018beyond good and bad\u2019. So how does Nietzsche contrast the two? Since I take \u2018good and bad\u2019 to be an evaluative couplet Nietzsche (sort of) endorses, while \u2018good and evil\u2019 is not an evaluative couplet Nietzsche endorses. How I take Nietzsche to mean is: \u2018good and bad\u2019 is a \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018basic\u2019 way to evaluate, whereas \u2018good and evil\u2019 is an incorrect way to evaluate. So \u2018good and bad\u2019 might include basic do\u2019s and don\u2019ts e.g. do eat, drink, copulate, exercise; don\u2019t drown yourself, don\u2019t starve yourself, don\u2019t catch leprosy. Whereas \u2018good and evil\u2019 is like an expansion pack that modifies the original sorting; instead of \u2018sex is good because it\u2019s a part of our species nature\u2019 to \u2018sex is EVIL since it dirties the soul and continues our wretched species\u2019. <br>There is a LOT more to say. Happy to talk. But my main takeway point is: \u2018good and evil\u2019 are terms in an evaluative framework that Nietzsche takes as misinterpreting how people/life works. You should avoid thinking in terms of \u2018good and evil\u2019 while inquiring/rooting out the ways you implicitly do think and act in accord with those terms.", "time": 1674953304, "resto": 21583422}, {"no": 21585115, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:12:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21583422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21583422</a><br>They exist only as a made up slave morality interpretation.

Demographic winter for much of the world will usher in a great winnowing. If the selection pressures and conditions of life from antiquity through the industrial revolution cannot be reimposed, the environment of the human biomass itself must be acted upon.

He was a solitary figure, known for his quick draw and deadly aim with a revolver.

The local outlaws had been terrorizing the townspeople, and the mayor had put out a call for someone to bring them to justice. Jack knew this was his chance to make a name for himself and rid the town of its troubles.<br><br>He went to the saloon and ordered a whiskey, sizing up the patrons as he did so. A group of rough-looking men sat in the corner, laughing and boasting about the robberies they had committed. Jack knew they were the ones he was looking for.<br><br>He finished his drink and approached the group, his hand hovering over his gun. &quot;You boys have been causing trouble in this town,&quot; he said, his voice low and menacing. &quot;I&#039;m here to put a stop to it.&quot;<br><br>The outlaws sneered at him, thinking him to be just another cowboy looking for a quick buck. But they were wrong. Jack was a seasoned gunslinger, and he was not to be underestimated.<br><br>With lightning speed, he drew his revolver and fired, taking down the leader of the group with one shot. The other outlaws scrambled for their guns, but they were no match for Jack&#039;s skill and precision. In the blink of an eye, the outlaws were all lying dead on the saloon floor.<br><br>The townspeople were shocked and amazed by the stranger who had saved them from the terror of the outlaws.

It seems semi-autobiographical but it really is a work of fiction. I hit up Google many times while reading this to try and figure out what is real and what isn&#039;t. The Trawler was a serial killer in LA in 1981 but he targeted elderly women. Bret took that story and spun it to fit the narrative of this book and it was super successful. I was creeped out and chilled to the bone on several occasions.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having said that please be warned that this book is not for the faint of heart. The descriptions of the murders for some will be beyond disturbing and nightmare inducing. As a reader you will also have to endure all sorts of debauchery.

There is a lot of male/male sex, some male/female sex, and a whole lot of masturbation.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve mentioned before that I don&#039;t need to know all the nitty gritty details of sex in my books but it does work here because there is absolutely nothing erotic about it.

Of course, reading Melville or Faulkner is a much different experience from each other and both from Shakespeare, and few have the metaphorical density of Shakespeare (\u201cten similes in one line\u201d as you put it). Even if Melville doesn\u2019t have such density, passages like these are still some of the closest you\u2019ll get to Shakespearean monologues in prose or literary (non-play) dialogue, in my opinion:<br><br>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. <br><br>Consider all this; and then turn to the green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half-known life.
