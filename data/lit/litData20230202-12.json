We of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius (as you now call it) was the first principle, and all the others merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the Priests and Philosophers of other countries, and prophesying that all Gods would at last be proved to originate in ours, and to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius. It was this that our great poet King David desired so fervently, and invokes so pathetically, saying by this he conquers enemies and governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God that we cursed in His[24] name all the deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled. From these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the Jews.<br>\u201cThis,\u201d said he, \u201clike all firm persuasions, is come to pass, for all nations believe the Jews\u2019 code, and worship the Jews\u2019 God; and what greater subjection can be?\u201d<br>I heard this with some wonder, and must confess my own conviction. After dinner I asked Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works; he said none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his.<br>I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years. He answered: \u201cThe same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian.\u201d<br>I then asked Ezekiel why he ate dung, and lay so long on his right and[25] left side. He answered: \u201cThe desire of raising other men into a perception of the infinite. This the North American tribes practise.

His view of the world is shallow even if ingeniously elaborated. Depth of thought finds its material within ourselves; sagacity has to receive it from outside in order to have data. However, in those times the empirical data were in part scanty and in part even false. Therefore, the study of Aristotle is nowadays not very rewarding, while that of Plato remains so to the highest degree. The lack of profundity reprimanded in Aristotle of course becomes most visible in metaphysics, where mere sagacity does not suffice, as it does elsewhere; so that in this he satisfies least. His Metaphysics is for the most part talking back and forth about the philosophemes of his predecessors, whom he criticizes and refutes from his point of view, mostly in reference to isolated utterances by them, without really penetrating their meaning, rather like someone who breaks the windows from the outside. He advances only a few, or none, of his own dogmas, at least not in systematic fashion. That we owe a large part of our knowledge of the older philosophemes to his polemics is an accidental achievement. He is hostile towards Plato mostly where the latter is completely right. Plato\u2019s \u2018Ideas\u2019 continue coming back up into his mouth, like something that he cannot digest; he is determined not to admit their validity. \u2013 Sagacity suffices in the empirical sciences; consequently Aristotle has a predominantly empirical direction. But as empirical science since that time has made so much progress that it compares to its past state as the manly age compares to infancy, today\u2019s empirical sciences cannot be much advanced directly through the study of his philosophy, but indirectly they can through the method and the properly scientific attitude that characterizes him and was brought into the world by him.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The radical antithesis of Aristotle, in the way of thinking as well as in the presentation, is Plato. The latter holds on to his main thought as if with an iron hand, follows its thread, even if it becomes ever so thin, in all its ramifications, through the labyrinths of the longest dialogues, and finds it again after all episodes. One can tell, before he started writing, he had thoroughly and entirely thought through his subject and had designed an artful order for its presentation. ...Therefore, we need not be so much surprised if, as some reports indicate, especially in Aelian (Historical Miscellany III, 19; IV, 9; etc.), a major personal disharmony manifested itself between Plato and Aristotle, and Plato may even from time to time have spoken somewhat contemptuously of Aristotle, whose wanderings, vagaries, and digressions relate to his polymathy, but are wholly antipathetic to Plato. Schiller\u2019s poem \u2018Breadth and Depth\u2019 can also be applied to the opposition between Aristotle and Plato.</span>", "filename": "schoppi_d8rw6__please_credit[palette.fm]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 476, "h": 525, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675332937720809, "time": 1675332937, "md5": "6nQhytnFxyERCCcuoUnLmg==", "fsize": 60258, "resto": 21604270}, {"no": 21604503, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)05:27:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21604370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21604370</a><br>this is the final pill<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plato did not approve of his life and habit, for Aristotle wore rich garments and shoes, and cut his hair after a manner not used by Plato.

Most here definitely don&#039;t go the extra mile and it is work to do so I appreciate it. <br>And secondly I do see what you&#039;re saying. Your rewrites are noticeably easier to read and it makes it apparent I do have a problem with over doing it. Yet it does lead me to another line of questioning, if that&#039;s okay. <br>This story is first and foremost a horror story that tries to blur the line between cosmic horror and psychological horror as two sides of the same coin. Leading to some primary themes being about the brain and the mind and their role in the universe. And the character we&#039;re following here is a meta attempt to self insert the reader quite literally in their mind by the reader&#039;s mind being the character&#039;s mind (I really hope that makes sense, I tried to word it simply). Which is leads me to saying that I had intended for all the &quot;Bridges&quot; or bridging chapters to just sit in the mind of the character as typically a horror or significant even occurs. This is to bring to light another staple horror theme of isolation. It&#039;s why if you skim the last three paragraphs of that chapter, you&#039;ll see what it was building to and why it kind if was just &quot;someone looking at stuff&quot;.<br>So then do you think even with that being my goal in a chapter like this (typically around 2 chapters in every 8-10), its still unpleasant or adolescent (at best) to read at best? Even with editing to have more varied verb use and smoother structuring? Or do you think that isolation and self-insertion can still be captured while writing how you&#039;re saying so long as I put the time in to figure out how?<br><br>Sorry for the TLDR, but it&#039;s about as concise as I can ask it.", "time": 1675233210, "resto": 21593992}, {"no": 21599077, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:41:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598953</a><br>A lot of proper names.

The road towards the beginning always leads into barbarism, and he who is concerned with the Greeks ought always to keep in mind the fact that the unsubdued thirst for knowledge in itself always barbarises just as much as the hatred of knowledge, and that the Greeks have subdued their inherently insatiable thirst for knowledge by their regard for Life, by an ideal need of Life,-since they wished to live immediately that which they learnt. The Greeks also philosophised as people of culture and with the aims of culture,and therefore saved themselves the trouble of inventing once again the elements of philosophy and knowledge out of some autochthonous conceit, and with a will they at once set themselves to fill out, enhance, raise and purify these elements they had taken over in such a way, that only now in a higher sense and in a purer sphere they became inventors.

There were serious side-effects of this system due to issues using hard-chemical conditioning like dopamine triggers to condition peasants unto work as opposed to instinct-based fear-triggers used by religion.

It is a social/historical phenomena.<br><br>I don&#039;t think many would deny this, especially not those who doubt Christianity at all. Heresy is contextual. <br><br>To teach that it was allowable to eat pork and work on the Sabbath was heretical. And yet Jesus tells us of the shepard who, having lost a sheep on the Sabbath, saved it. He rewrites the Law. The Law is not the object we aspire to, but its particularization. It is the discrete phenomena that embodies the universal.<br><br>However, it is the universal of the law we want to promote. Justice, compassion, and above all, the promotion of human freedom.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Law to promote human freedom!? Law constrains, it says &quot;thou shalt not.&quot;</span><br><br>That is only negative freedom. It&#039;s the freedom of Thelema, &quot;do what thou wilt,&quot; or the freedom of the revolutionary sans-colottes who can only riot and destroy. <br><br>This negative freedom seeks pure abstraction because any actuality, the actual particulars of real life, necessarily makes for constraints. Particulars always constrain; simply, when one makes a choice, one has chosen and the freedom to choose no longer remains. You cannot have your cake on your plate and eat it too. But the zealots of negative freedom retreat into abstraction to avoid limits. Hence, SJWs rail on about an amorphous White Privilege and they and /pol/tards alike want to rail against an amorphous elite, but never can particularization this without fracturing their coalition since now they must fight real people, particulars. &quot;Intersectionality,&quot; is a blanket term to abstract away the fact that identity can both support and cut against existing power.<br><br>But there is also positive freedom, the freedom to do what one wills rationally, not to be drive on all sides by ones instincts and desires. This is Paul in Romans 7-9. He does a death in sin to the &quot;members of his body.&quot; This is not a biological death, but a death of personhood, of autonomoy. Drive and desire rules him. <br><br>Paul is resurrected in this life by Christ, the Logos. The law of his mind desires what is good, the aim of God&#039;s Law, and only rationale constraint allows him to live free from the &quot;Legion within,&quot; (see the story of Christ driving the demon into the pigs). See also: I Peter 4, on living &quot;with the will of God.&quot;<br><br>But obviously the Law of Christ and Law of Moses differ. Contradiction!? No, because the goal is the goal of all law, the promotion of human freedom. States and laws change over time, moving dialectically towards greater freedom. Systems with internal contradictions, e.g., a state that allows slavery, must resolve these. Hence, freedom has grown over time. Not just negative freedom &quot;from&quot; but also positive freedom, universal education, social support for poor children&#039;s development, etc.<br><br>Throughout the Bible God works through social structures and historical process.

In the concept of love, philosopher and artist had to part ways, and as a consequence, Wagner deepened and glorified this conception in his own fashion. In his diary of December 1st, 1858 we read: \u201cI have recently read slowly through friend Schopenhauer\u2019s major work again and this time he has extraordinarily stimulated me to amplification and\u2014in some particulars\u2014even to correction.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wagner had, in fact, without being aware of it, introduced in The Victors a Mahayanistic idea which in his days was scarcely known in Europe: namely, that the way to redemption must take, not a direct path, through perfect denial of sensual love, but rather an indirect path, first through the affirmation of sensual love, in order to arrive at the ultimate overcoming of it. This idea is essentially Mahayana and is found neither in Christianity nor in Hinayana Buddhism. Wagner had, so to speak, perceived through artistic intuition ideas which run parallel with Mahayanism. For that reason, I would like to quote further from the diary pages of December 1st: . and perhaps it had to be reserved for my very special disposition to gain insight here, which no other could conceive of in this very special time of my life. The point is to show the way to salvation, recognized by no philosopher, nor, for that matter, by Schopenhauer, which leads to the perfect appeasement of the will through love, and, to be sure, through no abstract humanitarian love, but one emerging from the depth of sexual love, i.e., from the attraction between man and woman.\u201d</span><br><br>If The Victors expresses a general Mahayana view, Tristan is full-blown Vajrayana. Only in his late Christian period did the extremes which bear the resemblance to Vajrayana cool down, and he subscribe to a practical ideal much closer to Theravada.

On a first, more superficial (and thus probably wrong) analysis, Wagner&#039;s aesthetic would seems to exacly oppose a would-be Platonic one. Wagner first articulates a dialectic between form and content, phenomenon and noumenon, light and sound, expression and feeling; then he places the primacy on the content, subordinating form to it; Beethoven&#039;s c-sharp minor quartet starts inwards, from the noumena, pours out into form as a means to communicate that inner vision (hearing?) to the audience; and so does the Tristan, etc., whereas a would-be Platonic view would put form first, and relegate the content to the inferior realm of the sensible, contingent and temporal. But this would be incorrect in at least two ways, first and most important of which is this, there is an equivocation of terms here. Form for Wagner means the phenomenal, the temporal, etc.; the exact opposite is true for Plato: form means the intelligible, the atemporal, etc.; secondly, in Plato&#039;s actual writtings about music he never deals with &quot;form&quot; as understood by modern music theory (that is, compositional structure), but with &quot;ethical&quot; side of music, namely how music moves the soul, the effects that it has on the soul.

It is conclusive, that I am able to use for this (as philosopher, not as poet, since as such I have my own) the terminology which Sch. himself supplies me. The exposition leads very deep and far, for it embraces a preciser explanation of the state in which we become able to apprehend Ideas, as also of that of Genius (Genialitaf), which I no longer conceive as a state of disengagement of the intellect from the will, but rather as an enhancement of the intellect of the individual to a cognitive organ of the race itself (Erkenntnissorgan der Gattung), thus of the Will as Thing-in-itself; whence alone, moreover, is to be explained that strange enthusiastic joyfulness and rapture in the supreme moments of genial cognition which Sch. seems hardly to know, as he can find it [i.e. that mode of cognition] only in repose and in the silencing of the individual passions. Quite analogously to this conception, I then arrive with greatest certainty at proving in Love a possibility of attaining to that exaltation above the instinct of the individual will where, after complete subjection of this latter, the racial will comes to full consciousness of itself; which upon this height is necessarily tantamount to complete pacification. All this will be made clear even to the inexperienced, if my statement succeeds; whilst the result cannot but be very significant, and entirely and satisfactorily fill the gaps in Schopenhauer&#039;s system.</span>", "time": 1675179816, "resto": 21595781}, {"no": 21596333, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596306</a><br>Schopenhauer is an arhat; Wagner is a bodhisattva.", "time": 1675180312, "resto": 21595781}, {"no": 21596342, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proving in Love a possibility of attaining to that exaltation above the instinct of the individual will where, after complete subjection of this latter, the racial will comes to full consciousness of itself; which upon this height is necessarily tantamount to complete pacification</span><br>Using sexuality to achieve a state of &quot;racial will&quot; which pacifies the individual will isn&#039;t Vajrayana Buddhism, it&#039;s... esoteric natalism?

It must be a fearfully lecherous thing to see a girl with her clothes up frigging furiously at her cunt, to see her pretty white drawers pulled open behind and her bum sticking out and a fat brown thing stuck half-way out of her hole. You say you will shit your drawers, dear, and let me fuck you then. I would like to hear you shit them, dear, first and then fuck you.

The relationship between a father and son is a very complicated affair that has no overlap with the relationship between a man and a woman. Your deliberate conflating of the two is below both of us.<br><br>At the beginning of their relationship the father is by far the senior and authoritative position but as the son ages and gains experience he will, or at least should, eclipse the father in terms of experience and ability. Thus it starts and ends as unequal relationship. First in favoring the father and as time progresses the needle shifts in favor of the son. So yes, a son should naturally submit to the authority of his father but constantly rebel within the framework of a growing up and finding the boundaries and a father should enforce gradually expanding boundaries. The father should then step back and allow his son the rightful position as the head of the family when the time comes.<br><br>Failure to do this results in <a href=\"#p21602833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602833</a>", "filename": "32", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 274, "h": 184, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1675300935627262, "time": 1675300935, "md5": "klqo1i+JnBl3NN4MA4eYTg==", "fsize": 6220, "resto": 21602807}, {"no": 21602979, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)20:23:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I will once again attempt to diminish my internet/technology use down to the bare minimum.

If one interest becomes too domineering, too powerful over and against other powers, the others check it in some way in order to ensure some degree of balance and equanimity. You might then think of individual ambition/competition as not necessarily opposed to equality, but as in fact the very means of ensuring equality.

It&#039;s like they went from being protagonists of a movie about their life to being ordinary, invisible background characters like everybody else. <br><br>It&#039;s really as if they don&#039;t even have the mental categories to process not being the center of attention. They keep trying to fix the problem by changing their fashion or trying to find a new &quot;character type&quot; that fits their situation, but can&#039;t realize the real underlying problem is simply that nobody cares about your style or what twist on the dark academia archetype you are when you&#039;re a 29 year old wine aunt who just works a remote job. I&#039;ve seen them ruin really good relationships with men that frankly would have saved them and given them a new lease on life because the men weren&#039;t accepting the &quot;role&quot; they were forcing on them, of mirroring their dark academia academic girl archetype back at them. The men just saw a nice 29 year old girl and wanted to date her, not enable her play to a character. <br><br>I wonder how much of women&#039;s misery could be prevented if they just got having kids and starting a family out of the way while they were young, so they didn&#039;t base their entire identity on the perpetual edging session of &quot;dating.&quot; Their behavior reminds me of things I did in my preteen and early teen years, dumb shit that is just funny in hindsight, like how I thought I was going to run away and join the Foreign Legion, or how I wanted to be a cool drug dealer so I lied and told people I sold weed. Women don&#039;t have the same character types, but it&#039;s the same energy of trying too hard to be &quot;cool&quot; and nobody giving them any honest feedback. But the reason nobody gave me any feedback at 14 is because 14 year olds are stupid. It&#039;s normal to give them space to figure things out. These women are 23-27 years old and their entire sense of self comes from the attention they get while dressing up as characters in movies they haven&#039;t seen. I&#039;ve tried telling the women close to me that life gets both more mundane and paradoxically more exciting when you&#039;re no longer a twentyish person who thinks the world revolves around them, that somehow the other people on the bus know what movie soundtrack you&#039;re listening to on your &quot;earbuds.&quot; I&#039;ve told them that they could be any other college girl archetype and they would get just as much attention, that the attention is because of the &quot;college girl&quot; part of the equation and not the &quot;archetype&quot; part.

I think, to abstract away from what you&#039;re specifically saying about /lit/ type younger women who aestheticize being a intellectual &amp; &quot;indie&quot;, women especially as they age, have very different baggage from men. Whereas boys are always taught that they do not have intrinsic value, that their feelings do not matter, etc. girls are socialized to believe they do have intrinsic value because they are young, pretty and pure. As they age and become adult women I imagine it&#039;s quite painful to adjust to this, which is something that men cannot relate to at all because their pain comes from a completely different source. At least I think that&#039;s the spirit of what you&#039;re saying. The only point I&#039;d disagree with is that settling down and having kids will offer your life meaning. I think for normies perhaps it does, but if you are depressed, alienated, not part of the masses I doubt that it helps.

It&#039;s similar to what George R.R. Martin does in Games of Thrones in that a less influential character&#039;s viewpoint is provided to show how the world sees an important character and how their relationship changes. This also provides for a more detached assessment of a supposed hero&#039;s actions, as it can be all too easy for a reader, let alone the characters, to just go along with whatever they do.<br><br>The story begins with the party&#039;s arrival in Sova, the city at the heart of the Sovan Empire, and with that everything changes. The previous book took place at the fringes of the Empire where its might held less sway. That allowed for a lot of personal agency, but being here strips all of that away to reveal obeisance to institutional authority. The Empire could described as a liberal autocracy in that it has free markets and doesn&#039;t discriminate among its citizens. There&#039;s also a long tradition of secular common law meant to be applied fairly to all. However, all of that only continues to exist at the pleasure of the Emperor. If civil rights are dictated by the whims of one, or only a few unelected individuals, how much can their continuance be counted upon? Much of the book is in contemplation of the relationship an individual has to their government and the interplay between its estates.<br><br>Unraveling the conspiracy that was discovered in the first book is of the utmost concern. There&#039;s also a murder mystery, an infiltration, multiple battles, purges, relationship drama, and the occasional horror scene. The action-oriented scenes were nice, though I enjoyed the contemplative ones more. What interested me the most was the questions that are brought up along the way and my consideration of them, especially in terms of contemporary similarities.<br><br>The characters are of a decidedly gray morality. There&#039;s a clear delineation between being lawful and what many would consider being good. Mostly they&#039;re just trying to survive through their trauma and obligations. The utmost priority is the continuation of Empire, despite their reservations about its methods. The Emperor&#039;s directives must be obeyed regardless. Many ethical compromises are required to preserve the status quo. How much ought a person sacrifice to ensure the victory of the lesser evil?<br><br>The first book set up the world, this one sets up the stakes, and third is assumedly the consequences. I&#039;m quite interested to see what form that takes, specifically whether it&#039;s viewed at a distance, as is done with the viewpoint protagonist. The outcome has been already been known since the opening of the first book, so it&#039;s only a matter of how they get there.

He seemed to have a lot of talent in conveying ambience, world building, and plot development all through how people talked. I firmly believe that is a major component of why Neuromancer is so fantastic. Peripheral feels like a shitty knockoff of Neuromancer. The characters speak in stilted &quot;cool&quot; parlance like they do in Neuromancer, but none of the characters are actually cool or interesting.. They&#039;re all country hicks, ex military, or extremely rich fucks. I get that it&#039;s not meant to be cyberpunk, but god damn were all the characters boring and uninspired. The dual world setup was cool and the only, ONLY redeeming factor of the book.

Contrary to what is usually thought, it is the man of excellence, not the common man who lives in essential servitude. Life has no savour for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendent. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of serving as an oppression.

The privileges of nobility are not in their origin concessions or favours; on the contrary, they are conquests. And their maintenance supposes, in principle, that the privileged individual is capable of reconquering them, at any moment, if it were necessary, and if anyone were to dispute them. ... It is annoying to see the degeneration suffered in today&#039;s speech by a word so inspiring as &quot;nobility.&quot; For, by coming to mean for many people hereditary &quot;noble blood,&quot; it is changed into something similar to common rights, into a static, passive quality which is received and transmitted, something inert.

He searched for the death realm of one of the greatest minds that dwelled in the house in Schwarzspanierstrasse &amp; put an end to his bodily existence.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; At the time of his funeral a partial eclipse of the moon took place that was visible from Vienna, and ended exactly at that moment when his body was lowered into the earth.

To be a member of Vienna\u2019s Philosophical Society was to be as much of an insider as was humanly possible. It was a society that met once a week to listen to a talk, though the audience didn\u2019t discuss that same evening what the speaker had said; that was left till later, to afford time for reflection and serious debate. When Nietzsche died in 1900, many such lectures were held (some were attended by Houston Stewart Chamberlain), lectures at which the effects on philosophy of the theory of evolution were discussed. Otto Weininger was at the centre of these events. One gains a different impression of Weininger when one learns that Stefan Zweig said that he once saw him at a caf\u00e9 but did not dare go over and engage him in conversation; and Zweig was neither overly reticent nor cowardly. That says something of Weininger\u2019s standing in his day: central, but totally misunderstood.&quot;<br>- Allan Janik<br><br>https://www.eurozine.com/weiningers<wbr>-vienna/", "time": 1675271865, "resto": 21584555}, {"no": 21600928, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:18:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600767</a><br>Triggered kike", "time": 1675271937, "resto": 21584555}, {"no": 21600957, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)12:28:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600922</a><br>&quot;Many of those who dismiss Weininger as a serious thinker because of his alleged hatred of Jews, forget that he identified Judaism with neither a race nor a people nor a faith, but, on the contrary, with a spiritual movement or state of mind that is typical of modernism and which represents a possibility for any human being. It is nothing else than conformity and satisfaction with mediocrity. In defining Judaism thus, Weininger contrasts a higher Judaism that represents a moral ideal with a lower Judaism that represents a more non-binding aestheticism. Weininger abhorred the aesthetics of the Viennese Art Secessionists because they were totally detached from ethics and science. He makes direct reference to Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and Jewishness becomes a kind of psycho-cultural classification that is latent in contemporary Christian culture. Nietzsche\u2019s attacks on Judaism have been labelled anti-anti-Semitism. The same term may well be used to describe Weininger\u2019s position.

For example, the movie doesn&#039;t feature the zoo-scene and Batemans numerous racist remarks, and as a result i feel like the movie character is a little more tame, prob. to keep the movie more palatable for a general audience.

Its form and execution mainly and which tradition of writing does it fit in. In the Novel form, Dostoevsky and Thomas Mann, who was influenced by Dosto, are obvious comparisons. But the form of the conversation is quite different from Dosto and Mann. It has been compared to Sunset Limited but again the form that the conversation takes in Sunset limited is also quite different, and more abjectly Dostoevskian.<br><br>McCarthy might have revived and replenished Socratic dialogues for fiction. Dr. Cohen can&#039;t follow Alicia and it is precisely because he can&#039;t follow her or offer anything in the way of intellectual simulation is what shapes the conversation in Stella Maris. The book is 190 pages of &#039;Dialogues with the self&#039;. The therapist just provides the frame for the conversation to begin but as it progresses and deep into the book, Alicia and her mind unravels. McCarthy is possibly nodding at the history of western literature, which began proper with greek plays and its most modern renditions have been dominated by the solipsistic internal monologue/stream of consciousness. Alicia is a solipsist herself, and the confessional turn her rambles take on later into the book as opposed to the more balanced beginning is possibly an allegory for the evolving form of literature.

But here the narrator&#039;s direct listener is sitting with her forcing her to modulate herself and her thoughts. The Narrator is caught between two worlds due to the length and form of the conversation. McCarthy&#039;s form rescues Alicia from her own solipsism momentarily by providing a laconic listener, a witness. Cohen can&#039;t change her mind or even begin to reason with her, but it at least allows Alicia to listen to her own self. The witness changes the nature of the event even as he witnesses it, which is probably the foundational outlook of the two sibling novels.<br><br>It is quite amazing what McCarthy has done even if the weirdities are only felt and are not easily recognizable.

The scholar Robert Baker has argued that Gl\u00fcck &quot;is surely a confessional poet in some basic sense&quot;,[60] while the critic Michael Robbins has argued that Gl\u00fcck&#039;s poetry, unlike that of confessional poets Sylvia Plath or John Berryman, &quot;depends upon the fiction of privacy&quot;.[61] In other words, she cannot be a confessional poet, Robbins argues, if she does not address an audience. Going further, Quinney argues that, to Gl\u00fcck, the confessional poem is &quot;odious&quot;.[58] Others have noted that Gl\u00fcck&#039;s poems can be viewed as autobiographical, while her technique of inhabiting various personas, ranging from ancient Greek gods to garden flowers, renders her poems more than mere confessions. As the scholar Helen Vendler has noted: &quot;In their obliquity and reserve, [Gl\u00fcck&#039;s poems] offer an alternative to first-person &#039;confession&#039;, while remaining indisputably personal&quot;.</span><br>I am not an authority on Gluck, having only read a few of her poems afyer her nobel win, but what she seems to be doing has much more in common with what I described as traditional confessional literature.

I get what you&#039;re trying to say here but there&#039;s no possible way Christ didn&#039;t know people would misinterpret His words. In fact in John chapter 6 a lot of people left Jesus after He made some statements that they misinterpreted and got offended by. I don&#039;t think that was accidental, rather, the people who are not fit for God - or perhaps just not ready yet - will hear what they want to hear and miss what God is really saying in these passages. That&#039;s why Jesus often says, let him who has ears hear. The implication is that there are going to be people who misunderstand, these being the proverbial people who do not have ears, as opposed to those that do have an ear to hear.<br><br>Christ also said in John chapter 10:<br><br>&quot;But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.<br>4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.&quot;<br>(John 10:2-4)<br><br>So basically, those who are His will hear. Those who are not will not grasp the meaning of the parables or the teachings, and the miracles done before their eyes won&#039;t even convince them. Like it says in John chapter 12:<br><br>&quot;But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<br>38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br>39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,<br>40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.&quot;<br>(John 12:37-40)<br><br>So you see, if people would just take Jesus at His word, they would be able to understand. The problem is many people are blinded and always inject their own false meaning into everything. That&#039;s why they misinterpret things like Matthew 16:18, and many other things besides, reading what&#039;s not actually there. Anyone that truly has ears to hear can understand regardless. I can prove it, since Jesus said so all of those times, and I know that God never does anything in vain or for no reason. Those whom God has blinded and hardened (for good reason, as typical of God who is infinitely good) are unable to see, hear, or be converted. It&#039;s no surprise you&#039;ve got people running around saying all kinds of ridiculous things about the Bible then, or living their lives in complete opposite of what it says. That situation is purposeful by God due to God&#039;s infinite wisdom.

and Punishment rigamarole. No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1675295659, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21602650, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:00:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21600652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21600652</a><br>No. That pop sci book is line that goes down.", "time": 1675296050, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21602665, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:04:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21602626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602626</a><br>Tldr", "time": 1675296270, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21602730, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:18:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21597895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597895</a><br>lol", "time": 1675297132, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21602750, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)19:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21602454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602454</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;negative IQ</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two-dimensional enjoyment</span><br>what", "time": 1675297481, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21603356, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)21:42:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596538</a><br>Literally the quintessential pseud-core book.", "time": 1675305737, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21603732, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)23:45:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594803</a><br>&quot;the evil one&quot; is exclusively from new perverted bible versions and sounds really dumb", "time": 1675313150, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21603747, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)23:50:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21595100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21595100</a><br>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"#p21595647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21595647</a><br>It doesn&#039;t actually say anywhere in the bible that Jesus was a carpenter, people say that presumably because Jesus said he does the work of his father (talking about God the father) and interpret that as Joseph.", "time": 1675313443, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21603764, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)23:56:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21603356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21603356</a><br>I own this and I am a strange loop but only because I did a bunch of drugs and not because I&#039;m pretending to be smarter than I actually am", "time": 1675313816, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21604304, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)03:49:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594794</a><br>Somebody recommend me a couple of Mark Twain&#039;s works.", "time": 1675327750, "resto": 21594761}, {"no": 21604314, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)03:51:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594761</a><br>Bayonetta&#039;s destruction <br>Basically all futa on male femdom", "time": 1675327885, "resto": 21594761}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21598451, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:35:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "he would be a redditor today wouldnt he", "filename": "Mark_Twain_by_AF_Bradley", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 756, "h": 1061, "tn_w": 178, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675218908508194, "time": 1675218908, "md5": "fA4XnzkHBzRiziOqrglyow==", "fsize": 84757, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "he-would-be-a-redditor-today-wouldnt-he", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 27, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 21}, {"no": 21598542, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)22:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No, you fag.", "time": 1675220503, "resto": 21598451}, {"no": 21598597, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)22:15:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598451</a><br>He served as a Confederate soldier.

Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect.

Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world.

Things like Shinto seem praxial I guess as would have been the mundane interpretations of classical Mediterranean polytheism.

It is one thing to hunger spiritually for revolution and to risk one\u2019s life for it in an absurd gamble; it is something else to believe in it, to rave about it, to wrap oneself in a dream of it, to talk of nothing else, to join a handful of others in stirring up the fires of hatred and violence; or else to regard it as the most obvious, banal, and ordinary fact of life and a theme for sociologists. When revolution does occur, those dreamers and pseudo-scientists are the terrorists. The current attitude to terrorism generally fails to account for revolutionary ideology as an inexhaustible source of terrorism fed by the complacency of those who give in to it.

At one end of it a pretty poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall- likely by a sexy man. It depicted simply an enormous gay face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a biker moustache and daddy-esque features. Wankston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the elevator (which tenants had nicknamed \u2018The Pleasure Shaft\u2019) as it was always packed with the horniest of cornholers. <br><br>The flat was seven flights up, and Wankston, who was 18, was still recovering from the other night when he pounded a sexy slut.

The list had something to do with the production of piss for the town piss pigs. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque with two circular pieces of metal that seemed to hang below it, flanking the left and right lower corners respectively. Wankston cranked a knob and the voice sank somewhat, though the sarcasm and passive aggressiveness were still everpresent. The instrument (the telescreen is what it was originally called, but had later become colloquially known as \u2018The Daddy Box\u2019) could be volume adjusted to a point, but the only way to silence it completely was to not wank off for a few weeks- then have a big wank session in front of it. The facial recognition system built into the instrument would scan the users face for signs of extreme pleasure. A show of such pleasure would in turn cause the instrument itself to become horny. The instrument would then extend two mechanical arms and a mechanical appendage. The instrument would then begin masturbating itself- moaning loudly throughout. At the end of the process, the instrument would spray a foam like substance from its mechanical appendage to signify that the process was complete. The mechanical extensions of the instrument would then retract and the instrument would become unresponsive and silent for 48 hours. Yes, it was possible to silence it- but for that silence came a burden even the strongest of men would deem uncarryable. Wankston moved over to the window: he had a smallish, sexy figure. The meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the pink overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was well kept, his face perfect- strangely not marked by wrinkles despite years of smiling and winking and various other facial expressions I don\u2019t have time to go into.

The sides of the spectrum have basically flip-flopped on their pro vs. anti-social and pro vs. anti-establishment character. Troons and BIPOCs are still avant-garde and offensive in a limited sense but their radicality and dangerousness is seriously damaged by the fact that upper-middle class soccer moms, the state department, and major corporations are all on their team even if only performatively though it&#039;s probably not just that. Therein something weird happens: the retvrn to trvdition tradlarpers get casted as renegades and disturbers of the peace, which is totally alien to their own self-concept of their political/cultural identity and their intentions. Troons get social capital from historically conservative demographics and institutions, while chuds, who are apparently fighting for more conformity, more social control, more tradition, are cracked down upon by the the institutions of social control they are trying to uphold and kick into action. <br>The whole idea of people telling conservatives of all people to &quot;grow up&quot; and the like is just so strange, shouldn&#039;t they be the ones telling the rebels to grow up? And all this seems to be pretty recent, because the edgelords of the 2000s were still on the left with their atheism and no war for oil rhetoric and such. It almost seems like the establishment just put on a different face, say, a black face, around 2008 or so and it just caused people to realign themselves accordingly", "time": 1675215434, "resto": 21594818}, {"no": 21598326, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)20:59:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598256</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dunning-kruger: the post</span>", "time": 1675216764, "resto": 21594818}, {"no": 21598971, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)00:50:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594999</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yeager strikes me as a</span><br>bougie tourist hamming up a lurid phantom for critics to shadow box that ultimately reinforces various and sundry spooks&#039; own budgetary feedback loop kayfabe.

This can easily be demonstrated with the example of an inch: a unit of distance such as an inch exists as a span between zero and one, and within that span you can create infinite decimal subdivisions but you can never escape the fact that in order to have the phenomena even numerically there has to be a unity that contains multiplicity. This is what Aristotle said about time and what Kant described when he said &quot;all bodies are extended&quot;. <br>When Logos/Eros is replaced with Order/Chaos the feminine category switches from connection to something that can only be compared to disconnection. Order by itself simply refers to discrimination but that creates a problem being that discrimination only creates a category when unity contains it, otherwise the discrimination functions as a solution to chaos (which is why Peterson said he believes the purpose of the left hemisphere is to prevent the right hemisphere from having to turn on, as he theorizes that the role of the right hemisphere is to detect anomaly which the left tries to integrate).

It&#039;s commonplace that people persist in doing things that they agree are bad for them. This can happen for a variety of reasons. The simplest form is addiction. In this case short term pleasure overshadows long term harm, even overwhelming harm, and even when the subject knows that they&#039;re hurting themselves. Addicts often express that they feel they cannot change, and so take comfort in the fact that the pleasure of the addiction at least temporarily distracts them from the harm they know they&#039;re ultimately inflicting.<br><br>Another form of acting against your own interest arises from failures of social coordination. In this case, it would obviously be in everyone&#039;s interest to change behavior, but if any one person changes their behavior alone, they are worse off. The toy model of this phenomenon is the prisoner&#039;s dilemma. People in this situation will acknowledge that the social structure is incentivizing them to do harmful things, and will acknowledge that by going along with it they are thereby creating additional social pressure for others to do the same harmful things, but will say they nevertheless cannot change, because no one else will go along with it. Thus they actively support and contribute to the thing they know is harmful.<br><br>Another form of acting against your own interest is reaping rewards today at the cost of problems to be solved later. In this case the person acknowledges that the harm they are creating outweighs the immediate benefits, but because the harm comes later, they hypothesize that they will come up with a mitigation strategy later to deal with the harms. Thus they deny that the harms will really happen, even though they don&#039;t actually know how to prevent those harms. They simply stipulate that &quot;somehow&quot; we will mitigate them, with unspecific appeals to belief in Progress.<br><br>It&#039;s pretty obvious that all of these psychological and social forces are at work with technology. It creates new addictions, it creates coordination problems, it creates immediate benefits in exchange for long term crises. It does also produce legitimate benefits, like certain medical technologies. And medical technology is usually what technophiles will point to.

The first question is whether humans are better off under industrial society than the alternatives. The second is what causes industrialization to take place, and why does new technology get developed in the way and at the rate that it does. The third is what kind of measures are necessary to prevent this from happening. And the fourth is what kinds of technologies are compatible with human good, what &quot;level of technology&quot; a healthy society can exist at.<br><br>The concept of surrogate activities is introduced to explain the second question. Surrogate activities are not &quot;bad for people&quot; per se. Rather, the theory of surrogate activities partially explains why technology continues to be developed as it is, even though it has bad consequences. So the fact that a certain behavior is a surrogate activity is not a moral condemnation of it. It&#039;s just a (partial) explanation of why something is happening.<br><br>Now, whether something qualifies as &quot;immoral under this regime&quot; is a very loaded question. Certainly your question presumes that the answer to question three above is that we need an anti-technology political regime. But my comments in previous posts about Ancient Egypt are a challenge to this presumption. Egyptian kingdoms did not have an anti-technology ideology, but maintained political and cultural continuity for thousands of years without undergoing industrialization. What explains this? Either industrialization naturally takes many thousands of years, or not all civilizations are structured in a way that guarantees an industrial explosion. In either case it appears that an Anti-Tech Police Force is really not necessary.

The system is about to fall.<br><br>And we can learn this by observing the Roman Empire and it&#039;s decline.<br>The Zenith of the Empire was during the Antonines, when the empire reached it&#039;s peak limits with Trajan. The succession of Commodus and the establishment of the Severan dinasty brought too much corruption to the Empire. Provinces didn&#039;t feel as accountable to Rome as much as before and after the fall of the Severan the corrupt the Praetorian Guard even managed to sell the throne of Rome for the highest bid after the death of Pertinax. So, after reaching its highest, Rome became corrupt, bureaucratic and unable to maintain control of its borders. The crisis of the Third Century resulted in terrible outcomes that we can see in the decline of the arts and architecture.<br><br>What people don&#039;t realize is that the aftermath of the crisis meant also a sort of &quot;energy crisis&quot; in Rome. Firstly, because the empire could no longer maintain coinage as before and archeologists can see that Rome was already having problems with bullions even before Constantine. Another reason was the environmental destruction, considering the importance of charcoal and the lack of this essential resource crippled Roman metal works. The other and more efficient resource was charcoal, that came primarily from Britain and became more pricy, since mining this resource became more expensive, problems of corruption and of course, barbarian incursions in that region. This lead to a poorer infrastructure, soldiers wouldn&#039;t have access to weapons and armors of quality, petty disputes paved way to barbarians to strike and last but not least, environmental factors brought more barbarian migrations and the arrival of the Huns.<br><br>My point is, with energy crisis, a growing population, the current corruption of establishment politics and the dependency of foreign markets make both the West and China (the bastions of technology btw) weak. It gives us opportunities to strike.<br>The current goal should be exporting Kaczynski&#039;s ideas to Chinese misfits. This shouldn&#039;t be hard, since young Chinese men have no life perspectives, are condemned to be incels and they are smart enough to read and comprehend the text.<br>A group of militants in both the West and China will overwhelm the system, and it will halt the system when we turn ideas into action.

Monasticism was a sort of a rebellious movement in Ancient Rome, the early monks were seen as hardcore outcasts. However, they helped to spread the religion and some monks started to influence politics, one example is St. Thelemachus, who is credited as influencing the emperor to ban gladiator games, another example is St. Simeon Stylites, whose awful smell could be felt from a long distance, yet the Byzantine emperor would often visit him seeking spiritual and political advise.<br>2. The hippie movement started as a bunch of outcasts, it was important as a resistance against the Vietnam war and its consequences were so significant that liberal boomers to this day still think in the lines of their former hippie years.<br>3. The punk movement started in the industry of music and became a major political platform for anti-war ideas, the punk and hardcore bands were very important to criticize Bush&#039;s wars and contributed to the unpopularity of that president among the youth.<br>4. The black metal movement in Norway influenced many adolescents and young adults to copycat a fringe minority group of Oslo and do a lot of mischief. To this day, black metal is the major cultural export of Norway.<br><br>This goes along with Kaczynski&#039;s case studies presented in the ATR:W&amp;H, where he discuss Lenin, Mao, Fascists etc.<br>The only difference of my propositions is that I believe there is a Gramscian way of making the revolution softer.<br>THIS IS A SAMIZDAT REVOLUTION.", "time": 1675292307, "resto": 21602134}, {"no": 21602375, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)18:01:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21602367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21602367</a><br>ON THE FEAR OF DEATH<br><br>If you are commited to the cause, you should not fear repression, imprisonment or death.

But they will never go beyond that. They will never actually do a new Russian Revolution.<br>Why?

Many were killed, but the empire ended up bowing to the cross.<br>Can&#039;t we say the same about Islam? The only difference was the use of the sword. Started with small tribes, raging and pillaging. Not afraid to die because they believed in a higher truth.<br>Mormons were ready to die by crossing the poorly charted parts of the United States, suffering from illnesses and thirst, in order to reach the Salt Lake area and institute their state of Deseret.<br>What about the Russian Revolution? The red army was assembled by whom if not by people who weren&#039;t afraid of dying? They were ready to do anything for their cause, even if it meant death.<br>We can say the same about China.<br>The Israelis took everything they had and went to build these kibbutz in what they called Zion.

If you practice &quot;chaos magic&quot; or &quot;enochian magic&quot;, all you are doing is destroying your own being; you will be driven mad by demons and will enter into Hell while alive.<br><a href=\"#p21599479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21599479</a><br>Christianity has that as a failsafe against counter-initiatory forces.

Don&#039;t mean to be snappy. But first of all, esoteric has more meanings than Guenon&#039;s definition. That&#039;s a pet peeve. Be a Guenonian all you want. But he is as idiosynchratic as anyone else on the list. Also it is funny that you praise Hanegraaf. He is quite critical of Guenon and Evola in esotericism and the academy. The list does perhaps lack some thirdness. That is because I am not trying to push an agenda however. I am Christian myself. Had an occult phase but over it. Enjoy the esoteric but do not consider it monolithic as do Guenonians. In whatever case, I meant the guide as a general suggestion list and overview of the tradition as a whole with judgement suspended -- in the same way a teacher will give a survey of thinkers they both agree and disagree with as part of a course to teach history and transmission of tradition and the evolution of the canon and such...<br><br>Which authors do you disagree with?

Not a fan of dee either but influential regardless.<br><br>Regarding contemporary, whatever thoughts on Fortune, Crowley, Spare, &amp; Grant they are some of most well-known occultists today. Chaos is silly I agree which is why I said it was optional even in such a wide ranging list. Snell / Dukes and Hine even ended up going toward more traditional routes of occultism later as well (ceremonial and tantra respectively). Despite lineage from and similarities to aforementioned, as a Guenonian I think you may enjoy Chumbley. Very syncretic. Possibly inverted symbolism. But his philosophical essays are influenced by traditionalist school. Opuscula Magica. Mysticism, Initiation, and Dream. Interesting stuff.<br><br>Chumbley does a reasonable job of defending witchcraft. But Wilby and Ginzburg do better. Eliadean shamanism. Neither necessarily tradition nor counter-tradition.

For me, the &quot;trick&quot; is to trick yourself into not wanting any tricks. It has to become an actual quest. You have to accept that it&#039;s a lifelong thing, that you may even only be doing it for others in the future for example, maybe in this darkened age the astral light has been blocked to such an extent that your role can only be to collate and present knowledge that will enable the light to be uncovered by some future generation.

The famed &quot;Catholic guilt&quot; is one of the great &quot;negaters&quot; of egoistic self-enclosure, and thus one of the great &quot;openers&quot; onto true wisdom. <br><br>These experiences of self-negation, the solvere that precedes coagulare, are comparatively harder to come by in an the wisdom-seeking/gnostic (lowercase), because in this modern age &quot;knowing&quot; (gignoskein) has collapsed all the different forms of knowledge, from merely sensuous and merely ratiocinative thinking to full-fledged wisdom and nondual insight, into an amorphous single category. So when people go seeking &quot;wisdom,&quot; they think &quot;I want to KNOW in the highest sense,&quot; but because the category of KNOWING they are invoking is so blurry and amorphous, they think &quot;knowing&quot; must just be a particularly intense form of what their near-animal, sensuous-but-served-by-clever-ratio<wbr>cination modern consciousness does every day. Moral/religious humility is one of the few experiences still available today that can jar one out of this initial, &quot;sleepwalking and dreaming that one is awake&quot; state that modern man starts in. It&#039;s one of the few great negations one can still experience today. One can then (hopefully) see an analogous process that needs to take place in the sphere of wisdom. <br><br>The cosmos only reveals itself to man once he has retracted into himself and realized how infinitesimally small he is in comparison to it. But this is because he is its antipode, microcosmos to macrocosmos. The inevitably next step after this retraction is the realization of &quot;thou art that,&quot; of identity WITH the cosmos, and the beginning of true vision into the correspondences linking one&#039;s self with the self of the cosmos. But if you tell someone this while they&#039;re still in the sleepwalking state, they will interpret it as applying to their egoistic sleepwalker pseudo-self.

I do think that it would be interesting to see which traditional planet is attributed with the negative phenomenon of pride/arrogance.<br>As to the reason why Saturn is associated with limit, I think it has to do with two things. First, Saturn is the dimmest planet in the sky. It carries connotations of weakness, endings, the expending of strength and finality. Second, Saturn is traditionally the most external planet - if Earth is the centre, and all the other planets form concentric circles around this circle, Saturn is the final circle, the edge of the cosmos. It marks the outer limit and the end of life and light, both celestial and human. Further, as a symbol of the outer limit, it is also a symbol of time and death, hence why Saturn was also known as Kronos or the star of Kronos. Everything exists and lives on its appropriate plane, and carries on its journey, until the very end, at which point Saturn collects what is due and dispenses death - the meaning of the life is therefore forced to be constrained within a beginning and an end, giving mortal beings a kind of imperative to attend to our tasks, needs and duties - this is why Saturn is the lord of organisation, control, discipline, mastery and authority, in addition to being a lord of disaster, pain, suffering and death.<br><a href=\"#p21589629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589629</a><br>That&#039;s probably the Saturnine era conceived in cthonic terms, the cthonic demon Saturn rather than the celestial Saturn.", "time": 1675042875, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589721, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the greeks and romans are not western btw", "time": 1675042997, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589728, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585665</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I always assumed that this was merely some commonplace reactionary diatribe,</span><br>Spengler was part Jewish friend.", "time": 1675043077, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589758, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589608</a><br>Who said this 2000 years ago?

The history of ancient warfare is normally nomadic pastoralists leading widescale invasions (entire peoples migrating in a violent wave or waves, see Germanic Migrations, Mongol migrations, Turkic Migrations, Aryan Migrations, etc.).

The large armies with advanced food logistics of Babylon, Egypt etc were already in the throes of aristocratic rule. <br><br>Joseph Campbell talks about the origins of farming, and it wasn&#039;t organized and hierarchical.

He termed one group as symbolized by the &quot;Animal&quot;, and others as symbolized by the &quot;Plant&quot;. <br>Now when he said &quot;animal&quot; he wasn&#039;t referring to just any ol animal, but to hunters, like wolves. So i would say there are some humans that have wolf-like temperaments (Algernon Herbert talks about Nimrod and how he made a religion of this wolf temperament). But they&#039;re the minority. Most people are peaceful. Sure they&#039;ll get in scuffles, but that&#039;s totally different than the psychopathic behavior that is a requirement to literally enslave and slaughter others on a massive scale. <br>Yes, Dionysian&#039;s weakness is that it still needs to defend itself from the Apollonian wolf temperament (incidentally, Apollo is sometimes symbolized by a wolf). <br><br>A democratic republic (like Rome had at certain points in its history, or like the US) is a balance between the two factions. Maybe that&#039;s the best we can hope for, though they never last because INEVITABLY the elite faction wants more (it&#039;s in their nature). Maybe it&#039;s because they have more kids, and then their kids have more kids, etc etc, so that in order to maintain their lavish lifestyles they&#039;re &quot;forced&quot; (though really, it&#039;s a choice) to squeeze the peasants more, eventually collapsing the balance and peasants are back to being cattle. <br><br>The Dionysian types, per Algernon Herbert, did often fight back, but often times would lose to being outnumbered. Then they&#039;d flee in ships to new lands. <br>Maybe the gnostics are right and we&#039;re in hell and there is no path for the Dionysians to just live in peace.", "time": 1675191373, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21596889, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)14:05:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585665</a><br>Did you completely miss the part where Spengler rants about money?

Art in Weininger and Rousseau&#039;s time meant &#039;talent&#039;, so in a sense Weininger was just as anti art as Rousseau. This type of talented art is conditional, so it actually becomes a problem for an unconditional masculinity. Weininger wasn&#039;t saying men are best because they have more terrestrial skill, it&#039;s just easy for the genius to have whatever terrestrial talent appeals to the original Dostoyevskyean mission of counter balancing the external with the internal. The genius has powerful internal secretions that allow him to form strong mental sinew connections through ethical caring that leaves no lapses, no flubbing a note in a song or writing with bad grammar. He can trivially hypnotic snap himself into becoming talented with any relation that increases the internal sinews. He is brought on by the honey of the oak to the laurel&#039;s knowledge of the future. But It&#039;s not about talent, or the honey, performance, display, these are just signs of the strength of the initial feeling of worth, this talent becomes lapses in itself (origin of homosexuality), and the craft becomes the last cloud of ignorance. Honey is sticky. <br>God; the simple beginning: Life under the moon; the multi-varied end. It&#039;s not about talented ends, but creating strong beginnings that absorb so much of the simple first causes that they literally eclipse the world and make it seem incredibly small. This may be only really possible through Dostoyevsky. Only masculinity and maleness has the internal secretions strong enough to be unconditional and absorb first causes against the influence of the multi-varied ends, the ends require conditions of law to have a more stable environment to syphon the causes from humans, and this type of law world cancels real morality and engagement between moral beings because morality can never activate from the root of law, or uncondiality (Job&#039;s crime).", "time": 1675284748, "resto": 21599909}, {"no": 21601849, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)15:54:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21601675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21601675</a><br>actually my great-grandmother knew his great-grandmother in pre-WWI Europe and said she was compulsive liar and a whore who let retarded people fuck her, my great-granduncle and great-great-grandfather also fucked her but only as a joke and not because they were retarded which they weren&#039;t", "time": 1675284895, "resto": 21599909}, {"no": 21601898, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:08:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21601689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21601689</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;btfoing seething troons from the grave</span><br>absolutely based", "time": 1675285724, "resto": 21599909}, {"no": 21601944, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21601689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21601689</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m glad he&#039;s dead</span><br>...yeah, he was born 1788.....", "time": 1675286436, "resto": 21599909}, {"no": 21602045, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:40:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21601421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21601421</a><br>This.", "time": 1675287615, "resto": 21599909}, {"no": 21602111, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)16:52:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21599909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21599909</a><br>Same problem all philosophers have.
