Secondly, Mishima&#039;s view of death is a whitepill because it re-contextualizes death as the object of life.<br>For the average normie, death is a bad thing-- something to be feared and despised. To Mishima, death made the greatest virtues possible. Death proves the sincerity of one&#039;s beliefs and actions and lends meaning to life. Is it really better to live for the sake of living? To chase after pleasures for 80 years and die a drooling retard in a hospice? You will die no matter what. If you live your life chasing after wealth and pleasure, you will lose everything regardless- you will even lose your death. What a meaningless death: bedridden, demented, and bespeckled with fetid sores and shit filled diapers. To the man that charges head first into death, he will gain exactly what he wished for: Death. His life and death becomes a poem crystallized into the annals of time; whether he is remembered or forgotten, his death remains eternal.<br>Mishima had a burning desire to help his people throw off the shackles of materialist nihilism, and he died to prove the sincerity of the words he had written and spoken his entire life. He did not commit suicide, he demonstrated his concept of unflinching loyalty and dedication, succinctly explain in Runaway Horses:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cLike the men of the League, I would cut open my stomach.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIndeed?\u201d The martial prince\u2019s expression indicated that he had grown used to hearing such answers. \u201cWell, then, if he was pleased, what would you do?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isao replied without the least hesitation: \u201cIn that case, too, I would cut open my stomach at once.\u201d </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cOh?\u201d For the first time a gleam of interest flashed from the Prince\u2019s eye. \u201cAnd what would be the meaning of that?

It refers to loyalty. Suppose I make steaming rice balls with rice so hot it burns my hands. My sole purpose is to present them to His Majesty, to offer them in his sacred presence. Now as to the outcome. If his Majesty is not hungry, he will curtly refuse my offering or perhaps he may even be pleased to say: \u2018Am I to eat food so tasteless?\u2019 and hurl it into my face. In which case I will have to withdraw, the grains of rice still clinging to my face, and gratefully cut open my stomach at once. Then, again, if His Majesty is hungry and is pleased to eat the rice balls with satisfaction, there will still be no course of action open to me but to withdraw at once and gratefully cut open my stomach. Why? To make rice balls to serve as food for His Sacred Majesty with hands so common is a sin worthy to be punished with a thousand deaths. But, then, suppose I were to make rice balls as an offering but keep them in my hands and not present them, what would happen then? After a while the rice would certainly rot. This, too, would be an act of loyalty, I suppose, but I would call it a loyalty without courage. Courageous loyalty belongs to the man who, with no fear of death, dares to present the rice balls that he has thus made with single-minded devotion.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhile knowing he\u2019s sinning? Is that what he\u2019s to do?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYes, Your Highness. The gentlemen of the military, Your Highness foremost among them, are indeed fortunate. For the soldier\u2019s loyalty rests in casting away his life in obedience to the Emperor\u2019s commands. But in the case of an ordinary civilian, he must be prepared to sin by reason of his unsanctioned loyalty.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201c\u2018Obey the law\u2019\u2014isn\u2019t that a command of His Majesty? And the law courts\u2014 they are, after all, His Majesty\u2019s courts.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe sins I refer to have nothing to do with the law. And the greatest sin is that of a man who, finding himself in a world where the sacred light of His Majesty is obscured, nevertheless determines to go on living without doing anything about it. The only way to purge this grave sin is to make a fiery offering with one\u2019s own hands, even if that itself is a sin, to express one\u2019s loyalty in action, and then to commit seppuku immediately. With death, all is purified. But as long as a man goes on living, he can\u2019t move either right or left, or take any action whatever, without sinning.\u201d</span>", "filename": "mishima", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1800, "h": 2266, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673785791826623, "time": 1673785791, "md5": "5698dme4JBqypPEPu1Z68w==", "fsize": 649129, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21528720, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)07:30:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528634</a><br>I genuinely wonder how the Emperor must have felt when Mishima pulled his stunt.

I have always the same experience over, again, and always make a new effort against it; for although it is evident to me I do not want to believe it: in the greater number of men the intellectual conscience is lacking; indeed, it would often seem to me that in demanding such a thing, one is as solitary in the largest cities as in the desert. Everyone looks at you with strange eyes and continues to make use of his scales, calling this good and that bad; and no one blushes for shame when you remark that these weights are not the full amount, - there is also no indignation against you; perhaps they laugh at your doubt, mean to say that the greater number of people do not find it contemptible to believe this or that, and live according to it, without having been previously aware of the ultimate and surest reasons for and against it, and without even giving themselves any trouble about such reasons afterwards, the most lifted men and the noblest women still belong to this &quot;greater number.&quot; But what is kind-heartedness, refinement and genius to me, if he who has these virtues harbours indolent sentiments in belief and judgment, if the longing for certainty does not rule in him, as his innermost desire and profoundest need - as that which separates higher from lower men! In certain pious people I have found a hatred of reason, and have been favourably disposed to them for it: their bad intellectual conscience at least still betrayed itself, in this manner! But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discors and all the marvellous uncertainty and ambiguity of existence, and not to question, not to tremble with desire and delight in questioning, not even to hate the questioner - perhaps even to make merry over him to the extent of weariness - that is what I regard as contemptible, and it is this sentiment which I first of all search for in every one, - some folly or other always persuades me anew that every man has this sentiment, as man.

Corey (Daniel Abraham &amp; Ty Franck)<br><br>This is the book where the divergence of the TV series became noticeable in major ways for me. One prevalent difference is that the tv series has considerably more drama between characters and organizations. The plot revolves about the differing reactions to a protomolecule artifact that teases far greater expanses will be explored in the future and hints at what happened in the deep past.<br><br>James Holden is the only reoccurring viewpoint character thus far. The other viewpoints are contained to their single book. By comparison the TV series introduced several of the characters much earlier and continued following them. I think that&#039;s the better approach. It may be more realistic that once a character fulfills their role in relation to main character they fade away from the narrative, but that doesn&#039;t make it the better choice. I didn&#039;t notice it as much in TV series, but for the viewpoint characters of the books, they&#039;re all obsessive and reckless bordering on being self-destructive. I have to wonder if there will be one who isn&#039;t. I&#039;m uncertain whether that&#039;s just my perspective.<br><br>For Holden, if the first book is the exaltation, and the second the rebuke, then this is the humbling. He&#039;s no longer the Choosing One, he&#039;s now the Chosen One, that&#039;s how he sees it anyway and he detests that. The problem with being Chosen is that rather limits your personal freedom and what one can do with their life. That&#039;s not at all what Holden wants since he now thinks he&#039;s free to do anything. Holden tries to escape what he believes to be his destiny, but but he&#039;s forced to confront it, which makes its resolution all the more amusing to me.<br><br>Carlos c de Baca, &quot;Bull&quot;, the head of security for the Behemoth, isn&#039;t introduced into the tv series until what would be book 5. Bull is ok, but I like the tv version of Camina Drummer more, which is who fills most of his book role, though she hasn&#039;t been introduced in the books yet. I suppose it&#039;s because since so many characters are introduced so much earlier in the TV series that they have to displace the original roles to keep their storylines going.<br><br>Melba, and her quickly revealed actual identity, may be most baffling character in the both the book and tv series to me. It&#039;s not that I dislike the character so much as it baffles me by how often and with such intensity that she changes and how others react to that. I feel like she&#039;s more to make a thematic statement about what the series is about rather and then a fully developed character.<br><br>Annushka &quot;Anna&quot; Volvodov, a Methodist pastor, is better in the book. Too much was changed for the worse about her, especially the shift from outsider to insider status. She&#039;s also basically a different character as well.<br><br>Although this is worse than the previous books, it&#039;s not so much that I&#039;d only call it decent.

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. Lem liked to imagine Sisyphus happy. Sissyphus may be the name of a porn star Lem liked<br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle.

It&#039;s perhaps too sudden to say it doesn&#039;t begin with action. There&#039;s lots of dialogue and you&#039;ve got to be careful using so much. When a character&#039;s words are defined in a text they should be important and telling, otherwise when they say something of genuine importance it might be overlooked by the reader if they&#039;ve been speaking about mundane subjects a lot already. As for your older character, I&#039;m not comfortable with how he&#039;s simply called &quot;Old Man&quot; as if that&#039;s his name. You should write &quot;The old man&quot; and change how you say it from time to time, such as<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The wrinkled gentleman smiled</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The gray-haired man stated</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The older fella asked</span><br>instead of capitalising &quot;Old Man&quot; each time.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Old Man did this</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Old Man said that</span><br>Doesn&#039;t work.<br>Again, going back to how much dialogue you use.

And when you finally managed to get your energy level above 1,000, you glanced up at a mirror (there&#039;s a mirror in there, wherever you&#039;re dancing off death) and -- wow. Is that dancing? Is that me dancing? Good God. But your energy level is at 1,200 and climbing. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What would you do? </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;d keep dancing like that. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If people out in the hall were laughing at you, you&#039;d feel: &quot;Okay, sure, laugh away -- my dancing is not perfect, but at least I&#039;m not dead.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The writer has to write in whatever way produces the necessary energy. For Turgenev to get his energy level up above 1,000, he had to make those dossiers [i.e. his wordy and unnecessarily detailed character descriptions]. He had to admit that he wasn&#039;t good at integrating description and action. He had to plunge ahead, doing things his way, or die. He had to look honestly at himself and conclude, &quot;Yep, Mr. Nabokov is right as usual, even though he hasn&#039;t even been born yet: my literary genius does fall short on the score of naturally discovering ways of telling the story which would equal the originality of my descriptive art. But what am I supposed to do?&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s hard to get any beauty at all into a story. If and when we do, it might not be the type of beauty we&#039;ve always dreamed of making. But we have to take whatever beauty we can get, however we can get it. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I teach &quot;The Singers&quot; to suggest to my students how little choice we have about what kind of writer we&#039;ll turn out to be. As young writers, we all have romantic dreams of being a writer of a certain kind, of joining a certain lineage. A painstaking realist, maybe; a Nabokovian stylist; a deeply spiritual writer like Marilynne Robinson-whatever. But sometimes the world, via its tepid response to prose written in that mode, tells us that we are not, in fact, that kind of writer. So we have to find another approach, one that will get us up above the required 1,000 units. We have to become whatever writer is capable of producing the necessary level of energy.</span>", "filename": "cal-shakes", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 879, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673700324937409, "time": 1673700324, "md5": "7elDoxEnfefPOMS/D7ILOw==", "fsize": 74873, "resto": 21518170}, {"no": 21524133, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:14:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why are there so many crabs in this hobby?", "time": 1673702059, "resto": 21518170}, {"no": 21524137, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:14:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21524133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21524133</a><br>What&#039;s a crab?", "time": 1673702087, "resto": 21518170}, {"no": 21524147, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)08:19:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is difficult for me to say with certainty whether or not you have a unique and distinctive writing style, as I am only evaluating a small excerpt of your work.

The use of long and complex sentences, disjointed and stream-of-consciousness narrative, and the mixing of high and low-brow language are all techniques that are commonly associated with these authors. Additionally, the use of the frame narrative and the lack of traditional structure within the poem, as you have mentioned, do add a unique aspect to the writing.

Why?\u201d the little girl asked. <br> \u201cI don\u2019t currently have any spells,\u201d I replied.<br>\u201cOh, well you should learn some!\u201d<br>\u201cI fully intend to, young lady, but to do so, I will need to complete various tasks to raise my levels and unlock skills.\u201d<br>\u201cWell\u2026 okay!\u201d <br> There was nothing to do but to use my own physical strength to pull out the leaves and branches inside the fountain. It took a few hours, but eventually it was done. The pile of leaves lay nearby, but I have no rake to dispose of it. I looked around and found the night soil collector walking by. <br> \u201cGood day. May I borrow your wagon for just a bit?\u201d I asked him. <br> \u201cIt\u2019s gonna cost ya. Oh just a pretty penny. Or better, you run my collection and round today. Just five buildings and you\u2019ll be done. A fair trade.\u201d<br> \u201cVery well. I shall do your job today. It would not be hard for a Dark Lord like myself,\u201d I said, \u201clittle girl, wait right there. I need to help the night soil collector.\u201d <br> \u201cOkay! Bye bye! I\u2019ll be at the chief\u2019s house!\u201d<br> I took the wagon, mixed the leaves and branches with the excrement, and pushed the heavy pile towards the river banks. The heavy weight of the contents exerted my muscles quickly; forcing me to breathe heavily. Foul odors from unknown places entered my lungs causing me to quickly gag. Luckily, living near a pile of feces itself boosted my stamina and tolerance for pain a good three points. It was still painful to push up the pile, but tolerable. I reached the end of the river and dumped the pile. I quickly collapsed onto my rear watching the trash wash down the river.", "time": 1673723818, "resto": 21518170}, {"no": 21525495, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)14:17:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21525490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21525490</a><br>You got it down to a t.

I had no choice but to sleep in an alleyway for the night. I slept peacefully for what I believe to be a good two to three hours. A scratch against my large toe woke me. I kicked away what bit me and the mass of the object was much larger than I anticipated. Adrenaline exploded inside me \u2014 my eyes were wide awake. In front of me, a disgustingly large rat glared at me. It was unafraid of me. Odd. Most critters would run at the first sign of movement, but not this one. It stood on its hind legs chittering away ready to sink its large yellow fangs into my flesh. It struck! A leap toward my face trying to take a bite of whatever it could. I swung out my arm as quickly as I could out of instinct. By luck of gods, or fate, my arm connected against its body and flung it toward the wall. It was not done. I quickly rose to my feet and clenched my fist. I may not have any spells or weapons, but the knuckles inside should offer plenty of pain the moment I connect my fist to the rat\u2019s face. It jumped at me again and I jabbed a straight right. It smacked it in its jaw, breaking its two front teeth and causing it to stumble \u2014 stunned. I took my foot and smashed the creature, ending its life. It faded into a dark smoke entering my body. It was no regular rat. That was an eidolon. <br>A chime entered my body, a sound that I haven\u2019t heard in over five hundred years \u2014 I leveled up. The eidolon provided more experience points than I anticipated. It also dropped a skill card. A magical card that allows for its user to choose a new spell or technique, often related to the eidolon. It was the poison fang skill. A completely worthless skill. I have zero desire to bite someone to infect them with poison. It&#039;s completely counter-intuitive, biting into someone would more than likely infect me with disease. Nonetheless, I placed the skill card inside my pocket. It could be useful later.

To begin with man is bound to Earth, considering only the needs of their body and indeed eking out an existence from the labor that is attached to land, and the peasants never graduated past this base point.<br>The thinking man then looked upward and came to know of the great wide world of thought and learning and wisdom far beyond the Earth, and they study with a ravenous, new hunger all things, flitting away as a feather carried by the wind, they become Air.<br>Air however is able to do very little, and indeed this learning does not turn to anything useful until a true passion is discovered, and thus is Air transformed to Fire, as a cause or a deeply beloved pursuit is discovered. Through Fire comes light and warmth and all things worthy, and yet it may also consume the man entirely, and one can only burn for so long until they are utterly spent.<br>Those who survive this trial and come out the other side tempered with wisdom from experience, indeed develope temperance itself and moderation, they then become like Water, seeping into every crevice through the path of least resistance; with reason they douse the Fire of others and nurture those who still dwell in the Earth, and though they may be shaken by the ever blowing winds of the studious Air, in time Water always settles to its container, filling it and offering both a profound depth and a mirror of the very heavens.<br>I thought it all well said, but Mortimer asked me then if still waters wouldn&#039;t simply stagnate and grow foul and bitter.

If abstracta lack causal powers and spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them.<br><br>Some, such as Ernst Mally, Edward Zalta and arguably, Plato in his Theory of Forms, have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of metaphysics or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions.<br><br>In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel.<br><br>Gottlob Frege said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a third realm, different from the external world or from internal consciousness.", "filename": "745eecfaf1ba293c4c1662e6289661c9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 452, "h": 600, "tn_w": 94, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673752554725998, "time": 1673752554, "md5": "kWTpr1T+78CcMPcugVHqXQ==", "fsize": 48142, "resto": 21527281}, {"no": 21527312, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)22:19:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m about to have a really weird night guys.", "time": 1673752757, "resto": 21527281}, {"no": 21527318, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)22:20:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21527312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21527312</a><br>Share with us little buddy...", "time": 1673752833, "resto": 21527281}, {"no": 21527319, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)22:20:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21527300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21527300</a><br>Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br>Heaven (third realm), Earth and Mind.<br>The number 1, one physical apple, the idea of 1.", "time": 1673752840, "resto": 21527281}, {"no": 21527326, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)22:22:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21527281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21527281</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5 years old</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have constant nightmares</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they get worse as I get older</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be 9 years old</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nightmares are so intense and frequent that I start having waking nightmares</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes can&#039;t distinguish between being awake or asleep</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes the nightmare continues while I&#039;m awake and I imagine the monster getting angrier and angrier at me for not going back to bed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;every time I fall asleep I resume the nightmare from where I woke from it</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;every night is constant terror</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes stay awake for days straight to avoid sleeping</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age 10</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nightmares get more disturbing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fat women mutilated into the shape of a giant toothed starfish consuming me, tentacled monsters pulling me in, toys trying to kill me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nightmares become esoteric to the point of being &quot;meta-dreams&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age 15-17</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i dream that i&#039;m dreaming, and I know I&#039;m dreaming in the dream, but I can&#039;t wake up and while in the dream I feel like the dream rules are true and affect reality</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dreams become related to eldritch abominations and eternal torment that result from breaking small rules</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when I successfully force myself awake I sometimes have sleep paralysis and &quot;waking nightmares&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age 18</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nightmares slow down, but sometimes I have dream entities appear immediately before I fall asleep or immediately afterward</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age 19+</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very few nightmares and now no dreams or nightmares at all</span>", "filename": "forest", "ext": ".png", "w": 624, "h": 352, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673752929296405, "time": 1673752929, "md5": "Ajz6i84fwre1CHgEDpIyJw==", "fsize": 201805, "resto": 21527281}, {"no": 21527327, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)22:22:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"/lit/thread/21519351#p21527245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21527245</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After culture has been successfully broken down and homogenized the proles will be reduced to insects working for billionaire neo-feudal jews.

ALL of the Mormons are out there learning languages, going through months of intensive training seminars, leaving their lives behind for years to work for their church, going from suburban softies to learn homesteading and family-defending skills in organized groups, engaging in nepotism that must absolutely horrify whatever council of rabbis is tasked with monitoring their progress, and in general actively engaging with other Mormons to build something every single fucking day with a level of energy and enthusiasm that simply does not exist elsewhere in the west, probably in the world.<br>It&#039;s a shame because their theology is very silly, but there&#039;s absolutely nothing silly about Mormons themselves.

But over the last few years that is precisely what has happened: Just look at the recent debates over America\u2019s legacy of slavery, what can be taught in public schools about the nation\u2019s founders and even the definition of what constitutes fascism. The interpretation of the American past has not in recent memory been as public or as contentious as it is now.</span>", "filename": "7F9D7003-85C7-4014-A81B-CEC7D0C93542", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1170, "h": 2026, "tn_w": 144, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673740602358965, "time": 1673740602, "md5": "iP8PKCtTIeprp3qBAk8GJA==", "fsize": 756440, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-the-humanities-are-dying", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 184, "images": 18, "unique_ips": 57}, {"no": 21526603, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:57:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21526600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21526600</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe it started with The New York Times Magazine\u2019s 1619 Project, which sought to \u201creframe the country\u2019s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative\u201d and which accompanied a national reckoning around race. That provoked, perhaps inevitably, a right-wing backlash in the form of \u201cThe 1776 Report,\u201d a triumphalist, Donald Trump-directed effort. Then came a raft of laws in conservative-governed states across the country aiming to restrict and control how history is taught in public schools.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;History, as the historian Matthew Karp has written, has become \u201ca new kind of political priority\u201d for people across the political spectrum, a means to fight over what it is to be an American: which values we should emphasize, which groups we should honor, which injustices we should redress.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The historical profession has likewise been roiled by controversy. Last August, James H. Sweet, the president of the American Historical Association, published an essay in which he argued that present-focused narratives of African slavery often represent \u201chistorical erasures and narrow politics.\u201d The piece engendered a firestorm of reproach, with scholars variously accusing Dr. Sweet of attempting to delegitimize new research on topics including race and gender; some even accused Dr. Sweet of outright racism.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet as Americans fight over their history, the historical profession itself is in rapid \u2014 maybe even terminal \u2014 decline. Twelve days after Dr. Sweet published his column, the A.H.A. released a \u201cJobs Report\u201d that makes for grim reading: The average number of available new \u201ctenure track\u201d university jobs, which are secure jobs that provide living wages, benefits and stability, between 2020 and 2022 was 16 percent lower than it was for the four years before the pandemic.</span>", "time": 1673740677, "resto": 21526600}, {"no": 21526606, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)18:59:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21526603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21526603</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The report further notes that only 27 percent of those who received a Ph.D. in history in 2017 were employed as tenure track professors four years later. The work of historians has been \u201cde-professionalized,\u201d and people like myself, who have tenure track jobs, will be increasingly rare in coming years. This is true for all academic fields, not just history. As Adrianna Kezar, Tom DePaola and Daniel T. Scott note in their book \u201cThe Gig Academy,\u201d about 70 percent of all college professors work off the tenure track. The majority of these professors make less than $3,500 per course, according to a 2020 report by the American Federation of Teachers. Jobs that used to allow professors to live middle-class lives now barely enable them to keep their heads above water.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is to blame? In the past generation the American university has undergone a drastic transformation. To reduce costs, university administrators have dramatically reduced tenure. And as the protections of tenure have withered away, the size of nonteaching university staffs have exploded. Between 1976 and 2018, \u201cfull-time administrators and other professionals employed by those institutions increased by 164 percent and 452 percent, respectively,\u201d according to a 2021 paper on the topic. Professors have been sacrificed on the altar of vice deans.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, in an effort to fund research that might redound to their financial benefit and to demonstrate their pragmatic value to politicians and to the public, universities have emphasized science, technology, engineering and math at the expense of the humanities. As the American Academy of Arts and Sciences reported, citing data from 2019, \u201cspending for humanities research equaled 0.7 percent of the amount dedicated to STEM R.&amp;D.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The humanities, including history, are often considered more an object of ridicule than a legitimate lane of study. Look no further than statements from politicians: Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, assembled a task force in 2012 that recommended that people who major in history and other humanities fields be charged higher tuition at state universities. In 2016, Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky said that \u201cFrench literature majors\u201d should not receive state funding for their degrees. Even more recently, in 2021, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida mocked people who go into debt to \u201cend up with degrees in things like zombie studies.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Republicans: President Barack Obama remarked in 2014 that \u201cfolks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree,\u201d implying that if a degree didn\u2019t make money it wasn\u2019t worth it. (Mr. Obama later apologized to a University of Texas art historian for his remarks, clarifying that he did believe art history was a valuable subject.)</span>", "time": 1673740775, "resto": 21526600}, {"no": 21526612, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:01:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21526606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21526606</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These material and ideological assaults have engendered a steep decline in undergraduate humanities majors. In the 2018-19 academic year, only 23,923 graduating undergraduates received degrees in history and related fields, which, the A.H.A. notes, is \u201cdown more than a third from 2012 and the smallest number awarded since the late 1980s.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Private groups, which traditionally provided significant financial support to budding humanities scholars, have taken the hint and increasingly stopped supporting the humanities and soft social sciences. The Social Science Research Council recently ended its International Dissertation Research Fellowship program, which in the last 25 years funded over 1,600 scholars exploring \u201cnon-U.S. cultures\u201d and \u201cU.S. Indigenous communities,\u201d declaring that the program \u201caccomplished many of the goals it had set for itself.\u201d The Ford Foundation has similarly decided to conclude its long-running National Academies fellowship program for historically marginalized scholars in order, the foundation\u2019s president declared, \u201cto invest more deeply in movement-building work.\u201d</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s the end of history. And the consequences will be significant.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entire areas of our shared history will never be known because no one will receive a living wage to uncover and study them. It\u2019s implausible to expect scholars with insecure jobs to offer bold and innovative claims about history when they can easily be fired for doing so. Instead, history will be studied increasingly by the wealthy, which is to say those able to work without pay. It\u2019s easy to see how this could lead American historical scholarship to adopt a pro-status-quo bias. In today\u2019s world, if you don\u2019t have access to elite networks, financial resources or both, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to pursue a career in history. In the future, history won\u2019t just be written by the victors; it\u2019ll also be written by the well-to-do.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If Americans don\u2019t seriously invest in history and other humanities disciplines, we encourage the ahistoric ignorance upon which reaction relies. Many Republican politicians support \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d laws that try to regulate what college professors teach. Are they aiming at an easy target in the culture war? Perhaps. But it\u2019s also true that a humanities education encourages thinking that often challenges xenophobic and racist dogma. Progress depends on studying and arguing about the past in an open and informed manner. This is especially true in a moment like our own, in which Americans use history to fight over which vision of the country will dominate politics. If there are no historians to reflect meaningfully and accurately on the past, then ignorance and hatred are sure to triumph.</span>", "time": 1673740863, "resto": 21526600}, {"no": 21526615, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:02:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21526612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21526612</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Without professional historians, history education will be left more and more in the hands of social media influencers, partisan hacks and others unconcerned with achieving a complex, empirically informed understanding of the past. Take, for example, Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s 12-books-and-counting \u201cKilling\u201d series \u2014 the best-selling nonfiction series of all time, according to Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s publishers \u2014 whose very framing sensationalizes the past by focusing on \u201cthe deaths and destruction of some of the most influential men and powerful nations in human history.\u201d The same could be said about Rush Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cRush Revere\u201d series for young people, in which a time-traveling and tri-corner-hatted Mr. Limbaugh teaches \u201cabout some of the most exceptional Americans.\u201d Or consider Twitter, where debates over history regularly erupt \u2014 and just as regularly devolve into name-calling.

The contemporary book market is saturated with books written by mediocre undergrads inspired by movies and tabletops. Any other writer with more ambition and imagination would just try to write &quot;something like finnegan&#039;s wake&quot;. Cyberpunk is irrelevant since we&#039;re living in it. Then there&#039;s AI... There isn&#039;t exactly a centralized way for a book to reach a wider audience either, except for using movie and series adaptations as advertising, and even then, you have to spend a lot. This calls to mind that monologue towards the end of metal gear solid 2, about information hygiene, or whatever it was called there. Nothing&#039;s really come out that you can reference and expect a large enough body of people to get it, and the few things that did have already been referenced enough to be stale. <br>The current target audience for books is younger too. Every time I pick up something modern to read, I feel like I&#039;m wasting my time and should instead read a less well known classic. It&#039;s almost as if narrative altogether is meant to stagnate because there&#039;s no point in writing anything more complex than what&#039;s already been written. Maybe it&#039;s necessary for books to come out that parse everything that has already come out first, bringing people up to speed with the essence of literature, a bit like a game of 1024. Otherwise even people who read will get stuck on some particular school of writing and never go past it, to something that builds upon it. <br>It sort of feels like the movie has already ended, but the camera kept rolling. <br>This isn&#039;t doomposting or anything, there exist more than enough books to keep me happy. That&#039;s kind of the problem though.<br>Public narratives seem to be repeating, and enough books have come out covering the current thing.<br>On the subject of poetry: rap epics.

Another possible explanation is that there is far less privacy. One is surrounded by people constantly, social isolation is simply not a possibility. This intensely communal environment might make autism impossible to manifest.<br>Given that we now know the brain is still developing till 25, maybe what is called autism could in many cases just be the product of extensive social isolation.

They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.

His manifesto only unifies the observations of industrial society into a single ideology that is easy enough for anyone to understand.<br>Here&#039;s an outline of his beef with industrial society:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Technological progress sometimes has unintended consequences</span><br>The most obvious examples are pharmaceutical chemicals, PCB, and BPAs. In the case of BPAs, the chemicals last for decades or hundreds of years in the environment and cause endocrine disruption and other issues. In the case of PCBs, they do not break down even after over 1000 years and are so persistent and dangerous that they&#039;ve been successfully globally banned yet levels have not noticeably fallen. PCBs have even spread to arctic ice.<br>Now how is this so bad? Sure, it&#039;s possible to stop production of a harmful chemical or even clean it up, but with many chemicals they can seem biologically inert or non-toxic after years of trial in a lab environment but after decades of exposure in the environment they cause severe epigenetic issues. Just imagine a scenario similar to (God forgive me for referring to schlock) Stephen King&#039;s The End of the Whole Mess.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. The unintended consequences cannot be prevented</span><br>Refer to the above. As long as tech progresses, there is no way to know if a particular experiment will result in a major disaster, especially one of the fate-worse-than-death varieties.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Technology reduces the effective power of the individual and small groups and dramatically increases the power of large organizations</span><br>This is easy to understand. For a simple case, imagine that large organizations can easily send satellites into the air, eliminate dissidents with intercontinental missiles and precision drone strikes, or plain nuke the planet. An individual or small organization is unable to do much in comparison, and this leads to a dramatically increased capacity for tyrants to perform oppressive acts.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4.

From where the young man leaned over her could see the ring of light brown wrinkles spread open, and the dark face of the first serpent peek into creation. The body that followed was so much larger than it&#039;s nose made it seem. Her circlet clung to it as it passed, as if desperately trying to apprehend the newborn before it could escape, and a projecting sphincter interrupted the once smooth valley between the oracle&#039;s spread butt cheeks. She gasped and shuddered against the young man&#039;s legs. Though at first the procession was snailishly slow, the ropey length gathered speed until its tail finally threw itself onto the grass behind her, tangling into the rest of its coiled body. Her anus began settling back into place, as dough might, but stopped to shudder at a machine gun burst of flatulence, whose depressive pitch made it sound embarrassed to be there. Without delay, another girthy line of brown paste followed like custard from a machine. Somewhere along it&#039;s middle, she contracted her nethers, severing the soft turd in half and squeezing feces into the cleft of her bottom. What had already escaped fell limp beside it&#039;s older kin, and in a moment it was joined by the rest of itself with a moist thud. Bitter steam billowed from her leavings. The young man crinkled his nose, while she began catching her breath.<br>&quot;Are you finished?&quot; the young man said.<br>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, in her low, scratchy voice.<br>&quot;Then face the tree and turn your butt towards me.&quot;<br>Still squatting, she rotated until she could rest her cuffed hands against the birch. The young man, kneeling now, found himself staring into the dilations of a reeking black star. He ripped off a sheet of toilet paper, bunched it between his fingers and drew it across the filthy corona, stretching her sphincter and gathering brown sludge beneath the tissue. Thoroughly used, the paper was thrown in with the rest of the refuse and another, clean piece was torn from the roll.<br>She looked over her shoulder at him, grinning, &quot;have you ever wondered how it tastes?&quot;<br>&quot;Be quiet,&quot; he said, and began wiping again.<br>&quot;You could just lean in and have a lick and no one would know. I certainly wouldn&#039;t tell anybody.&quot;<br>&quot;I said shut up.&quot;<br>&quot;Look, here,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#039;ll make you something fresh.&quot;<br>She tensed up and began to groan again. He was wiping the inside of her butt cheeks when he saw her rim bunch and erupt with one small, dark turd, right next to his foreknuckles. It slid out, barely missing the young man who had kicked himself up and away from the squatting priestess and now watched as her gift slapped against the ground where he had just been kneeling.<br>&quot;You&#039;re disgusting!&quot;<br>She laughed and raised her swaying hindquarters at him.<br>&quot;What are you waiting for imperial?&quot; she called to him, &quot;clean it up!&quot;<br><br>-from my diary desu by anon", "time": 1673739986, "resto": 21521551}, {"no": 21526631, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)19:07:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21524697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21524697</a><br>Damn.

This is also what Europeans don&#039;t understand when Americans try to articulate their &quot;being&quot; of some European heritage. In addition, the founding, public culture of America in some sense claims to be at least as Anglo as the &quot;remainer&quot; Anglos and this is obfuscated by a sudden shift within the last century to the ideological weapon of the propositional nation thesis, which denies any role to ethnicity and deep cultural inheritance.

They are very fun to read, it gives this really expansive feeling to the world, like the characters are seemingly more real and living their lives and you get to look inside at different points.

Schmitt&#039;s rolling over in his grave. He identifies political theology with ideology. He misinterprets Schmitt&#039;s view on liberalism, which Schmitt could not mention without compulsively haranguing the reader about its tendency to depoliticize (and so not draw a distinction between friend and enemy).

The only difference is the extent to which a regime may obscure the nature of its power or else genuinely buy into myths of neutrality. Viewed in this way, a state wedded to liberal democracy is as \u2018totalitarian\u2019 as any other since, by its very nature, it will be unable to tolerate any leaders who are not always already liberal democrats.</span><br><br>Check out pic related.

I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better.

If you read it and have a &quot;omg that&#039;s so me&quot; moment you need therapy. The book has zero character development from start to finish, Holden learns nothing and is still incapable of coping with the fact he&#039;s growing up, there is little justification for his distaste of the adult world and for a 16 year old, he acts like a 10 year old.

Read these - do not read white-trash meme works like Mein Kampf, save for historicity. Sure, read anyone, but don&#039;t waste your time with trash, and take any religious text which is not the Bible as of mere cultural interest. Honestly, there&#039;s nothing I would have you read that everyone shouldn&#039;t be reading - especially since most whites aren&#039;t reading anymore, are casting aside Christian tradition (Europe worst of all), and have left the greatest of literature - Poetry - almost entirely to their women, it is up to us now, to pick up that which made civilization great in the same way the Anglos took up the banner of Christ and the literary tradition of the Greco-Romans. Hopefully, we shall all men retain our senses, but if not, let us at least do our part. Take, for instance, Victorian-era England, a period in British history which seems quintessentially British to an American like me, but to the Britons of the day, it was a time of great change when they were becoming almost hyper-English out of a preservative reaching back to the old-ways for fear of losing them (not in the sense of paganism mind, Christmas was on the boom after all). That retro-conservativism became the hyper-English image of the Victorians by way of the eternal recurrence of the old clashing with the new which is always iconoclastic. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Bible - to be taken more seriously than anything; both for its Divine origins and for its influence</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plato; Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic, Meno - Parmenides is a personal favorite, but not as necessary</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aristotle; Nichomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics, Magna Moralia, Rhetoric, Politics, Poetics, Physics, and Metaphysics</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;any good history of philosophy - for instance; Copleston or Russell</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Irrational Man; William Barret</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Problems of Philosophy; Bertrand Russell</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Owl of Minerva; Philosophers on Philosophy; Every essay within was written by a prominent philosopher of the time - a few of them are famous. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If it&#039;s still on YouTube, watch the 1980s series The Great Philosophers with Brian McGee (I think it was called) - it was a series of interviews with varying philosophers and scholars on areas of their expertise</span><br>I&#039;m not recommending any further particular philosophers. Pick and choose them according to your interests, and how each philosopher relates to any particular time-period or field you&#039;re looking at closely. If you want to tackle it systematically, it shouldn&#039;t be difficult to find a guide.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I recommend in general BBC Radio 4&#039;s podcast series In Our Time with Melvyn Bragg as host. I enjoyed so many of them - I highly recommend looking for the Shakespeare episode which had Bloom on. I found it funny.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Read all the greats of English literature, obviously - Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Pope, etc.,.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Read at least the core Greco-Romans - Hesiod &amp; Homer, the major tragedians, Ovid, Virgil, and so on. </span><br><br>(1/2)", "filename": "David Russell - MLK Jr., acrylic and oil, c. 2013", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1500, "h": 2035, "tn_w": 92, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673764525224718, "time": 1673764525, "md5": "TzO5Ki+8780DGH9jisRRLw==", "fsize": 1612868, "resto": 21525541}, {"no": 21527913, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)01:59:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21527880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21527880</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read as you please of major novels.

They laud vice and are Godless.</span><br><br>As for black works in particular. Read as many as you like, but I personally try and read very little of anything written out of bitterness or hate. If that is all a major black author has written, I will read something by them, only to see them for who they are and what ability they have. I do not recommend reading much of these because hate, bitterness, envy, unforgiveness, and so on are all vices. We wish to move forward unto magnanimity, not shrinking back into spiritual destitution. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MLK&#039;s Letter from a Birmingham City Jail is a must, as is the letter from five pastors and two rabbis two whom he was responding at the time. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Celia, A Slave</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The poetry of Tracy K. Smith - one of the most kind, sane voices of modern poets</span><br>If you&#039;re an American, read the works of the Founding Fathers, and of those who had a keen influence on them - for instance, Francis Bacon (I really enjoyed New Atlantis) or Thomas Hobbes. I&#039;m not sure whether or not to recommend looking into Masonry. I have done it out of curiosity, but it is a very deep and wide series of tunnels - most of them lain as intentional distractions, I believe. It has, and has had, an influence here and abroad, but use your own discretion - just be careful not to go too far down that road, wasting time and becoming tainted by their wickedness. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Federalist Papers</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Declaration of Independence</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;etc.,. </span><br><br>Read personal finance, finance, and econ. Do not be overwhelmed by it. The language is often intentionally obfuscating or opaque. You may or may not be aware many important papers and talks done by elite bankers and policy makers are publicly available for free. This is because they have erected jargon and dryness as a barrier to the public psyche. Even given the chance, the average person does not read, nor want to read what they publish - no matter the cost. If you increase your financial literacy gradually and continually you will simultaneously increase your opportunities for wealth, decrease your chances of poverty, and decrease your chances of being caught unawares by the schemes of politicians, bankers, and their friends.

In a moment of irony that may not have been lost on the interviewer, Faulkner reached over to his table and handed Smith a 1924 edition of the book. . .

At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.

You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep.

He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his 296 the fellowship of the ring close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lu\u00b4thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u00b4miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\u2019s kin, in Lo\u00b4rien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father\u2019s house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry; for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother\u2019s torment in the dens of the orcs.</span><br><br>I want you to read this and then honestly tell me Tolkien&#039;s writing compares in any way to that fat bastard. <br><br><s>Also, Tolkien managed to finish his works, even 40 years after his death.</s>", "time": 1673571422, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517748, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:57:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517743</a><br>lord of the rings is earth itself. simple incredible", "time": 1673571426, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517751, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "its honestly insane people think they can compare tolkien to martin. i guess getting adapted to the american big screen is all that fucking matters", "time": 1673571488, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517757, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:59:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517748</a><br>It has width but not depth.

The grittier side sure, a more zoomed in viewpoint that shows more of the &quot;flaws&quot; and imperfections of the world (thus making it more realistic and &quot;normal&quot;), while Tolkien&#039;s has more of a zoomed out view that is like looking on a beautiful painting from a distance (even a battlefield looks less brutal when viewed from a tall mountain)<br><br>GRRM calls the story Fire and Ice, to indicate the perennial theme of opposites, which could also be said of Tolkien though it&#039;s not as clearly stated.

And Tolkien also took many ideas from from more the more common understanding of history (i.e. in the same way that GRRM did). And as I pointed out in my earlier post, GRRM was also writing about many of the same themes. GRRM had gods and mythic faerie people too, just as Tolkien. GRRM&#039;s fey folk, by the time of the events of his books, are a mere shade of their former glory, just as Tolkien&#039;s elves, by the events of the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth, were beginning to fade from the world. GRRM&#039;s books are like a 4th or 5th Age storytelling, when elves have all but vanished, and the world is the less beautiful and more brutal and orcish. <br><br>Examples of Tolkien &quot;taking from history&quot;: Arnor = Western Roman Empire, Gondor = Byzantine (WREmpire collapsed into multiple kingdoms.

He&#039;s described his writing method as gardening rather than scaffolding, but he&#039;s ended up writing himself into too many corners because he didn&#039;t exactly plan out the whole series and wastes time rewriting because of it.

The fish may also be motivated by a desire for warmth in a suddenly cold environment, or a desire for a change in its surroundings. The fish in question is simply called, Andreyevich the Incendiary Ichthyoid, also known by his shorter yet equally enthralling name, Blaze. <br><br>Here are Blaze\u2019s most memorable quotes: <br><br>1. &quot;I&#039;ll light the ocean with a spark, and leave the sharks in the dark&quot;<br>2. &quot;With fire, I&#039;ll make the tide turn, and show them who&#039;s the real burn&quot;<br>3. &quot;I&#039;ll set the seaweed ablaze, and watch the eels squirm in a daze&quot;<br>4. &quot;My fins may be small, but my flames will rise tall&quot;<br>5. &quot;I&#039;ll burn the coral reef, and watch the clownfish grieve&quot;<br>7. &quot;I&#039;ll start an inferno, and show the whales who&#039;s the her oh (hero)&quot;<br>8. &quot;I&#039;ll light up the night, and be the small fish with the biggest bite&quot;<br>9. &quot;I&#039;ll burn the fishing nets, and set the tuna free&quot;<br>10. &quot;I&#039;ll singe the seaweed, and watch the crabs all speed&quot;<br>11. &quot;I&#039;ll kindle a flame, and give the big fish a reason to be ashamed.&quot;<br><br>Here\u2019s Blaze\u2019s favorite things to do: <br><br>1. Setting things on fire: Blaze, as the name suggests, has a fondness for flames and loves nothing more than to ignite anything that comes in its way.<br>2. Being the center of attention: Blaze loves to be in the spotlight and enjoys being the talk of the ocean.<br>3. Adventure: Blaze is always looking for new and exciting things to do, and is not afraid to take risks.<br>4. Causing chaos: Blaze takes pleasure in causing chaos and disrupting the peace of the ocean.<br>5. Being feared: Blaze relishes the idea of being feared by other creatures of the ocean and uses its fire-starting abilities to intimidate them.<br>6. Watching things burn: Blaze has a fascination for the destruction caused by fire and enjoys watching things burn.<br><br>Dusan woke up from his dream feeling confused and slightly disturbed. He couldn&#039;t shake off the image of the small fish, Blaze, committing arson and causing destruction in the ocean. He thought to himself the following 4 things: <br>1. &quot;Why did I dream about such a bizarre and violent thing?<br>2. &quot;I have never heard of a fish that can start a fire, it&#039;s completely unrealistic&quot;<br>3. &quot;I hope this dream doesn&#039;t mean that I have a hidden desire to cause harm or destruction&quot;<br>4. &quot;Maybe it was just my subconscious mind processing something that I&#039;ve seen or heard about recently&quot;<br><br>Each night Dusan would see Blaze in his dreams.

Much depends on whether those market transactions accurately reflect both the costs and the benefits that result. Under some conditions, they do not. When someone buys a table or a tractor, the question as to whether it is worth what it cost is answered by the actions of the purchaser who made the decision to buy it. However, when an electric utility company buys coal to burn to generate electricity, a significant part of the cost of the electricity-generating process is paid by people who breathe the smoke that results from the burning of the coal and whose homes and cars are dirtied by the soot. Cleaning, repainting and medical costs paid by these people are not taken into account in the marketplace, because these people do not participate in the transactions between the coal producer and the utility company. Such costs are called \u201cexternal costs\u201d by economists because such costs fall outside the parties to the transaction which creates these costs. \u201cExternal costs are therefore not taken into account in the marketplace, even when these are very substantial costs, which can extend beyond monetary losses to include bad health and premature death. While there are many decisions that can be made more efficiently through the marketplace than by government, this is one of those decisions that can be made more efficiently by government than by the marketplace. Even such a champion of free markets as Milton Friedman acknowledged that there are \u201ceffects on third parties for which it is not feasible to charge or recompense them.\u201d Clean air laws can reduce harmful emissions by legislation and regulations. Clean water laws and laws against disposing of toxic wastes where they will harm people can likewise force decisions to be made in ways that take into account the external costs that would otherwise be ignored by those transacting in the marketplace.</span><br><br>It&#039;s not radically free market.

How all you can do is bait a hook and wait for the idea fish to appear. That made me think about the book &quot;From Normal to Healthy&quot; by K\u00fchlewind. In the intro section he talks about how thought forms appear fully realized in your consciousness. And this all made me think about something I realized while journaling recently - I haven&#039;t been truly bored in years, decades, perhaps since I was a kid where I have distinct memories of those grueling moments of pure boredom. Sundays after church when my dad was cooking and the whole house was 80F+, I would sit in my room sweating, looking at the handful of books I had read multiple times each, flipping around the three stations on the TV. Maybe I&#039;d go in the back yard and lose hours climbing on the same tree or scratching at the ground with a stick or throwing pebbles at the fence. Riding my bike down, and pushing my bike back up, the same hill at the end of the street over and over again. These activities were all meaningless but they gave the appropriate space to imagine, to worry, to think. In an effort to fight the boredom, as I always dreamed of doing on those sweaty Sundays, I have created a life in which I can never be bored. And as such, I am no longer fishing. Any idea that could have formed flows right past me. I&#039;m not tuned in to hear it.<br><br>Today I did a bit of an experiment. My top priority was to drop whatever I was doing when I had a &quot;distracted&quot; thought in order to pursue it - something Lynch also mentioned in the clip I saw. I would catch the faintest idea and pursue it. Bloom it. At the very least, record it. I wrote pages in a legal pad until my hand hurt. And despite the scribbling and the interrupted reading and working sessions, I feel more centered than I have in some time. I feel less distracted because I gave myself some boring space to sit staring at the trees, and when I realized what the trees looked or smelled like, I wrote about it.", "time": 1673664331, "resto": 21519351}, {"no": 21522387, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:00:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldQ<wbr>rapQ4d0Y", "filename": "1614203842017", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 578, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1673665245687564, "time": 1673665245, "md5": "vk7AG6aDNbsDvhQVI30CSw==", "fsize": 49817, "resto": 21519351}, {"no": 21522414, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)22:08:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21522349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21522349</a><br>You seem like you will be considered a wise man someday, anon.<br><br>I truly hope that you don&#039;t ever give up on yourself.

No explanation. Remember, I&#039;m on this website: I&#039;m one of life&#039;s failures, especially socially, so for any woman, let alone a real pretty one to throw herself at me like she did was unthinkable, even if she was an emotional trainwreck. She was the first and so far the only one. I was 27 on the night we met which was also the first time I had sex. In the end, she was very clear that she didn&#039;t want to see me anymore, neither as a serious relationship nor as a friend (the latter through actions rather than direct words).<br><br>After no contact for about 4 months, we ran into each other again last night, as I was with mutual friends who wanted to see her. She was very genial and we could speak comfortably, alcohol helping (she was blind drunk, me slightly less). I had been thinking of calling her since about early December. I thought there might be a chance to try again. Eventually I found out she was seeing someone. I couldn&#039;t help but mention that she had said before that she had too much going on for a relationship when we last spoke. She said it was true then but she was sorry and that I never did anything wrong, a thought which has tormented me since it ended. I didn&#039;t really have it in me to hide my disappointment, but I didn&#039;t push the issue any further. She no doubt noticed the change in demeanour and a few times during the night she seemed to try and make me feel better, despite being blind drunk. We chatted a little more as people started to head home from the bar around 2AM. She seemed to remember the things we used to talk about before we stopped talking; a work deadline I had, a job I had applied for and asked me how those things went. She kissed me on the cheek as she got a cab home.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m not sure what the point of this is.

It probably wouldn&#039;t have worked with us in the long term (probably, not definitely). The obvious 4chan answer is that she&#039;s a crazy slut, who cares, move on. But I&#039;m also a real piece of shit so a trainwreck like her is probably on my level. At least I thought that might be the case. I dunno, I think I&#039;m kind of fucked in general. I got problems outside of her and I don&#039;t see things getting better soon. I don&#039;t really have much resilience left in me so I think I&#039;m approaching an inevitable conclusion soon enough. I know bad things happen to everyone but it&#039;s more the absence of anything good that gets me; many false dawns and glimpses of better things.

The way we met differed. I met her because she was trying to make money quickly for some urgent expenses, I just happened to find the ad because I had gradually been becoming sexually desperate to the point of looking around online, and naturally alongside that desperation, also wanting to meet someone who was reasonably intelligent, because as everyone probably knows if there is a big gap in wit it just results in feeling more alone, despite being in company (although ultimately, both situations can lead to increased suffering depending on the actual outcome). It&#039;s also the first time I&#039;d done anything like this, though, and quite impulsive on my part.<br><br>When I met her and went to the hotel (which was reasonably high class, no doubt, at least as far as I could tell), it was like a nonstop barrage of conversation about virtually anything. She had a personality that was not quite bubbly but at the same time highly open and dynamic, she could talk about virtually anything, a little bit airheaded, but more out of habit than actual stupidity. It was easy to tell she was quite intelligent despite the act, and she was also highly attractive and had a beautifully shaped face, especially her nose. She was complimenting me about everything (physical and otherwise, the former makes sense because I am actually quite tall and in reasonable shape) while at the same time asking questions to get to know more. I did the same to her, to the point where we ended up knowing more about each other than most people would know, I assume, even after going on a few normal dates.<br><br>The sex was also amazing. Despite it also being my first time, which means I genuinely cannot tell how well things went objectively or if there was deception involved on her part, it seemed like she enjoyed it more than I did, not just from what she said, but even (mainly) from her bodily reactions.<br><br>Last, I ended up overstaying and more or less staying the night despite the intention originally being about an hour. After I arrived back home, I was fine for a while, but the pangs of loss came into effect probably a day later. I messaged her after I left with the complimentary message saying how much I enjoyed our time together, but then later, as the pangs were felt, I likely overplayed my hand by becoming too personal and complimenting her too much on things that are well beyond merely sexual. I say &quot;likely&quot;, because despite this she was still messaging back and wanting to see me again, however she was not as open handed as me in giving out compliments.

Their career path, specifically. You wouldn&#039;t believe me if I told you I spent thousands of hours, if not more reading LinkedIn profiles in college but I did. I still do, albeit to a slightly lesser extent now that I have real work. It all started when I was in college and discovered that I could use LinkedIn to stalk my seniors&#039; paths. <br><br>With one simple click, I would learn everything I needed to know. From my major, which master&#039;s was the best to get a real job in the industry? Which masters should I avoid, because people have to complete their curriculum with expensive non-uni courses? In which city? It was all there. Even if uni teachers tried to lie about how students were &#039;inserted&#039; in the professional world, I would only see the plain, bare truth. <br><br>There is a common misconception about using LinkedIn that people don&#039;t understand; bullshiters are easily singled out. Sure, you can lie about one or two things, but you can&#039;t really lie about where you&#039;ve done professional work with your degree. It made my research and my pursuit of truth easier. Some things just don&#039;t line up when multiple people have a 3 years hole in their CV after graduating with the same degree. <br><br>Anyways, I have about a thousand HTML files containing the LinkedIn profiles of people who are 1 to 5 years my seniors right now. I use it to plan my career course; where did people get the most promotions? Who were they friends with at the time (see who liked their posts)? etc. The seniority helps because they&#039;re making mistakes I won&#039;t make in the future. If someone is changing workplaces after a few months or a single year, I know that there is something iffy about the management or the salary. It&#039;s hard work, but I&#039;m certain it will pay off someday. I&#039;m not doing it for the career. I&#039;m doing it for the thrill of &quot;planning the best course of action&quot;. I think I became like this because I come from a poor background. I don&#039;t have the wits nor the talent to achieve great things, but I&#039;m hella fucking smart when it comes to observing others and taking shortcuts. Whenever I reach a milestone I&#039;ve been looking at from afar and look back behind me to see the amounts of unforeseen hurdles I plowed through, I feel a surge of adrenaline like no other.

Find what your base metabolic rate is (probably around 2k calories), fast more, eat more meat, eat more eggs, have more low-processing dairy products like yoghurt, eat some lettuce salad and citric fruit juices to help digestion, calibrate it to have enough variety and less volume than before, and eat twice a day tops. You&#039;ll end up eating way less than you&#039;re used to, your digestion will stop to be in constant overload and maybe the sadness and tiredness will go away.

He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them.
