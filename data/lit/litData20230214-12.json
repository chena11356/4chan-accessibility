What he means by \u201cEros\u201d is never clear to begin with: sexual activity (in the Freudian genital sense), or an aesthetic-sexual mixture of art, sex play, and creative effort, or the whole domain of instinct (which returns us to the age-old problem of reason versus instinct), or else \u201ceverything oppressed by civilization.\u201d How does one conclude that revolution will occur through Eros and also will liberate it? Of course, the vibrant call for sexual liberty and uninhibited emotions would appeal to young people. But is it not plain that this licensed pan-sexuality, made out to be the highway to revolution, is among the most effective propaganda weapons (the kind that hits below the belt, as Hitler himself put it) and also the most demagogic form of deceit? To redeem spontaneity by that means is senseless regression in terms of revolution\u2014\u201cPost coitum animal triste\u201d: that is all we can expect of it, unless an iron fist clamps down on the rampant irrationality, the results of which we have already seen. We ought not to forget the vast irrational movement of our time which produced public festivals and mindless emotionalism on an incredible scale: National Socialism. The practice of \u201cclassifying,\u201d and thus dismissing, Nazism should stop, for it represents a real Freudian repression on the part of intellectuals who refuse to recognize what it was. Others lump together Nazism, dictatorship, massacres, concentration camps, racism, and Hitler\u2019s folly. That about covers the subject. Nazism was a great revolution: against the bureaucracy, against senility, in behalf of youth; against the entrenched hierarchies, against capitalism, against the petit-bourgeois mentality, against comfort and security, against the consumer society, against traditional morality; for the liberation of instinct, desire, passions, hatred of cops (yes, indeed!), the will to power, and the creation of a higher order of freedom. When I read the following: \u201cThe mob disclaims all responsibility, either for those who join it, or for what will happen tomorrow. Their actions and words are free of traditional restraints. They believe what they are doing and saying is simply the truth at the moment. ... I do not represent anyone; I think what I say voices the feelings of the students as a whole. ...

Also, not everything big tech is pushing is going to land because it will be expensive and not pleasant for the public (see the example of Google Glass, or how the Metaverse is not being a big deal outside techie circles and the predictable failure of Neuralink, actually everything Elon do is a scam). Economies that were promising are decelerating fast due a number of reasons (China is having minor growth, India is not a superpower as some predicted, Russia is thrown into a war, Brazil is almost in a civil war and Saudi Arabia reached peak production of oil and its promises of a &quot;Jeddah world trade center&quot; are halted for almost five years), economies that are well stablished are actually decreasing.<br>So, it&#039;s a great time to do some mischief to make the system bleed.

This board was really better some years ago. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyway, how did I ruin this post? I gave a genuine answer to OP&#039;s question. The Bible is consoling and comforting to mankind. God&#039;s promises are great, and His dealing with mankind is holy and righteous. So, for anyone seeking consolation, to hear the holy and righteous God of Israel has a plan they&#039;re a part of is good news.</span><br>You didnt ruin the thread, Im saying religion posts like that are poor and lack substance. It doesnt open discussion, it closes it; Im saying dogmatic christian posts (just read the bible! everything its there!) are just like propaganda. If OP just doesnt believe in God, the post is useless. The suggestion should work indepently of this guy being a believer or not, and all posts should be like that. <br>I wish there was a religion and mysticism board. <br>BUT, maybe OP could join his closer church? That kind of thing could give him consolation. Maybe he missed stuff he just wont be able to experience now, but he could still bond with people by doing that and experience something thats different. Bonding and doing things related to religion its the only consolation I can see christianity can offer thanks to the existence of the church. Just reading the bible or anything else wont help.<br>Anyways, I think going beyond consolation its better. I cant see christianity as anything but just copium. But thats just me, and I may be wrong and will end up in hell, but I really doubt it.", "time": 1676378460, "resto": 21655475}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21651930, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:46:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Beginning when I was 12 years old my 36 year old aunt sexually abused me and tortured me.

For modern and contemporary poets, there is no uncontestable heavenly muse and no \u201ctribe\u201d that can be taken for granted like the bygone Epics. In The Tale of the Tribe: Ezra Pound and the Modern Verse Epic, Michael Andr\u00e9 Bernstein articulated this problem in his study of Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson: \u201cthe essential paradox of a modern verse epic,\u201d he says, is that \u201ca text that can be only the response of a particular individual writing from his own, partial and limited perspective [\u2026] must nonetheless give voice to historical forces transcending any single consciousness or moment\u201d (Bernstein 272). In Bending the Bow (where most of the Passages are contained), Robert Duncan writes<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the soul is the life-shape of the body, great stars, that are born and have their histories we read in the skies and will die, are souls. And this poetry, the ever forming of bodies in language in which breath moves, is a field of ensouling. Each line, intensely, a soul thing, a contribution; a locality of the living.</span><br>The passage illustrates Duncan&#039;s views on poetry and ethics. Duncan saw poetry and the body as interconnected, with the poem and the body both being sites of ethical responsibility during times of war. This responsibility goes beyond simple condemnation and instead involves a connection with the entire universe, which would bring all people together regardless of their political beliefs. This idea of interconnectedness is similar to the views of other poets, such as Charles Olson&#039;s proprioception and Louis Zukofsky&#039;s desire for totality. <br>Duncan disagrees with the idea that the universe is limited and fixed. Instead, he says in \u201cThe Multiversity, Passages 21,\u201d that it&#039;s made up of different parts that fit together but don&#039;t lock, meaning that what was previously closed can now be opened: \u201cThe part in its fitting does not lock but unlocks; what was closed is opened\u201d (iv). He believes that by going beyond what&#039;s expected, poetry can help heal people and bring love to those who are hurt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I have only the language of our commonness, alive with them as well as me, the speech of the audience in its refusal in which I would come into that confidence. The poem in which my heart beats speaks like to unlike, kind to unkind. The line of the poem itself confronts me where I must volunteer my love, and I saw, long before this war, wrath move in the music that troubles me.

It is a story about the end of the world in which the world ends.&quot; In other words, Clute&#039;s answer to my question is nothing, there&#039;s nothing at the end of the road. Such a statement &quot;in which the world ends&quot; strikes me as too categorical for The Road or for McCarthy&#039;s work as a whole, of which The Road, presaged over and again from The Orchard Keeper onward, is both a logical continuation and a kind of termination. I believe, with Edwin T. Arnold, that McCarthy&#039;s work is grounded in moral choice. Clute&#039;s statement &quot;you remove the Christ figure and you are left with virtually nothing&quot; leaves little room for choice, but I think the novel, in its own contradictory way, does. How then do we go about examining the relative evidence for and against God in The Road? We look directly at the text, at what McCarthy intentionally did or did not write. What and where is the textual evidence working against God, what and where is the evidence working for God? And how do they stack up? In the novel&#039;s second fragment we can begin to accumulate the evidence against God. There is a simple description of the setting as &quot;Barren, silent, godless&quot; (4). A few pages later a single snowflake sifts down: &quot;He caught it in his hand and watched it expire there like the last host of Christendom&quot; (16). It&#039;s the boy who catches the snowflake but the narrator&#039;s simile is hardly of the boy&#039;s imagining. Sometimes McCarthy reverses the religious reference for negative effect as in this un-writing of Genesis by the man: &quot;The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion.

Relendess, intestate, implacable, blind, crushing, hunted, trembling - is there a more ferocious description anywhere of our borrowed world?<br><br>If that hyper-McCarthy prose poem is the most negative ponderation on God, the most intriguing is surely the father and son&#039;s encounter with the old man who calls himself Ely. Their conversation treats survival, death and God, but it raises more questions than it answers. Ely, whether it&#039;s real or some perverse nom de guerre, is the only person in the novel endowed with any sort of proper name. Why? What - beyond urging the critics to hustle - is the significance of the name? Some of the criticism takes Ely to allude to Elijah, a connection I fail to see except on the most superficial level - the wise old biblical prophet, other than caricature or intentional reversal, he is not; even less is he Melville&#039;s Elijah from Chapter 19 of Moby Dick - and I don&#039;t understand any link beyond some weird possible version of Elijah&#039;s sharing of the Passover meal, a flimsy tie, for what it&#039;s worth, seen also by Phillip A. Snyder (81) in the context of hospitality. <br><br>Why not Ely itself? I mean E-L-Y, but pronounced Eel-ee (possibly derived from eels), the city on the River Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire, the cathedral of which is called the Ship of Fens, popularly believed to be built on Cromwell&#039;s Rock, on a meteorite that may have helped put the dinosaurs out of business (Ely Ghosts).", "time": 1676109337, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643876, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:00:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643868</a><br>Most readers tend to think that the unspecified catastrophe in the novel is man-made, but if so, why does McCarthy deliberately fail to say so, either in the novel or in subsequent interviews? What if it&#039;s God-made or a catastrophic accident? McCarthy remarked somewhat facetiously in an interview in the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I don&#039;t have an opinion. At the Santa Fe Institute I&#039;m with scientists of all disciplines, and some of them in geology said it looked like a meteor to them,&quot; as if they were privy to information beyond his ken. &quot;But it could be anything - volcanic activity or it could be a nuclear war. It&#039;s not really important&quot; (Jurgensen). The only critic I have read so far who wants to keep the question open is Jay Ellis, who does not decide between &quot;nuclear winter, or the calamitous climate change sped up by a comet strike&quot; (28). The interview, even given McCarthy&#039;s well known propensity for hermetic or enigmatic pronouncements, only strengthens the possibility that the catastrophe was not necessarily man-made.<br><br>If we accept McCarthy&#039;s ingenuousness or ingeniousness, we also have to accept the somewhat outrageous notion that the only proper name in the novel (other than Rock City, of which Ely could be a reiteration, in which case Ely would be the rock of the un-church) coincides, at least in the popular mind, with a great physical disaster, which did to the dinosaurs what the current disaster in the novel is doing to man. And then we must ask if it&#039;s also coincidental that this character Ely, the only one with a name, is the one to tell us: &quot;There is no God,&quot; an utterly un-Elijah-like judgment that he promptly reiterates: &quot;There is no God and we are his prophets&quot; (170) - And why does he look like<br> &quot;a starved and threadbare buddha&quot; (168) and talk like the prophet Mohammed? That sort of multi-religious palimpsest is clearly contrived, but to what end? Is McCarthy deriding &quot;diversity&quot;? Are we meant to believe Ely? Maybe he&#039;s just crazy, or maybe he&#039;s right and crazy, or maybe he&#039;s trying to tell us in his own crazy Nietzschean way that God is so utterly removed from us as to be dead, an idea Jay Ellis flirts with when he writes of: &quot;[. . .] the larger philosophy we keep<br> determining in these novels - including McCarthy&#039;s sense of god as a kind of absent parent no longer able, or willing, to do anything&quot; (35), a sense that echoes tangentially Leo Daugherty&#039;s Gnostic reading of Blood Meridian. The disaster may not be caused by man, but the episode with Ely can only reinforce any case against any God other than a totally absent one, no matter how eccentric or contrived Ely himself may be.", "time": 1676109653, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643891, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:10:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643876</a><br>Another of those prose poems occurs in a kind of flashback or memory: &quot;Out on the roads the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond&quot; (181). The passage sounds like certain descriptions from Suttree and something like the first chapter of Ecclesiastes. The key word, for my purposes, is &quot;unremarked,&quot; which seems to indicate a nonexistent or uncaring God. The passage echoes one from early in the novel: &quot;The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air&quot; (11). These passages point convincingly to nothingness and doubtless are among the major reasons the novel has been labeled nihilistic or godless. There is also a brief fragment that would seem to deny any after life: &quot;Do you think your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledgerbook? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground&quot; (196). This denial seems to issue straight from the man as does a subsequent passage of the same type: &quot;I think maybe they are watching, he said. They are watching for a thing that even death cannot undo and if they do not see it they will turn away from us and they will not come back&quot; (210). Who are &quot;they,&quot; we are forced to ask, ghosts, angels, archons, aeons, gods? There is no answer and all that is clear is the quandary itself, yet the very nature of the question, at once rhetorical and pointed, seems to signal some Eliot-like turning, however bleakly. Is it some spark - &quot;the thing that even death cannot<br> undo&quot; - that they must see in order not to turn away? <br><br>The textual case for God, or more specifically a Christlike figure in<br> the boy, difficult to imagine without some a priori God, however aloof, comprises more evidence than the negative case, and more convincingly. We can understand much of the material by stringing it together, almost without explication, beginning with this passage, which is the first we hear of the boy: &quot;He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke&quot; (5). Shortly after they emerge from the mountains, the father, having left their camp, observes: &quot;When he rose and turned to go back the tarp was lit from within where the boy had wakened. Sited there in the darkness the frail blue shape of it looked like the pitch of some last venture at the edge of the world. Something all but unaccountable. And so it was&quot; (48). Except for being unaccountable, this phenomenon - whatever it describes - is wholly unremarked in the narrative or in the criticism, but it foreshadows much of what follows. That foreshadowing, while easily slipping by unnoticed here, cannot be anything other than explicit and intentional.", "time": 1676110251, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643898, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:14:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643891</a><br>Some twenty pages later, as the father washes the roadrat&#039;s gore from his son&#039;s hair, comes the first direct inkling of the boy&#039;s role: &quot;All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you&#039;ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them&quot; (74). Messiah, of course, means anointed one and while this passage does not proclaim a messiah, it does plant a seed of implication, especially when on the next page we read that the man &quot;sat beside him and stroked his pale and tangled hair. Golden chalice, good to house a god&quot; (75). Someone - the father, the narrator, the reader, the critic - is making suggestions we cannot simply ignore. Then the boy himself begins to make pronouncements. First he says that nothing bad will happen to them, &quot;Because we&#039;re carrying the<br> fire&quot; (83), when there is no fire and they&#039;re about to sleep in a car with only suit coats piled on for warmth. This figurative fire will become a central motif for the boy&#039;s sacred nature, which the man will continue to assert, as when he asks Ely: &quot;What if I said he&#039;s a god?&quot; (172), a role<br> the boy will eventually take for himself. When the boy answers the man, saying that he is the one &quot;who has to worry about everything,&quot; saying, &quot;Yes I am. . .I am the one&quot; (259), he is echoing Jesus in a number of instances - I am the way, the truth and the light (John 14:6); I am the door of the sheep (John 10:7); I am the light of the world (John 8:12); I am the alpha and the omega (Revelation 1:8), to mention a few of the most obvious. Suffice it to say the proclamation &quot;I am&quot; is among the strongest phrases in the Old and New Testaments, the latter inevitably an echo of God&#039;s pronouncement to Moses: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (Exodus 3:14). Not only does the boy offer to take responsibility, he offers to do so in unmistakably religious language, with none of the equivocation or contradiction so evident in Ely&#039;s negative discourse. The boy, born after the disaster, has been raised, we must assume, without church or scripture, and his scriptural echoes must therefore issue forth from narrative design or divine inspiration. There cannot be - not in a Cormac McCarthy novel -inadvertent echoes or unintentional allusions.", "time": 1676110497, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643914, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>Later the boy asks: &quot;Is it real? The fire?&quot; and the man answers: &quot;It&#039;s inside you. It was always there. I can see it&quot; (278-9). Is that the figurative fire of civilization? I think it means - textually, in this novel - less something vaguely Promethean than the literal belief in or presence of God or at the very least some entrapped divine spark of the Gnostics. My reading stems not from any innate desire to interpret the text that way. Rather it seems the weightier of two intentionally conflicting possible readings or discourses, set out as though the narrator himself were engaged in some mono-dialogical debate meant to be attended and adjudged by the reader. Alongside the fire motif runs a light motif - when there is in this darkest of worlds no source of light - that only reinforces the sacred nature of the boy: &quot;There was light all about him&quot; and &quot;when he moved the light moved with him&quot; (277). The man is compelled to comment: &quot;There is no prophet in the earth&#039;s long chronicle who&#039;s not honored here today&quot; (277), an inference, by the father at least, that the boy incarnates some second coming. Finally, there are two poignant words that I believe strengthen the textual case for God. The first is salitter: word used rather exclusively by Jacob Boehme (or commentary on him, as by Hegel), the Lutheran mystic clearly familiar to McCarthy, to judge nowhere beyond the two citations, one used as epigraph and the other reversed as subtitle, for Blood Meridian. Salitter - there could be a dissertation on this usage eventually, as well as a study on the meaning of fire and light as God and Christ in Jacob Boehm and Cormac McCarthy - means divine essence, the stuff of God (not unlike the Tao or Brahman, or in quantum physics the matrix of Max Planck): &quot;He walked out into the road and stood. The silence. The salitter drying from the earth&quot; (261). John Clute properly underlines the vital importance of this sole word, acknowledging God&#039;s presence but believing that &quot;the Christ figure must somehow be seen - be felt - to transcend the drying of the divine out of the earth.&quot; I agree, at least to the point that Clute has put his finger in the wound. The central question would seem to be precisely that: Does the Christ-like figure of the boy transcend - or reverse or compensate for - such an absence or withdrawal? It is reasonable to argue, as Clute does, that the answer is no. But what are we to make of this passage, giving us the second poignant word, just before the father dies: . .he [the man] would raise his weeping eyes and see him [the boy] standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle&quot; (273)?", "time": 1676111035, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643920, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:25:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643898</a><br>I got 1 paragraph through this wall of complete shite and couldn&#039;t go on. <br>TLDR please and thx desu.", "time": 1676111150, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643928, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:29:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643914</a><br>Tabernacle: In general terms, a place of worship.

But regardless, why tabernacle, why the singularly most ecumenical term imaginable to express the essence of God? And what if the man is seeing into the future, or what if the boy does indeed glow? What if McCarthy is not making a reasonable or cogent argument?<br><br>The last thing the father says is: &quot;Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again&quot; (281). The father dies, the boy stays with him the emblematic three days and then as if on cue or as if preordained or as if popped from a machine, Parka-man &quot;hove into view&quot; (281). The critics who say that Parka-man is a deus ex machina are right, and that is precisely the point. His woman, who welcomes the boy, doesn&#039;t talk to him of civilization, she talks to him about God and tells him that &quot;the breath of God was his breath&quot; (286). If McCarthy didn&#039;t want us to read it the way I just have, why did he write it that way? Why say goodness will find the boy and have goodness find the boy? Why drag out a deliberate and undisguised deus ex machina - no one could seriously argue that McCarthy was unaware of the fact - if what you want to do is deny any sort of deus? And it&#039;s not just goodness that finds the boy but a new and this time caring mother, the mother that does not exist for that long list of road warriors we started with, the mother absent or defective in all those novels, every single one of them, including most especially this one, and not just goodness but warm caring affectionate understanding maternal goodness - quite the opposite of the mother who abandons the boy - the only such maternal goodness, all one short paragraph of it, in virtually all of McCarthy&#039;s work. If the message is meant to be nothing more than the withdrawal of whatever Gnostic substance there is out there, why have as the subject of the last paragraph of the plotted novel a mother who is not only all of the foregoing, but also a mother who understands how to explain the unexplainable without attempting to force any belief on the boy? What&#039;s at the end of The Road? What textually, with no need to adduce scientific opinion from the ironically named Santa Fe Institute? Stabat mater, not yet dolorosa. And that mother who is there, standing there, not yet grieving, means that the pistol-packing, fire-carrying boy, the light-bearing boy, the golden chalice and glowing tabernacle of an anointed boy who honors all the prophets and whom goodness has found is who and what we have. He and she - mother and child reunion - are the final image of the plotted novel.", "time": 1676111393, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21643935, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)05:33:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21643928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21643928</a><br>It&#039;s not just that the novel&#039;s &quot;literary passion defies the very emptiness that it proclaims,&quot; as John Cant has written (197).

The man who remembered the trout in the early mountain section of the novel is dead. Yet you, the reader, cannot help associating the trout here with those remembered trout.

On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.&quot; These miracle trout of becoming are at once real (the light wavy markings on the brook trout&#039;s dorsal area are called vermiculations) and intricately evolved, and they return us to once - what is now, from the current point of view of this narrator-after-the-fact, in illo tempore - to our as yet undestroyed world where the brookies still wimple and swim, while not releasing us from the recorded destruction in the novel: &quot;Maps and mazes.

A table is not a table because it has one flat plane and 3-4 legs as support, but it&#039;s daily day to day interaction with Dasein gives it its being. This knowledge is integrated automatically as background information and is not a conscious process. This is how objects take their being. Now, Heidegger also believed that poetic language can reveal aspects of Dasein that are usually hidden because it renders beings/objects in a different light for Dasein (I am using it as a noun but it isn&#039;t). Language is intrinsically tied with Dasein. Naming is the second step for Dasein to cognize objects as individual beings.<br><br>It is in the 2nd one that I see resemblance to Blood Meridian. The middle of the novel (nearly 200 pages) are almost exclusively landscape descriptions and natural imagery. But McCarthy&#039;s use of Similes and figurative language constantly casts &#039;known&#039; objects (usually features of geology with specific names) in almost alien, sometimes transcendent light. They become highly suggestive. This is possibly how language imbues symbols onto objects and is the basis of symbolism. But symbols in Blood meridian are unresolved. Images can imply any interpretation from any school of thought, even contradictory ones to the meaning of these scenes. This is what makes the task of interpreting the novel definitively, impossible. McCarthy&#039;s imagery is very vivid but also very associative and it seems to not observe a singular narrative line along which he might have wished to string his descriptions.<br>I would say that this may have been a function of poetic language than anything deliberate on McCarthy&#039;s part but for this one excerpt:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their figures now quick with clarity and now fugitive in the strangeness of that same light. Like things whose very portent renders them ambiguous. Like things so charged with meaning that their forms are dimmed.</span><br>McCarthy clearly knows what his use of language is doing to the world/story he is describing. It is even acknowledged within the book by the narrator. The image of Judge and the fool travelling through the desert becomes suggestive, metaphorical such that readers will pay greater attention to the suggested symbols (King lear and his fool for one) than the literal objects themselves (the 7 foot albino judge and the shit-eating drooling fool). And in typical McCarthy fashion the suggested metaphor doesn&#039;t slot into any of the many interpretations of the novel.", "time": 1676224548, "resto": 21634950}, {"no": 21649589, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)12:58:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21649583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21649583</a><br>McCarthy&#039;s purpose here seems to show how language functions on the most fundamental level because finally all words are &quot;metaphors&quot; for their referrents.

But it is oblique, or should I say so obvious that most people never get it.<br><br>Additionally, I think Holden may also be a cheeky homage to Heidegger. He is also a master of language, a philosopher and speaks in the same convoluted but self aware way that Heidegger does in Being and Time. Both seem to be aware that some people will just label them sophists for the use of their kind of language. But what they are saying cannot be expressed in anyway else.

It is an exceptionally rich work. All his work is very rich and rigorous. McCarthy, like Melville, down the line might end up being seen as a philosopher or a visionary. But McCarthy might hold up better to rational/logic analysis because he seems to acknowledge the unreality of transcendence. <br><br>One thing I wished to add was that this figurative language, the suggestion in it, the suspense as you call it, might be McCarthy&#039;s way of implying presence of gnosis.

Language. All the great philosophers with great insights into the nature of being/world came to their final understanding when they finally had the words to express those insights. The permutation of words can deliver &quot;gnosis&quot;, if there is one to deliver. That&#039;s what Blood meridian seems to be trying, but mediated through the desert and the glanton gang and the Judge. It sounds ridiculous but the title is an homage to Jacob Boehme, who also has one epigraph at the beginning of the book, and Boehme started writing visionary books about art, creativity, philosophy etc. after witnessing the sun reflected off a pewter dish. The absurdity of the book&#039;s meditation is also an homage to the absurdity of Boehme&#039;s artistic inspiration.

The way to realize this is by relying on lots of sacrifice, chantings and rituals, also on material objects which magically purify the minds for them, like sounds, logic, mantras, little beads, amulets.<br> Mahayana-Hinduism tries to make a human society, some political system too.<br><br> It is only when there is a allegedly good creator [a god or just &#039;&#039;nature&#039;&#039;] that it makes sense to ask the usual question &#039;&#039;why the cosmos produce things which do not know that they are the cosmos?&#039;&#039; ie &#039;&#039;why some good god did not get people to be born directly enlightened? instead of being born unenlightened which produces lots of suffering?&#039;&#039;<br> So far the Hindus have no answer to this &#039;&#039;problem of evil&#039;&#039;.

The way to get enlightened is to purify the mind, however not with useless incantations and rituals nor with magical objects, nor worship, unlike the Hindus do, but with the mind itself, ie all the time inclining [with the mind] the mind towards what the buddha calls good qualities and then directly knowing the mind as it really is, which is anicca, dukkha, anatta [contrary to what the hindus say], which is the condition for dispassion, dispassion which is the condition for liberation, liberation which is the condition for direct knowledge that dukkha is ended.", "time": 1676353424, "resto": 21650880}, {"no": 21656365, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)00:44:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21654123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21654123</a><br>Good post.", "time": 1676353447, "resto": 21650880}, {"no": 21656377, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)00:48:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21654444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21654444</a><br>Yes, reminds you of the army in Xenophon&#039;s Anabasis performing a sacrifice and augury ritual every morning to decide whether and where the ten thousand should march.

Like the aforementioned individuals, Klages was against industrialization and modernity.<br><br>Klages warned about the dangers of Abrahamic/Mazdan eschatology, which views the world as inherently flawed and in need of improvement. This idea of progress, born from Abrahamic/Mazdan Messianism and eschatology, is at the root of much of the world&#039;s ills. According to Klages, nothing positive has come from the concept of progress. He devoted a significant amount of time to investigating this topic.<br><br>Klages also criticized logocentrism, which prioritizes fixed and discrete categorization and segmentation. Logocentrism coupled with the march of progress can be referred to as an expression of &quot;Geist&quot; (spirit). Geist is in opposition to &quot;Seele&quot; (soul), which is vitalistic and already pure and perfect, similar to the concept of one&#039;s Original Nature in Ch&#039;an. The spirit is parasitic to the soul and mechanizes &amp; destroys it. This is why, despite all the &quot;progressive rhetoric&quot; such as calls for more scientific growth, diversity, inclusivity, and so on, we see more destruction of ethnic diversity, biodiversity, and so on. For instance, a progressive liberal may claim to support ethnic diversity, but their progressive rhetoric, rooted in Geist, ultimately leads to the destruction of diversity through immigration policies. Another example is a scientist who claims to care about life, but through their pro-industrial and progressive rhetoric, they end up cutting down old-growth forests, polluting the ocean, empowering devastating weapons, limiting human autonomy, and separating humanity from nature and community. <br><br>It is important to note that Ludwig Klages&#039;s philosophy is complex and multifaceted. The information I am presenting here is only a limited overview of one aspect of his ideas.

Regarding all such attempts, we feel that man simply does not have the ability to bring about a transformation of his inner life on his own. We stated earlier that the ancients never presumed to unravel nature&#039;s secrets by means of experiments, and never thought to conquer her through the use of machines, which they dismissed as clever contraptions that were suitable only for slaves; we now insist, moreover, that they abhorred such attempts as ungodliness. Forest and spring, boulder and grotto were for them filled with sacred life; from the summits of their lofty mountains blew the storm-winds of the gods (it was not from lack of a &quot;feeling for nature&quot; that one did not climb their peaks!), and tempest and hailstones threatened or clashed furiously in the play of battle. When the Greeks desired to construct a bridge across a stream, they begged the river deity to pardon this deed of man for which they atoned by offering up to him a sacrificial libation of wine. In ancient German lands, an offense against a living tree was expiated by the shedding of the offender&#039;s blood. Today&#039;s mankind sees only childish superstition in those who attend to the planetary currents. He forgets that the interpreting of apparitions was a way of scattering blooms around the tree of an inner life, which shelters a deeper knowledge than all of science: the knowledge of the world-weaving power of all-embracing love. Only when this love has been renewed in mankind will the wounds inflicted by the matricidal spirit be healed.&quot; <br>- (Man and Earth essay)", "time": 1676332312, "resto": 21654861}, {"no": 21655268, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:53:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655252</a><br>so humans are perfect but should be more in line with nature but also not the nature that involves killing and subjugation", "time": 1676332390, "resto": 21654861}, {"no": 21655270, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:53:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655263</a><br>Compassion based on notions of progress is not real compassion.<br>Compassion asks for nothing in return and seeks nothing. <br>Trying to change the world to fit your idea of &quot;perfection&quot; in fact leads to the inverse.", "time": 1676332420, "resto": 21654861}, {"no": 21655279, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:54:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655270</a><br>This is literally a sentiment in the Bible", "time": 1676332474, "resto": 21654861}, {"no": 21655281, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:55:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655270</a><br>And this ideal of perfection is a point in time that would be the ancient times, that came about somehow, but not through progress?", "time": 1676332516, "resto": 21654861}, {"no": 21655292, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)18:57:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "OP if you want some help on this quest against progress I\u2019d strongly recommend you look into Calvinism and English Puritanism as those movements blended a lot of what you\u2019re talking about together.

It took some time (about 5 months) but I&#039;m seeing some fruition so I came to leave an update there. I have 3 distinct friend circles in my new city, which are made of about 4 people each. One of those circles is never gonna cross the others, including my old city friend circles as my personality is radically different with them. I&#039;m also keeping that social circle private because I&#039;m flirting with a woman I don&#039;t want anyone to meet inside as I&#039;m fucking tired of women destroying my buddies groups. <br><br>The end goal is to have different lives I can swap whenever I get bored and, if I can manage to, different women I can meet and spend time with. I will stay celibate to make sure peace is respected in those friend groups. My next move is to solidify my current social circles as much as I can then unlock another flirt. It&#039;s funny to write but the hardest part in all of this is to make sure no one in a given isolated social circles is aware of other social circles and keep the secret to my grave. I can&#039;t talk to anybody about that plan, or at least not in great details to my normie friends because this will out me as some kind of manipulative bastard. I&#039;ve only told a single friend who I think is a sociopath and is literally doing the same thing as me in another country right now.

A strongly opinionated person is precisely someone who knows the least on a given subject. It is a compensation. To me, these opinionated people are not to be trusted. How little any of us actually knows about the world. How far it is that what any of us REALLY have is an objective, dispassionate, yet somehow fervent opinion of the world. There is always a personal motivation. An opinion, especially a political one, is always a form of vengeance, of putting a certain group of people &quot;in their place&quot;, as a correction for some deeply held grievance. This is why the opinionated person must always force his view on others: the raison d&#039;etre of the opinion is to change the perception of reality or of himself in the eyes of others, not to evaluate. A man who is opinionated but silent is redundant.<br><br>I&#039;m reminded of being at a bar with a young man who was hell-bent on turning the conversation toward the fact that all women are whores. He clearly had no methodology for his conclusions, but he was only expressing whatever in that moment made him feel vindicated in his scorn for women. He would have loudly agreed with any comment made about women in that moment so long as it was negative. Clearly, if he could convince himself and others that all women are indeed whores, then he is innocent of his own failures that led him to that sad position.<br><br>The opinionated person is always confessing something about himself. Narcissists are very telling in this regard. The narcissist is someone who is always ill-at-ease, and whom seeks to compensate his feelings of inadequacy by aggressively asserting some form of trashing others.

I would worry less about some of the things the other anon mentioned, like your scholarly contribution, since scholarship is mostly dead and terrible now. I mean, care about that stuff if you want, but know what the stakes are before you wade in. Definitely don&#039;t expect grad school to be some life of the mind shit. Maybe it will be for you, maybe you have one of the few remaining fields where people are still cool and things are small enough that it isn&#039;t 70% taken over by racial grievance studies. But maybe not. That&#039;s where you have to do your due diligence and figure it out.<br><br>Once you know what you want and what the odds of getting it are, you can decide. For example if you know you could get a free ride at Princeton and have literally 6 years to finish a book project you intended to finish anyway, and scraping to meet the other statistical anomaly autistic people you want to be friends with, and you don&#039;t mind then being a 30+ year old English PhD applying for $60k/yr jobs at libraries, and you don&#039;t mind that most of your peers on the way there are likely to be very rich very &quot;gay acting&quot; people and hypersocial office women or that all of them will be studying colonialism and transgender Shakespeare, then maybe it&#039;s good for you. It&#039;s just not one size fits all. <br><br>I would demystify it first and foremost. Unfortunately this is something that can&#039;t be done until you&#039;re on the other side. One thing I recommend contemplating is that when you&#039;re 35, if you&#039;re a decent honest person anyway, nothing really matters anymore except having money to live and a lifestyle you identify with. At 21 it&#039;s easy to think having a PhD is objectively important or objectively meaningful but just like how you don&#039;t think of your SATs after you graduate your BA, you probably won&#039;t think of your PhD once you&#039;re just some guy with a PhD. But there is another kind of person who really really identifies with having a PhD. You can find them on Twitter, telling you and everyone that they have a PhD.

I suppose I don&#039;t have any strong criticisms towards Barth, and I have read one of his books from cover to cover, so maybe he is my favorite. <br>Lost in the Funhouse was maybe too slow, but that&#039;s a minor fault, and I found it pretty funny sometimes. He&#039;s not a genius like Pynchon, but Pynchon a lot of the time is just too verbose. That&#039;s also one of my criticisms of Krasznahorkai - the other being that he&#039;s too sentimental at times, with suicide children and all that.

I was raised Episcopalian so NO mass feels like a step down. The church, as a human institution, also has plenty of other problems. I think of the parable of the prodigal son as applying to the Roman and Orthodox churches\u2014Orthodox has strayed far less but, like the older brother, they grumble a lot. If the Roman church finds its way again it will be glorious. I am not personally convinced they are there yet. <br>St. Francis de Sales described a long, steep ladder to Jesus and a shorter, easier one that reaches Mary, then proceeds onward to Jesus. This metaphor can also apply to a good church. Church isn\u2019t necessary to establish a relationship with Christ but it can be sufficient. The sacraments are a very big part of that and they are where apostolic succession really matters. <br>I go to an Orthodox church because I take my kids there. My personal practice is very rooted in the Rosary, the Psalms and the Sacred Heart. It\u2019s taken me to some pretty good places. The Jesus Prayer is much better known in Orthodox circles but there is still an Orthodox variant of the Rosary fwiw. I read both Roman and Orthodox writers and have gotten plenty out of each. <br>If you are serious about church and serious about finding the true/best church, my two cents is examine your motives, get good with Christ, pray to the Spirit for discernment, then go and see.

You have your own temperament, your own personality. When you hate a writer, instead of thinking there&#039;s something wrong with yourself, you should ask the question: why do I hate it?<br><br>Sometimes, specially if it&#039;s a great author like Homer or Dante, the fault is really in you. Perhaps you are not ready for the book, or you don&#039;t know enough to appreciate it. In this case, you need to leave the book, learn more, and come back to it a few years later.<br>Sometimes it&#039;s just a specific lack of sensibility which you cannot fix, but that&#039;s not a problem either, it&#039;s just who you are -- Tolstoy hated Shakespeare, but that&#039;s because Tolstoy was a firm 19th century moralist and down-to-earth realist, and he couldn&#039;t help being otherwise, so it would be difficult for him to love a man who was, in a profound way, one of the most pagan, fantastic and amoral writers of all. In cases like these, you need to know how to differentiate between taste and quality. I personally dislike Jane Austen, because I can&#039;t stand the overly Protestant environment of her novels - what on earth happened to sex? But I recognize her merits as a writer anyways, because she was indeed a good novelist. It&#039;s just that our temperaments do not match.<br>But when you are really convinced that the writer is overrated, and it does happen from time to time, then you just have to recognize some profound disagreement in aesthetics and philosophy, not just in temperament, like the disagreements between Pound and Milton, Faulkner and Hemingway, Quevedo and G\u00f3ngora, the academics and the impressionists. This too is part of a literary education.

To that end the thing must be made unconscious: that is the aim of every holy lie.\u2014The order of castes, the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an order of nature, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary fiat, no &quot;modern idea,&quot; can exert any influence. In every healthy society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and feeling of perfection. It is not Manu but nature that sets off in one class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only mediocrity\u2014the last-named represents the great majority, and the first two the select. The superior caste\u2014I call it the fewest\u2014has, as the most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can goodness escape being weakness. Pulchrum est paucorum hominum: goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees ugliness\u2014or indignation against the general aspect of things. Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. &quot;The world is perfect&quot;\u2014so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the instinct of the man who says yes to life. &quot;Imperfection, whatever is inferior to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala themselves are parts of this perfection.&quot; The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others.... cont.</span>", "time": 1676121077, "resto": 21643328}, {"no": 21644288, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)08:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21644285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644285</a><br><a href=\"#p21644255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21644255</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Knowledge\u2014a form of asceticism.\u2014They are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them being the most cheerful and most amiable.

The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals, the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is rough in the business of ruling\u2014their followers, their right hand, their most apt disciples.\u2014In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing &quot;made up&quot;; whatever is to the contrary is made up\u2014by it nature is brought to shame.... The order of castes, the order of rank, simply formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution of higher types, and the highest types\u2014the inequality of rights is essential to the existence of any rights at all.\u2014A right is a privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre. Life is always harder as one mounts the heights\u2014the cold increases, responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture, science, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of occupational activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not society, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines.

I picked up programming in a few months, enough to do some fun stuff with it (tough I&#039;m still a beginner), but a true poet like Yeats took me ten years to absorb, and to this day there is much in him which I don&#039;t understand. This is because poetry is open to many interpretations and involves just too many things for there to be any clear route towards learning it, which is why Literature courses are a scam. There is no TAOCP for poetry, the best you&#039;ll get are rough guides by individual poets, like Horace&#039;s Ars Poetica or Pound&#039;s ABC of Reading, and the rest is left to your own individuality, or personality, assuming you have any and most people don&#039;t. You can do everything Pound recommends and you&#039;ll end up a Pound imitator, nothing else. Sooner or later you&#039;ll be entirely on your own, both as a reader and as an author, and then there is no clear learning route, only personaltiy, instinct and the help of accumulated knowledge. <br><br>Mathematics is just one specific type of thinking, based on logic. Once you now how to do it, it&#039;s just a matter of learning concepts and not skipping over prerequisites. <br>Theorem proving is harder, not because it&#039;s really hard, but because it demands too much time and concentration and exploration of possible solutions, including possible connections with other areas of math. Where it gets really hard is in higher, creative maths, which should be reserved to those who wish to be professional mathematicians, the Perelmans and Scholzes of the world. If you&#039;re not one of them, there&#039;s little point in it, because mediocrity has no point other than suicide.<br><br>Poetry demands *all* kinds of thinking, it can have rigorous logical reasoning and abstract structure, visual richness, emotional content, humor, and philosophy all at once. Think of Dante&#039;s sestinas or any passage from the Commedia.<br>Pure mathematics is beautiful in itself too, but its beauty is syntactical. Numbers don&#039;t mean anything, there&#039;s no real semantics, with few exceptions, such as when dealing with problems which inevitably lend themselves to practical applications and possible consequences for physics - yet even then the semantics is in our mind, the numbers are just its syntax. I think Mathematics is one of the great arts, but below poetry, music, painting, and others, because it doesn&#039;t excite the whole brain and body, only a part of it, even if it&#039;s one of the most noble parts - that of rigorous, clear thought.<br><br>Learning mathematics is like learning how to pilot a ship through the Atlantic: a precise procedure with a precise goal. Learning poetry is like learning how to love a woman: highly imprecise, improvisational, and you&#039;re never quite sure if you&#039;re doing it right or even if you ought to be doing it, but you&#039;ll know it when you get there.", "time": 1676251555, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651207, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651198</a><br>Hegel is literally one of the most influential philosophers of all time retard, he has changed the world in more ways than electrodynamics has.", "time": 1676251576, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651218, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:27:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;born 1770</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most influential</span><br>I think not.", "time": 1676251665, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651219, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:27:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651137</a><br>Electrodynamics is one of the most esthetic theories ever devised. <br><br><a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he has changed the world in more ways than electrodynamics has.</span><br>The bait was alright up to that point.", "time": 1676251670, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651221, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:28:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651206</a><br>imagine writing up this whole cope", "time": 1676251682, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651234, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:30:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651207</a><br>hegel was only influential because he was a propagandist for prussia and his descendant marx became the basis of a state religion in a relatively short lived 20th century empire. they both are just ideologies pushed by now defunct states. waste of time.", "time": 1676251825, "resto": 21650919}, {"no": 21651236, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)20:31:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651219</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The bait was alright up to that point.</span><br><br>It&#039;s not bait.

Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud was born in terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What Wagner calls the &quot;ur-myth&quot; reveals, in Oper und Drama, a recurrent conflict of individual and social wills. In order to explain this conflict Wagner uses two terms found elsewhere in his writings of this period, the words &quot;Will- k\u00fcr&quot; and &quot;Unwillk\u00fcr.&quot; &quot;Unwillk\u00fcr&quot; means &quot;not consciously willed&quot; or &quot;instinctive&quot;; and &quot;Willk\u00fcr,&quot; its antithesis, signifies conscious choice with pejorative overtones of despotism, caprice, and irrationality. The Mythos embodies the conflict of the instinctive-unconscious and the arbitrary-conscious in terms of the incompatibility of the individual will as immediate response to sensible reality with the social will as codified abstract. The story of ancient Thebes is cited to illustrate the political basis of the Mythos.</span><br><br>See Die Walkure for Wagner&#039;s own incest myth (which Marx and Engels formed their own theories on the family against).

So then there is no way that Paul would just casually say that any of his followers were sodomites.

That is a ridiculous and obtuse notion. He is obviously just mentioning that some of them had done some of those things. Any reasonable person can see that.

But in doing so they ignored what Paul also said to the church in 1 Corinthians 10:13, which is that, &quot;There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man&quot;.

I suggest you write to the language asks length of your desired outcome instead of anything else. I unfortunately have a hard time writing past my 16 page muscle memory. Sure I can make chapters but they aren\u2019t connected. If you wrote 1000 pages over 2 years then you would probably add another 500 pages after editing. You can always write more. So besides page kill count for the content, I suppose you would make a mock outline of where you want to take it. Take the odyssey for example. The core story is probably a short story but filled with you guessed it filler. Filler can also be very well noticed in the ancient stories such as hero is born, hero losses their parents, hero gets bullied, hero becomes the main character hero\u2019s journey to something, hero finds friends along the way, hero discovers obstacles, hero overcomes obstacles with friends, hero loses a friend to an obstacle, hero now is more motivated, hero defeats the final obstacle, hero\u2018s journey finishes, and all the filler to impose simple philosophy or complex philosophy to the reader. It could also be a continuation of a previous story(fan fiction), a brand new concept or a retelling of a story (you) love. Now editing, editing is a discipline. If you choose to edit yourself you won\u2019t be much of an original writer but more of an editor. IMO the best edits are as simple as \u201chey can you read my story and tell me if you get stuck or give me critical feedback as I wish to improve my writing.\u201d Be direct and exact with yourself and those you request to read your work.<br><a href=\"#p21656042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21656042</a><br>Write 50000 words and don\u2019t stop.

(You) will realize how to write in one tense. (You) will face your demons who may defeat you. So I guess enjoy the ride. Btw no book is a one shot and probably was written ten times over before a complete manuscript is turned in. One thing I really love about writing is there are really no restrictions. You want to spend 6 months to construct awesome complex characters to torture. You want to spend 6 months storyboarding the best expression of your story. I take breaks from writing my hobby work to \u201cenhance my writing skills\u201d in other disciplines as well.

However, he struggled with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco. He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing. He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote. Writing the novel took far longer than he expected; he wrote every day for 18 months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord. During the 18 months of writing, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and \u00c1lvaro Mutis, and Mar\u00eda Luisa El\u00edo and Jom\u00ed Garc\u00eda Ascot, every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions.

King is the worst in all of them. He has a good frame idea, and then the rest of the novels are talking about soup cans and roads. He thinks he&#039;s doing something for Americana, like Hawthorne did for the House of the Seven&#039;s Gable&#039;s by describing the history of the house as a character, instead of the person, but he&#039;s not and he always fails at it. He doesn&#039;t know how to build up meaning, and just projects anger and self loathing that someone with a basic English major would do, if their brain was fried on drugs for years to be able to see deeper meaning. His books have no editor after Carrie, they are too much of a mess in between the beginning concept and the end resolution. They just let him rant for 950 pages of a 1000 page book, with nothing that other genre writers make endearing with world building. The only world building that exists in Stephen King novels is that he connects the books with different plots together, but the story telling is just him self loathing and a man screaming about Americana for 1000 pages. The only good thing about Stephen King books is they are a prime A grade example of what a narcissistic drug addict thinks is reality. Any screen writer could butcher Stephen King&#039;s plots into a two hour movie, even if the book is a thousand pages long, and it would always come out better than his work, because his ideas are just the frame tail surrounded by less than trash writing, but amateur rantings without meaning. <br><br>Dean Koontz is a significantly better writer, because every chapter of a Dean Koontz novel has structure with a beginning and resolution, which build ups actual tension if one can identify with the character or not. In a Stephen King novel, it&#039;s just rants, and he hopes you identify with the character because every character is Stephen King being angry at the world. A Dean Koontz novel will not have every character as a projection of the author and his psychosis, but there will be characters that the character doesn&#039;t understand. When there is a character that isn&#039;t Stephen King, it&#039;s a character that is a religious Christian because he has a pathological hate of Christianity, but no other religion. He&#039;s a spiritual Jew of the worst type, without possibly actually being a Jew. His world view is simple and Talmudic. He keeps on writing the same angry novel over and over again, because he&#039;s a hack. Not because he actually enjoys Horror, but Horror is his vehicle to hide behind his hate of this world and being born in it, without understanding anything out of shitty Boomer consumerism that he thinks is Hawthornesque.", "filename": "139238110_224501482494412_9209254982789565227_n", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 823, "h": 818, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676358720452824, "time": 1676358720, "md5": "L1snIIzstK/J3zAVkKliMw==", "fsize": 106687, "resto": 21652217}, {"no": 21656550, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)02:14:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655888</a><br>He could just not use Twitter and focus on writing books.

I&#039;ve tried to as an adult, as an act of meditation, but I no longer can get past a few pages of his work without groaning. What I remember the best is when I was a kid. I read Carrie as his first novel. Which I finished, and was a good novel, on an R.L. Stine level. It had a beginning and end, it was marketed to the write group that the novel was about. And it probably had an editor, since it&#039;s concise. After that, everything seems to be a mess, that either he refuses editors to cut up, or the editors are filtered out by the rambling rants. I tried to read others of his books, like The Shinning and The Stand, but only got halfway through. Perhaps the unabridged rework of the Stand, which only really seems to have minor changes with dates and times (forgive me, I read it as a teenager, and am now 38, it&#039;s been awhile, it could of had a couple of hundred more pages thrown in, but it would of been meaningless.)<br><br>So, let&#039;s look at the Stand. There is a disease killing off people. The novel is in two parts it seems. The beginning act is just 500 pages of people dying from the disease, and the other 500 pages I didn&#039;t get far into, seems to just be those people meeting up to get blown up (I saw the first TV adaptation,) I couldn&#039;t take anymore, after the first 500 pages. There was no world building. It was just random projections of Stephen King ranting at the world. He thinks he&#039;s the proletariat, and projects himself as it, but he&#039;s almost always been a rich protected Yankee from Maine, who hasn&#039;t seen the world outside of liberal cities he visits for book signings. He wants to be poor and weak, because he bought in completely to the FDR narrative that Greatest Gen Yankees living in the most protected place in the world sold retarded boomers as a child. We just went through a &quot;pandemic&quot; whether it was real or simulated, and there were characters from all over the world, from China, to Iran, to how African American Blacks reacted to it, to shady government politicians and capitalists like Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab exploiting the disease for whatever purpose, and even getting up on podiums to tell the masses they are exploiting them. None of those characters in real life, who are all complex and dynamic, are in the Stand. .... NOT EVEN CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT LIKE THAT. No, there are only characters that are examples of Stephen King&#039;s &quot;Every Man.&quot; And almost every character is the Every Man. ...... Same with IT, every kid in the movie versions (I didn&#039;t read IT at all,) but every kid is psychologically the same, even if Stephen King tries to make them different, they are all him as a child. <br><br>(continued.)", "time": 1676360604, "resto": 21652217}, {"no": 21656610, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)02:45:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21656547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21656547</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he has a pathological hate of Christianity, but no other religion.

You could learn a lot about the different ghosts, their hates, and how they are stuck in there with all the other ghosts, and why they want to harm the family. None of it makes sense, and the novel is not about that, as far as I got, which must of been 200 pages. It was all just ranting about alcoholism and abuse of children. ..... Seemingly from the perspective of Stephen King. At no time could I relate to the characters, except in the Kubrick adaptation. And at no point I did I think he was not writing about himself. It&#039;s like someone writing a confession that they threw a small 5 year old child across the room. I was a teenager when I read it, and didn&#039;t have multiple degrees like I do now to understand red flags where I should call social services on someone&#039;s writings. Because the novel sucks and is unrealistic and doesn&#039;t connect at all, except the one very obvious thing, Stephen King is ranting about having abused his child at some point, and how he got caught, and dragged into family counseling against his will. His therapists in real life must be really good at keeping their oath of confidentiality, because the novel doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s written by someone that genuinely want to scare his readers with a spooky ghost story, but a crazy man confessing out of guilt behind his shitty writing. <br><br>One of my degrees is in psychology, and I sort of want to meditate on Stephen King&#039;s writings as artifacts of a sick culture and the human soul, but I&#039;m no longer Buddhist, but converted to Christianity recently, and I am now cynical and see the world through Christian Sin and corruption, and I don&#039;t have to torture myself by reading Stephen King by studying books by people in lower states and frequencies. I am toying with writing myself, and have some minor things written under pseudonyms that no one reads yet, except my erotica. I might read Stephen King to teach myself what NOT to do as a writer, but he&#039;s not really even good for that, since he seems to less try at anything, and just writes drug fueled psychosis filler thousands of pages.

He&#039;s just insane, and it&#039;s hard to point out how there is no world building, because he&#039;s so empty as his novels are. He&#039;s achieves a Zen like level of being bad.

I can see why people say that Akira Kurosawa took the plot and turned it into Yojimbo, because it&#039;s so filled with intrigue. <br><br>I mean, any writer is better than Stephen King. And I mean almost any. I&#039;m reading the Dexter novels right now. They are simple and dumb. Because they are supposed to be. I&#039;m on the third one. They are not meant to be high artistic works merit. But each chapter has a resolution, or a cliff hanger. Which is what simple pulp like genres should have, as their base, and if they do better than that, ... than fine. <br><br>Stephen King is not even that. He&#039;s like a guy flashing a light in the eyes of a deer, and you think he&#039;s going somewhere, because his book is long and he talks a lot. But when you reflect on his works years later (I was a teen when I read him,) there is nothing of value in his chapters. He&#039;s a perfect study in what not to do when writing a chapter for a novel. He&#039;s stream of conscious rants pretending to be a story. And not in an artistic way. But in a totally unaware way. <br><br>A teacher sat him down at some point in college, and told him to write for a grade. And he never stopped writing for a grade, but this time it was exchanged for money. All authors want to make money. But I just don&#039;t see Stephen King having a second thought about what he is writing. <br><br>There is an interview where George R.R. Martin is asking I&#039;m about his writing process. Martin relents that he suffers in research, and thinking of characters, and their motivations. He will think of the currency and some kind of ideology, like feminism or how chivalry is bullshit. Whether you agree with Martin&#039;s politics and view of the world or not, or if his works are good or not, you can clearly see he thinks deeply about his projects. I don&#039;t like Martin&#039;s writing, but I respect them, because there is an effort. <br><br>King says to Martin, that he just sits down and types, without any research or thought.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

In this sense we may truly say that the good soul is the forgetful. It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual life, all that is foreign to that order.

This is something that happens directly to those who accept the truth. As Christ said, &quot;Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.&quot; (Luke 8:18)<br><br>In other words, someone who rejects the Gospel will be locked out of understanding the rest or recognizing God&#039;s word from falsehood. Meanwhile, someone who gladly receives the word of God will be given more, as it is God who gives us understanding in the first place. It also says that the sheep of the Shepherd know His voice, and will not follow the voice of a stranger (see John 10).

Whether something is considered to be within canon or not, this doesn&#039;t matter if you don&#039;t actually believe it in the first place. Answering the first question without really believing, is more or less meaningless. If you do believe, then you will arrive to the same singular truth as other believers, since the Lord really is helping people to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br><br><a href=\"#p21651752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651752</a><br>2 Peter is written by Peter the apostle, That&#039;s what it says in the very first verse.", "time": 1676269869, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652178, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:36:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651741</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would think that the reference to it in the bible would be the predecessor claim of authenticity to any official claiming that it isn&#039;t authentic right?</span><br>Not really. Imagine that some historical event really happened, like Enoch preaching, and later it was written down in the Bible. There is sometimes a time lag between the event happening and it being recorded. Now imagine some third party source might also write some of these things down elsewhere. That doesn&#039;t mean the Bible is copied from it, it just means a non-inspired source also recorded some things that happened. And there are other instances of this where we learn about what someone preached that is written in a later book of the Bible. For instance, Matthew 27:9 tells us that Jeremiah once spoke the same prophecy that is found written in Zechariah 11:12-13. That is new information in the New Testament, as the Old Testament only has it written in Zechariah. Another good example of this just from the Old Testament is where Isaiah is inspired to write about events regarding the rebellion of Lucifer, in Isaiah chapter 14. And where Ezekiel does the same in Ezekiel 28. Obviously, this is God revealing new information via the prophets about events that happened long before them, which, if we are the believe the Bible, is true.<br><br>It&#039;s possible that people before these prophets had some awareness of these things in some cases - such as that of Jeremiah. Although they ultimately were recorded in the Bible where we find them today. So this would explain the fact Enoch&#039;s prophecy is found in Jude. The most straightforward explanation is that it really happened, and with that it wouldn&#039;t be a contradiction if any number of people recorded it or mentioned it in non-biblical accounts. There are also non-biblical accounts of Jesus&#039; life, although sometimes they contradict the New Testament, especially when it comes to things like the Gnostic writings which had their own agenda behind them.", "time": 1676270175, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652208, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:51:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651075</a><br>awo[eigo[iwjehjoi[weeiowqevrnoewrv[<wbr>oirvnoivnoiHJOIAWEFIFEWHOIEWFHJOIEW<wbr>FHIO I KILLED HIM.", "time": 1676271070, "resto": 21651032}, {"no": 21652214, "now": "02/13/23(Mon)01:54:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "There&#039;s a lot of good reasons Enoch 2-4 is not canon.

It shows how Adam was misguided for trying to save someone else by descending into sin rather than trusting and loving God first. The whole point of this is to demonstrate to us that the right thing to do was always to trust God and love God first, rather than try to fix things ourselves. Although where Adam failed, Christ succeeded. Hence giving some motivation for why He is called the second Adam in 1 Corinthians 15.<br><br>&quot;For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<br>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot;<br>- 1 Corinthians 15:21-22<br><br>It reminds me of what Jesus said in Luke 14:26. &quot;If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.&quot; So we are not to repeat the mistakes of the past, but rather believe and trust in Christ, love Him first with our whole being. God in infinite wisdom and love knew all of this was going to happen, but intended for us to learn this all along. When they were banished from the Garden, they were given the prophecy of the seed who will crush the serpent&#039;s head in Genesis 3:15, which is what all of mankind was to believe in, since this is God&#039;s word.

Wherever a lot of spirits gather, the natural world becomes replaced by the realm of spirits. Before the change is complete, people must enter these realms and defeat the spirits&#039; leader to restore the world back to normal. Defeating major spirits earns people moon coins, which can be exchanged for a lot of real money and interesting goods at a special vendor. Only people with moon coins are able to enter the spirit realms. If the spirits kill you there, you won&#039;t die for real, but lose all the moon coins you&#039;ve gathered, can&#039;t ever enter a spirit realm again, and they say a personal tragedy awaits you. Money-hungry people take a big risk to get rich quick while protecting the world.

When a greedy empire plays the clan as a disposable diversion in their sneak invasion against the capital of Alberion, the protagonist ends up the lone survivor and at the mercy of the struggling locals.

While it is an issue, any amount of scripting won&#039;t cover the issues with your delivery. You waffle about without cutting your flubbed lines and your microphone quality is still not where it needs to be. Your mic is picking up an absurd amount of reverberation from your voice. This means that you are speaking too loudly in an untreated room with a microphone that does not handle background noise rejection. If you can&#039;t afford to throw $125 at acoustic foam then your next best option is to turn the gain down and move the microphone closer to your mouth. 6 inches away with the capsule and 15 degrees away from the front of your mouth to stop direct plosives.<br>As for your Vtuber avatar, upgrade or ditch it.

I&#039;ll second the other anon&#039;s observation that this appears to be less of a script and more an outline, but I&#039;m not sure expanding upon the outline can lead to an entertaining final product.

Deleuze quotes Henry Miller: &#039;To succeed in getting drunk, but on pure water&#039;. The most intense things are the subtlest, and to achieve them you need to be careful and alert. Every time I&#039;ve got better at writing, and felt like I was developing my aesthetic sense, it&#039;s been because I&#039;ve become better at discriminating and selecting, at figuring out which things &#039;work&#039; and which things are fluff or cliche or energy-dissipating.<br><br>Negativity is one of your most powerful aesthetic tools, because it&#039;s the instinct that pushes you to go beyond the mediocre cultural baggage that doesn&#039;t actually give you the ineffable &#039;thing&#039; you&#039;re looking for. Because that &#039;thing&#039; is ineffable, it&#039;s easier to say what it&#039;s not than to give a positive definition of what it is. Being negative and critical and discerning therefore helps you avoid those traps and dead-ends that take you further away from the &#039;thing&#039;.<br><br>Making unexpected connections is good, but you have to learn to sense which connections are the most intense and meaningful. You can&#039;t just blend everything together into a big abstract soup. If you mix together every colour of paint, you end up with grey. The most intense things are the most concrete and specific, because they contain abstract forces in a delicate one-off configuration that can&#039;t be untangled.<br><br>I don&#039;t think any writer (that I&#039;ve read) makes language as eerily intense as Samuel Beckett, but he doesn&#039;t achieve it by some big sprawling opera about the mystical creative soul of language; he achieves it by stripping things down to the bare essentials of teeth and tongues and lonely unanswered voices in small rooms.

Saying what it&#039;s about would be a spoiler, or at least the narrative seems set up that way, which I find to be a risky idea, as it may require a lot of trust from the reader that the story is eventually going to go somewhere. There&#039;s a central idea that&#039;s explored, <s> the fermi paradox </s> but it&#039;s not evident that that&#039;s the idea until late in the book, so it may be inaccurate to say that&#039;s what the book is about. There&#039;s also a persistent aquatic motif which doesn&#039;t seem to tie into anything else in the book. It&#039;s something Reynolds seems to have done for aesthetic effect as far as I could tell.<br><br>The relationships among the crew of initially almost 150 on the space mining vessel is mostly what&#039;s focused on. Unfortunately, I have several complaints about Reynold&#039;s characters and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s one of his strengths. I didn&#039;t like any of them and the relationship that has the most time devoted to it is petty, overwrought, and unpleasant. There are quite a few named characters, though none of them really matter. I felt like the narrative was rather detached from the characters even though they were the focus, which was an odd feeling and may have just been me. Surprisingly for a Reynolds novel, identity issues were not a major part of the plot, though they&#039;re still present in other ways.<br><br>The story is divided three parts. I didn&#039;t like the first, the second was ok, and third was almost enjoyable, but not quite. I wouldn&#039;t have read through the first part if this wasn&#039;t something I read and discussed together. Those who don&#039;t like the first part, which is mostly arguing about whether they ought to be chasing a moon, may like the the second and third parts more, as they are about <s> trying to establish a sustainable society on a moon and then contact with alien species. </s> These are ideas that with other authors I have liked more, though there&#039;s often dissonance between what I think I&#039;d like and reading it in practice.<br><br>Overall, it&#039;s fine, even though this early standalone Reynolds features most of the problems I tend to have with him. The pacing is sluggish as it takes far too long before its premise is realized. I would&#039;ve preferred it be a few hundred pages shorter and there are various subplots that could&#039;ve been omitted. It does however provide for thoughtful consideration, fun speculation, and has generally interesting ideas, even though most of them are mostly in the background. This is the 10th book by Reynolds that I&#039;ve read, almost all of which I&#039;ve either read and discussed with others, or at least read at their behest. He&#039;s not an author that I would seek out. If I&#039;m asked to read more of him though, I will, because they are sufficiently worthwhile to read and discuss together.<br><br>Rating: 3/5", "filename": "pushing-ice", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1858, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676258987185557, "time": 1676258987, "md5": "OoDDEMetETFtc75VYFx+sw==", "fsize": 218058, "resto": 21647897, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21651697, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)22:34:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651671</a><br>Was it Zahn who wrote about the fucking space whale monks that can teleport?", "time": 1676259274, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651727, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)22:42:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish I could just press a button that would just instantly gas every Star Wars and Star Trek fan or creator in existence.", "time": 1676259749, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651833, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:10:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21651727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21651727</a><br>I appreciate Trekkies paying the first mover cost for every other fandom in a lot of ways, even though the property itself is awful and kiked to the moon.<br><br>The only good thing to come out of Star Wars was Lucas Arts PC games.", "time": 1676261437, "resto": 21647897}, {"no": 21651887, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)23:28:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wonderful.
