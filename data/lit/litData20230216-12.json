I don&#039;t know why (because I was a dumb kid), but I answered that &quot;She&#039;s so wonderful!&quot;, not that I spent much time daydreaming about her or ever even talking to her. But I said it nonetheless, I suppose because it just occurred to me at the time that she was pretty. In the next few years my classmates would occasionally tease me by reminding me of this remark of mine loud and clear.<br><br>Then, one day my mother came into my room. She had a small dark green piece of paper on her hand. She handed it to me and told me that I have mail. Nothing could have perplexed me more, but I took it and immediately read what it contained. To my devastation, it was a love letter! A love letter from the very same girl I previously mentioned. It was short and sweet, and said something along the lines of &quot;Hi Anon, I don&#039;t know how to say this to you straight but I think I like you.&quot;, with the girl&#039;s first name scribbled at the end at the bottom. I was shocked to receive a letter like this and equally surprised that she had come forward to me like that. But my feelings were not exactly positive. <br><br>I was a very sheltered and introverted boy at the time, partly because of my upbringing and partly because of my social status at school. I had earned a bit of a reputation for being a gullible, dumb kid. Not bad at school, quite the opposite actually, but uninformed and simple in &quot;street&quot; terms. And I&#039;ve always been a late bloomer socially speaking as well. It wasn&#039;t until late upper middle school that I finally began opening up, but that was after changing schools and getting more accepting and friendlier schoolmates. But at this time, I was still in fourth or fifth grade, when I was a clueless, dumb kid. The odd one out, often. The weird kid. At times I felt like I was bullied and pushed around by the others, and while that probably isn&#039;t entirely untrue I probably overthought it at the time.<br><br>My personality and state of maturity at the time of receiving this sudden love letter being what it was, I hope my reaction to it is more understandable. My heart was racing, and my mind was filled with a host of conflicting emotions. How should I talk to her about this? How should I respond to her feelings? How would others react? How do I even feel to begin with? What do people usually do in situations like this? I was in a state of chaos. To make matters worse my parents were very giddy about the whole ordeal while refraining from proactively sharing some much-needed wisdom. And my brother made fun of it all. I felt the pressure of outside expectations already building up.<br><br>But I tried to take a step forward, if only out of courtesy. One day after school I talked to her! I somewhat awkwardly told her that I had received her letter and that I was happy about it. I asked whether we could walk home together, and she said yes.", "filename": "1672017881972539", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 651, "h": 655, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676497400740892, "time": 1676497400, "md5": "zuTmJao4+6NgPpx3GPJMxA==", "fsize": 59591, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21663699, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:47:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663491</a><br>Yep.

We had walked a few minutes when I realized that neither of us had said a single word the whole time! Neither of us really knew each other. I had no recollection of ever speaking to her before, let alone call her name (aside from that single situation in second grade, which may have indirectly lead to her sending that love letter to me)! And after I had realized this it became even more awkward to start a conversation. It felt like my mouth was welded shut, and the entire walk went on until we reached my house which, I later learned, was only about fifty or so meters away from hers. I awkwardly said something like &quot;Well, this is my home. I&#039;ll be off now, see you!&quot;, and I immediately got into my room feeling physically exhausted.<br><br>I still didn&#039;t know how I felt or what I should have done, and seeing as I was receiving no guidance or aid of any kind I felt like I was on my own in this. After asking my parents I only received vague advice like &quot;Just talk to her&quot;, or &quot;Don&#039;t worry it will shape up well&quot;, so I decided to try again later.<br><br>Some time later we again walk back hone together. Not much else happened, again. I said something meaningless like commenting on how the weather and got &quot;Ah, okay...&quot;, or &quot;Yeah...&quot;, and similar sorts of answers. But not much else. She wasn&#039;t taking the initiative and I hadn&#039;t the slightest clue how I should, either.<br><br>We repeated this behavior a number of times without much success in improving our budding love story. And once my peers started noticing they wasted no time in yelling at me about her from a distance: &quot;Oh Anon, Anonette is so wonderful!&quot;, &quot;Hi there lovebirds!&quot;, that sort of light teasing. It was a major blow to my ego at the time. I couldn&#039;t cope with it all and our relationship never went anywhere. We never learned much about each other before I had to transfer to another school.<br><br>To this day I feel regret and shame about it all. I feel sorry for her. Sorry that she had to fall for me of all people. Today I happened to drive past her house. Or her parents&#039; house, I don&#039;t know if she lives there still. I saw her standing outside the lawn talking to somebody. I think it was her anyways, and I think she was talking to a guy about our age. She noticed me driving by and she stared at me the whole time. But I couldn&#039;t return her gaze. I didn&#039;t dare. If only I knew what she was thinking... I half wanted to stop the car and apologize to her, apologize for not being able to reciprocate her feelings or even talk to her properly back then, that I wanted to be better but couldn&#039;t.

The shortest version is something like I got very close to someone but then I disappeared for a while out of some anxiety from a previous bad experience. I came back a few months later and was put through the ringer for having left right at the moment of greatest pre-attachment. Two years of bipolar abuse later (all of which I accepted because I&#039;m most easily motivated by guilt above all other motivators) and things went kaput, but only after something happened that made the following passage (from some internet intellectual or whatever I only heard about recently) hit me like a ton of bricks for reminding me of how things finally collapsed:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For the overdog, making the underdog mad is an excellent tactic\u2014it is a way to induce \u201cfear biting,\u201d a violent response to nonviolent abuse. Observed casually, this creates a superficial narrative in which the underdog looks like the instigator. Self-flattering narratives are often built out of casual self-observation. You actually believe your own victim narrative, even when you bullied the underdog into a corner; he desperately nipped at you; then you methodically tore his throat out. In fact, you\u2019d like to file a police report\u2026 you may be suing his estate\u2026 you\u2019re not usually one to litigate, but\u2026</span><br>I know all of it is at least half my fault because reasons. Those reasons being that I&#039;m over-inhibited by both temperament and upbringing so I&#039;m drawn to women with impulse control problems. Not my first time getting burned, but no previous experience has left me so damn bitter. Usually I just mope for a few months and self-isolate, but this time around I&#039;ve been left with so much negativity. Humiliated that I ever thought she was anything other than a bipolar e-girl. Confused that I was so enthralled by her facile charisma. Mad I wasn&#039;t disgusted by her obsessive self-pity. Embarrassed that I sought advice from close friends about her. Frustrated that I played perfectly into her hands to construct the narrative for the audience. Baffled that I ignored every red flag and tolerated what would normally cause me to dismiss someone out of hand because I felt guilty for following my (completely correct) gut instincts. I dunno, but that Florence Nightingale quote (pic related) rings truer and truer the older I get and I&#039;m worried I&#039;ve lost the ability to let anyone in; maybe I&#039;ve reached the threshold of experiences with bad women that now I can only interpret everything in the most negative way possible, immediately jump to conclusions of narcissism, hypocrisy, and toxic femininity.<br><br><a href=\"#p21663844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663844</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s interesting how people seem to divide into stimulant-types and sedative-types.</span><br>&quot;Bunnies like to go slow and turtles like to go fast&quot; is the phrase I&#039;ve heard.<br><br><a href=\"#p21663922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663922</a><br>No one is forcing you to work an office job.

I&#039;ve met people who&#039;ve had a lot of success with it. You can of course do these with the help of a therapists and some therapists have training in CBT, but you should ask them up front of they practice CBT before committing to a mental health provider.

The game takes various characters from Family Guy, Futurama, American Dad!, Bob&#039;s Burgers, King of the Hill, and Archer and assigns them a number 1-10. With 1 being the lowest rarity as red. Gold being the highest rarity at 10. It&#039;s great. You can even combine different cards to make even greater numbered cards. For instance, a red Quagmire with a power of 2 &amp; a blue Bender with a power of 4 makes a green whatever character power of 6. Whoever has the highest number wins. In the case of a tie, you lay three cards face down and flip each one over and count the numbers I think.

I look back on so much of my life and it&#039;s all such a blur, I remember things and I remember some thoughts I may have had but I can&#039;t really recall how I used to think.

The rich and the poor; black and white; men and women.* A few examples of movies would be: The Great Dictator, The Defiant Ones, To Kill A Mockingbird, West Side Story, Norma Rae, Tootsie, and Working Girl. Of course, the REAL point isn&#039;t that we are equal, but that everyone who isn&#039;t a white man has had it bad. So then, for the sake of equality we must vote in non-whites and women. We must let in people to make up for history. <br>Equality...https://youtu.be/Y9TviIu<wbr>XPSE?t=1625 &quot;You cannot legislate equality...if you want to be equal, you have to deserve it.&quot;<br>Because of brainwashing -- which isn&#039;t new to media; read Dickens -- people don&#039;t understand this. Diversity is our strength. Why? It just is : )<br>2) As it&#039;s obvious psychology is bullshit, so are many of the labels often thrown around, such as &quot;narcissist&quot;. Yes, a &quot;narcissist&quot; can develop a high sense of self from constant praise (&quot;you&#039;re so great&quot; &quot;everyone loves you&quot;), but there is an even bigger issue -- single parents. Specifically, single mothers. A missing Father means a lack of real discipline; it means young men taking advice on how to talk to women from their mothers; worst of all, it means learning to never control your emotions; to tame the passions. Those quick to violence or anger haven&#039;t tamed their passions, nor have the protesters who scream through megaphones. <br>3) Executives, contrary to mainstream public opinion, are aware of the brainwashing and refuse to fall for it, likely due to higher education, or knowing someone who was part of the manipulation process (directors, producers, etc.). Another buzzword appears to describe these people: &quot;psychopaths&quot; or &quot;sociopaths&quot;. Yet, they are aware that 98% of the world is conditioned, and so as their goal is to make a bunch of money -- as money is power -- they give the public what they want. Execs don&#039;t actually socialize with anyone other than themselves and their other colleagues (in film: actors, crew, etc.), so they learn about the public through social media sites such as twitter. Twitter is of course filled with students (indoctrinated) who are vocal and prolific in their opinions. Execs take this to be the pulse of society, and so they make changes, hoping to continue making money. I am referring strictly to goyim execs.

Why? It just is : )</span><br>I believe the truth is simply that the championing of diversity by the state &amp; powerful actors is due to the inevitability of changing demographics, as the U.S must increase immigration to counter population decline. Given that a increasingly multicultural future is unavoidable, promoting diversity becomes a way of getting ahead of the curve, throwing the browns a symbolic bone, and attempting to instill among white people tolerance as a virtue so as to pre-emptively inoculate them to the change and prevent the future unrest which will come with changing demographics. Leaders know this change is coming, they have likely studied all the data available to them, and see that racial unrest tends to birth populistic sentiment which could threaten their power, and the power of the state as a whole. <br>In France it came out that the U.S was actively founding various diversity programs in France. In a Wikileaks leaked note from a U.S ambassador, the ambassador spelled out the pragmatic reason. Put simply by encouraging these programs the U.S state helped ensure that France, given its changing demographics, would not become engulfed in racialized violence which would disrupt France&#039;s effectiveness as an ally to the U.S.<br>Domestically, the rationale behind encouraging diversity is the same--to prevent racial unrest from weakening the state.<br>This is the state&#039;s rationale, but the state is not the only actor here. Among average people, &quot;diversity&quot; rhetoric is a simultaneous political demarcation and a status symbol, a sign that you can employ the rhetoric used by the savvy progressive professional class and so fit in among the upper middle urbanites.<br>And of course in-between all these there are the simple cynical grifters who use this rhetoric merely to milk a profit.", "filename": "Studio_Project (6)", "ext": ".png", "w": 1280, "h": 556, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 54, "tim": 1676544853534093, "time": 1676544853, "md5": "DXJlvLggyr8S1ssFe45q3w==", "fsize": 1507835, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666398, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:55:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666385</a><br>-&gt; <a href=\"#p21666298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666298</a>", "time": 1676544935, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666412, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:00:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666398</a><br>What?", "time": 1676545248, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666417, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:02:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666412</a><br>You lack confidence", "time": 1676545360, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666437, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:07:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666417</a><br>Just say that.", "time": 1676545679, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666443, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:09:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666437</a><br>I can&#039;t because it&#039;s illogical and doesn&#039;t make any sense", "time": 1676545769, "resto": 21663395}, {"no": 21666457, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)06:13:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21666319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21666319</a><br>I wish there was a long ass Youtube series where a film/psych graduate broke down the history of cinema and showed how movies affected/fucked western society.

Both of them made shit up and basically shilled for political views: Gueon was a Theocratic Monarchist and Evola was a Fascist Neo-Feudalist.<br><br>Much like Blavatsky, who was a Theocratic Socialist, and Crowley who was a hedonistic anarchist, they knew quite a deal, spent a good amount of time with primary sources and distilled existing ideas into their own understanding.<br><br>I&#039;m going to get a response saying that Crowley and Blavatsky were frauds, but abandoning your faith for Islam, and being a Magical Tantric renegade Fascist ostracized by your own tradition is pretty much the same as saying you&#039;re giving birth to the Anti-Christ or in contact with magicians from India. If we view all 4 of them for their works alone, ignoring the personal problems and insanity, they were all quite well spoken, did good work, and had a strong grasp on some of the material they talked about. Blavatsky was intimately familiar with Gnosticism, Vedanta, Hermeticism and Tibetan Buddhism (in fact this has been confirmed by 20th century Tibetan Buddhists, she very clearly did meet Dzogchen and Mahayana adepts). Crowley had a good grasp on Taoism, an incredible understanding of Kabbalah/Qabbala, Tarot, Numerology, Alchemy and other mystical currents. Guenon was an excellent metaphysician echoing the Geometric-Mathematical metaphysics of Volume 1 of Blavatsky&#039;s secret doctrine, a sign that he did indeed understand the perrenial wisdom, or the Secret Doctrine as she called it. It seems that Evola had a good grasp on Vedanta, though inserting his own views as well, strong grasp on Tantra, and a strong grasp of initiation and its relationship with esotericism. Actually taking anything the four of them said on faith is extremely stupid.<br><br>Read what they read, and come to your own conclusions. Modern spirituality is marred by a few things: the existence of Christian culture and theologians; Atheism and rationalism in academia; Anglos translating Eastern ideas improperly; Jews suppressing ideas; Fascists polluting Eastern and Western Esotericism with anachronistic nonsense racial science and racial teleology; Metaphysics as a talent dying off with the 19th century. It is absolutely best to go to the texts themselves while using these people as biased encyclopedias and as foils to your own understanding. I agree with Evola&#039;s Kali Yuga, Crowley&#039;s Age of Horus, Blavatsky&#039;s universal brotherhood and cosmogenesis and Guenon&#039;s ideas about the degeneration of spiritual principles. I reject most of the rest of what they say.

As some ideas come fully formed while others take weeks of writing and editing.

The main point is the relative spectrum of different flavors of socialism, especially during that historical time period, compared to what communism always seemed to devolve into: murderous totalitarianism. When something like this is brought up it belays the poverty of generalizing on what constitutes capitalism (i.e. it&#039;s relatively vague in so being economically driven systems that passively influence ideology and national character) versus selectively restricting what constitutes &quot;real&quot; communism (a political and socially driven worldview which dictates these things).<br><br>Conflating Nazism with modern capitalism alone and ignoring the social policies, over which today&#039;s leftwingers would cream (only if they were divorced from what we&#039;d now label as socially conservative), illustrates that both the postive and negative forces unleashed by that regime can&#039;t be simplistically pidgeonholed into &quot;they happened because the Nazis were capitalists.&quot; Therefore, when a retarded commie ideologue brings wars into it referencing the Nazis and their unique flavor of socialism undermines them. Aside, not understanding that the Nazis should be credited as a fairly successful variety of socialism (war aside) is mostly due to the positive connotations to which we want to attribute the idea of socialism in general (i.e. Nazis bad therefore don&#039;t admit they&#039;re socialists).<br><a href=\"#p21664370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664370</a><br>Oh no, I just wrote more words.", "time": 1676509158, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21664574, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:02:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21664370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664370</a><br>Based crypto-leftists spotter", "time": 1676509343, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21664615, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:13:20", "name": "Dago", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663610</a><br>Kantbot I know that\u2019s you making these \u201ctrad\u201d threads trying to troll people", "time": 1676510000, "resto": 21663610, "trip": "!deClb9SBC."}, {"no": 21665403, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:51:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21664568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664568</a><br>what were some of the social policies? off the top of my head i know there were housing programs for families or something like that.", "time": 1676523093, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665411, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:55:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;100 million corpses not enough for you buddy?</span><br>No.", "time": 1676523320, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665416, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)23:56:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665411</a><br>based, me too", "filename": "1656286697739", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 812, "tn_w": 76, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676523411027925, "time": 1676523411, "md5": "xcccREo5h+oH9aBE6wPtog==", "fsize": 71341, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665439, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)00:03:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663610</a><br>Imagine believing in fictional concepts like free time or free will", "time": 1676523828, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665446, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)00:09:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663686</a><br>This is like saying cars have killed more people than uranium.", "time": 1676524166, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665454, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)00:11:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665446</a><br>Not at all", "time": 1676524291, "resto": 21663610}, {"no": 21665476, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)00:18:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663610</a><br>Dreher as in Rod Dreher?

God is infinitely just as well, but your depiction isn&#039;t accurate either, nor realistic. For instance, what King David did to Uriah the Hittite was guilty of death according to Exodus 20:14, yet God spared His life. If God torched you the minute you transgressed, Israel would have perished in the desert, or Moses might have been condemned for arguing with the Lord at the moment of His calling before the burning bush. So why does God show mercy, and to whom? We can make reasonable speculation based on Scripture. The Lord shows mercy to those who worship Him, and whose hearts are contrite in their sinful state. He loves those who repent in earnest, and who love Him. God, who weighs the hearts of man, and who sees not only the man, but his whole lineage - past and future - more intimately than we see anyone, is able to weigh fairly each man. King David was sincerely contrite and repentant, yet sin still required death, so the child born of the sin died, this too is fair.

It says, put simply, that all predications to God are to His essence. And because God&#039;s essence is absolutely simple, those predications do not contain real difference. As such, His mercy is identical to His justice and so forth. In other words, everything that God&#039;s acts are identical to His essence. All manner of critique can be made about this notion and yours, if fleshed out, could be one such. <br><br>However, Eastern Orthodox Christians do not hold to this. They believe in the Essence-Energies distinction. God&#039;s essence is wholly unknowable. Instead we come to know and directly and truly experience God through His energies (actions). This distinction between God&#039;s essence and His energies is a real distinction and not a conceptual one. Both God&#039;s essence and energies are fully God. Importantly, when we predicate things to God, we predicate them to His energies. Therefore, His mercy is distinct from His justice and so forth because they are different energetic operations. The classic example to clarify this point is to consider the Sun. The Sun itself can be taken to be God&#039;s essence - it is wholly unknowable, unapproachable etc. Nevertheless, we experience the rays of the Sun. Whilst these rays proceed forth from the Sun they are not the Sun itself but yet also not distinct from the Sun. So when partake in the rays, this is nevertheless a direct experience of the Sun itself and has the capacity to directly affect us. Likewise, we interact with God&#039;s infinite and distinct energies/activities without collapsing them into a singular absolutely simple essence.<br><br>It obviously gets more complicated and an analogy can only go so far but I hope that I showed that what you state is not necessarily accurate for all Christians. <br><br>If anyone finds that I have erred in this exposition or have misspoken please correct me.", "time": 1676541130, "resto": 21659514}, {"no": 21666332, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:30:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665485</a><br>Thank you friend, and may God bless you.

Spend time in the Word and serving God in the world (God often moves in us and our lives when we obey Him and go out in faith to glorify Him among men; BE READY, He will often surprise you!). The Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. It is the weapon of our warfare. God&#039;s Word is divinely powerful for the demolishing of enemy strongholds. This is not mere metaphor or hyperbole. Hebrews 4 tells us His Word pierces even unto the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and nothing is hidden from His sight! 1 Corinthians echoes similar sentiments (2:10-16). This is fully corroborated within the Tanakh, which tells us in Proverbs 15 &quot;even Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD, how much more the hearts of the sons of men!&quot; Ephesians 6 (I strongly suggest studying all of Ephesians with care) tells us we war not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual forces of darkness in the heavenlies. Colossians 2 (such a powerful book, despite brevity) goes on to tell us through Messiah God has disarmed those rulers and powers, putting them to open shame upon the cross, and returning to Ephesians 6 we are reminded that faith is our shield and the Word is our sword, thus logically, when we speak the Word of God in faith, we not only please and honor Almighty God, our blessed Father, by giving His Word the faith it is due, but we are simultaneously attacking and defending against our spiritual foes. THIS IS NOT METAPHORICAL. Fast (as in fasting - going without food and drink, typically) as a consecrated and highly spiritual affair. I recommend it when you feel the Lord prompt you, when you desire to draw closer to God, or when you&#039;re facing great difficulty as Israel did many times in the Word. If I recall properly, Israel even fasted as a sign of renewed consecration and repentance, and what a wonderful way to show God we love Him and remind ourselves of the deep holiness of His ways! Christ tells us (I will paraphrase it) some demonic forces in this world must be removed by those who have gone through this sanctifying preparation - it is always best to prepare. There are moments you do not know are coming, opportunities for which the LORD can put you to use, if you keep yourself at the ready. I am not a pastor or a priest, just a Christian - blessed of the Almighty Living God, may we praise Him always! I encourage any and everyone to scrutinize my thoughts by the Word of God (the only meaningful arbitrator of Truth), so as to feel assured of their wholesomeness, and that I may never inadvertently lead anyone astray by error.

I do not disagree with your logic, nor was I implying anything contrary to it, but we should be very clear in realizing - God is a person. It is God&#039;s character to be merciful, certainly, yet the Word says He &quot;shows mercy,&quot; thus the trait is exercisable at His discretion, and no surprise there - He is a person. We are all capable of the same. David could have slain Saul a number of times. He chose to exercise mercy, yet we would say this makes Him merciful, yes? The Word shows us the same is true of God, the difference being men have the capacity for inconsistency, while God is unfailingly true to Himself. Hopefully this clears up your confusion. <br><br>On the note of the child, do not think yourself kinder or more merciful than God. It is a mistake anyone can make almost as a knee-jerk reaction out of being caught up in our human perspective. God is kind, just, and so forth - all His judgements are true, they are righteous altogether (Psalm 19), yet this same God prophesies over a nation that the mothers will eat their own young of starvation, that those who dash a particular nation&#039;s children will be dashed upon rocks will be blessed, afflicted Israel - even His chosen - with plague, permits Elisha to curse 42 young men, Elisha to destroy 400 priests of Baal, repeatedly hardens the heart of Pharoah and rains plagues upon the Egyptians to glorify Himself among them (and certainly there were many many children among them), He who drowned nearly the entire world - children and all we can safely assume, who let His servant Paul be flogged, beaten, jailed, stricken blind, and shipwrecked three times, who let James fall to the sword, Thomas martyred in Northern India, Peter crucified upside down, and many other things. This is the same God who says, &quot;I will bring them back from Bashan. I will bring them back from the depths of the sea; that your foot may shatter them in blood, the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from your enemies.&quot; (Psalm 68) Even in the final book of the Word, Revelation, Messiah Jesus speaks strict warning to the Church, and the judgements which fall upon the Earth are great. God does not look at bodily death or pain in the manner of men, yet neither does He take it for granted. Both are very clear in the Word. We cannot look upon what we like and hide our eyes from the side of God which is difficult to apprehend. Here is a favorite verse of mine.

It is Exodus 20:21:<br><br>&quot;So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.&quot;<br><br>Some translations even read, &quot;deep darkness.&quot; It is powerful revelatory symbolism.

I will die a virgin. My death will be a death that would have been considered sad if it had occurred perhaps fifteen years before. There will be grief, but all the agonies that my progenitors might pass into (and they are the only people in this entire world who even know of my existence) will be underpinned by this indomitable truth: it is a mercy that he is gone. The quantity of my existence stands only as a component for perpetuating the tortuous quality of the cheap jest that constitutes its vapid manifestation. My virginity has become the gorgon against which all my faculties rise only to be turned to stone; but this is no silent stone, this is not the stone of Plotinus that stands as the antithesis of the Intellectual Principle--for while yet stone I still feel the mind&#039;s unscrupulous lacerations and all that grieves the very fibers of its being. The spirit is dimmed each time a girl passes before the mechanism of sight that some pitiless god has glued to my body. Even the ugly, unshaven, modernity enthralled women with clowns&#039; hair and bodies desecrated with tattoos which map out upon fastfood fed bodies the vapid cliches that coagulate to form their mind, even these paralyze the life in me. Masturbation has become merely the corpse of a habit that no longer instills pleasure, no longer even succeeds in distracting, but is only the dull libidinal twitch of a mind faced with the irrepressible impossibility of its reality, while lacking the courage to galvanize itself towards rectification. In the end I do not seek repentance. The decimated husk of my ego drifts towards the only gray shore its virginity-shackled mind can still vaguely form, still vaguely know as whisper or faint wriggling worm in an unclear wound--worm&#039;s whisper out of a wound that clears: Death. Here is the Telos to which the entirety of my Dasein has been speeding. Here I shall sink at last, unrequited, into the tentacles of Annihilation&#039;s amnesia.

One might imagine that working in a library entails having a quiet, spacious office in which to organize the library&#039;s inner layout, making sure books are ordered and delivered on a timely basis, overseeing new technology being implemented and so forth. I am 40 years old. For thirteen years now I have stood and sat at the front desk of a large urban library whose most loyal denizens are the homeless and the clinically insane. Schizophrenics are drawn here like moths to a flame. Alcoholics come here to snooze and disrupt. Niggers crowd the aisles and spread their toxic subhuman behaviour. I thought I would be advising enthusiastic kids what to read next, or helping elderly peasants become introduced to the world of literature in order to enjoy their final years thanks to the offerings of high culture. Instead I stand silently and alone as my miserable colleagues discuss their boring husbands or browse facebook or holidays websites to look out for the cheapest package deals. I am forced to replace urine-stained seat cushions. Forced to &quot;kindly&quot; &quot;usher&quot; out the bums who vomit on themselves and the constantly wide-eyed middle-aged women who start to scream and talk gibberish at a rapid pace if I approach them and tell them we are closing up. What a pathetic life I lead. I imagined I would be like Larkin, like Borges, like the kind of refined, reserved kind of man whose job allows him an air of mystique and glum erudition. Instead I am no better than a janitor who has found himself at the till of a supermarket. In 2008 I had a brief sexual affair with a student girl who spent a month here as part of her training to become a librarian. We screwed in the storage room several times a day. It was purely physical on her part but deeply emotional on mine. Eventually she realized she didn&#039;t want this kind of job and admitted she felt sorry for me and thought fucking me would make me less depressed and her less experienced. She is now working for a marketing company and is earning more than me despite being a member of a different generation. Please kill me. Please. Please. Please God let this be the day I am struck by a truck on my lonesome drive home. Let this be the night the niggers break into my home and garrote me as I lay sleepless staring silently toward the ceiling.</span>", "time": 1676432955, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21660448, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:50:14", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "lit-memes-ruin-lives", "ext": ".png", "w": 632, "h": 472, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676433014141493, "time": 1676433014, "md5": "oe2lSk34W3JqDc1vxgPQ0w==", "fsize": 172545, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21660450, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:51:15", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "joyce-carol-oats-on-young-male-writers", "ext": ".png", "w": 592, "h": 334, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1676433075100750, "time": 1676433075, "md5": "obuKLAjUq4suwyC/ki45WQ==", "fsize": 72378, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21660453, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:52:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21660390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21660390</a>", "filename": "katies-classic-books", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 756, "h": 9800, "tn_w": 9, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676433137285679, "time": 1676433137, "md5": "2t4/i6RK2bQed/XnITkceg==", "fsize": 877967, "resto": 21658352}, {"no": 21660455, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:52:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658352</a><br>There was this one guy who explained the schism between the Hegelian and Rankean views of history, the rise of the former and the decline of the latter and it just made a lot of things click in my head.

Of course as a general philosophy this is and always will be true; but if you were a high IQ physically fit male in the Middle Ages for example, or really any time before the Industrial Revolution, like some of us are now, you could rightly expect to become a very important and valued member of your community and receive ample reward based on merit, regardless of class. And I say regardless of class because as a serf sure you couldn&#039;t expect to become a king or a baron but you could become a very valued member of your class and that would be a more worthwhile and rewarding endeavour than almost any today. After the Industrial Revolution, technology quickly made the working classes, particularly the males, obsolete, or at any rate made their labour worth far less. What we see now with the information/computer revolution is just that same concept reaching the higher classes, i.e. from those whose primary means of production was their body to those whose was the mind. Also I&#039;m not a Marxist but technology &quot;creating jobs&quot; is almost always code for a shift in self-sufficiency and ownership of the means of production from a lower social class to a higher social class (the owners of the technology).

Get like 5-20 chapters into the Greek (just so you have some basic familiarity and basic vocabulary to work with, even if it&#039;s just recognizing simple single-clause sentences) and start reading Plato with a parallel edition that has literal English translation, and see how much of the Greek you can follow. The main difficult stuff will be all the indirect speech. But you can learn a LOT of vocabulary and race past the textbook/classroom environment&#039;s teaching of it by doing this, because you actually care about what you&#039;re learning/reading and aren&#039;t just memorizing abstract lists at the ends of chapters for the sake of tests. Also, you will get a ton of practice with core syntactical and grammatical structures, like subordinating conjunctions. Just do this for fun with no expectations whatsoever, tell your brain that you&#039;re just reading Plato for Plato&#039;s sake and &quot;also glancing at the Greek,&quot; so that it doesn&#039;t feel like a chore or an additional assignment. You will soak up way more than you think this way, and this will both aid your progress in the course and give you a massive boost to REALLY reading Plato when you make even further progress in the course and reach the level where you theoretically should be able to translate.<br><br>Also remember, reading Greek is always hard. Don&#039;t wait for that magic moment when it becomes easy, or when you finally know &quot;enough&quot; stuff that translating becomes automatic. You will ALWAYS be looking stuff up, always thinking about the multiple ways of translating a sentence and trying to figure out the correct or most plausible way based on context. Learn to love this and do it every day and you will get better and better, and in years you will be a real reader of Greek. Hate it or fear it, because of a misguided assumption that it means you still suck at Greek and should feel bad about yourself, and you will never really learn Greek.<br><br>Greek is a fucking mess and the only way to have fun is to just jump in and have fun as soon as you feel even a slight ability to do so. The worst that can happen is you go &quot;lmao I have no idea what the fuck is happening in this sentence,&quot; but this then leads to looking up the use of \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 in the sentence, and suddenly you know \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 forever, because you learned it from a real context you cared about and your brain absorbed it instantly.", "time": 1676491162, "resto": 21657097}, {"no": 21663442, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:39:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is learning modern Greek first a good idea?

The better you are at ignoring the \u201cgiving up\u201d feeling the better equip you will be against the autistic master race born without stupid distractions like social cues. Everybody gets distracted but it\u2019s what you take away from a task which has meaning not some stupid task metric made to stop you from achieving things. Stop looking at smartness by a value judgment. It\u2019s been refuted due to the discovery of sixteen types of smartness in society. Here\u2019s an executable action and mock goal setting exercise: Fold a paper hotdog style and write strengths and weaknesses on the top two columns; now list these. After about 15 mins of writing stuff down, you will notice what you may be able to navigate from your position like a chess game of life. I\u2019m telling you all this because you made this thread and you\u2019re asking how to learn more in life. As a lifelong learner, son of a nasa employee and a teacher, I will tell you that life is a learning curve of patience with trial by fire. Don\u2019t give up on improvement. Something else I\u2019ve learned is you learn better after you\u2019ve already been entertained. So break up your self improvement with productive things to help you and those around you. Walking helps stimulate writing. Exercise helps everything. Get a part time job you find meaningful and quit immediately if it\u2019s not for you. Be sober and find a cheap therapist to talk to on a weekly basis.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

In this sense we may truly say that the good soul is the forgetful. It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual life, all that is foreign to that order.

This question is addressed in the Republic. In the first place, obeying law is a phantom of true justice (443c), and in the second place, while the hypothetical philosopher of the hypothesized city of the Republic owes something to his city insofar as it reared him *as* a philosopher (520a-b), this isn&#039;t true of Athens. Ergo, the reasons for allowing Athens to put him to death, while still mysterious, are not those expressed in the Crito, which is an argument for a non-philosopher (see Crito&#039;s lack of participation in Phaedo, and his incredulity throughout the Euthydemus towards Socrates).<br><br>As for his paying attention to death, he clearly in that passage means with respect only to whether he would be put to death, since, as per Phaedo, philosophizing is practicing death and dying.", "time": 1676473016, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21662049, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)09:58:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21662040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21662040</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;by the action of the any</span><br>*many", "time": 1676473118, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21662907, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)13:44:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21657454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21657454</a><br>I didn&#039;t read any other posts but from what I remember my favorite interpretation was that Socrates was getting old and decided to martyr himself for philosophy by making a mockery of the court system.", "time": 1676486678, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21663611, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)16:24:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661577</a><br>Yeah.

I regard the Republic as a later work which elaborates on the character of Socrates as opposed to a truly Socratic dialogue like the Apology. So in your second point I think your applying the ideal hypotheticals of the Republic to Athens is a false equivalency.

Phantom makes it seem a bit false.</span><br>The word in Greek is eidolon, which primarily means &quot;ghost&quot;, and secondarily means &quot;image, likeness&quot; (compare as &quot;eikos&quot;, which means primarily means &quot;likeness&quot;; this is the word Timaeus uses when he says he&#039;s telling a &quot;likely story&quot;). I take it Plato intends us to have both connotations in mind, since &quot;eidolon&quot; is the word he uses in 516a for what the now-freed cavedweller is capable of looking at first (shadows and reflections in water of things).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I regard the Republic as a later work which elaborates on the character of Socrates as opposed to a truly Socratic dialogue like the Apology. So in your second point I think your applying the ideal hypotheticals of the Republic to Athens is a false equivalency.</span><br>We disagree very fundamentally on this point (I think we would only agree that Republic is written after the Apology), but settling it would likely be beyond any discussion we could have on this thread (unless you&#039;re interested, then I&#039;ll start a new thread instead of hijacking this one). So I&#039;ll offer a different tact:<br><br>Plato alludes to the trial in other dialogues, by either setting or foreshadowing in discussion (Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Phaedo all take place around the trial; Theaetetus, Gorgias, Republic, Meno all allude to the philosopher not being able to persuade the many in a court or the dangers philosophers might be exposed to). If Plato had wanted, for the purposes of maintaining any coherent set of teachings, he would&#039;ve been able to rework passages from the dialogues, destroy dialogues, or offer something not far from commentary on dialogues via subsequent writings, keeping what he wanted and changing or ridding himself of what he came to differ with. The Republic passage I pointed to before can be set beside the claims at the end of Crito without any contradiction that Plato couldn&#039;t live with, such that the later writing elucidates the earlier writing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But nothing grows up on its own. Therefore everything has some form of community it should justly repay for having helped bring it up.</span><br>But Socrates isn&#039;t speaking of being brought up merely as a neutral human in a certain place at a certain time, but the rearing of a type of person, the philosopher, as he emphasizes right before the quote:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Well, then, Glaucon,&quot; I said, &quot;consider that we won&#039;t be doing injustice to *the philosophers* who come to be among us, but rather that we will say just things to them while compelling them besides to care for and guard the others.

On making his appearance in the orchestra Wagner was greeted with the customary Tusch, or flourish of trumpets. When his attention was drawn to the fact that the Conservatorium pupils occupied the auditorium, through which he had not passed, the composer-conductor advanced towards them and said: &#039;My young friends, we all belong to one another, so stop where you are,&#039; thus inviting them to listen to the rehearsal. No wonder that Hellmesberger called for a cheer &#039;in honour of Herr Wagner,&#039; and that the students responded thereto with all their might and main. The concert proved to be a great success, so much so that at its close Wagner addressed the audience in these words:<br><br>Years ago, when I was staying within your walls, I received a welcome which surpassed all my expectations and afforded a proof that on the uncontested ground of this city, as elsewhere, German art had obtained the upper hand. This gratifying fact is manifested to-day in a still greater extent by the reception you have accorded to my art. In the name of that art, I thank you for the sympathy you have so liberally exhibited towards me to-day, and which is a guarantee that a great national enterprise, to which I have, for years, been devoting all my energy and strength, will not remain uncompleted. Whenever the old Greeks set about a great and important work, they supplicated Jupiter for some sign of his approbation; the eagle he caused to soar aloft, and the lightning flashes he hurled through the air were regarded by them as foreboding good. Similarly will we look upon the lightning, which so unexpectedly accompanied to-day the performance of the Feuerzauber, as a propitious omen, and hope that an undertaking which you have promoted in so gratifying a manner by your sympathy will attain to a successful conclusion. (Musical World, June 1, 1872.)<br><br>The students were so delighted with Wagner, especially his pleasantly-spoken words of encouragement at the first rehearsal of the concert, and for allowing them to attend both the rehearsals, that they decided to present him with a silver goblet entwined with laurel.", "time": 1676518576, "resto": 21661398}, {"no": 21666311, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:22:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663513</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Alright lads, how do I get into Wagner?</span><br>You read his works, Anon.", "time": 1676542971, "resto": 21661398}, {"no": 21666321, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:27:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663389</a><br>Literal Marvel shit.", "time": 1676543221, "resto": 21661398}, {"no": 21666322, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)05:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663389</a><br><a href=\"#p21664170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664170</a><br><a href=\"#p21664309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664309</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a fellow Dallas Anon</span><br><br>The performance was really great.

An authentic spirit leads to an authentic tradition (The Church Fathers, Theravada), an inauthentic spirit leads to an inauthentic tradition (Mahayana intellectualism, Protestant rationalism and sola scriptura).

The charges laid against Socrates are similar to those laid at a Physicos, which was more specifically that you denied some Gods and reduced them to empirical phenomenon, rather than denying divinity as a whole. It was still a death sentence. Socrates possibly sought to obtain a certificate of orthodoxy from the Athenian priesthood before his trial, which would suggest that he was not an atheist. Furthermore, the type of claim that Socrates is accused of mainly, that is to say that the gods do not behave like thugs and whores and thieves, and that those stories are just stories, was *perfectly* acceptable in Socrates times. Absolute orthodoxy was considered gauche, a sign of low education. This leads additional credence that Socrates was not framed as an atheist or simply as someone who denied the truth of the myths, since the first one would have been a quick thing, and the second would not have lead to a death sentence, but rather as a Physicos.

However, it might be that if the Athenians understood no difference between not believing in the gods of the city and atheism, it might be more probable that Socrates and Plato were atheists by such a definition. As pointed out at <a href=\"#p21665621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665621</a>, you do have expressions in the dialogues that do suggest Socrates was guilty of impiety, some examples being:<br><br>- The argument in the Apology with Meletus, where Socrates lures him into calling him an outright atheist. The alternative that Socrates offers beforehand was in fact the actual charge, not believing in the gods of the city and introducing new divinities. Socrates notably does not defend himself by asserting he worships the Olympians, but rather that, since Meletus knows about his daimonion, that&#039;s sufficient proof that he&#039;s not an atheist. But, again, this dodges the actual charge, since 1) the daimonion by Socrates&#039; argument could still be a novel introduction, and 2), he at one point equates daimonions with heroes, but this leads to the absurdity that Achilles, who died and went to Hades, qualifies to be functionally a god.<br><br>- The already mentioned Euthyphro&#039;s dilemma, where either piety is irrational ad no worship of the gods can help you, or there&#039;s some Form making the pious lovable, in which case you don&#039;t need the gods when you can lok to the Form. This in addition to his expressed irritation in the traditional myths at the beginning.<br><br>- Socrates&#039; denial that Eros is a god in the Symposium (and the fact that Phaedrus, Eryximachus, Alcibiades, Critias, and Charmides were all Socratic associates implicated in either desecration of the Herms, or blasphemy of the Mysteries).<br><br>- Socrates&#039; assertion in the Theaetetus that Homer and the poets concealed a teaching about Becoming being sovereign.<br><br>- The Republic moves from &quot;the gods&quot; to &quot;the god&quot; to &quot;the Idea of the Good&quot; and then back to &quot;the god&quot;. No room for Olympians. Not to mention the critique of the traditional view of the gods.<br><br>- Timaeus&#039; cosmology denies the account of Hesiod&#039;s Theogony, and the gods are replaced with a demiurge.<br><br>- Socrates is led to admit in Parmenides that an implication of the Forms is that if there are gods, they&#039;re with the Forms and don&#039;t have knowledge of us.", "time": 1676530425, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665799, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:56:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665790</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but this leads to the absurdity that Achilles, who died and went to Hades, qualifies to be functionally a god.</span><br>Heracles became a god", "time": 1676530595, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665808, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:59:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665799</a><br>Did Achilles, who Socrates explicitly refers to after his argument with Meletus?", "time": 1676530798, "resto": 21665589}, {"no": 21665835, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)02:09:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665808</a><br>He had a cult and was sacrificed to, yes.

Is the person who saves every penny 1 days before their death superior to the person who cashes out and retires at 65? No, because that decreases their happiness. Likewise, is the person who spends every cent they make on booze getting a better reward than the person who saves? No, they are punished by life themselves. So &quot;virtue&quot; in your definition is always something that naturally results in the betterment of the self. If this is the case why would anyone need to enforce virtue or punish those with vices? In fact if virtue is so obviously beneficial you should guard it like a precious jewel and make sure nobody knows so that you can increase your superiority to those with vices.

Hence, Ambrose says (De Virgin. i, 5) that &quot;virginal chastity is integrity free of pollution.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now venereal pleasures offer three points for consideration. The first is on the part of the body, viz. the violation of the seal of virginity. The second is the link between that which concerns the soul and that which concerns the body, and this is the resolution of the semen, causing sensible pleasure. The third is entirely on the part of the soul, namely the purpose of attaining this pleasure. Of these three the first is accidental to the moral act, which as such must be considered in reference to the soul. The second stands in the relation of matter to the moral act, since the sensible passions are the matters of moral acts. But the third stands in the position of form and complement, because the essence of morality is perfected in that which concerns the reason. Since then virginity consists in freedom from the aforesaid corruption, it follows that the integrity of the bodily organ is accidental to virginity; while freedom from pleasure in resolution of the semen is related thereto materially; and the purpose of perpetually abstaining from this pleasure is the formal and completive element in virginity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As stated above (A[1]), the formal and completive element in virginity is the purpose of abstaining from venereal pleasure, which purpose is rendered praiseworthy by its end, in so far, to wit, as this is done in order to have leisure for Divine things: while the material element in virginity is integrity of the flesh free of all experience of venereal pleasure. Now it is manifest that where a good action has a special matter through having a special excellence, there is a special kind of virtue: for example, magnificence which is about great expenditure is for this reason a special virtue distinct from liberality, which is about all uses of money in general. Now to keep oneself free from the experience of venereal pleasure has an excellence of its own deserving of greater praise than keeping oneself free from inordinate venereal pleasure. Wherefore virginity is a special virtue being related to chastity as magnificence to liberality.</span>", "filename": "aquinas chad", "ext": ".png", "w": 523, "h": 533, "tn_w": 122, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676491433084408, "time": 1676491433, "md5": "zXouRuGr0nEuxZGpwfYTlQ==", "fsize": 80389, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663313, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:08:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663233</a><br>Look at the schnoz on dat hoe", "time": 1676491694, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663324, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:10:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663285</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is Indonesia</span>", "time": 1676491844, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663325, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:10:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude, it doesn&#039;t matter if any key can open the lock, just trust your life and salary with it.</span>", "time": 1676491848, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663330, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:11:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663293</a><br>Wow yikes sweaty", "filename": "legreenface", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 322, "h": 214, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1676491888730432, "time": 1676491888, "md5": "YGHt9sNUsYm0/MvkLXqFYA==", "fsize": 15605, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663336, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:12:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663301</a><br>I hate reading him so much, but the ideas are ok somewhat.", "time": 1676491967, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21663359, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)15:17:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663214</a><br>Were all of them white?", "time": 1676492240, "resto": 21663214}, {"no": 21664000, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:40:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21663214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21663214</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Do you think it MATTERS with how many people a woman has slept with!?</span><br>Yes, because it shows a lack of commitment, loyalty and trust for a long term relationship to function properly.

Lesbians are just insane women who are lesbian as a made up protest against men. All the lesbians I have known were either women who were very ugly and insecure and would take anyone as a lover, including a lesbian, and these literal psychopaths who hated men and felt a rush of power in the idea that they didn&#039;t need a man to be loved. So they loved these very dependent, submissive women and hated them because it was like having a dumb puppy as a lover. Women don&#039;t want a puppy to love them, they want something bigger, something like a grown up, big dog, a big snarling dog, even if it&#039;s a wounded one or a sad one, that power, that masculine potential needs to be there. A woman can&#039;t give that, and that&#039;s why lesbians always hate each other. One couple in particular I&#039;ve spent some time with amazed me at how fucking sadistic one acted upon the other. It was a dynamic I&#039;ve never seen anywhere else. Not even normal women are that sadistic toward men, I swear to God. Women are cruel to men, but because they know men can take it, they don&#039;t feel that joy. They&#039;re just naturally cruel. But with other women, who are fragile as they are, whose psychology they know because it&#039;s their own, they really bring out those claws and enjoy every little bit of shredding the other apart.", "time": 1676409659, "resto": 21658425}, {"no": 21658973, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)16:23:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658425</a><br>Right back at you guy.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search.

Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing.

Slowly, they discover that they have secret powers and abilities--and that their teachers are much more than they seem. The adventures, and the tangled Greek mythologies that provide the backdrop, are a great deal of fun and quite exciting.

It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

Their importance dropped sharply in the 1980s and since 2002, fewer than 1,500 mixed marriages involving a person of Spanish or Italian nationality have been celebrated each year.

I had a long history of writing fanfiction before I became a &quot;serious&quot; writer, and almost all fanfics are serialzed and released a chapter at a time. Releasing your story in serialized format has some advantages, namely that, if your work is good and you start to attract a following, the wait time between chapters can be used to kind of charge up energy among your fanbase: you can fuel comments, fan theories, speculation, all the sorts of things that whip your fanbase into a frenzy, and that in turn attract new readers to come and start from the beginning.<br><br>I&#039;ve written more than one fanfic that got pretty popular, and I can tell you that there&#039;s nothing your fans love more than talking about the story in between chapter releases. You build up a community, a fandom, and it drives engagement, which will help your story spread.<br><br>Even some of the greatest works of literature have been serialized.

Googling it I see it is related to other similar words for fire, beacon, pyre etc. and another site says it was also used figuratively to mean home, or family, for obvious reasons as the hearth is the centrepoint of a home where people gather for warmth.<br>This was the primary meaning of the word focus for a long time, until someone, I can&#039;t remember who, used the word focus metaphorically. He was speaking of how a lens can concentrate sunlight into a single point to create a flame. For that concentrated beam of light, he used the word focus.<br>At that point in time that use of the word focus was a brand new metaphor. He had taken a word for hearth, fireplace etc. and used it in a way that suggested a single concentrated point of attention or energy. This new meaning went on to become so dominant that the old meaning was superseded and forgotten, and the word association of focus has remained so strong that today in English we use that same word in this second, metaphorical meaning, with no common knowledge of its origin.<br><br>This is an example of how words change, according to Barfield. A common word is given an extra, metaphorical meaning, and the variety of meanings for a word is expanded, such as when focus was both a hearth and a single concentrated point of attention. But words also lose meaning, such as how today the word focus has lost the original meaning of the word hearth.<br>This is also related to how a cliche or idiom is formed. Look at the expression &#039;mum&#039;s the word&#039;, for instance, from Shakespeare. Many people might know this phrase, and understand it means to keep a secret, but they would not be able to understand the sentence on the face of it, because they would no longer know that &#039;mum&#039; in Middle English meant silence. They would instead only understand mum as meaning mother, and so the original sense of the phrase is completely lost in favour of a secondary meaning (in contrast to the original, &#039;speaker&#039;s meaning&#039;).<br><br>This was a great book that has the potential to really blow your mind as he links language formation, expansion and decay, to the cognition of the speaker, and so forms a thesis for the origin of consciousness.", "time": 1676503176, "resto": 21659831}, {"no": 21664188, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)18:20:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21664183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664183</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;focus was the latin word for home</span><br><br>I fucked up, I meant hearth.

This is also how I make songs to myself when I am walking probably to the annoyance of my roommate. I greatly enjoy making clicking noises inside my mouth when I am walking or standing idly. I am a white person descended from catholics, Protestants and atheists who happen to be non-believers. My mother would say I am borderline agnostic. I used to think like that but I\u2019ve accepted the truth and wisdom of my fellow polytheists and generally, of all people who aren\u2019t evil. My home computer is sickly. It is an x86, which means it has no capability for really doing anything other than changing a few kilobytes of data in memory, and even it can make clicking sounds when it runs. As a result of this random clicking, my fingers do strange things, and the Windows 7 startup chime made it very difficult to develop a standard non-clicking idle tone for myself, but set off a bit of a social revolution in my house and drove most of my roommate\u2019s snarky friends away. What used to go off is instead replaced by this cheerful little Celtic jig in click tones, which is about as far away from a traditional \u201cwind up\u201d chime as a twenty-four-year-old can get. To our polytheistic ancestors, a click was the sound of fire as it lit up to consume an oak log or a timber (or dried animal flesh, like the sheepskin cloaks of The Age of Legends). Their computers are just as impotent as ours. I have never once burned a log or a tree in my life, although I have played spectator to that old ritual many a time. My computer, too, will always be just as impotent as its ancestors rituals were, re: summoning non-virtual forms of success or happiness. But I will carry on the old tradition of clicking and clacking to myself, in the middle of the night when I am walking to keep me awake. That clicking seems to be a way of holding on to all that is good about humanity.", "time": 1676456385, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661483, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)05:58:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21655399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21655399</a><br>They have the least sexual dimorphism among races", "time": 1676458697, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661511, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:17:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661483</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;races</span><br>reactionnary pseudoscience", "time": 1676459844, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661527, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)06:26:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661511</a><br>Yeah that&#039;s why you can&#039;t do a bone marrow transplant outside your race.", "time": 1676460397, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661737, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21654723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21654723</a><br><a href=\"#p21654723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21654723</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I imagine that the first Bushman-aboos in the Zulu kingdom were made fun of, and pronounced the clicks wrong, but it eventually caught on.</span><br>Kek", "time": 1676466155, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661768, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)08:19:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21653280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21653280</a><br>I do.<br>To approve quietly mostly.<br>It&#039;s like: &#039;I get it.&#039;", "time": 1676467181, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21661908, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)09:09:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661527</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bone marrow transplant</span><br>Even from brother or sister (most likely to be a match) there is only a 1 in 4 chance of your cells matching.", "time": 1676470161, "resto": 21653280, "filedeleted": 1}, {"no": 21662034, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)09:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661511</a><br>Race is real<br>Egalitarianism is nonsense<br>Blank slate is a meme", "time": 1676472918, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21662580, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)12:23:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21662034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21662034</a><br>But race is an artificial boundary with a million porous holes and egalitarianism is a time honored tradition practiced by everyone\u2019s ancestors for millions of years.<br><br>I\u2019ll bet you believe Fauci and Biden", "time": 1676481835, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21662993, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)14:02:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21662580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21662580</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I bet you believe the establishment as I repeat an establishment talking point</span><br>Lol<br>Lmao even", "time": 1676487720, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21664039, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)17:48:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21661511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21661511</a>", "filename": "20230215_100309", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 828, "h": 773, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1676501322035610, "time": 1676501322, "md5": "UTZTBKwEebsEhtM3zbDsaw==", "fsize": 73992, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21665094, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)22:13:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "*smacks lips*<br>hol up<br>*sucks teeth*<br>u sayin<br>*smacks gums*<br>we wuz communicatin<br>*hocks*", "time": 1676517220, "resto": 21653280}, {"no": 21665114, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)22:20:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21653280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21653280</a><br>Asian languages are different too; I noticed especially Thai.<br><br>They use regular stop intervals; t-t-t-t-t.

For a moment everything remained quiet. &quot;They&#039;re not going to answer,&quot; Gregor said to himself, captivated by some senseless hope. But then, of course, the maid went to the door as usual with her firm stride and opened up. Gregor only had to hear the visitor&#039;s first word of greeting to know who it was--the office manager himself. Why was only Gregor condemned to work for a firm where at the slightest omission they immediately suspected the worst? Were all employees louts without exception, wasn&#039;t there a single loyal, dedicated worker among them who, when he had not fully utilized a few hours of the morning for the firm, was driven half-mad by pangs of conscience and was actually unable to get out of bed? Really, wouldn&#039;t it have been enough to send one of the apprentices to find out--if this prying were absolutely necessary--did the manager himself have to come, and did the whole innocent family have to be shown in this way that the investigation of this suspicious affair could be entrusted only to the intellect of the manager? And more as a result of the excitement produced in Gregor by these thoughts than as a result of any real decision, he swung himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thump, but it was not a real crash. The fall was broken a little by the carpet, and Gregor&#039;s back was more elastic than he had thought, which explained the not very noticeable muffled sound. Only he had not held his head carefully enough and hit it; he turned it and rubbed it on the carpet in anger and pain.</span><br>WEEEEE YIPEEE!!!!! HORRAYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because of the diversity of the movement, it is difficult to say much that is illuminating about existentialist theology as a whole. In general, however, these theologians attempt to understand God in relation to the situation of the concretely existing human individual. Their analysis of human existence is one that emphasizes the freedom of individuals to shape their own identities through choices, and the paradoxical, ambiguous or even absurd character of the reality that humans encounter. Religious faith is seen as closely related to feelings of alienation and despair; faith may grow out of such emotions or it may provide the key to overcoming them, or both these relations may be present at once.<br><br>Though the designation of any particular theologian as \u2018existentialist\u2019 is a controversial matter, Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann and Paul Tillich are among the more important thinkers whose work exhibits existentialist themes. The entire movement has been strongly influenced, directly or indirectly, by the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher-theologian S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, while the works of the Russian novelist F\u00ebdor Dostoevskii and the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, both from the late nineteenth century, have also been important.", "time": 1676528149, "resto": 21665225}, {"no": 21665696, "now": "02/16/23(Thu)01:25:52", "name": "SAGE GOD", "com": "<a href=\"#p21665667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665667</a><br>This reads like an AI.<br><a href=\"#p21665225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21665225</a><br>The contradictory nature of God leads people to (rightfully) drop any faith they might have had in any of the fantastical stories found therein.

Most of the self-proclaimed christians don&#039;t even believe in most the basic dogmas of the religion. Here&#039;s a little excerpt from The Catechism of the Crisis on the Church:<br><br>Many statistics for the US can be found in Kenneth C. Jones&#039;s Index of Leading Catholic Indicators. For example, 77% of American Catholics in 1999 did not believe one must attend Mass on Sunday to be a good Catholic. Only 17% of young Catholics in America believe the priesthood should be restricted to males. Only 10% of Catholic elementary school religion teachers agree with the Church&#039;s teaching on artificial birth control. A 1992 poll in Der Spiegel showed that only 56% of Germans believe in the existence of God, 38% in his omnipotence, 30% in original sin, 29% that Jesus is the Son of God, and 24% in the existence of hell.7 Likewise catastrophic is the situation among Catholics. Only 43% of them believe in the fundamental dogma of the Resurrection of Christ. Of those who attend Mass on Sundays, only 55% believe in the Virgin Birth and only 44% recognize papal infallibility. Amongst all Catholics only 32% believe in papal infallibility. In France a recent poll8 showed that only 57% of the French consider the existence of God certain or probable (against 61% in 1994); 65% (and 80% of those 18-24 years old) say that they have no belief in the Trinity, and 67% (compared with 48% in 1994) do not believe in the existence of hell. Only 12% of Catholics say they definitely believe in hell (16% have some belief in hell, 72% deny its existence); even among regularly practising Catholics the statistics are catastrophic: only 23% of them firmly believe in hell, while 54% deny its existence.", "time": 1676511457, "resto": 21655317}, {"no": 21664719, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)20:41:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21664677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21664677</a><br><br>The context of this is that we all return to dust, but it is our souls that belong in the Kingdom of God.

Ultimately, the deficiency lies with Nietzsche, because he is unable to extend his critique beyond a sociological one targeting the particular Protestant type of the Christian religion prevalent in the Germany of his day whose decaying effects he was witnessing and wanted to strike out against to a critique of Christ as he is presented in the gospels. It&#039;s important to also remember that Nietzsche was writing at a time when it was assumed that the historical truth of Christianity had been disproved by archeology and the natural sciences (hence the attempt at historical revisionism on his part), something which is definitely no longer the case today.<br><br>If Nietzsche has to effectively write a fan-fiction of the founder of the religion in order to critique it, should I take his critique seriously?

I am not sure why christers believe they&#039;ve inherited the medieval luxury of all their debate partners being of the same belief system.

I think many of you are all too aware that the average &quot;atheist&quot; is not worthy of &quot;atheism,&quot; often this is repulsively so. Hence what we Nietzsche trying to tell us is that Christianity has become increasingly unbelievable (for Europeans) and in order to evaluate going forward, for those who are leaving this system behind, it is necessary to investigate everything this system has touched in order to make a break from the nihilism and enfeebled morality baked into it. And this is not limited to Protestantism, which is the entire point of the genealogical approach, why Nietzsche is going back to the Romans and to the Gospels and to early Christianity, which is the father of all sects.(I am sure you are trying to carve out a place for Catholicism or Orthodoxy, but why?

You seem confused here, making reference to &quot;non-hagiographic&quot; interpretations and the &quot;same belief system&quot; as though we were discussing Thomism or some metaphysical debacle as opposed to events rooted in space and time. Without indulging in vain psychological speculations- which abound in The Antichrist- it is obvious that the figure of Christ existing was unbelievable for Nietzsche precisely because it was so drastically opposed to his core assumptions about the world, as evidenced by his attempt at some alternative reading of the gospels based purely on a highly contentious psychological model. Why should I take anything he says about resentiment and a retrospective malignant misreading by Jesus&#039;s disciples seriously when this is derived solely from the aforementioned personal bias and the cultural assumption of his time that the Christian story had absolutely no basis in reality? Understanding this cultural assumption of its dubious historicity probably helps us make sense of the inclusion of the interpretation of Jesus as a figure free from resentiment in The Antichrist: precisely because Nietzsche considered the idea of Jesus being remotely like the gospels said so unlikely (I think in On the Origins of Early Christianity by Friedrich Engels, the author just takes it for granted that the gospels were a Roman invention in around 300AD) he saw no problem with what is ultimately a poetic interpretation of Jesus in line with what can quite broadly be termed his philosophical project. Basically, what I&#039;m trying to say is, Nietzsche&#039;s critique of Christ fails because it acts on the basis that the Jesus of Christianity simply could not have been real; it engages with him as though he is a metaphysical principle to be disputed as opposed to a historical fact existing within time. Engaging in a philosophical critique of the consequences of a spiritually dead and neutered Christianity is fine, but Nietzsche cannot make any claim to doing anything beyond that, especially since most of his dislike of Christianity seems to stem from a philosophical misunderstanding of it as a form of Gnosticism / Platonism largely informed by the type of Protestantism he was brought with. He simply does not understand early Christian or even medieval theology well enough if at all to be able to claim that it suffers from the problems he diagnoses the whole religious tradition with, and his genealogical critique again relies on a denial of the reality of Christ and his love, focusing instead on his church and the way it uses the talk of peace to obscure its violent ends. But, as a writer like G K Chesterton correctly asserts, the problem is that Christianity has not yet been tried; the church is vindicated by virtue of the violence of the world, not vice versa.", "time": 1676411917, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660284, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:04:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br>Cause his fucking mustache keeps muffling his words.", "time": 1676430270, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660294, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:06:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659122</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche&#039;s critique of Christ fails because it acts on the basis that the Jesus of Christianity simply could not have been real</span><br>Ok so as per usual Christians think Nietzsche is wrong because he isn&#039;t Christian.", "time": 1676430376, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660329, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:17:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21659122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21659122</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the problem is that Christianity has not yet been tried</span><br>almost missed this\u2014you guys really are the mothers of bolshevism aren&#039;t you?", "time": 1676431026, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660371, "now": "02/14/23(Tue)22:26:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;generalist</span><br>You didn&#039;t understand him either, midwit.", "time": 1676431602, "resto": 21658171}, {"no": 21660904, "now": "02/15/23(Wed)01:11:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21658171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21658171</a><br>Maybe because Nietzsche was an atheist?

A billionaire cryptocurrency exchange owner has died and now everyone is scrambling to best position themselves before a complete collapse of several cryptocurrencies. Those involved will do whatever it takes to remain profitable. The wealthier they are, the more badly they behave. In a world where people don&#039;t die when they&#039;re killed, murder comes easy, and torture is routine. If you&#039;re looking for a relatively short and simple noir-like story with a neat gimmick that takes place in Chicagoland of Current Year, then you could do worse than this.<br><br>This book brings in contemporary events and their effects, such as the pandemic, and pop culture. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s me, but when I see brands used like how they are here I can&#039;t help but wonder if they were intended to be casual mentions or native advertising. If it&#039;s the latter, it doesn&#039;t detract from my experience other than being distracting in that it makes me pause to consider advertising in books in general. I don&#039;t mind pop culture if it&#039;s contextually appropriate, which it is here. <br><br>I continue to think that the premise of the series, that 99.9% of the time people respawn when they&#039;re killed could be used in so many more ways than it is. I keep hoping that the next installment will do something more with it, and I keep being disappointed. As it is, this is a mediocre series with a gimmick that doesn&#039;t fulfill its potential in almost any way. It&#039;s annoying because Scalzi has better explored speculative ideas in his other near future works. For those who aren&#039;t hung up on this idea like I am, it&#039;s probably a better read.<br><br>I&#039;ve tried both listening to and reading a few audiobook originals now. My current belief is that they are more suited to be listened to rather than read because of how they were written. It&#039;s somewhat like how podcast scripts are meant to be listened to rather than read, as reading them would almost surely be a lesser experience. It can be done, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be what was intended.
