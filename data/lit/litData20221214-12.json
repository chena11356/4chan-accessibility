Name of the Wind... I liked. The &quot;draccus sequence&quot; near the end was goofy, but that&#039;s a minor quibble. Otherwise, I was engaged, read through it in a week, and thought Rothfuss was a pretty gifted writer. I was interested enough in what would happen with the story that I ended up reading Wise Man&#039;s Fear a couple weeks later.<br><br>In the meantime, I started browsing /lit/, and didn&#039;t understand the hate the books got. &quot;Patrick Rothfuss is a fat lefty beardo soijak textbook male feminist.&quot; Looking him up, that seemed to be true, but so what? You should separate an author from their work, and none of the personal complaints about him seemed to effect his book. Even the complaints about Kvothe being an &quot;overpowered author&#039;s fantasy self-insert&quot; didn&#039;t seem meaningful, because it&#039;s established that Kvothe is a massive liar. One of my favorite books is Umberto Eco&#039;s Baudolino, so I actually like this kinda thing. An unreliable narrator can evoke some fun speculations on my part.<br><br>Wise Man&#039;s Fear started well enough, and the little bits of in-setting mythos beginning to make sense as the story progressed was well-done. I did start to seem like there wasn&#039;t much progress being made, even though there was an increased progression from one sequence to another; I didn&#039;t even hate the &quot;fairy realm&quot; sequence like most people seemed to, though that was around this point where I started getting bored and annoyed for pages at a time (the Ctheah encounter was pretty rad, tho). Then we got to the Adem. The fucking Adem. I&#039;ve never hated 100-or-so pages of a book as much as I did this shit. After finally getting through that, we get the goddamn Gypsies.

His father gave him a mission \u2014 one that he did not know how to accomplish. He was almost sixteen years of age and needed to wed. The princesses of the nearby kingdoms were too old or he did not find them to be suitable in one way or another. He could not possibly marry a commoner, that would be against the rules of the kingdom. <br>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d he bemoaned, \u201cperhaps a bit of fresh air would be for the best.\u201d Taking his horn, he blew a bellowing cry for his steed; a Dragon given to him by his godfather, the Wizard of Pillarime.<br>A gust of wind and a loud thud could be heard on his balcony. The large red dragon knelt in front of the prince, knowing what was desired. Securly mounted, the two took flight across the kingdom of Pillarme. They flew past the forests and into the mountains, finally landing near a large secluded lake surrounded by the snowy peaks that guarded it. It was their spot, a spot no one else knew, except one other; a girl of ashen hair and hazel eyes. She was drinking from the lake undisturbed nor worried about the man and beast in front of her.<br>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Prince, \u201cI\u2019ve never met another person here. How did you get up here?\u201d<br>\u201cMy name is Meredith. Don\u2019t tell anyone but I used magic.\u201d<br>\u201cMagic?\u201d <br>\u201cYes, magic. Let me show you.\u201d<br>With a wave of her hand, sparks of mana took shape. She performed for the Prince, dazzling his mind with the beauty she conjured. <br>\u201cWow! How did you learn to use magic? And can I do it too?\u201d<br>Meredith smiled at the Prince. Her eyes welled with tears and her smiling lips drooped into a frown. <br>\u201cIt is a curse which I would never wish upon another. To mock Nature is a crime upon itself.\u201d<br>\u201cI wish to learn anyways. A talent this powerful could never be a curse. I\u2019ll do anything to be able to cast magic!\u201d<br>\u201cAre you prepared to sacrifice what you love?\u201d<br>\u201cYes!\u201d<br>Meredith\u2019s eyes glowed a yellow that shocked the dragon. The beast stepped back and arched his neck. Smoke formed from its nostrils, and in a single instant it blew a fire directly at the girl. <br>\u201cDraco! Stop!\u201d the Prince cried.

Binding the beast to the ground, Meredith inched closer to the struggling animal. It leered over to the Prince, whimpering and pleading for any help it could get, but it was too late. Meredith touched the nose of the beast and in an instant, decay set upon its body. The Prince was shocked; speechless at the events that took place. Meredith turned around and held in her hand, a glowing blue orb.<br>\u201cHere. This is your gift for defying Nature.\u201d<br>\u201cWhere did Draco go? What did you do to him?\u201d cried the Prince.<br>Without warning, Meredith pressed the glowing orb into the Prince\u2019s chest. Screams of pain erupted in the middle of the mountains, where only one other could hear. The Prince blacked out. <br>Upon waking, he felt a surge of power in his veins. Looking into the lake, the reflection showed another. A creature with blue eyes and a haggard face. It touched itself, trying to find any comfort in its appearance.

Nor did I object when I found equally brief descriptions of the same countries in reviews of books I would never read or in magazines I would never subscribe to.<br><br> *****<br><br>I kept to myself some of my interpretations of its forbidding architecture, the awkward restraint of its dances, and the provoking fluidity of its language. And few people had the opportunity to dispute my explanations for the decline of some dynasty or the relentless persecution of some wayward sect.<br><br>But I never doubted the existence of the land, even when I least expected to learn where it lay. Whenever I was assured that it could not be located beyond this or that frontier, I only intensified my researches into its culture. I even surmised that some traveller had already uncovered in an actual territory the way of life that I knew as necessary to some nameless folk, but that his account of his travels had been suppressed or hopelessly mutilated.<br><br> *****<br><br>On the steep side of a mountain, in the country that I first found in those days, a ragged shepherd sprawled beside his flock. He was able to watch all day the comings and goings of villagers among the huddled houses across the narrow valley. But he himself lay almost unnoticed among the lowest reaches of a dense forest. In the languid hours of afternoon, the men and women moving in and out of his field of vision were mere blurs of limbs propelled by the same insistent energies that drove the wind through the branches above him or brought his snuffling sheep to the very grass where his legs rested.<br><br>The thoughts that occurred to this man might have seemed outrageous to anyone but myself. I had watched many a distant village in sombre illustrations and seen their inhabitants stripped of the invisible but bulky layers of moral fabric that I sensed about the people nearer me. The face of the man was haggard and creased. I knew he had done in his native valley what I would not have failed to do between far hillsides. And years before I knew that his homeland was called Romania, I called it, for convenience, Romania.<br><br>A group of farm-workers straightened their backs and rested for a moment from their threshing. Women and men stood elbow to elbow. The drudgery of their work in the shadeless sunlit field and the nearness of the keen-eyed older women should have protected the only girl I was interested in.

That these desires are nothing but the conjured demons of economics, society, and evolution and while they promise fulfillment they will only use you to their own ends, increasing their strength over you, leaving you a slave and a broken human. The world of phenomena is a test, projected by the noumena, and to conquer it you must conquer yourself.<br><br>Although I might try to convince myself that life has some external value, after a night drinking with \u201cfriends\u201d or a sexual encounter with woman, it quickly becomes apparent that most friends are not worth having, and that woman\u2019s sexual desires are so perverse and banal that their even having desired you bears the weight of a bad conscience. What man does not disgrace himself by submitting to a woman\u2019s desires? He becomes a fool, a brute, a scoundrel, a cuckhold, all at once\u2014 and looses himself in the process. What man benefits from society? He devoured his life\u2019s work to the machinations of warfare and industry, he trampled the earth, he becomes bound up in stories told to gullible children, he is sold slavery and like an idiot wears his chains with pride.<br><br>Service originates in the Latin word &quot;Servi\u201d, meaning slave. That\u2019s what society, friends, woman the whole world, asks from you, your slavery. In English, the familiar for of \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cthou\u201d, has long since died from the language. For those lonely men in Anglo countries seeking company, this should be (with honest reflection) enough proof that you will never find it. We live in a civilizational world-spirit which lacks even the words to express friendship, closeness.<br><br>There are two things in life worth their weight in gold: freedom and silence. How many men exchange these treasures for paper? Or for a soft touch of flesh? Or for some false sense of meaning to disguise their emptiness?<br><br>In books, there is the peace of forming a genuine connection with another person. If you cannot read, write. If you cannot write, read. If you are still lonely, hire a whore; it is less demeaning and less expensive than going to clubs.

It&#039;s not about your capacity to retain and learn, but about how much time you&#039;re really going to have to learn. How many free hours do you have left in your life. It takes a lot of time to get barely decent at playing, let alone getting decent at songwriting.

I mean he is a vile conglomeration of meat oozing with juices. I hate this worthless sniveling rat bastard sack of shit. Somehow I got scammed into the dorm room situation and have to live in the same room as him. This is actually my second roommate this semester, because I thought that there couldn&#039;t be anyone worse than the first one. Perhaps I am lucky. Perhaps God loves me. This third-world mutt cunt sleeps all fucking day and keeps me up at night. Initially, I let it slide, and I would try to stay out of the room all day, but not having access to my own room during the day really fucking pissed me off. Recently I&#039;ve just started opening the curtains and being as loud as possible so I wake him up. I know he won&#039;t get out of bed, but it feels good to piss him off. The vampire fuckwit also has a tendency to lie in bed and watch tiktok all night with the volume up. My solution is to blast some annoying shit as loud as possible and act like I don&#039;t know what the problem is when he tells me to turn it down. Wear fucking headphones cunt. He&#039;s also messy as fuck, and he&#039;s gay. He has forgotten to flush the toilet four times, and pisses on the god damned seat. He also gets hair fucking everywhere. And, worst of all, he smells like shit and makes the room smell like shit. Due to his faggotry and brown skin, he&#039;s also the loudest mf on earth and I want to murder him when he speaks. My number one pet-peeve, though, is his constant fucking scratching. The itchy motherfucker doesn&#039;t fucking stop and it sounds like sandpaper. Stop fucking scratching yourself you nasty fucking cunt. Recently, he&#039;s developed a cough. This is, of course, loud as fucking shit too. He kept me awake for three fucking nights before I told him to fucking cover his mouth and muffle his goddamned cough. Nasty fuck. Still going. I leave the country in about a week. I&#039;m going to throw his headphones that he doesn&#039;t use out the goddamned window. I&#039;m going to piss all over the shit he has strewn all over the bathroom. I&#039;m going to leave pube trimmings on his toothbrush. And if he is actually asleep when I leave next week at 5am, I am going to blast HAMBURGER CHEESEBURGER BIGMAC WHOPPER at full blast on my speaker right before I leave.", "filename": "1608959015826", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 574, "h": 574, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1670988117565815, "time": 1670988117, "md5": "aqBUYi9iGEIKKCGgJEpCQw==", "fsize": 209526, "resto": 21376862}, {"no": 21381027, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:24:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21380966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21380966</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is this supposed to be funny?</span><br>no.", "time": 1670988257, "resto": 21376862}, {"no": 21381034, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:25:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21376862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21376862</a><br><br>Where&#039;d you learn how to steer<br>You do eighty in second gear<br>When you drive, I can&#039;t relax<br>Got your license from Cracker Jacks<br>You just hit another tree<br>These fender benders are killin&#039; me<br><br>She drives like crazy<br>Like no one else<br>She drives like crazy<br>And I&#039;m afraid for myself<br><br>They&#039;ll put you behind bars<br>We&#039;re not playin&#039; bumper cars<br>Did a great figure eight<br>In the middle of the interstate<br>Tires squeal wherever we go<br>Even hitchhikers just say no<br><br>She drives like crazy<br>Her car&#039;s a mess<br>She drives like crazy<br>She&#039;s got a death wish I guess<br><br>She&#039;s a demon<br>Behind the wheel<br>Thinks she&#039;s drivin&#039;<br>The Batmobile<br><br>Burnin&#039; rubber in school zones<br>Runnin&#039; over traffic cones<br>Passin&#039; &quot;semi-&quot;s on the right<br>Now my knuckles are turnin&#039; white<br><br>She drives like crazy<br>She&#039;ll break our necks<br>She drives like crazy<br>She always gets into wrecks<br><br>She drives like crazy<br>Like no one else<br>She drives like crazy<br>Now I&#039;m afraid for myself<br>Beautiful, just beautiful...", "time": 1670988317, "resto": 21376862}, {"no": 21381080, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:34:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21380910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21380910</a><br>Apparently George agrees.<br>-<br>George: Elaine, you know how I&#039;ve always been obsessed with finding the perfect job, the perfect apartment, the perfect girlfriend?<br><br>Elaine: Yeah, I know.

Instead, he argues, these types of places have simply become liminal spaces constructed in order to fulfill the needs of consumers. The physical location itself has superseded the symbolic attachments we have to traditional places. Instead, these non-places serve as simple transitional spaces from one act of consumption to the next, utterly devoid of any meaning beyond their own purpose.

It&#039;s kind of dense, definitely not the must interesting read at times, but he lays out a pretty convincing argument. <br><br>Colonial American&#039;s enjoyed living and consooming in a trans-Atlantic world full of new consumer goods. 18th-century Britain was laying the foundation for the Industrial Revolution, especially in the hinterlands where individual households produced what Breen calls the &quot;baubles&quot; of Britain. These shiny trinkets filled genteel and middle class colonists&#039; homes. <br>As the American independence movement began, the levies on consumer goods increased. This caused the vast majority of Americans-- even those who didn&#039;t give a shit about the high minded Enlightenment ideals-- to seethe to unprecedented levels. Once their consooooming was interrupted, more colonists participated in revolutionary politics in greater numbers and with a newfound fervor. Aditionally, Breen argues much of the early networks of communication (committees of correspondence) and demonstrates centered around protests against taxes that negatively impacted consumers the most (must... consoom.... MUH TEA... need... LE PLAYING CARDS). <br>Boycotts and similar protests allowed all colonists to participate in the revolution. Women especially found a sense of patriotisms in their shopping choices. Women often controlled most of the household budget, and their correspondence helped further strengthen ties throughout the colonies.<br><br>The story is nothing new: no taxation without representation (retarded argument btw). Breen&#039;s contribution was that it was precisely the consooming American public that formed the basis for revolutionary change.<br>As he argues:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the colonists&#039; shared experience as consumers provided them with cultural resources needed to develop a bold new form of political protest. In this unprecedented context, private decisions were interpreted as political acts; consumer choices communicated personal loyalties. Goods became the foundation of trust, for one&#039;s willingness to sacrifice the pleasures of the market provided as remarkably visible and effective test of allegiance. </span><br><br>I think it&#039;s an important work if you want to study the development of American consumer behavior and the politics of consumption. It also shows that mutts will put up with whatever until their precious product is threatend or unavailable. <br><br>If you don&#039;t want to read the full book, just check out Breen&#039;s article here: https://www.jstor.org/stable/651021<wbr>", "time": 1670893075, "resto": 21375421}, {"no": 21376594, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)20:02:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21375421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21375421</a><br>Empire of Things: How We Became a World of Consumers, from the Fifteenth Century to the Twenty-First", "time": 1670893362, "resto": 21375421}, {"no": 21377366, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)23:50:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21375518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21375518</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*hops onto amazon to order a copy*</span><br>honestly looks good, though", "time": 1670907059, "resto": 21375421}, {"no": 21378494, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21375518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21375518</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;edited book</span><br>mildskepticism.jpg", "time": 1670937753, "resto": 21375421}, {"no": 21378516, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:29:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is consumerism on the decline or is the soft austerity pushed now because of inflation only?", "time": 1670938173, "resto": 21375421}, {"no": 21379265, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21378516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21378516</a><br>It&#039;s always consumerism at base: just because platforms don&#039;t explicitly sell you things doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not profiting off you.

With an engineer-like or scientist\u2019s mind, Aristotle quickly saw the patterns in the data, grouping everything by commonalities, properties, and overall structure. Using unsentimental rationality, Aristotle also applied these principles to humans, classifying them by temperament, gender, race, and various other properties with a level-headed shrewdness that caused his observations to be read and celebrated throughout the ages. As for happiness, Aristotle believed that it is best attained by doing what comes naturally to us and doing it well; in other words, to fulfill one\u2019s purpose and become a paragon of human excellence.<br><br>Kant: A great scientist and a great philosopher, Kant aimed to fuse the writings of Newton with the philosophy of his day. For Kant, the human mind contains the faculties that appear to us to be woven into the physical universe (such as quantity, causality, totality existence, etc.). These faculties interact with reality as it exists in itself, creating a synthesis that appears to us as \u201cobjectively true\u201d while being, in fact, only true according to the synthesis between the rational categories of the human mind and the raw \u201cstuff\u201d of reality which is unknowable to us in its unsynthesized form. Kant was also a notable thinker in the domain of ethics, where he developed the rules-based approach to ethics and summed up his teaching in the categorical imperative: An action can only be ethical if it can be followed as a general principle by all members of society, in all similar situations.<br><br>Epicurus: Epicurus advised his followers to live simple lives. For example, their food and drink consisted mainly of bread and water, with cheese as a rare indulgence. Having been much misunderstood by posterity, Epicurus actually counseled that intense pleasures were to be avoided because they were often followed by pain \u2013 either from overindulgence or from losing access to the pleasures again. Likewise, Epicurus held that stronger and more uncommon pleasures would, at the same time, make common and less potent pleasures less pleasant, thereby robbing the man who indulges in the rarefied pleasures of the opportunity to enjoy a simple, quiet life.<br>1/2", "filename": "philosopher-personality", "ext": ".png", "w": 1009, "h": 975, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1670919741844825, "time": 1670919741, "md5": "oC3PSuLgpVYcJ9e+etCpNw==", "fsize": 603681, "resto": 21376604}, {"no": 21377815, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)03:23:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Nietzsche: Nietzsche was a German philosopher and a cultural critic. Regarding his biography, he expressed contempt and disgust for the behavior of most and mocked them incessantly. Nietzsche believed that all philosophy is autobiographical and that our so-called \u201cprinciples\u201d are really influenced by our self-interest and our physical and sensory experiences. Furthermore, he advised that we should not live an overly cautious, orderly life, risking nothing, since the outcomes that may result from taking chances may lead to personal growth. Additionally, Nietzsche argued that objective truth is impossible\u2014there can only be perspectives and interpretations driven by a person&#039;s interests and experiences. For Nietzsche, it was important for each individual to find meaning in his or her own life and to live in accordance with that meaning.<br><br>Hume: Hume was skeptical of most beliefs \u2013 be they religious or derived from pure rationality without experimental data to back them up. Consequently, friction with the settled orthodoxies of his time was a constant theme in his life. Like the other empiricists that preceded him, Hume believed that the contents of the mind came only from experience. Hume is known for the is-ought divide, also called Hume\u2019s Fork: The proposition that it is not possible to derive an \u201cis\u201d from an \u201cought\u201d (e.g., we cannot go from the moral proposition that everyone ought to be equally smart to the factual proposition that everyone is equally smart). Hume also proposed tremendous challenges to concepts like causation and induction \u2013 challenges that some consider have never been solved to this day.<br><br>Diogenes: Diogenes chose to become homeless and settled in a big earthenware storage jar on the sidewalk. He stayed in his street-dwelling, where he shocked the Athenian citizenry through seemingly mad and crass behaviors, backed up by insults and occasional wise sayings. One could say that Diogenes was history\u2019s first punk, a true provocateur who cared little for his own well-being or physical safety, mocking both the highborn Plato and the mighty conqueror and king Alexander in a remorseless display of how conceited they looked when viewed through the lens of his jarring, no-holds-barred philosophy and view of life. Diogenes furthermore disapproved of conventional religion and believed social customs are human inventions and that adhering to them leads to hypocrisy.<br><br>2/2", "time": 1670919821, "resto": 21376604}, {"no": 21377819, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)03:24:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Plato: Plato proposed that the only true knowledge involves rational thought, which is ultimately sublimated into intuitive and mystical knowledge of the good. According to Plato, at the end of this journey lies an enlightenment experience, where the soul grasps the metaphysical source of the universe all at once, dispelling all ignorance and attaining immortal wisdom. Since the soul is immortal and has been born many times over before its present life, it has already seen many things, both in this world and in the worlds beyond this one.

Also, the most likely champion of these evils is the degraded, headless and soulless termite nation of the CCP, and its most likely allies are countries like Russia and Iran if these latter become further annoyed with Western powers. Thus it is absolutely necessary to end the current brother wars and try to create a moral order of friendly nations in Eurasia that is opposed to the aforementioned evils. <br><br>Beyond that we can all have whatever long term spiritual goals or meta-historical speculations we want. <br><br><a href=\"#p21372660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21372660</a><br>What is your take on the LaRouche crowd?", "time": 1670834717, "resto": 21363533}, {"no": 21373784, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:45:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this book anti anglo?

He was smart enough to recognize how to artificially create a culture (his speeches will go down as the most impressive speeches mankind will ever see) but he was responding to Marxism more than anything else and similar to how Marxism is basically the friendly term for &quot;Jewish Marxists&quot; like how Intersectionalists are just Jewish Intersectionalists (see White Fragility et. al.) in the final analysis of our current cultural critique, Hitler didn&#039;t identify that the core heresy, or thought error, is the continued spiritualization of race itself is what makes Judaism the progenitor of so many thought errors throughout time.

Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active.

What does it MEAN that analogous developments occurred in India, with Mahayana and other soteriological movements introducing new ideas into the stagnant and formalistic ritualistic cults?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence.

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function.

If you can&#039;t advertise yourself and you&#039;re a white male writing in a saturated genre like fantasy, for instance, they&#039;re not going to give you a second look unless you&#039;re selling yourself on your own social media. And at that point the self-publishing industry is robust enough that you can do the whole thing on your own.

Only the truth can tear you apart like the words in this letter. I don\u2019t say it cuts to make it out to be a horrendous thing. The cuts are surgical. John wrote truly so we Christians could live as we ought to live, walking even as He walked. The truth of the way of Christ\u2026 <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.</span><br>This is true because it gets to the very core of your being and it is simple enough for any man to understand. I think something true ought to be simple enough for everyone to realise, not a convoluted philosophy. If you have sinned, you have walked in the darkness and have not known Jesus. If you confess your sins, you are cleansed by the blood of Jesus and walk in the light even as He walked in the light, and it is the true light of God, not physical light. I think the true way of being a Christian is therefore continuous confession, to receive continuous cleansing and continuous fellowship with Jesus Christ, but it also takes love to be in fellowship with Jesus Christ, and if you have not loved the brothers, who you have seen, you cannot love Jesus, who you have not seen. This is another cutting word of the epistle for me. I have not loved my brothers. I have hated them, and I have not loved Jesus, I have only loved myself. It is a terrible realisation to make as a Christian that I have not loved Jesus in deed or truthfulness, but only in saying and in tongue. With my lips I was close to Him but my heart I have kept far from him.

We should not be hateful nor sinful, if we are truly on the way. I think this is another reason why the letter is so good.

The central premise was simple: you are only allowed to believe in something that you can prove via reason and empiricism. This ideology was constructed by nerds on the late-90s to early-2000s internet, particularly in opposition to the comedic stupidity of the Republican &quot;Moral Majority&quot; ideology/philosophy of the Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush administrations. Around 2007 or so, a faction split off. This faction, in essence, believed that Atheism meant a rejection of Liberalism. When this turned out not to be the case (the Democrats began to takeup ant-Christian rhetoric at this time), this faction left and became what we now know as the Alt Right.

Agamemnon was prideful and declared himself king of kings, but the Argive chiefs constantly engaged in sacrifices and rituals that established their equality as a warrior aristocracy.

Nobody granted the rights, but by custom Achilles had already claimed his share of the spoils and Agamemnon abridged what under custom was recognized as Achilles&#039;. So he shamed Achilles, and Achilles took the opportunity to abandon the war. Like another Anon said, the other big theme is of destiny or fate, which is a constant theme in much Greek myth. Fate is a nice tool to contextualize values and human agency, since Achilles knowledge of his death in the war means he has to decide what matters to him. It contextualizes his rage over the death of Patroclus, his choice to return to the war and face death for personal vengeance against Hector.

I&#039;m glad some people here know the Greeks. Particularly, I don&#039;t think many modern people seem to read the Odyssey and really question what is going on with Telemachus and Penelope. It might just be the archaic way it is all written, but it seems like people glaze over at that. The suitors both don&#039;t need Penelope and do need her to take possession of Ithaca. Penelope isn&#039;t the &quot;heir&quot; of Ithaca per se, Odysseus inherited the throne through his father and Penelope is just his wife, but Telemachus is not the one in charge of the household either because he doesn&#039;t seek to claim it, he believes his father lives. It is just de facto the case that Penelope is the one who represents the household of Odysseus and the closest position to the power over Ithaca, so the suitors compete with each other for Ithaca by competing over Penelope. She just finds herself in the position of being the means to claim some legitimacy over Ithaca. <br><br>But also as you said, while I think Telemachus doesn&#039;t want to claim power over Ithaca because on some level this could be seen as a betrayal of his father, or a challenge to him (the situation could get sticky if Odysseus returns), he also simply doesn&#039;t feel secure enough to do so. There are tons of adult men in Odysseus&#039; house who have many friends and kinsmen who would fight on their side, and Telemachus doesn&#039;t feel capable of opposing them. This is the flip side to him potentially feeling conflicted about claiming the household for himself, what if the suitors simply try to kill him and take Ithaca? Suppose his father returns, he would find that his incapable son lost everything. So ultimately Penelope and Telemachus are of the same understanding that the best thing to do is stall for time and try to find Odysseus.", "time": 1670958853, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379470, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:15:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "being gay used to be cool now its just female fantasies where one guy is essentially a woman that preteen chicks scared of penetration self insert into so that they dont have to think of vaginas getting fucked<br>women ruined being gay", "time": 1670958935, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379498, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:24:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379346</a><br>I only saw the movie once when it first came out and tried hard to forget it afterwards.

They don&#039;t always, it isn&#039;t some necessary condition of patriarchy, but it happens in multiple cultures throughout history and doesn&#039;t seem like a coincidence. Consider how the companionship of women can become devalued by their general status as tools for powerful men to trade between each other. Women are still arousing, but even in this capacity they can easily be equated to slave women and prostitutes who are just objectified for their qualities of being arousing.<br><br>So the female sex in general becomes partially sub-human, they&#039;re just the inferiors of men. The test of companionship for women becomes their loyalty to you, but their loyalty is expected of them and isn&#039;t exactly valuable as something given to you. Greeks in Homer still showed strong signs of being a gift giving culture, since the aristocracy proudly gave, received and displayed gifts as signs of respect and alliance. In the Iliad there were even cases where somebody would recognize somebody else as a friend because their fathers had exchanged gifts. Gift giving is done between, roughly speaking, people who are equals, and it displays how you are valued by others when they freely give you gifts. <br><br>The loyalty of a wife in a culture as patriarchal as the Homeric Greeks was not a gift given by the wife, she owes loyalty as a member of the patriarch&#039;s household. But the loyalty and devotion of a man can really inspire pride, because men can be equals in honor. So the relationship between men can take on a deeper value. That isn&#039;t to then say that love between men and women in the way we understand it as a kind of companionship of &quot;equals&quot; was unheard of, but it was usually very ambiguously presented as something like intense lust. But male companionship wasn&#039;t as sullied by the quality of women as sexual objects that brought houses together in alliance. So it is easy to see how it can paradoxically (for us) appear as &quot;masculine&quot; to have semi-sexual companionship with men, because it is like an equal is giving themselves to you freely. But there are still tensions around dominance and who is giving to who, so you also get the common element of the older man and the younger man who is often something like an &quot;apprentice&quot; to the older man (see the gay samurai too).", "time": 1670960134, "resto": 21378465}, {"no": 21379629, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:08:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379498</a><br>The prophecy of glory for Achilles is not in the Iliad.

But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

More than that, they are unconcerned with the fortunes of their village, the safety of their streets, the fate of their church and its vestry. They think that such things have nothing to do with them, that they belong to a powerful stranger called \u201cthe government.\u201d They enjoy these goods as tenants, without a sense of ownership, and never give a thought to how they might be improved. They are so divorced from their own interests that even when their own security and that of their children is finally compromised, they do not seek to avert the danger themselves but cross their arms and wait for the nation as a whole to come to their aid. Yet as utterly as they sacrifice their own free will, they are no fonder of obedience than anyone else. They submit, it is true, to the whims of a clerk, but no sooner is force removed than they are glad to defy the law as a defeated enemy.

Analysis certainly manages to coexist in the mindscapes of (some of) the greats, but it is not necessary. I don&#039;t think it even helps, personally, at least not once you let go of your independence of thought, subsume your individualism and start seeing literally anyone as &quot;more expert&quot; than you are. Good writing is, in my opinion, a function primarily of good taste and dedicated practice. The things you like about literature should be deep and enduring love for inexpressible infinitesimals you (and maybe only you) find exhilarating. The things you dislike about literature should be deep and burning hatreds. Above all, you should trust your ability to (eventually) grasp that for which you reach.

Annie Dillard said it similarly: aim for the chopping block, not the wood (this is a wood chopping analogy). Andre Gide said his writing was something like, to paraphrase, the pursuit of his soul, or the growth of his soul. That&#039;s good too. With writing seriously I&#039;ve found that I could never write before due to faults in my own character, or views, or mindset, or state of mind. I had to shift my whole world around to even get myself to sit down each day and write for a few hours.

I imagine my world is going to have to shift again in order to facilitate these goals, though I have no idea how. One might think it is very simple, point here, do that, make a list, organise, make a plot, follow it, but in practice I find it deeply involved, as though it&#039;s all different ways of seeing and being, so getting myself to that place where I can sit on the level I desire and have it all work . . . well that&#039;s blocked to me somehow now.", "time": 1670938072, "resto": 21378106}, {"no": 21378530, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)08:34:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21378106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21378106</a><br>Look at The first five pages by Noah Lukeman, from what I read, you are struggling to find your own work flow, which can be troublesome if you do not understand *why* it works, mechanize your own writing system it all fails.

Its final meaning is the sand blown through the eye-holes of human skulls.\u201d Through his analysis of history, he has concluded that our species is engaged in a constant process of armament, with the eventual end goal of wiping itself out through war. History, for him, is nothing more than a slaughterhouse . . . \u201cthe place of a skull and charnel house of a mad, incurably bloodthirsty slaughtering, flaying and whetting, of an irresistible urge to destroy to the last.\u201d Although inspired by the already extreme philosophy of Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder, Horstmann ends up with an even more explicit solution regarding the problem of human existence. In his book The Beast he actually goes so far as to suggest the use of nuclear weapons in order to bring forth the extinction of the human race. For him only the annihilation of life would give rise to a universal redemption in which we would once again achieve the existential peace of inorganic matter.

Only in so far as it has seized in all its purity this content common to all men, can a people call itself Christian in truth. However, a people can make nothing fully its own but what becomes possible for it to grasp with its inborn feeling, and to grasp in such a fashion that in the New it finds its own familiar self again. Upon the realm of aesthetics and philosophic Criticism it may be demonstrated, almost palpably, that it was predestined for the German spirit to seize and assimilate the Foreign, the primarily remote from it, in utmost purity and objectivity of intuition (in h\u00f6chster objektiver Reinheit der Anschauung). One may aver, without exaggeration, that the Antique would have stayed unknown, in its now universal world-significance, had the German spirit not recognised and expounded it. The Italian made as much of the Antique his own, as he could copy and remodel; the Frenchman borrowed from this remodelling, in his turn, whatever caressed his national sense for elegance of Form: the German was the first to apprehend its purely-human originality, to seize therein a meaning quite aloof from usefulness, but therefore of the only use for rendering the Purely-human. Through its inmost understanding of the Antique, the German spirit arrived at the capability of restoring the Purely-human itself to its pristine freedom; not employing the antique form to display a certain given &#039;stuff,&#039; but moulding the necessary new form itself through an employment of the antique conception of the world.

Perhaps on evolutionary paths unknown to us, and by us unimaginable, he might have arrived hereat; and certain attributes would make it appear that, of all others, the German spirit was called thereto. In any case &#039;tis easier for us to see what hindered its solution of the problem, since we recognise what enabled it to solve a like one in the region of \u00c6sthetics. For here there was nothing to hinder it: \u00c6sthetics were neither interfered with by the State, nor converted to its ends. With Religion things were otherwise: it had become an interest of the State, and this State-interest obtained its meaning and its guidance, not from the German, but quite definitely from the un-German, the Romanic spirit. It was the incalculable misfortune of Germany that, about the time when the German spirit was ripening for its task upon that high domain, the legitimate State-interests of all German peoples were entrusted to the counsels of a prince to whom the German spirit was a total stranger, to the most thorough-paced representative of the un-German, Romanic State-idea: Charles the Fifth, King of Spain and Naples, hereditary Archduke of Austria, elected Romish Kaiser and Sovereign of the German Reich, devoured by ambition for world-supremacy, which would actually have fallen to him if he had been able to master France,\u2014this sovereign felt no other interest in Germany, than to weld it with his empire, an iron-bound monarchy like Spain.", "time": 1670943464, "resto": 21378713}, {"no": 21379739, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)15:40:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21378713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21378713</a><br><a href=\"#p21378716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21378716</a><br>Good read.", "time": 1670964006, "resto": 21378713}, {"no": 21380938, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)22:02:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump.", "time": 1670986920, "resto": 21378713}, {"no": 21381470, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)00:41:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sauce?", "time": 1670996494, "resto": 21378713}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21379160, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "funniest book I have ever read. why is no one talking about this?", "filename": "51ilzcpV3QL._AC_SY780_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 324, "h": 500, "tn_w": 162, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1670952500580246, "time": 1670952500, "md5": "WQ3Liugo9jDVbJ6/QVuzTQ==", "fsize": 34013, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "funniest-book-i-have-ever-read-why-is-no-one", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 19, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 8}, {"no": 21379218, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)12:47:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "because /lit/ hates<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;contemporary lit</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;/tv/ crossovers</span>", "time": 1670953660, "resto": 21379160}, {"no": 21379289, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:16:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379160</a><br>Goyslop", "time": 1670955404, "resto": 21379160}, {"no": 21379370, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)13:41:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379218</a><br>tv crossover?", "time": 1670956861, "resto": 21379160}, {"no": 21379466, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)14:14:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21379160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21379160</a><br>It&#039;s incredibly funny, especially the scene where Roseberg wakes up from a coma after trying to save the film reel from a fire. <s>Rosenberg isn&#039;t a jew but the doctors assume he&#039;s one based on his name.

When societies of people humble themselves to God He rewards them with unbound success and purpose by using His infinite abundance of craftsmanship and skill. He is the Creator of all things and must be sanctified and obeyed. I&#039;ve been trying to be more conscious day by day with reading the Bible and that is a theme which is very apparent to me in books such as Kings 1 &amp; 2 where it is most explicit.<br>However it seems that the fate of the entire kingdom of Israel rested upon people like King David and King Solomon which I believe is relevant to modern times because our western empire allows for leadership to disobey God directly while keeping the people complicit. It is up to the people to seek Christ because the New Testament was written by witnesses to His life, death, and resurrection; It explicitly lays out an even clearer vision for how to make an empire aesthetically beautiful and also full of meaning - Because God is pleased by being glorified and praised and then inspires His people and protects them while they build society to His liking, which is nothing short of Heaven on earth.", "time": 1670990136, "resto": 21378940}, {"no": 21381232, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:11:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I\u2019m glad to read threads and replies like this because it reminds me not to waste a single iota of my emotional bandwidth in favour of this utter dogshit.", "time": 1670991088, "resto": 21378940}, {"no": 21381365, "now": "12/13/22(Tue)23:57:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Do not think less of yourself.

I simply cannot believe that you, with all your knowledge and taste, are not made to squirm by such things as the dialogues between the \u201cpositive\u201d characters in Faulkner (and especially those absolutely ghastly italics).

The Faulkner, again, has a texture of emotion infused into every string, whilst Nabokov keeps a sort of academic distance.

Faulkner gives us his direct approach, this happens, this means this to the man, this sounds this way, and when he does try to insert detail, it strikes a sort of false tone, the &quot;that precarious and meretricious&quot;, if one could pin his style down in his own words, he&#039;s done it here.

If I could work in a firm for flat 40 hours a week and leave it at the door, I would do it. However, that&#039;s usually insurance law which doesn&#039;t really pay that much. Everything else is incredibly deadline intensive, and the clients want work done yesterday. <br><br>Also, the biggest problem with the practice of law is the billable hour. Firms might set you a target that says you need 1800 billable hours a year. You might think &#039;woo, nice, that&#039;s the same as the average hours worked by US employees, and lawyers get paid a lot so it&#039;s fine.&#039; It&#039;s not fine. Just because you have been at work for an hour does not mean that&#039;s a billable hour. It&#039;s entirely common to be at work for 8 hours but only bill 5, in which case you either BILL for 11 (work for 14+) the next day to catch catch up, or more commonly work on the weekend to make up those extra unbilled hours. <br><br>Also, 1800 hours is not a common target for big firms. Firms that pay a decent wage relative to hours worked demand 2100+ billable hours a year. Which factoring in commute and all this shit means you have been &#039;at work&#039; for 3000+.

Thomas and Scalia both believe the 8th Amendment has no guarantee of proportionality, which is at odds with pretty much everyone else on the Court (other conservative justices like Alito and O&#039;conner reject their arguments; I think O&#039;Conner&#039;s plurality opinion in Ewing gives the best argument against Thomas&#039;s theory from a somewhat originalist/textualist perspective). There&#039;s about a dozen dissenting opinions where Thomas and Scalia cite each other about how the majority is constantly exceeding its authority, which are funny to read, particularly Scalia&#039;s.<br><br>Thomas actually does think proportionality exists, but is only relevant in capital cases, or (maybe) fines/bail/whippings. Also worth noting that his upper bound for what would be proportionate is something like executing a seven year old for stealing 50 dollars worth of merchandise. Maybe adjusted for inflation if he were feeling particularly generous. The gist of the argument as I understand it is that (a) the framers never used any language to indicate proportionality in sentencing, (b) the 8th Amendment was meant to protect against torture and little else, and (c) prison sentences were never really covered under the 8th Amendment since they didn&#039;t exist in 1790; only of relevance is executions, whippings, public shaming, etc. Honestly I might be somewhat incorrect here, but yes, it&#039;s exactly as insane as it sounds.<br><br>Honestly it&#039;s a mediocre argument in my opinion, since the actual text of the 8th Amendment implies proportionality in fines and bail (&quot;excessive&quot; implies proportionality), other historically relevant documents like the English Bill of Rights contain explicit proportionality guarantees, and when dealing with how cruel any punishment is the idea of proportionality is implicit.<br><br>Thomas goes over the argument in his dissent in Graham v. Florida. You can ignore everything about how unusual the punishment is (number of states, etc.) since he doesn&#039;t think the analysis the majority is using should exist at all, unless you find that debate interesting in its own right.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/f<wbr>ederal/us/560/48/</span>", "time": 1670740213, "resto": 21364471}, {"no": 21369935, "now": "12/11/22(Sun)05:38:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;m a software engineer.
