You must stop these things. Making friends with women is easy. 1. Talk to them. 2. Don&#039;t make it about sex. 3. When you do talk about sex (as it is an inevitable part of adult conversation, sadly), don&#039;t make it about them, don&#039;t make it graphic, and don&#039;t talk about it excessively or often. 4. Be genuinely interested in people. Do this by finding women you actually like, but not in a romantic regard. 5. Always be ready to fulfill the role that a big brother would. Women need this from their male friends from time to time. 6. Avoid talking with them often about their romances with other men. Leave this for their female friends. <br><br>Your problem isn&#039;t a lack of reading or social competence, but (1) an overly sexualized thought life, and (2) fear. In the past, I would have recommended you just read the romance section of Men&#039;s Health for basic conversation tips and such, but that magazine has gone downhill, and last I looked was (like everything) an overwhelming deluge of morally defunct faggotry - 100% useless. You should find someone you can be friends with, preferably a small group, where the men are good with women. You will learn just by being part of the group. If you can&#039;t do this, maybe join some sort of hobby-oriented club or something where there are both men and women who are socially competent, and integrate yourself there.", "time": 1673318677, "resto": 21503734}, {"no": 21504401, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)22:24:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "stop watching porn, it over-sexualises your mind and stops you from just talking to women.

There are no books that will make your behaviors just change by virtue of reading them. Behaviors don&#039;t work that way, anon. Some people will probably spout some dumb incel/PUA shit, but the reality is that if your approach is designed to get laid, women will notice. Women from the age of 13 (and sometimes even younger) get used to the fact that men will look on them with lust, and the vast majority fucking detest it. I&#039;m not making a moral argument when I say any of this, but the approach of barely-restrained sexuality is just not going to work. Many men have poor self-control, and no woman is going to want to be around a man who&#039;s teetering on the bleeding edge of his sexual urges. It&#039;s rapey, and it&#039;s really just not worth the risk of being raped to be around some sex-obsessed male in the hopes that he&#039;ll restrain himself.

When I try to envision death I imagine intensively a real-world location I presently am not, such as my city&#039;s city centre or the lobby downstairs, and then imagine extending that feeling of non-being outwards to cover everywhere, all coordinates in the plane of existence. And when I witnessed these things it was as if the force of will present was so total I to all intents and purposes did not exist, in this same sense, and had total catharsis from any suffering or pain or simply the tightly-knotted sensation of being that I might have been experiencing. Not to say simply that I was getting something out of this experience, but that this absence was one way of verifying that some stimuli had provoked something in me. It felt like the consummation of the world, like being sucked through the self-intersection of the universe&#039;s Klein bottle and seeing the entire thing as a perfect and limitless circle drawn freehand. What I do think is impossible for a human being is holding onto it for more than an instant, but I think partly through intent and partly through luck and accident it is quite possible to transit through the path of perfection as a matter of course. It&#039;s this that I want to make myself a part of both out of purer libido and also so that I don&#039;t feel so inadequate in the face of it.<br><br>These moments all occurred before adulthood though, and like for many people the world and its prospects have been growing dimmer the past decade.

Having these sorts of problems is rough enough on its own (I&#039;ve only glimpsed the kind of agony the human body is capable of experiencing, and I hope even a natural death doesn&#039;t feel like that for half a second more) but having been granted a taste of what&#039;s possible and then not being able to do anything with it feels like an utterly schematic kind of cruelty that I can&#039;t even do anything with artistically.

His version of Socrates is probably gayer than it should be, and when you read Socrates in Plato about gay things, take a moment to remember this is being written by a man who has never had Socrates and really wants Socrates. Most of the stuff about Alcibiades in Plato is either a severe attempt at political distancing or stuff someone who is envious of their friends would write. Plato is so insistent that Socrates i) was once in love with boys ii) now prefers discussing philosophy and Plato is always invited and always gets told when he directly asks that Socrates no longer loves any rival. Basing Socrates relationship to Alcibiades in Plato as being gay ignores a healthy measufe of wishful thinking on Plato&#039;s part if Plato is gay and Socrates less so. There&#039;s pretty good evidence that Socrates would have engaged in some acts we consider gay but Athenian men would have considered normal, but most other contemporaries don&#039;t see it to be the notable level Plato does. Socrates is probably just a bro who jacked off in the same tent as his best bro while camping a few times, but Plato would have us believe that is the focal point of the broship. Alcibiades is treated way more as a cute twink in Plato, which makes political distancing much less likely to be the sole motivation, because in other accounts Alcibiades sounds way more like a chaotic bottom Socrates probably has good reasons other than philosophy to not go back to. Plato also denounces people who we know Socrates approved of their portrayal as getting the portrayal wrong, and writes fanfiction about them which isn&#039;t supported by any other accounts, kind of like an insane twitter stan with a wattpad following.", "time": 1673284658, "resto": 21491810}, {"no": 21502092, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)12:30:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500248</a><br>yes, now show em slut", "time": 1673285458, "resto": 21491810}, {"no": 21502105, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)12:34:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21491972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21491972</a><br>You look like a girl so it&#039;s not even homo.

If you&#039;re so confident in your own vision then you should be able to go through the effort of learning how to actualise it.

Nabokov himself said his only purpose in writing anything is to elicit that &quot;shiver of the spine&quot; you get when things end just right. I only read Lolita once many years ago but I still remember the last phrase of the book &quot;the sound of children at play&quot;. The training methods that are being used to generate these GPTs is not enough to ever get something that does what Nabokov does; that requires a genuine understanding of human emotions, not data accumulation and training of some sophisticated algorithm. But I think GPTs will be used to tell stories as &quot;human&quot; as Lolita and then some hack will read through it, change a few pieces here and there, and then write the last paragraph/chapter and call it a day.

One game of chess, for any individual player, has one of three exclusive outcomes: win, loss, draw. A win is always preferable to a draw, which is always preferable to a loss. There are rules which clearly delineate all three scenarios, with which there is precisely zero ambiguity. Writing cannot be a win, a loss, or a draw. There is no objective framework from which you can evaluate these things. The closest you can get is commercial success.

A shape can be quantified and tied to reality. There are spheres and squares and triangles in the material world which provide the backdrop for a more deterministic learning model. A smiley face is an open half circle and two small closed dots inside a larger circle. A hat is a closed half-circle with a line protruding its brim. From this &quot;understanding,&quot; AI can learn (by methods nobody genuinely understands, even its programmers) the ways in which individual human artists iterate on the idea of a smiley face. One artist may draw a smiley face with a thicker line, another may offset the mouth or make it crooked. There are complex patterns in visual art which can be collated given a wide enough dataset, and it all ties back to quantifiable collections and combinations of basic shapes. <br><br>Writing is much more abstract.

I have seen this sort of sentiment thrown around going back to when I was a 12 year old kid in 2012. Nobody would plainly say it like how I&#039;m saying it, but the basic sentiment was if you saw pictures/videos of things like gore, dead bodies, mass shootings, ect, it was generally expected that you would seek therapy over it or something.<br><br>Even among the people that posted the gore there was this sentiment that what they were posting was &quot;traumatizing&quot;. I remember 8 years ago, when eight chan was still a thing, there was this board called /baph/. It was a board dedicated to trolling, doxing, messing with innocent people. Terrible, I know. And one thing I remembered them doing was that they would write their plans and what they wanted to do in gore images, so the &quot;normalfags&quot; won&#039;t be able to read them. Another example is that /b/ tumblr raid event that happened a long time ago, it was rumored that people killed themselves over it? I was a kid when it happened and I all I remember is being confused/amused by how serious people were about it. A long time ago I also read some posts about how facebook mods seek therapy over having to see gorey posts.<br><br>Where does this seeing dead bodies=trauma sentiment come from? To me, this whole sentiment seems to just be a thing that has been socially engineered in our culture rather than something that is biologically inherent.

I genuinely feel like I went throufh some kind of psychological torture. I dropped out after a year and decided to just go through a community college, but then the pandemic fucked me over.

Keep in mind the main character and narrator is beyond schizo:<br><br>I could feel the glares of my fellow students. Like a dry tongue licking me up and down my back, violating me. I could feel them all. Even the nuances of that invisible tongue were not lost on me. Their dumbfounded looks, the lack of understanding in them. They were filled partly with pity, partly with disgust, but mostly with a feeling of superiority. It was as if they couldn&#039;t fathom that a man could be independent of their lousy company. With every fibre of its being, my left hand had to wrestle the right one away from finally drawing the serrated edge bayonet knife, and going on a stabbing spree that would end only with my suicide. The blackness returned, stronger than before. My heart was pounding, my head was inflicted with a pulsing headache that stabbed at my right temple and an unbearable pressure within my chest was building. I managed to calm down after 5 minutes of muttering to myself in the school\u2019s bathroom, and somehow the feeling subsided again. I had robbed the knife off of some crazy homeless bum when I was in the capital for a lavish banquet with my family, and started bringing it to school ever since I started seeing the shadows. The devil on my left shoulder was hushed away though and at least for the time being, my humanity steadfastly remained, as if bound by rusted chains to my body.<br>Exasperated, I trudged into the classroom having already decided that the day was going to be a heap of shit, that I was forced to sit in. Another one of these days huh?<br>Nearing the classroom, I could hear the jumbled echoes of dozens of conversations emanating from within it, making a single, large and incoherent wall of noise that immediately made me question whether it was too late to turn my tail and take the day off.

A seat close enough to the front, that I had to feign paying attention, yet far enough away to never be caught doing so. Looking at the others continuing their conversations, oblivious to my presence, I noted how comfortable they were around each other. Another strange knot formed in my stomach. <br>As I sat, waiting for the lesson to start, another student named Eleanor entered the classroom. Eleanor and I had known each other for years.

I heard freewriting is like brainstorming but even so i dont know where is the storm like i cant even find enough data to choose so it fits my writing...</span><br><br>One way to approach this problem is to start by examining your characters and their goals. What do they want, and what is preventing them from achieving it? The conflict in your story should stem from the characters&#039; desires and obstacles, and should be the driving force that propels the plot forward.<br><br>Another way is to think about the theme or message of your story. What are you trying to say or explore through your characters and their actions? Once you have a clear sense of the theme, you can then think about what kind of conflict would best serve to illustrate or explore that theme.<br><br>One technique you can use to generate ideas for the conflict is freewriting. Freewriting involves setting a timer for a specific amount of time (say, 15 minutes) and writing down whatever comes to mind without worrying about whether it&#039;s good or not. You can freewrite about the characters, their desires, obstacles and setting, it might generate some new ideas that you can use.<br><br>Another option is to brainstorm with someone, talking through different ideas and seeing what resonates with you. A fresh perspective can be very helpful in generating new ideas.<br><br>If all of this fails, one more technique can be looking at other stories, movies or books that have resonated with you and trying to find what specifically made them work. Analyze the story&#039;s structure, character, conflict and resolution and see if you can find inspiration from them.<br><br>Remember that the most important thing is to keep writing and experimenting, don&#039;t be afraid to try different ideas and see what works best for your story.

If I have fanaticism, it is in the idea that the worldview in which you are so invested is not some kind of supra-real reality as is always depressively implied in these discussions. The fact that it makes you feel bad does not necessarily imply that it is more real. A set of ideas that justify your feelings of hopelessness, resignation, despair is not intrinsically correct to the exclusion of all other ideals just because you find it sufficiently justifies that feeling. Answer me honestly: what came first, the feelings that spurred on the development of these ideas of yours, or the ideas?

Sex is what makes babies after all and you can&#039;t really have sex without passion. I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s.more to a relationship than pure passion and it&#039;s the active decision to sacrifice one&#039;s freedom to their spouse and to their children (assuming they have any) that makes a relationship true. I can have passionate sex with hookers or arthoes or have passion for a cute girl I see. That doesn&#039;t make it love at all. It&#039;s just lust in the first two cases and a crush in the latter. The difference between love and lust is the addition of devotion and sacrificing one&#039;s own good for the other and the direct promise that the union will be fertile (assuming no biological sterility). You can talk abou &quot;passion&quot; this, &quot;passion&quot; that, but a man that has swx with 20 women, a man that has a crush on a gravure model and a man that is about to make love to his wife all have passion for a woman. But only the husband is truly in love in some sense. Also, these associatoons are non non-existent. They exist in a great deal of philosophical literature and also a good deal of love stories like that of Heloise and Peter Abelard, the parents of the Gracchi brothers, Saint Augustine and his common-law wife that bore Adeodatus, etc. If you are decently read or at least looked around on this subject for awhile it is nkt hard to find. Aristotle, whike he writes more about friendship, talks about the same in the Nichomachaen Ethics and Gaius Musonius Rufus has an entire tract on marriage and what I said basically comports to that.

Just because most people don&#039;t put effort to actually do this in practice doesn&#039;t mean that this isn&#039;t how marriage is supposed to work: it&#039;s funadamentally an active sacrifice of oneself for the spiritual, mental and physical (which includes sexual passion) of your spouse for the propagation of spirtual, mental and physical (children or at the very least openess to children) fruits.<br><br>I think you reading way too much into my texts.

One I particularly like is a sort of Rip Van Winkle derivative set in modern times. Married man with two kids driving home on a freeway in LA. By chance a vanishingly rare phenomena occurs where his car is collides with a momentarily manifesting tear in space-time, completely halting the spin of every atom from the outer layer of the vehicle all the way inside. Including his own. He and the car are completely frozen in time, totally immovable and anchored to the earth below it and possessing a hardness that withstands any force that is applied to it. The incident gains world-wide renown almost instantly. &quot;The Frozen Man&quot; becomes the most famous person on earth. He&#039;s voted Time man of the year. Millions of people flock to the spot where his car is frozen to catch a glimpse of him. The man&#039;s wife and children are obviously devastated by this. The section of the highway is eventually cordoned off and covered by a large hangar, turning it into a giant lab for research, only accessible by authorized scientific delegations, US intelligence, military and the president...but the Frozen Man&#039;s immediate family are also allowed visitation. As years pass, many profound scientific discoveries are made as to the nature of matter. Frozen man&#039;s oldest son becomes the most frequent visitor among his family as wife can no longer bear the pain of seeing him. The son is a bit of a prodigy studies in school and eventually grows up to specialize in plasma physics. He becomes a regular researcher at the facility. He comes up with a novel method to observe the frozen matter and eventually dislodge and capture some particles from it using a particle accelerator. These captured particles were found to be capable of seeding a process to create exotic materials, capable of withstanding astoundingly high levels of heat. At year 20 after the freeze, the son is having a coffee break talking to his dad behind the glass and he notices that his dad&#039;s hand was slightly off of the steering wheel which wasn&#039;t the case. He also observed the beginnings of a squint in his eyes...as if he&#039;s about to flinch. Calling an emergency meeting, the scientists take measurements and discover that the frozen vehicle is in fact accelerating exponentially. They calculate that within 3 days, the car and everything in it will hit an inflection point and very rapidly come out of the freeze. They prepare by clearing a path for the vehicle through the hangar and out to a now abandoned section of the freeway.. With the whole world watching and anticipating on the third day, the car starts rolling forward slowly and then suddenly accelerates to 65 MPH and Frozen Man, who was a split second ago driving on a freeway was now driving inside a giant hangar. He pumps the breaks just as his car exits the end of the hangar in full view of news helicopters. His son, and others run out to the car as he steps out into a world that has left him 20 years behind.", "time": 1673339705, "resto": 21504225}, {"no": 21505222, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:36:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505219</a><br>This would be the first half of the story.

The billionth reprint of Alexandre Dumas, self-help crap, countless battle sci-fi and battle fantasy series from no-names, etc. Most regular people have two options when it comes to classics: dirt cheap pocketbooks or not so cheap glossy hardcovers that are printed on the same toilet paper as pocketbooks. Sometimes freelancers hired to work on books forget to include end-notes or use some random copy full of OCR errors found on the net (even when the same book has already been printed by the same publisher).

Democracy in the 18th century was predicated on liberalism, or the naive and crypto-aristocratic faith in the &quot;natural&quot; self-governing capacity of republics. Then in the 19th century this faith was challenged and by the early 20th century no one believed it anymore and even within the &quot;liberal democracies&quot; it was the norm to decry the death of authentic democracy and its replacement by &quot;machine politics&quot; and the manipulation of the mob. Authors like Roberto Michels and Oswald Spengler convinced basically the entire literate class that liberalism was no longer self-evident as a viable mechanism for democracy, and had to defend itself vigorously if people were to renew their faith in it. The fascist and communist states answered this crisis by simply repudiating liberalism and trying to find another basis for the democratic principle, either the volkisch organism or the communist utopia. These attempts either failed and lapsed into the same machine politics that the anti-liberal critiques had initially criticized. <br><br>Instead of actually answering the critique of naive liberalism, the &quot;liberal democracies&quot; went full steam ahead with propaganda efforts to renew and augment the naivete necessary to believe in liberalism after its age of crisis. People like Lippmann and Bernays were listened to and read by the entire emerging technocratic and financial elite, which was part of the aforementioned literate elite and read all the same critiques, and knew very well liberal democracy was in severe crisis and that ordinary people were beginning to flirt with alternatives. They chose the Lippmann/Bernays alternative, not because they rejected fascist and communist &quot;totalitarianism&quot; - they agreed totalitarianism was the inevitable end-point of post-liberal democracy, i.e. managerial technocracy. They simply rejected the &quot;circulation of elites&quot; that would inevitably result from a fascist or communist revolution: they preferred that the technocratic totalitarian machine maintain their class, the class that killed true liberalism by using it as a cloak to dominate society with financial power, at its head. <br><br>All we are seeing now is the end of this process, as the &quot;Davocracy&quot; (Huntington&#039;s term) developing from the post-liberal/managerial &quot;new elite&quot; has spent over a century in power compounding on itself, becoming ingrown and idiosyncratic, and effectively going senile. It is synonymous with Peter Dale Scott&#039;s &quot;deep state,&quot; basically a writ-large version of the Tammany Hall style political machine, the &quot;spoils system,&quot; except with total control over countries and ultimately international spheres of influence.

Look at what people were writing in the 1920s. They all took it for granted that democracy was in peril because no plausible substitute could be found for liberalism, which nobody actually believed in anymore. To be a &quot;democratic liberal&quot; in 1920 even if you had leftist or conventionally liberal sentiments was like being a libertarian today, it required either willful self-delusion or extreme naivete. <br><br>Everything you have taught about &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; being relatively uniform traditions or relatively continuous political discourses for the last few hundred years is a lie: not only was there this massive crisis of faith in the ability of Enlightenment liberalism to absorb the shocks of industrial society and mass political participation, starting in the middle of the 19th century at latest and continuing all the way to WW2, even prior to this crisis there was great heterogeneity of discourse about both liberalism and democracy. Even in the Enlightenment heyday, most thinkers now associated with the march of progress toward states grounded in respect for negative liberty were extremely pessimistic, aristocratic, hateful and fearful of the mob. You can find incredibly prescient predictions of the impossibility of &quot;mass&quot; democracy, of the inevitability that financial powers will manipulate republics that are merely fortuitously composed of individuals without a strong overriding patriotic sense to unite them, etc., going back centuries. <br><br>Again, the narrative you have been told, of gradual progress toward greater and greater individual liberty through political &quot;liberalization,&quot; is a propaganda narrative cooked up in the mid-20th century by the elites of the liberal democracies, all of whom knew very well that actual liberal ideals were a fantasy that could only have been maintained by sensible people into the 1840s at most. The narrative wants you to think that history was a series of partial and increasingly adequate realizations of the principle of negative liberty, and that now that this ideal has been realized, it is the human default. But it never even existed prior to its period of crisis: all the states most associated with &quot;liberalism&quot; were in fact dominated by highly politically active de facto oligarchies, with barely any input from the lower orders, most notably the most famous example of a successful parliamentary democracy, Britain. The American Founding Fathers were profoundly opposed to mass democracy and openly said that democracy was only possible in small republics - even the Thirteen Colonies with a few million people total already stretched the 18th century &quot;democratic imagination.&quot; They would not recognize today&#039;s bloated &quot;liberal democracies&quot; at all, they would see them as oriental slave empires.", "time": 1673310353, "resto": 21503620}, {"no": 21503761, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)19:27:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21503628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21503628</a><br>yep. 1984 was about communism and that&#039;s it.

It was a good feeling as this was my first time in the big city and I felt quite ambitious and invigorated, doubly so as I began to remember the passion of Mishima works. As I sat there admiring the cover of the temple of golden pavilion, I saw a cute Asian girl from across another bench looking at me book in hand. I never had much luck with women because I lacked experience and confidence, after reading sun and steel I had gotten quite fit and fairly well groomed and dressed, so this was my first opportunity ever. The second time she turned we locked eyes and I shyly looked away. I decided it would be pathetic of me to not at least try so I struck a conversation and we talked about each other\u2019s books. I began to describe in great detail about the life of Mishima and she was struck with great shock but luckily this manifested as an interest so she seemed to enjoy the conversation and so did I. We decided to walk around the city and she showed me her campus and some other cool scenic spots. She said it was getting late and I didn\u2019t want to make it awkward so I volunteered to leave. We embraced each other, hugging and saying our goodbyes. Looking back had I been more confident I would\u2019ve really sealed the deal probably stayed the night with her but I was too nervous.

I like the way Erikson composes his sentences but I detest his approach to characters. Every character is either some immortal demigod or an elite, world-weary soldier/warlock/assassin who stops every five minutes to ponder the futility of life. Every other character is a woman or a negro, which means nothing in Eriksons world but still chafes because he never fails to describe them in case you were thinking about imagining them as white. I like that he doesn&#039;t try to do a Sanderson and produce some kind of autistic magic scheme that is really just marvel super powers but despite that the magic here feels way too powerful to be this commonplace.

So is &quot;war is politics by other means,&quot; and so is its inverse. This isn&#039;t 1685, we aren&#039;t fighting cabinet wars. All 20th century war is assymmetrical and self-consciously so.

For the USA to say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t drop our thousands of nukes on every single rice farmer, because then international opinion would have turned on us and our tactical victory in Vietnam would have been geostrategically pyrrhic!!&quot; is pathetic. Vietnam fought an incredible war using every single means at its disposal and proved that the pawns can outmaneuver the queens on the board of realpolitik. Vietnam&#039;s victory was so incredible that it&#039;s philosophically significant, it&#039;s a modern Thermopylae, Marathon, or Salamis. Who cares that the Persians burnt Athens? Does anyone even remember that? No, they remember Thermopylae, Marathon, and Salamis. <br><br>To say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t disregard all metapolitical factors!! if we could have done total mobilization and destroyed our geopolitical hegemonic position and caused revolution on the home front, we could have had more tanks than you!! you had a worse K:D ratio!!!&quot; is childish and shows a lack of understanding of war.

The deeper message here is non-identification with the body and mind. &quot;The one who knows and understands the activity of the gunas [the threefold interplay of the material substrate] is not deluded about the actions of the body and mind&quot; (paraphrased from the B.G.). But the Self, Atman, is not the agent of any of this interplay, it is without a second, and therefore does not act upon anything, because there is nothing apart from it to act upon. Therefore the Self/Atman is completely without action, no one is killed by anyone, the Self does not kill. But this is the absolute height of the teaching of the B.G. On a level that is more meaningful to human beings, in this case Arjuna, there is still a choice of what to do, but the right action is indeed pre-determined by the Dharma, the Law of Manu established at the beginning of Creation (the individual is not responsible to himself, which would not make sense, but responsible to the greater order established by Manu). You would have noticed that Krishna gives more than a single reason for Arjuna to act according to his caste, and that the first I mentioned (the highest teaching) is given last as a way to eliminate Arjuna&#039;s fundamental dissatisfaction with the need to take life in general, even after he accepts the necessity of his Dharma. The &quot;lesser reasons&quot; are partly that it is preordained by the cosmic order (rita/dharma) and therefore intrinsically constitutes a force for good in the world, another is that death is not really the end, another is that as long as you act well, you will be rewarded whether you live or die. Moral agency is still presumed to be relevant in the case of Arjuna because he clearly has the choice of acting in accordance with his Dharma, or not doing so, the &quot;higher teaching&quot; is that this choice is fundamentally illusory, even though it is still necessary.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against 2000 years of western ideas about subjectivity</span><br>You would mean approximately 500 years. &quot;Subjectivity&quot; is basically made up by modern philosophers, it&#039;s not found anywhere in influential thinkers like Aristotle.

What is unique in Tolkien (and this also separates the novel from the drama) is his creation of a world and the greater formal emphasis on this.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking forthe three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay. Well, but you\u2019re telling law enforcement.\u201d He said it again, \u201cdisinformation\u201d and then just walked away. Now they deny broadcasting those descriptions but I do have a copy of the teletype that was issued. Years later, I asked various other law enforcement officers about it and they also remembered the APB\u2019s being issued.2</span>", "time": 1673335423, "resto": 21500801}, {"no": 21505141, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:04:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505061</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the US government tightly controls the flow of information</span><br>no doubt<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you have friends who still somehow doubt that psyops are a real occurence</span><br>There&#039;s absolute proof of psyops.

For Guenon it is Advaita. For Evola it is Magic of which Alchemy and Yoga are examples par excellence. For Eliade it is shamanism. The lattermost was most accomplished scholar and rose to prominence. We must however question the politics of his move to place shamanism first. Is it most correct? Or most politically correct? Are shamans roots of all religions? Are modern so-called capitalist oppressed civilization avoidant shamanic indigineous cultures today really how all of primitive man lived? Eiade himself says drug use is degenerate shamanism lol. Many scholars nowadays also argue for schismogenetic religious experience and schismogenetic prehistoric culture. Polyphony. Plurality. Multivalence. I like pure Gnosticism and Hermeticism and Neoplatonism however myself... altho I do like Evola&#039;s Yogic and Alchemical approach for applying such philosophies even if I don&#039;t follow his methods exactly.<br><a href=\"#p21497323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497323</a><br>This is a good question and would require many books to answer but maybe check out Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, it is one of the classic books in the field of esoteric stuxies generally which lead to the modern scholarly interest in the so-called Hermetic Underground. In short, it is very complicated and the answer is yes and no and changed with time and place. Catholics have sacraments. And mystics. Masons are initiatic too. Kept alive certain stuff. Enemies tho. But latter led to GD and Thelema and stuff now. Whole mess of masonry illuminati and rosicrucians mixing. But also gnosticism. Christian theosophy. Not to be confused with theosophical society. Tho same milieu as Crowley Evola Guenon etc. Neoplatonism and Hermeticism crosspollinated. Both integral to western proto sciences like alchemy and astrology and magic. Catholic church is ambivalent. Delicate game of avoiding heresy. Science also considers heresy.

If the physician cannot infuse vitality into decaying parts, he cannot effect a cure, but must wait until Nature accomplishes the task; but he who can guide the power of life can guide and command Nature.\u201d</span><br><br>\u2014 Franz Hartmann,The Life of Paracelsus<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First there should be the invocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart, and a conscience which should be free from all ambition, hypocrisy and vice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, boldness, pride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and similar iniquities which should all be rooted out of the heart\u2014that when a man appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of his body, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be changed into a pure temple of God cleansed of all that defiles.\u201c</span><br><br>\u2014 Basil Valentine<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The more pure thou art in heart and mind, by so much quicker shall you perceive those high secrets we teach, and which are entirely hid from the discernment of the vicious and depraved\u2026</span><br>\u2014Francis Barrett, The Magus", "filename": "Henryk Waniek, Upon the Sky (1989)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 655, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1673231206909579, "time": 1673231206, "md5": "Mr96kNcaasS8ZvYmxIIOFQ==", "fsize": 217553, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21499859, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)22:14:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498558</a><br>It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit.<br>If I as a materialist were an alchemist I&#039;d never truly succeed", "time": 1673234098, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500558, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)02:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499859</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s the combination of the matter, mind and spirit</span><br>But what precisely does this mean?<br>If I were to become an alchemist, what would I truly be trying to do, without any mystical language to obscure it?<br>I&#039;m not a materialist by any means but I have no love for excessive obscurantism.", "time": 1673250518, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21500751, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)03:48:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br>same<br>it seems like everyone who is into alchemy today only talks and reads about it and looks at pretty colorful pictures<br>there&#039;s no real practice anymore, no longer a tradition. just gnostic smugness that they know stuff about it", "time": 1673254106, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501256, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)07:49:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21497858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21497858</a><br><a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br><a href=\"#p21500751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500751</a><br>just want to bump these concerns <br>maybe someone has an answer", "time": 1673268591, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501316, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)08:20:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498558</a><br>These difficult and unintuitive metaphysical truths often have deceptively simply applications that can lead to the sort of results some would consider magical or miraculous.<br><a href=\"#p21498581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498581</a><br>This is correct.

Or at least like an Aristotelian hylomorphic substance monism. Prima materia and all. Ofc, I take the nondual tack rather than strict flat monist or more conventional aristotelian logical dualism (which ofc is adapted to be moreso nondual by way of neoplatonism in hermeticism methinks). This prima materia should not be viewed as independent of the imaginal and/or ideal worlds either.<br><a href=\"#p21500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500558</a><br><a href=\"#p21500751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21500751</a><br>Although many of the traditional alchemists practiced both laboratory experiments as well as spiritual exercises, most modern so-called alchemists engage mostly with the latter. This has diluted the term somewhat and now there is much new age alchemy bullshit on the market but at the same time this is nothing new. Spirituality was always an integral part of such. Also, hermeticism as an esoteric philosophy is much broader than the mere practice of alchemy. Jung used alchemical principles to develop his theories of individuation and create what is now called active imagination. This latter practice he believed was more helpful and healing to the world than all his psychological theories combined -- provided people actually practice it. Which admittedly he worried was more dangerous and difficult. People like Lull also used techniques similar to active imagination to create vast memory palaces and turn themselves into what is almost like, if you&#039;ll pardon my Dune reference, a human mentat, or walking encyclopedia.", "time": 1673270410, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501763, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)10:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Larry Principe is one of the few legit alchemists of our day<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ea<wbr>lYU2ICnU&amp;ab_channel=BytesizeScience<wbr>", "time": 1673279115, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21502845, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)15:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any French anon alchemists here? <br>What do y&#039;all think of Patrick Burensteinas and his Voyage Alchimique and books on alchemy?", "time": 1673296090, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21503849, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)19:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673311605, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21504993, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the Count of St. Germain legit?

Kant categorises each type of logical thought into what they are, basically inventing a ruleset for valid logical thinking, and then with his new ruleset goes on to stake out the limits of rational thought itself. Interestingly he denies all off St. Aquinas proofs of God through reason as not compatible with his ruleset of logic, and thus not transcendal and not true. This marks a final separation of faith and reason, as God becomes unprovable or undisprovable through reason and purely a matter of faith.

All things chain together in causes and effects, and everything he wants to grasp dissolves before the testing thought. Soon he sees mechanics even in the so-far whole and dear, in the smile of his beloved \u2013 there are other smiles as well, a torn boot with toes. Eventually, the features of things are features only of himself. Nothing exists without himself, every line points back at him, the world is but a ghostly echo of his voice \u2013 he leaps up loudly screaming and wants to disgorge himself onto the earth along with his impure meal, he feels the looming of madness and wants to find death before losing even such ability.<br>But as he stands before imminent death, he grasps its nature also, and the cosmic import of the step to come.

For here, none has yet been clear about what he is longing for, but one has always a heartfelt awareness of what one is longing away from, namely the earthly vale of tears, one\u2019s own inendurable condition. If awareness of this predicament is the deepest stratum of the soul, as argued above, then it is also understandable why the religious yearning is felt and experienced as fundamental. By contrast, the hope that it forms a divine criterion, which harbours a promise of its own fulfilment, is placed in a truly melancholy light by these considerations.", "time": 1673313968, "resto": 21503939}, {"no": 21503974, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)20:27:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The fourth remedy against panic, sublimation, is a matter of transformation rather than repression.

The Transhumanist faction were simply better at fighting, but they had the critical weakness of requiring a ton of infrastructure in order to function. Silicon, aluminum, lithium, advanced chip manufacturing, these things all have really long supply chains that span multiple continents. So the Bio-Purists, realizing that in direct fighting they would lose, simply started blowing these things up and sabotaging the system. Some guy whose 12% remaining flesh is plugged into a flying death robot can kill a hundred Bios if he finds them--but he can&#039;t do shit if there&#039;s no electricity to recharge his battery, no replacement parts on hand, and the Swedish-produced immunosuppressants he relies on are at the bottom of the ocean because some guys in a speedboat suicide bombed the tanker transporting them across the Atlantic.<br><br>So things turn very asymmetrical, with the remaining Cogs desperately trying to cobble together enough of a functional supply system to avoid being wiped out, and the Bios systematically destroying everything that would make it possible. The story followed a joint-consciousness that is dispassionately (at first) trying to work out how this can be fixed, and slowly realizing that the Bios had argued that the entire transhumanist cause was inherently suicidal specifically because it relied on technology which in turn relied on a fragile ecosystem of production and industry and resources that was inherently unsustainable--and that once you go Cog you can&#039;t go back. This entire event wasn&#039;t so much a war as an illustration that they were right.<br><br>Near the end Pyrrhus (the Gestalt Consciousness) decides that though the Bios were idiots, they had actually intuited correctly that society was not and may not ever be ready for this, and self-destructs to spare itself the Hell-Program tortures that the renegades always used on captives.<br><br>And then I lost the fucking draft.

I feel like I died when I was 21 and came back to some form of life a few months ago only to find everything in ruins.<br>I&#039;m not sure if I am rebuilding, relocating, or knocking down the last few walls remaining here.<br><br>There&#039;s no time but now, and if you live a life without variety, if you let every day become the same, then you lose it all because it turns to mush in your mind, and you look back on a decade or more and wonder what the fuck happened to your life, where did the time go?<br>Time is the measure of change, and when you have no change in your life, there is no sense of time. A year feels like a day when all you do is go to work each day and return to watch the same old films, or read the same books, in the same room, with your same self, fretting over the same things.<br><br>I had that same anxiety to do something, and ended up doing nothing except stoking the fear. Writing or not, I wish I had lived a life worth living, one where each day was not exactly the same as the last, and my life wasn&#039;t indistinguishable from season to season and year to year.", "time": 1673039545, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21489195, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)16:32:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489076</a><br>Yeah that&#039;s exactly the feeling i have and that is exactly what im so desperate to avoid <br><br>Too much time already wasted, too many mistakes made.

The style seems to *superficially* ornate, as well as repetitive, for this at the moment. Dostoevsky&#039;s characters can describe some deep emotions without relying on &quot;I... think this!&quot; etc., even though they can often at times say &quot;I think [xyz]&quot; that is a metaphorical parallel to the thought. <br>A suggestion might be to be more sparse at first, then build up to the thought about modern life as an adult devoid of a higher meaning. <br><a href=\"#p21495615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495615</a><br>My critiques feed into this. Over-reliance of the sort of statements I pointed out, e.g., &quot;I find myself in darkness!&quot; is not very evocative since it&#039;s a cliche. There&#039;s a lot more melancholic fiction and writing that can do so lyrically (Cioran), or in rudimentary yet compelling style (Beckett). It also sounds like someone who has never really read much but just talks about their own state of existence without any backing in the canon. Just having a single landmark in the canon for the feelings presented here would be good, e.g., a poetic allusion to Prometheus bound, in his punishment for bringing fire to Earth, whose liver would be eaten alive by an eagle, which points to the modern state of existence.", "time": 1673172925, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21496761, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:43:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any good videos on writing?", "time": 1673174605, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21496769, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:47:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21496761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21496761</a><br>No. There are literally none.

Ignore the pronouns as they are replaceable<br><br>In a world where humans have been at war with the squid-like humanoids known as the Inklings for as long as anyone can remember, a young warrior named Elam is chosen by the god Sol to be the protector of humanity. Elam is skeptical at first, but as he learns more about the ancient prophecy that foretells his destiny, he begins to understand the weight of his responsibilities.<br>As Elam trains for battle, the Inklings launch a surprise attack on the human kingdom. Elam and his fellow warriors are sent to defend their people, and in the heat of battle, Elam discovers that he has powers beyond his wildest dreams.<br>With the help of Sol and the ancient relics of Solaria, Elam leads the humans to victory over the Inklings. But the war is far from over, and Elam knows that he must continue to fight to protect his people and fulfill his destiny as the guardian of Solaria.<br>As Elam and his fellow warriors engage the Inklings in battle, things seem to be going well at first. But the Inklings are a formidable enemy, and they soon turn the tide of the battle. Elam is gravely injured and forced to retreat, leaving his fellow warriors to fight on without him.<br>As he limps away, badly wounded and alone, Elam begins to have doubts about the Solarian religion and its teachings. He had always believed that the gods had chosen him to be the guardian of humanity, but now he wonders if it was all just a lie.<br>As he reflects on his life and the countless battles he has fought, Elam realizes that the war with the Inklings has been going on for as long as anyone can remember, and that it is likely to continue for all eternity. The humans and the Inklings are locked in a cycle of violence and hatred, doomed to fight each other until the end of time.<br>Elam dies knowing that he has failed in his duty as the guardian of Solaria, and that the Solarian religion is nothing more than a tool used to control the masses and keep them fighting. In his final moments, Elam hopes that one day, the humans and the Inklings will find a way to break the cycle of violence and live in peace.", "time": 1673228584, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21499680, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:11:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499568</a><br>this is a lie. the person who runs the pastebin is a salty bitch", "time": 1673230304, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21499758, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:39:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21498672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21498672</a><br>Once you get used to txt2img, you can try img2img.<br>You&#039;ll be able to make a rough sketch (e.g. less than MS Paint meme quality), give it a prompt, and it&#039;ll do a fair job of using the major themes of your rough sketch to generate a far higher-quality image!", "time": 1673231973, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21499766, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:42:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;my chapters are all mostly only about 2k words...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody wants to read short chapters. </span><br>I fucked up huh?", "time": 1673232161, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21499772, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:45:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21499537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21499537</a><br>Write a chapter in which your character transitions into a woman.", "time": 1673232331, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21499788, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)21:51:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any examples of harems done right?

By chance a vanishingly rare phenomena occurs where his car is collides with a momentarily manifesting tear in space-time, completely halting the spin of every atom from the outer layer of the vehicle all the way inside. Including his own. He and the car are completely frozen in time, totally immovable and anchored to the earth below it and possessing a hardness that withstands any force that is applied to it. The incident gains world-wide renown almost instantly. &quot;The Frozen Man&quot; becomes the most famous person on earth. He&#039;s voted Time man of the year. Millions of people flock to the spot where his car is frozen to catch a glimpse of him. The man&#039;s wife and children are obviously devastated by this. The section of the highway is eventually cordoned off and covered by a large hangar, turning it into a giant lab for research, only accessible by authorized scientific delegations, US intelligence, military and the president...but the Frozen Man&#039;s immediate family are also allowed visitation. As years pass, many profound scientific discoveries are made as to the nature of matter. Frozen man&#039;s oldest son becomes the most frequent visitor among his family as wife can no longer bear the pain of seeing him. The son is a bit of a prodigy studies in school and eventually grows up to specialize in plasma physics. He becomes a regular researcher at the facility. He comes up with a novel method to observe the frozen matter and eventually dislodge and capture some particles from it using a particle accelerator. These captured particles were found to be capable of seeding a process to create exotic materials, capable of withstanding astoundingly high levels of heat. At year 20 after the freeze, the son is having a coffee break talking to his dad behind the glass and he notices that his dad&#039;s hand was slightly off of the steering wheel which wasn&#039;t the case. He also observed the beginnings of a squint in his eyes...as if he&#039;s about to flinch. Calling an emergency meeting, the scientists take measurements and discover that the frozen vehicle is in fact accelerating exponentially. They calculate that within 3 days, the car and everything in it will hit an inflection point and very rapidly come out of the freeze. They prepare by clearing a path for the vehicle through the hangar and out to a now abandoned section of the freeway.. With the whole world watching and anticipating on the third day, the car starts rolling forward slowly and then suddenly accelerates to 65 MPH and Frozen Man, who was a split second ago driving on a freeway was now driving inside a giant hangar. He pumps the breaks just as his car exits the end of the hangar in full view of news helicopters. His son, and others run out to the car as he steps out into a world that has left him 20 years behind.", "time": 1673338951, "resto": 21485010}, {"no": 21505204, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)03:29:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21505187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21505187</a><br>This would be the first half of the story.
