Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Philip K. Dick, etc) and one thing they all have in common is how energetic and interconnected the real world was. Like, if they were interested in literature they could go to a store in town and find magazines related to that niche, or they could correspond with or join an existing literary community dedicated to that niche, whose members lived in various parts of the country. When they submitted work for publication, their rejections were not cold and impersonal, but rather encouraging and full of advice etc. It feels like the world I am reading about has been neutered, lobotomized, or hollowed out.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1675758875, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21626953, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:00:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>Old Yeller, Don Quixote and Lorca&#039;s collected poems", "time": 1675760409, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21626970, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:09:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>Jesus&#039; Son and The Largesse of the Sea Maiden,", "time": 1675760965, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627148, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)05:51:38", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Dido_and_Aeneas", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2396, "h": 1689, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1675767098979501, "time": 1675767098, "md5": "Mb7oM6NgMER2usPXIhAmSw==", "fsize": 1910905, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627182, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)06:07:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wept for days when the good guys lost to the Soviet Mongol hordes and the Amerifats", "filename": "55460C28-D524-4ACD-9521-D2891E7FD9A9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 296, "h": 500, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675768061225272, "time": 1675768061, "md5": "CKF9FXUB2ER7KrsdIhZhUg==", "fsize": 65662, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627338, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:13:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21625746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21625746</a><br>i&#039;m aware this is normie tier but i fucking bawled throughout this book. japanese authors are chad enough to end their books on the most depressing tones without any of the soppy bittersweet endings western authors love to jerk off over", "filename": "nwmurakami", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 368, "h": 570, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772005133325, "time": 1675772005, "md5": "2AlbxlRJc9Bj6UpMtuG5sQ==", "fsize": 35754, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627345, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:16:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I don&#039;t usually cry outright but this one made my eyes a little teary", "filename": "lonesome dove", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 591, "h": 900, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772209225173, "time": 1675772209, "md5": "2ZQOS6ONBOLekjE+Ge1lGg==", "fsize": 136544, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627347, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:17:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21627338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21627338</a><br>Read Kokoro by Soseki.", "time": 1675772230, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627350, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:19:40", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "Le_P\u00e8re_Goriot", "ext": ".png", "w": 330, "h": 545, "tn_w": 75, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675772380930264, "time": 1675772380, "md5": "GbET7XGEn238jkVT+ntc0A==", "fsize": 188284, "resto": 21625746}, {"no": 21627355, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)07:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626322</a><br>Yeah, I&#039;m not sure what qualifies as &quot;crying&quot; here.

Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is &quot;wrong&quot;; they can&#039;t be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains \u2014 in the brains of even the stupidest person \u2014 is as &quot;correct&quot; as what&#039;s in my mind or Nietzsche&#039;s or Baudrillard&#039;s. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the &quot;truth&quot; that&#039;s hiding inside even the dumbest person&#039;s brains. For example, when a Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, he is not wrong. It&#039;s just that the concepts he designates with the words &quot;God&quot;, &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word &quot;God&quot;, going by the Christian&#039;s definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says &quot;God&quot;, he doesn&#039;t really mean an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being&quot; (since he&#039;s so dumb he can&#039;t even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means &quot;a very powerful being&quot;. Similarly, when he says &quot;universe&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;universe&quot; (i.e. &quot;everything&quot;), he simply means &quot;the earth&quot; \u2014 or at most, if he&#039;s had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps &quot;the solar system&quot;. And finally, when he says &quot;love&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;love&quot; (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. &quot;help me&quot; (= shape me).<br>So basically, when the Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, what he&#039;s really saying, translated in our language, is &quot;A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me&quot; \u2014 which could very well be true!<br>All of this stems from Nietzsche&#039;s positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener.

So these people are superior to the base crowd-pleasers like Peterson because they at least make a concentrated attempt at grappling with the big issues, and the results are at least readable, if not exactly useful.

Far more genetically gifted individuals than us in this sphere have already tried this, after all, and failed: that&#039;s why Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times while scores of his closest competitors didn&#039;t. This means that the subhuman theory of magical power-bestowing barbells is false: if the barbells do indeed play a role in the strengthening of an individual, then at the very least this individual must be of a specific type that is CAPABLE of benefiting from their effect: he has, in other words, to be WORTHY of them, which is merely another way of saying that he has to be ALREADY STRONG.<br>QED: Power is not something you can take but something that you must give, and the only reason subhumans are adamant that it is the other way around is because they are so inherently and irremediably weak, that they don&#039;t have the slightest conception of it. <br><br>460.

Though it could be argued that the Overman is the only one who is able to manifest what he wishes, because he is the only one who truly thinks himself capable and deserving of it. If the average person tried to manifest their dreams, they might fail because subconsciously they know they aren\u2019t worth it, and since they don\u2019t want to manifest that guilt along with their dreams, they can\u2019t manifest the dream at all. Also, the belief in causality and determinism can be another hindrance, which the Overman is not susceptible to. He doesn\u2019t need to know precisely HOW he gets what he wants, the universe bends its rules for him, because he creates the universe. So these things might explain why some people are able to manifest thousands or millions of dollars while others can only manifest a free coffee. But you could also argue that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d doesn\u2019t occur at all, but that the people who are confident and believe that they can manifest are the ones who are already powerful enough to attain their goals naturally, and so they attribute their success to manifestation when it was just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Again, the subhuman doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth anything, and believes in strict laws of causality and science etc. so if he fails at manifesting then he will just blame his lack of belief \u2014 a clever way of preventing blasphemers of manifestation.

Perceived freedom is where you are bound to the laws, rules, and obligations of society but you are free to buy a house, start a family, drive a car etc providing that you meet the requirements to actually do so, that being have an income, have a good credit score, have the means to support and provide for the family, have a license and so on and so forth.

To put it simply, the ABSOLUTE left is that of absolute nihilism, subjectivity, egoism, and hedonism, and the ABSOLUTE right is that of a supernatural yet objective reality grounded by a higher principle, metaphysical truth, or higher power(s). An even more simple definition is simply this: Truth and relativity.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hierarchy.</span><br>One distinguishing feature of The Right is belief in an absolute power; power that does not radiate \u2018from below,\u2019 but which originates from above. This inevitably manifests itself as support for an absolute monarch (not beholden to the people), an objective hierarch that serves his own interests or that of the State (as a power greater than the simple desires of the people), or a form of theocracy (power from a god, God, or metaphysical Truth).<br>An argument against this might be that leftists have supported autocratic leaders in the past and continue, in some fashion or other, to support them. For example, Stalin was an indisputable leader of &quot;leftism&quot; yet an autocrat nonetheless. This discrepancy is fairly easy to explain; his power was justified not by a higher power (or by himself alone), but by his being a figurehead of the will of the proletariat. This is an emanation of power \u2018from below.&#039; His power was simply a representation of the base desires of the people, NOT that of a principle or of someone or something that is an OBJECTIVE HIERARCH.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truth</span><br>Another distinguishing feature of The Right is objectivity. The idea of reality, Truth, and Telos being OBJECTIVE in nature and not in any way relative to human beings. Leftism is diametrically opposed; there is not &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;reality&quot;, there is no &quot;fundamental purpose.&quot; A leftist MAY believe that there is an &quot;objective reality,&quot; but that this reality is ultimately indeterminable, unknown, uncertain, or even unimportant. In this regard, Protagoras sums up leftism: &quot;Man is the measure of all things.&quot;<br><br>Now for schizo-time: History is the proverbial Fall from the Garden of Eden. On the Right, Man governed by the most absolute of hierarchy, life at one with natural principles and truth and without &quot;philosophical mist&quot; over his eyes; everything is as it appears, and he lives out his telos with exactitude. On the Left, Man is purposeless, reality is in flux or unreal, truth is subjective, he cannot trust his own eyes. While it is unlikely for any specific movement to be &quot;purely&quot; right- or left-leaning, every political movement throughout history has had more or less of these qualities. The general trend is that of sprint towards the left, with minor &quot;re-adjustments&quot; back towards the Right. The Middle-Ages following the staunchly left-leaning Late Roman Empire is an example of a readjustment towards the Right.", "filename": "Untitled", "ext": ".png", "w": 1864, "h": 598, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 40, "tim": 1675662724221142, "time": 1675662724, "md5": "F2RkCEmnZ4pFClGR5z9QvA==", "fsize": 100161, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621902, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:53:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Damn, I used the draft image.", "time": 1675662800, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621909, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:56:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621900</a><br>Another example of readjustment towards the objective Right is that of Classical Athens; Socrates and Plato were &quot;rightists&quot; steering the increasingly egalitarian and hedonistic Athenian society towards &quot;The Right.&quot;", "time": 1675662974, "resto": 21621037}, {"no": 21621914, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:58:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21621269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21621269</a><br>I recognize your shitty writing from other threads on this board.

Too bad it doesn&#039;t help because everybody is still showing disrespect to you and sexualizing your humiliation while you&#039;re supposed to do a lecture, so it&#039;s pointless to continue.

You just automatically exclude certain undesirables out of your conception of humanity altogether, or imbue them with magical properties somehow visible on their face, when in reality, what determines everything is bone and fat distribution, or matter. You can observe many people talking complete tiresome bullshit yet diverse results with regards to popularity: so what explains it? That&#039;s when you notice the facial structures, the body shapes, the scents and the importance of the first second impression which is used to interpret everything after that. That is the real measure stick. There&#039;s no content to what people say, there is only matter. We react to each other&#039;s bone structures and fat distributions. And things like musculature, depth of one&#039;s voice etc. anything that determines the first second reaction. <br><br>This should not be shocking to a leftist materialist, but for some reason this keeps eluding them: of course these reasons are simply status quo-related.

But I was still viewing thing through a secular lens. I then encountered significant personal difficulties that made my call out to God for the first time since my childhood. I was faced with a situation where I could fall into the perils of secularism that I had already identified or cling onto God, the only Person who could deliver from what I was going through. Through His grace I was delivered and have been religious ever since. <br><br>In retrospect, God was sowing the seeds of my conversion to Him through my reading and the personal events were the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back. There has to be a movement of both the intellect and the heart to find God. Also, since then, God has helped me in ways that I couldn&#039;t even imagine.

Massa damnata makes more logical sense than universalism otherwise why create a world with any pain or suffering unless to separate one&#039;s self from it as offer it as a taste for what is even worse in store.

How can one ensure their child does not sin? This is a difficult task and even worse the consideration of all their progeny which if they have 3 children each after ten generations will number over 80,000.

There is no indication from either the Hebrew scriptures or the New Testament that God&#039;s infinite nature entails that all offenses against him are also infinite. It generally seems to imply the opposite; for example, how exactly could Isaiah say that Israel had received &quot;double&quot; for all her sins when the debt incurred by any singular sin is infinite? If the proper response from God to any sin is to immediately inflict endless torture on the offender, why does Jesus tell us in the Gospels that the way to be like God is to forgive your enemies and be kind to the good and bad alike? If this theory of retribution were true, wouldn&#039;t he have said, &quot;And if a man slaps you on the cheek, immediately slap him back with the exact same amount of force?&quot;<br><br>Moreover, we must consider the concept of &quot;mens rea&quot;. Mens rea defines the level of intention, lucidity, and available knowledge that a person has, and which will influence the level of culpability that they are judged to have had in their offense. A sin of &quot;infinite malice&quot; must necessarily entail perfect knowledge of the offense and perfect knowledge of its infinite-ness. But of course, therein lies the rub: we are finite. And not only finite; we are created, contingent. A major point of St. Thomas&#039;s metaphysics, along with many other veritable theologians, is that God is ultimately unknowable in his very essence. &quot;We cannot know what God is,&quot; Aquinas famously states, &quot;only what he is not.&quot; This isn&#039;t limited to humans, either - even Lucifer does not actually know WHAT God is. This clearly implies that it is completely impossible for any created being to have the perfect knowledge necessary to be fully and infinitely culpable for an offense of this nature. The only being with full knowledge of God is God; but God, by his very nature, can&#039;t sin! Therefore on closer analysis it turns out to be metaphysically impossible to commit an infinite sin at all.<br><br>Another problem: God is not our peer in an ontological sense. When we judge human offenders, regardless of their status, we judge them as beings of the same finitude and existential type as us, as human beings. But God is transcendent. God is not one agent among many, who stands side by side with any of his own creations. He has ALL the power - impervious to harm or obstruction in any way by the creations whose existences are wholly dependent on him. There is nothing that any of us can do that would affect God in any way. A microbe can do more to us than we can do to God. If our sins have any effect, it must surely be on ourselves and not God.<br><br>I could keep going but unfortunately I&#039;m running out of characters.

Marx sees the individual exchange relation as part of a particular social totality\u2014a totality in which the reproduction of society is mediated by exchange\u2014and asks what this means for the labor expended by the whole society.

And every child knows, too, that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society\u2019s aggregate labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves. And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value of these products.

And the answer he comes up with, following a line of thought from Smith and Ricardo, is labour. Demand will fluctuate, and people will pay more for things at times of higher demand, but in the normal run of mass commodity production for profit, the scarcity of commodities* is determined by the amount of human labour required to produce them. If a machine is invented that allows you to make twice as many widgets in the same time, then assuming constant demand, the LTV says that prices will approximately halve.<br><br>Another useful thing about labour is that you can measure everything else by this yardstick. You can even measure the cost of reproducing labour in labour - i.e., you can work out that a worker who earns $X per week can command Y hours of the average wage at current labour productivity.

If in the assumed case the price were higher than the average market-value, the demand would be smaller. At a certain price, a commodity occupies just so much place on the market. This place remains the same in case of a price change only if the higher price is accompanied by a drop in the supply of the commodity, and a lower price by an increase of supply. And if the demand is so great that it does not contract when the price is regulated by the value of commodities produced under the least favourable conditions, then these determine the market-value. This is not possible unless demand is greater than usual, or if supply drops below the usual level. Finally, if the mass of the produced commodities exceeds the quantity disposed of at average market-values, the commodities produced under the most favourable conditions regulate the market-value. They may, for example, be sold exactly or approximately at their individual value, in which case the commodities produced under the least favourable conditions may not even realise their cost-price, while those produced under average conditions realise only a portion of the surplus-value contained in them. What has been said here of market-value applies to the price of production as soon as it takes the place of market-value. The price of production is regulated in each sphere, and likewise regulated by special circumstances. And this price of production is, in its turn, the centre around which the daily market-prices fluctuate and tend to equalise one another within definite periods. (See Ricardo on determining the price of production through those working under the least favourable conditions.)</span><br><br>Marx is absolutely 100% onboard with the existence of demand and its role in setting prices.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible. And unlike anti-natalism, there are strong sociological and technical grounds to predict that the application of biotechnology will wipe out the substrates of suffering for good.</span>", "filename": "The Hedonistic Imperative - David Pearce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 279, "h": 445, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675759844213973, "time": 1675759844, "md5": "GU7wbhImRIt8qsWCkouz9g==", "fsize": 10616, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626937, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no meaningful arguments against antinatalism</span><br>If you accept utilitarianism.

One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller.

For example, Proust\u2019s psychological insights into the dinner parties of the little clan is so universal and accurate that anyone reading has experienced something almost remotely similar of being in the company of snobs, but Proust can articulate what we generally think is the ineffable parts of our minds. Everyone can envision a scenario of Swann\u2019s extreme jealousy when he is pacing uo and down her street of the whore Odette\u2019s window, looking for light, movement, other men. Or that feeling when Swann let\u2019s his friends know he is dying and they\u2019re more worried about their shoes for their party they did not invite him to: that feeling of despair and alienation of confiding into someone who then proceeds to act as if you\u2019re a chore to be around.

Interesting love story, I enjoyed the premise. Delivery is strong and it has a phenomenological composition which sort of stems from the narrative itself. Might read it again soon.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Life is Elsewhere</span><br><br>This one, again, absolutely crushes the idealist&#039;s hearts. It shows you the extent to which people will go to COPE with the fact that life is not the same as the ideology they believe in. It is more straightforward in its structure but beginnings in what Kundera would write in later novels are apparent.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The Farewell Waltz</span><br><br>Hilarious. My favourite by this author.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Immortality</span><br><br>For some reason I think this is Kundera&#039;s &quot;densest&quot; book. At least among the ones I&#039;ve read. It has a style that hearkens back to Life is Elsewhere and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, the characters all seem miserable. There is a metanarrative that really ties the whole novel beautifully because it turns out it was all either fiction or all truth and the narrator never clarifies it. It really grabs you but it demands lots of attention.<br>I suggest that you read more on him, he is proof that the Nobel Prize in literature is a sham because he has been looked over for too long.

For there is not the remotest possibility of dying of this sickness in the straightforward sense, or of this sickness ending in physical death. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely the inability to die. In this it has much in common with the condition of the mortally ill person who is in the throes of death but cannot die. Thus to be sick unto death is to be unable to die, yet not as thought there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness is that even the last hope, death, is gone. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life. But when one learns to know the even more horrifying danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become the hope, then despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.</span><br>t. the thinking man&#039;s neetch", "time": 1675753265, "resto": 21626692}, {"no": 21626746, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)02:13:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626692</a><br>Christbros.... we&#039;re being btfo again...", "time": 1675754030, "resto": 21626692}, {"no": 21626770, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)02:24:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626714</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kierkegaard</span><br>although he has some good concepts, it&#039;s both christological and moronic to call kierkegaard the thinking man&#039;s nietzsche, or to compare the two at all really. kierkegaard is more the stupid man&#039;s hegel, if anything", "time": 1675754665, "resto": 21626692}, {"no": 21626819, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)02:48:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626770</a><br>Hegel is complete rubbish, verbal-conceptual diarrhea.

In the distance, women slather spreads on different breads as men fetch children, who seem to be now playing a degraded form of hide and seek in which children play dead under the skirts of parked cars. The men pool near the jagged jungle of autos, standing wide and surveying the lot only to break focus for a terse nod to with whom they accidentally make eye contact. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One unsuspecting lady carrying a crockpot almost flattens a kid&#039;s nose as she hops out of her blue sedan.

The driver of the sedan is a middle-aged man, slightly balding, spotted in khaki shorts and a white polo matched with white sneakers. The two appear to be a couple, though Lexi can\u2019t really tell. The woman seems to be looking for the past kid\u2019s mother, aimlessly gawking at other pavilions and the rows of picnic tables for the perp\u2019s face.

Its story is of inexpressible tedium; its characters are as bloodless as the ghosts who provide its supernatural machinery; and they reiterate only the most highminded sentiments and vapid rhetoric. The context is an unchanging background of bleak crags, twisted oak trees, purple heather, raging storms and misty islands. But to the taste of the later eighteenth century, which had grown weary of Augustan formality, it provided, in instant form, everything that was most desired. It was sublime; it was melancholy; it presented the noblest of noble savages; and its rhythmical prose was a relief from the mechanical regularity of heroic couplets. Pope had put the Greek Homer into a literary straitjacket; but the Celtic Homer was free. He was also superior to the real Homer in every respect in which the real Homer was now being criticised. We have seen that the critics had begun to object to the crudities of the Greek poet and his heroes. How vastly superior were the early Scottish Highlanders and their poet! Here were no human sacrifices, no petty thieving, no princesses washing knickers in the river. Indeed there was nothing common, or even concrete, at all. All was high-minded humanity, sensibility, chivalry. As Sheridan put it to Boswell, Ossian surpassed \u2018all the poets in the world \u2026 he excelled Homer in the Sublime and Virgil in the Pathetic\u2019; his morality was so elevated that Mr and Mrs Sheridan \u2018have fixed it as the standard of feeling, made it a thermometer by which they could judge the warmth of everybody&#039;s heart\u2019. Finally, these poems marked \u2018a great discovery\u2019 in another respect. They were an important contribution to anthropology. Till they had been published \u2018we could not imagine that such sentiments of delicacy as well as generosity could have existed in the breasts of rude uncultivated people\u2019.63 Now it was clear that they could: Ossian proved that the Noble Savage was not a myth but reality.</span>", "time": 1675802443, "resto": 21627652}, {"no": 21628933, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)15:42:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt; First, there was the style: the style of Ossian was not that of a \u2018primitive\u2019 poet: it fitted a little too happily into the taste of the moment. It also contained some passages suspiciously similar to passages from Milton and the Bible, among others;1 and although these similarities would afterwards be explained away by Macpherson as being independent observations of \u2018Nature, the great original\u2019, this explanation was not judged sufficient by the literary critics, who found the parallels rather too close. Secondly, there were historical objections. Macpherson&#039;s Fingal was represented as king of \u2018Morven\u2019 in Caledonia in the third century AD, and Ossian, his son, sang his exploits in the \u2018Erse\u2019 language in the same century. But what were the Scots, and their \u2018Erse\u2019 or Irish language, doing in Caledonia so early? Historically, they only arrived there in the sixth century AD. Before that, the country belonged only to the Picts. All this had been scientifically established by Innes in 1729; and although Innes himself had not expected to be read by Englishmen, it might be assumed that Scotchmen who undertook to judge the question were familiar with his work. Then there were internal objections. These were both general and particular. In general, why were the poems so lacking in concrete detail? They seemed never to touch the ground: no one could deduce, from their thin, high-falutin&#039; rhetoric, the economy, the state of civilisation, the morals, even the religious beliefs of the Caledonians \u2013 except that their morals were exquisitely refined and their religion happily free, like that of the eighteenth century, from vulgar superstition: the upper air was peopled only by the spirits and ghosts dear to the early romantic writers. How different, in this respect, were the poems of the Ionian Homer, so full of vivid detail and domestic incidents! By avoiding such detail, Ossian did of course escape the charge of vulgarity levelled at Homer by the polite critics of the later eighteenth century, but only to incur the suspicion of forgery. For the critics could not fail to notice that when Ossian did descend to particulars, he was frequently guilty of demonstrable anachronisms: late medieval ideas of knight-errantry, halls, towers, palaces in third-century Scotland.This was the view of Walpole, who referred to the poems&#039;s \u2018sterility of ideas, the insipid sameness that reigns throughout, and the timidity with which it anxiously avoids every image that might affix it to any specific age, country or religion\u2019. This timidity did not, he thought, bespeak \u2018a savage bard\u2019: \u2018few barbarous authors write with the fear of criticism before their eyes\u2019; and he added that if one removed from Fingal its essential furniture \u2013 \u2018the moon, a storm, the troubled ocean, a blasted heath, a single tree, a waterfall, and a ghost\u2019 \u2013 there was nothing left to anchor it in time or space.</span>", "time": 1675802545, "resto": 21627652}, {"no": 21628939, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)15:43:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what the first Scottish collectors did not sufficiently realise (although Toland of course had stated it) was that Celtic Scotland was the outer fringe of Celtic Ireland; that the Gaelic ballads of Scotland, in general, were of Irish origin; and that the Ossianic ballads, in particular, were all originally Irish. Once again we see the results of the systematic falsification of early Scottish history, the insistence that the early Scots were a distinct nation, independent of Ireland. Macpherson himself had never been to Ireland; and although the scene of the poems, even in the form which he gave them, was throughout Irish, he claimed them as the literature of ancient Scotland. That was his first falsification. But there was also a second. Macpherson claimed that he had found the whole epic in the Highlands and islands of Scotland. He never specified his sources, but he insisted that Fingal, as published by him, was a faithful and literal translation of a continuous poem of which the ballads then known, or afterwards to be discovered, were \u2018spurious pieces\u2019, corrupt and degenerate fragments, \u2018disgustful to true taste\u2019.9 He did indeed use genuine ballads, and by now \u2013 thanks to the research of late nineteenth-century and twentieth-century scholars \u2013 we know, as his contemporaries could not, precisely which ballads he used. But he used them as occasional raw materials for a spurious modern epic poem, and then declared that the genuine ancient poems were spurious and only the spurious modern poem was genuine. And this fraud he protected by refusing to discuss the evidence. In this way \u2013 as his intimate friend, the local minister Andrew Gallie, would afterwards state \u2013 he claimed the credit that is due to one \u2018who restores a work of merit to its original purity\u2019.10</span>", "time": 1675802620, "resto": 21627652}, {"no": 21628961, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)15:47:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was a remarkable success story. But could such success be maintained and consolidated in the slippery metropolis? The more he savoured his triumph, the more Macpherson became inwardly aware of its unreality. He could not avow the truth about the poems which were making his fortune. He could not live on equal terms with the wits of London: how could he talk freely to men so much more learned and sophisticated than himself, who might, at any time, press him about Fingal? If he was challenged, he could not simply produce the modern \u2018intermediate\u2019 Gaelic text, without being denounced instantly as a forger. Nor did he dare to produce the old manuscripts which he could not read himself, whose contents were largely unknown to him, and which, if read, might so easily be the beginning rather than the end of controversy. He was temperamentally unfitted for controversy, even for dialogue, as Blair made plain.133 He was still a crude provincial, secretly aware of his own inner emptiness, which he concealed behind postures of bravado and vulgar self-assertion, and \u2013 when in the company of a sympathetic fellow Scot like Boswell \u2013 breaking out in abject self-pity and denunciations of the world. In the end, he recognised that he could not sustain the part. The carefree excitement of the mysterious laboratory at Ruthven could not be recaptured. After Temora, most of which lacked any genuine basis, he was on the defensive. So was Blair. And when Strathmashie died, no impetus was left. So Macpherson, having already, through Ossian, established himself in the antechambers of power, changed direction. The quest, and then the defence, of Ossian had brought him into contact with his namesake, the minister of Sleat; and the minister&#039;s son, John Macpherson, would replace the Celtic Homer as the means of realising his essentially philistine ambitions: wealth, status, the deference, if not of the literary world, at least of clan Macpherson.</span>", "time": 1675802853, "resto": 21627652}, {"no": 21629124, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)16:46:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Why does he do it?

It&#039;s not that we need to mortify our bodies so the soul can go free, it&#039;s that we need to free it from false opinions that keep it oriented downwards looking at the shadows. The body is not what leaves the cave, it is the soul and what binds it is false opinions like &#039;pleasure is the only good&#039; that need to be broken through mental/spiritual inquiry/dialectic and purification. If you&#039;re mortifying the flesh but internally moaning to yourself about what a horrible thing it is to be alive and how you can&#039;t wait for death, that&#039;s a big error imo, possibly worse than the moderate hedonist who is at least tries to be virtuous, do good for others and try&#039;s to keep in mind the Good.", "filename": "Barry-Lyndon-3-1600x900-c-default", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 900, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675593907281642, "time": 1675593907, "md5": "4Pg5qTJQIOJ2CR/QRkEbfQ==", "fsize": 160545, "resto": 21614908}, {"no": 21617497, "now": "02/05/23(Sun)06:04:32", "name": "Strange Love", "com": "<a href=\"#p21616738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21616738</a><br><br>What is the basic principle of &quot;life&quot; I ask here.

Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system.

Around that time I saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOH<wbr>DkIxyu2A and couldn\u2019t help but crave what was being presented to me. A helpless sort of craving: at 19 years old I was a depressed neet and had been so for quite some time. Weighing little more than 50kg and devoid of any dreams or hopes for the future, most days I barely had the energy to get out of bed. That is a literal statement; I remember crying in despair one day after realizing I couldn\u2019t summon the strength to get up on my own. <br>Only a screen away were these people - real or imaginary - alive and gleaming in the sun while I decayed in a dark room, a shambling corpse feeling loneliness and despair tortuously consume my spirit.<br>I saw this GTA life - as I used to call it during the few times I tried to unsuccessfully explain my fascination with it to someone else - as something absolutely unreachable, an alien way of being reserved for those who weren\u2019t some self-made creature existing in spiritual, physical and mental exhile.<br>Some way I got out of my prison. I don\u2019t know how. I had no strength, none whatsoever. My thoughts were confused, spiteful and neurotic. I started studying again, almost wasn\u2019t accepted. Made friends, re-learned how to look people in the eye. Had a couple bad relationships, which still showed me that what seems alien and distant one day is within reach the next. Started boxing and got a job and learned to appreciate what I had and value others and suffered and cried and felt exhausted and failed and tried and tried and tried\u2026 and lost friends, girlfriends, jobs, stopped boxing and graduated on a field I can\u2019t manage to find a job in. <br>Do you know what I liked the most about that video and that game? The sense of freedom. The trips or the luxury were never the main point. My fascination was always about how it would feel to be free: about gleaming in the sun.<br>Today, I\u2019m unemployed. This january I\u2019ve become a neet again for the first time since 2018. I broke up a two year old relationship and have less friends than ever before. In a couple of years I won\u2019t be able to count with the financial support that helped me through my younger years.<br>That being said, everything is fine. Because today, no matter how bad things get, I can close my eyes and see myself gleaming in the sun. It won\u2019t be as some fictional character or a gigatwink model-influencer, but it was never about being these things. Today, I see the shit around me and know that I can leave it behind. That life doesn\u2019t need to be this way and that I\u2019ll always have the power to change it. And so I study, I lift, I learn and set goals and try and fail and succeed and fall down and get up again.

I really think it&#039;s the DragonBall to the Silmarillion&#039;s DBZ. The Hobbit is truly an adventurous fantasy book for kids, but one that takes kids seriously enough to give them a real book. It has long winded passages just describing nice countryside, but it still has the dragons and the goblins and wizards and battles and all of that shit. Just a great book. I loved LotR too, but in retrospect it just feels like Tolkiens dive into the mythos almost killed the fantasy genre. Everyone had to one up Tolkien and make an even more autistically realized fantasy world, but the cost of that is sucking out the whimsical bullshit that makes The Hobbit feel like a real adventure in mysterious, made up lands. Unironically almost the exact image of what made DragonBall a great show and what led DBZ down the path of becoming a near parody of absurd action anime at the same time it was the progenitor of much of what came later.", "time": 1675723521, "resto": 21624647}, {"no": 21625159, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)18:55:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21624736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21624736</a><br>Is this a good book?", "filename": "Img_6_0-book_reader_ReadEra", "ext": ".png", "w": 496, "h": 751, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675727730743422, "time": 1675727730, "md5": "RpyLC8dBzCJLy8wHiFmFBQ==", "fsize": 486125, "resto": 21624647}, {"no": 21625171, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)18:59:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21624647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21624647</a><br>I can always tell who hasn&#039;t read Tolkien based on this comment.
