However in actual metaphysics the normie can be considered engrossed in Kants empirical intuition, which is why she is adapted to the physical world. She is actually the lowest stage of human evolution. The next stage is the schizo, who is becoming engrossed in imaginal intuition and thus becomes lost in his confusion of the imaginal and the sensible. Next comes the autist who has been born with intellectual intuition and is higher or lower functioning in the sensible or physical world depending on how developed his intellectual intuitionis, with high functioning autists having a lesser developed intellectual intuition and low functiong autists having a more developed intellectual intuition culminating in the absolute retard who is so engrossed in intellectual intuition he has lost touch with physical reality. Thus as you see in the hierarchy of human being the absolute retard has the highest being and is closest to God while the normie has the lowest being and furthest from God. The normie is also known by the term of midwit.<br><br>I would like to add that autist, schizo and retard are normie terms developed by normies to understand nonnormies from within the normie metaphysic and therefore carry with them the negative connotations normies associate with these nonnormies. In actuality however these connotations are contingent overtones of the normie metaphysic which is a faulty metaphysic grounded on the lower empirical intuition as opposed to the higher intllectual intuition, giving direct knowledge of reality.

The whole point and purpose behind Plato’s explicit violation of this law was to restore the possibility that what is not also “in one sense” (kata ti) is and that what is also, “in a certain respect” (péz), is not. By violating Parmenides’ laws with his patricidal little “in one sense” and innocent-sounding “in a certain respect”, with his endless need to qualify, his constant ifs and buts, Plato was able to lay the ground for all the complicated theorizing of later western thought. At the same time, he also ended up walking straight down the path of “is but also is not” which the goddess in Parmenides’ poem had already mocked as being the quintessence of human futility&quot;<br><br>In one Platonic dialogue was a stranger from Velia. This was Parmenides&#039; home in Southern Italy. He then makes this stranger say &quot;We must kill father Parmenides&quot;. &quot;Deviously, insidiously, manipulatively, he insinuates himself into a role that isn’t his; inserts himself uninvited into an initiatory lineage he doesn&#039;t belong to; systematically sets about sabotaging it by destroying it from within.&quot; In Athens Patricide was a terrible offense against nature, against, your ancestors, so Plato had to make his stranger speak weasel words, hesitant, before stating his intent. <br><br>&quot;But behind all the veils of literature, fiction, hesitation, that act of killing father Parmenides was carried out. The murder was done, only to be repeated time after time by scholars whose sole purpose and comfort lie in the world created by that murder. And not many things in our culture are more important than to understand just what it is that Plato killed; how he killed it; why he killed it. <br>As the founder and father of his lineage in Velia, Parmenides had allowed himself to be taken on the most terrifying journey imaginable—straight down into the underworld, the bowels of all existence, to meet the queen of death.&quot;<br><br>--Peter Kingsley: Catafalque', 'time': 1670616154, 'resto': 21359245}, {'no': 21363496, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)15:42:24', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21359245"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21359245</a><br>- The dialogue isn&#039;t only about metaphysics. Politics looms large in the background. Pythodorus, the man present at the conversation who shared it with Plato&#039;s younger brother, was a general in the Peloponnesian War, discussed in Thucydides&#039; history, and he ended up banished, if I remember right. The young man Aristoteles who Parmenides speaks with for the whole second half is explicitly pointed out to have been a member of the Thirty, a Spartan installed Oligarchy at the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War that brutally killed people like Polemarchus and Niceratus (and possibly Cleitophon) who appear in the Republic. The dialogue takes place during the Great Panatheneia festival, celebrating the unity of Athens (a &quot;Many-One&quot; joke, but also serious thought if one analyzes cities or nations with the approach used in the second half of the dialogue).<br><br>- There may be some observation of the differences between philosophers and non-philosophers. Consider what the Republic says about the danger in teaching the young dialectic, and figure whether the dialogue is maybe inclining us to acknowledge this danger when the person subjected to dialectic becomes a tyrannic oligarch later in life. Also note the lack of understanding in non-philosophers. Aristoteles, Pythodorus, Antiphon, none of them become philosophers; Pythodorus thinks Parmenides and Zeno will become angry at Socrates, which is a misjudgement.<br><br>- Eros and Thumos (love and spiritedness) are in the background. Socrates thinks Zeno wrote because of eros for Parmenides, but Zeno admits he wrote more out of youthful love of victory (= thumos). Parmenides recites a poem about eros before he gives his demonstration.<br><br>- It&#039;s worth noting that Parmenides is part of three dialogues showing Socrates&#039; philosophical development. Phaedo shows him, around stephanus page 97 on, as beginning with natural philosophy, hearing about Anaxagoras, and becoming disenchanted with him and moving on to learn about the beings in spoken opinions that he hypothesizes over. Parmenides shows that last move. Symposium follows with Socrates as a young adult learning about eros and how it relates to philosophy.<br><br>- Note that Parmenides doesn&#039;t see the special importance of the One as later Platonists like Plotinus would. For him, he hypothesizes about the One *as an example of how to work out hypotheses of anything.* <br><br>- I can&#039;t emphasize this point enough, but really pay attention to how Parmenides describes doing hypotheses and try to work them out using the examples Socrates thinks about (a form of Same, Other, Man, Water, Hair, etc.). Everyone is quick to assert that there aren&#039;t any Forms of Hair, Mud, Dirt, etc., but overlook Parmenides&#039; warning not to assert there are no such forms without working out hypotheses of such.', 'time': 1670618544, 'resto': 21359245}, {'no': 21363514, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)15:48:27', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21363377"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21363377</a><br>Oh I see now, you literally just repeat Kingsley&#039;s opinions about Plato verbatim, don&#039;t you, Tweetophon?

This leads to the known idea of the idea of self-organization, the answer is in the question or the process of questioning. The novel also touches on the difficulties of knowledge, both with the relentless listing of possible combinations of alternatives and also through its description of the unreliability of recollection of past perception. It places itself deftly in the context of the various scientific and intellectual revolutions and confusions of its era.

73,21362062,,,12/09/22(Fri)08:15:20,Deep&amp;Edgy,,"&#039;In his 1986 article, &quot;Anti-Semitism and National Socialism&quot;, Postone developed new thinking on modern antisemitism, and particularly on National Socialist ideology. Postone saw antisemitism as a major element in the development of a socio-historical theory of consciousness determined by social forms that are subjected to socialization under capitalism. What is said about modern antisemitism may also describe a trend of vulgar anti-capitalism that seeks the personification of the elements of capitalism that are so hated. Postone showed that modern antisemitism is very different from most forms of racism and Christian antisemitism; it differs from them because it casts a huge global invisible power of international Jewry, the idea of a global conspiracy that is intrinsic to modern antisemitism.<br><br>Postone analyzed antisemitism against the Marxian notion of the dual character of the commodity category. And he observed that the characteristics that antisemitism attributes to Jews are the same as for value: abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination. Postone argued that the form of socialization under capitalism (the historically specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism) makes it possible to separate the concrete (as socially &quot;natural&quot; sound, true, etc.) and the abstract (as socially constructed, historically specific and contingent). This opposition between the concrete and the abstract, determined by social forms, pervades all forms of subjectivity, and thus helps to understand a central feature of the National Socialist ideology, because this ideology was not fundamentally anti-modern and it would be wrong to label it as such. It is true, Postone argued, that Nazism claimed to defend the peasantry and craftsmanship, but it also valued modern technological and industrial production. Nazism was rather a vulgar form of anti-capitalism. The rejection of the bourgeoisie and its values is present in Nazism, but Postone saw Nazi ideology as the affirmation of the concrete dimension of capitalism - which includes technology and industrial production, as well as the peasantry and manual labour - as the heart of a healthy, organic social life. This stood in contrast with the abstract dimension represented by finance capital. The abstract is instead rejected - and it is personified by the Jews. Postone analyzed the figure of the Jew in modern antisemitism as the embodiment of abstract value, and extermination camps as a misbegotten notion of a &quot;factory&quot; to destroy value.&#039;<br><br>What do you guys think of this?",1651321392615,.jpg,251,260,241,250,1670591720896088,1670591720,qsvdRKD/+hdnGV1zGF1WFA==,5614,0,,in-his-1986-article-antisemitism-and-national,1,8,0,3.0,0.0,"[{'no': 21363509, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)15:47:11', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'This is atleast much better than other definitions of fascism and nazism like Umberto Eco and other marxist tards who just hinge the analysis on buzzwords and &quot;I don&#039;t like that&quot;', 'time': 1670618831, 'resto': 21362062}, {'no': 21364204, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)19:10:38', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21362062"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21362062</a><br>hey d&amp;e, how&#039;s it going', 'time': 1670631038, 'resto': 21362062}, {'no': 21364224, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)19:16:20', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21362062"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21362062</a><br>Sounds like what Bordiga said, which may or may not be construed as Holocaust denial.', 'time': 1670631380, 'resto': 21362062}, {'no': 21364270, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)19:29:18', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21364224"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21364224</a><br>If you mean the article on the holocaust, &quot;Bordiga&quot; (actually a Jewish guy wrote the Auschwitz or the Great Alibi article) didn&#039;t argue anything ideological, he essentially just argued the holocaust was economically pragmatic given war time conditions.<br>If you mean his general theory of fascism, I don&#039;t remember.

Active in the wake of the French Revolution as a dissenting pamphleteer and lay preacher, he inspired a brilliant generation of writers and attracted the patronage of progressive men of the rising middle class. As William Wordsworth’s collaborator and constant companion in the formative period of their careers as poets, Coleridge participated in the sea change in English verse associated with Lyrical Ballads (1798). His poems of this period, speculative, meditative, and strangely oracular, put off early readers but survived the doubts of Wordsworth and Robert Southey to become recognized classics of the romantic idiom.</span><br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;Coleridge renounced poetic vocation in his thirtieth year and set out to define and defend the art as a practicing critic. His promotion of Wordsworth’s verse, a landmark of English literary response, proceeded in tandem with a general investigation of epistemology and metaphysics. Coleridge was preeminently responsible for importing the new German critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich von Schelling; his associated discussion of imagination remains a fixture of institutional criticism while his occasional notations on language proved seminal for the foundation and development of Cambridge English in the 1920s. In his distinction between culture and civilization Coleridge supplied means for a critique of the utilitarian state, which has been continued in our own time.

The morality of compassion is predicated on the power of compassion to temporarily pierce the veil of individuality and gain access to the metaphysical truth of the interconnectedness of all life as manifestations of the Will. When Schopenhauer says that the goodness of the heart is so pure that it seems to expand to fill the entire world, he isn&#039;t just speaking in elegant metaphors, likewise with his statement that the beauty of nature seems to want to be contemplated (a point, he notes, made before by St. Augustine). Granted, you can luxuriate in his excellent prose on this level, but knowing that this is grounded in a specific metaphysical system is more rewarding and perhaps more importantly, what Schop expects his readers to do. Reading a basic primer on Kant and knowing what a Platonic form is will enable you to develop a deeper understanding of Schopenhauer&#039;s total project, a project he considered to have essentially solved all philosophical questions. It&#039;s not even essential to read a book - just read the Stanford Encyclopedia on Kant, and you&#039;ll have a much better idea of what Schop means by &#039;the fourfold root&#039; and the Will as the noumenon behind representation.', 'time': 1670593699, 'resto': 21356754}, {'no': 21363315, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)14:49:31', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21357045"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21357045</a><br>I like when her worldview gets BTFO&#039;d by Berkeley and she can&#039;t cope.', 'time': 1670615371, 'resto': 21356754}, {'no': 21363361, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)14:58:58', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21356754"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21356754</a><br>Try reading Hegel', 'time': 1670615938, 'resto': 21356754}, {'no': 21364012, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)18:24:26', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21356754"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21356754</a><br>Quality over quantity.

But the Eastern suggestions are that suffering is a misunderstanding of the way things really are, or what&#039;s really here, when the mind is not neurotically and compulsively trying to grasp, know, understand, and control experience. Greatness, overcoming, and life-affirmation as per Nietzsche&#039;s suggestion can still then be achieved, with the drive of a sufferer, and perhaps with much pain and difficulty, but without suffering.<br>I think there was more to Buddhism and Vedanta for N than he realized. He seemed to agree at least intellectually that the usual sense of self is an illusion, that there&#039;s no discrete self in the body or mind. The awakened pure unconditional life-affirming joy and amor fati in the face of the tragedy of mere existence is to me what he seemed to be after. Awakening doesn&#039;t require one to be a monk, ascetic, mendicant, to renounce the world, nor to follow certain ethics and morality or beliefs, it only seems this way because of the historical cultural contexts and due to misunderstanding what &quot;nirvana&quot; is. There were several other points N seemed to be in agreement on too. Speaking of points, I forgot what mine was, but maybe this gives you something to look into.<br><br><a href=""#p21362863"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21362863</a><br>It&#039;s about having such a strong will and powerful spirit that you desire suffering in order to overcome it again and again, while denying both the will to nothingness/oblivion/death and eternal life in an better ideal world. The thought of repeating any suffering for eternity would for most people be unbearable suffering upon suffering, but to love that idea is for Nietzsche the ultimate affirmation of life. Yes for most people it would suck regardless, but Nietzsche wasn&#039;t writing for most people.

It means that what you may will, you will to the nth degree. What&#039;s important to note is that the eternal return cannot be reduced to mere physical substance, and a mechanistic materialism. There is always something beyond the actual. Nietzsche makes it clear that the future must remain open to us, in order to pursue aesthetic truth. It isn&#039;t a multiplication of states of being, but a repetition of intensities of becomings. And this is obvious to us when we critically approach philosophy of time. To think that eternal return is just a multiplicitation of states of being, works off of both teleological and mechanistic presumptions about casuality and time which are not necessarily true. Nietzsche rejects both free and unfree will. Both commit the same fundamental error. But for Nietzsche, being qua being is becoming, so on the face of it this conception of eternal return and amor fati is already deprived of its most beautiful aspects and reduces it to fast food existentialism.', 'filename': '1670254844807514', 'ext': '.gif', 'w': 500, 'h': 309, 'tn_w': 125, 'tn_h': 77, 'tim': 1670619992057226, 'time': 1670619992, 'md5': 'jh+81myeczDXMMWU0UGowA==', 'fsize': 1001300, 'resto': 21362798}, {'no': 21363602, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)16:14:42', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'This untermensch would be about last person in the whole world who should advice anyone on how to live their life.

According to another report, the neophyte, to put his impassibility to the trial, was made to take part in the simulated killing of a man. And the story goes that Emperor Commodus, who wished to become an initiate, aroused the indignation of his milieu by taking that simulated killing seriously, thereby causing the death of a man. It may be that all this - that a qualification of the kind - could have relation to the symbol of the “generating stone,” that is, to one of the conditions of the initiatory rebirth. </span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;However, the qualities just mentioned appear to be required for the successive developments of the myth of Mithras, as Mithras must withstand a furious wind which immediately assails him and which flagellates his naked body; but he goes directly toward a tree, he makes a garment of its leaves and he feeds of its fruits. Given the initiatory meaning of the tree, here one might think of the tree whereupon Adam wished to put his hand to become “similar to one of us” (to a god), but from which he is barred by the Jehovah of the Old Testament.</span><br><br>Join our server if you are interested in Tradition, Religion, Metaphysics, etc.<br>https://discord.gg/XcMrcfXG",FB_IMG_1670092410709,.jpg,729,547,250,187,1670579503514053,1670579503,OidghKB1jqg/J81CBFbSgg==,36222,0,,in-fact-from-ancient-reports-especially-those,1,3,0,,,"[{'no': 21361876, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)06:57:21', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21361710"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21361710</a><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Discord</span><br>Fuck off groomer', 'time': 1670587041, 'resto': 21361710}, {'no': 21362382, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)10:14:30', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': 'Any women on the discord?', 'time': 1670598870, 'resto': 21361710}, {'no': 21363502, 'now': '12/09/22(Fri)15:44:23', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21361710"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21361710</a><br>Why are you disgracing Evola with gay anime?

Yet in spite of this the maiden was so comely and attractive that she should have learned Love&#039;s lessons, had she been pleased to hear them. But she refused to pay them any mind.

Only with great difficulty could she avoid looking at Alexander; but she had to be constantly on her guard against her brother, my lord Gawain. She paid dearly for her great haughtiness and scorn.
