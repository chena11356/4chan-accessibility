Only the stupidest ones blindly hypostasize nationality as if it&#039;s a self-evident category, in fact that is more a function of 18th-19th century liberal republicanism, which based its concept of nationality on social contract theory and was concerned with balance of power politics in Europe, and had to find ways to make the old dying monarchies and countries made up of outmoded feudal ties into proper stable republics. <br><br>True modern nationalism basically comes down to volkisch thinking, which is not even &quot;national,&quot; just ethnic, and subordinates the state to the organic Volk. If you want a good overview of that, Evola does a good job of it in his Notes on the Third Reich. Evola believed basically what you believe, and criticized the Third Reich for having a self-sufficient Volk concept but no higher ideal to channel it into. Evola&#039;s ideal for Europe was a pan-European imperial space based on the larger European culture, which is itself based on attunement toward the transcendent. Within that structure, he wanted a kind of quasi-socialist corporative order in which nations could manage their own affairs, and within nations regions and locales could manage theirs. There&#039;s a great little booklet by T.S. Eliot called Notes on Culture or something like that, in which he expresses basically the same views. Both Eliot and Evola want to protect things like &quot;how the Scots in Southern Scotland are just different from the Scots in Northern Scotland, somehow, and it comes out in their poetry, you can just feel it&quot; from being bulldozed by any totalitarianism, whether that totalitarianism was Bolshevik, capitalist, or nationalist. <br><br>But the power of the Volk can&#039;t be denied either, nor can its rights to assert itself. It just can&#039;t be elevated to a self-sufficient self-justifying principle. <br><br>The view you espouse is very similar to Evola&#039;s. Your king would be his emperor. The natural form of the monarchy isn&#039;t individual kingdoms or republics, you&#039;re right, it&#039;s the larger cultural space, like Europe, which is also similar to Schmitt&#039;s thinking about the Nomos.", "time": 1668624018, "resto": 21255497}, {"no": 21265094, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:06:33", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "IMG_20221116_220533", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 895, "h": 647, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 90, "tim": 1668629193213074, "time": 1668629193, "md5": "5xF/8Mlgp8rNJnkCAFvv8Q==", "fsize": 182337, "resto": 21255497}, {"no": 21265109, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:09:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21265094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21265094</a><br>Someone burned down the hedge maze to catch him, so he needed a new place to hide when people ask him", "filename": "solzh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1276, "h": 790, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 77, "tim": 1668629385992689, "time": 1668629385, "md5": "iOEix6e4Vwo4t6oXaIT+SQ==", "fsize": 237366, "resto": 21255497}, {"no": 21265203, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)15:28:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21255503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21255503</a><br>No", "time": 1668630515, "resto": 21255497}], "last_modified": 1668630515}]}, {"page": 4, "threads": [{"no": 21264739, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)13:32:14", "name": "rosecrossfaded hyperion", "com": "Do stack threads not go off anymore on this website lol?

Stephen Spender, the poet perceptively wrote to Scannell in a letter in 1953: &quot;you write good poetry and that is all that matters.&quot; Seamus Heaney in a letter to Andrew Taylor said he admired Scannell&#039;s poems &quot;not only for their sturdy metrical pace and structure, but for their combination of mordancy and a sense of mortality&quot;. John Carey, the critic commented: &quot;Scannell nearly always works on two levels, one realistic and external, the other imaginative, metaphorical, haunted by memory and desire. A master of the dramatic monologue, his work is drenched in humanity. It resounds with memories.&quot; Scannell also wrote the verse narration for BBC Television film A House that Died.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He also received a special award from the Wilfred Owen Association &quot;in recognition of his contribution to war poetry&quot;. Scannell&#039;s best-known book of war poetry is Walking Wounded (1965). The title poem recollects a column of men returning from battle: &quot;No one was suffering from a lethal hurt, They were not magnified by noble wounds, There was no splendour in that company.&quot;</span>", "filename": "Vernon Scannell", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 360, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668603564924357, "time": 1668603564, "md5": "xiKeGB4C6mnOkyQrlw+3OA==", "fsize": 34482, "resto": 21263865}, {"no": 21263893, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)08:12:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I like it.

Reigns in which citizens died in their sleep do not figure in history, nor the wise prince, inveterately scorned by his subjects; the crowd loves the fictive, even at its expense, the scandal of behavior constituting the web of human curiosity and the underground current of every event. The unfaithful woman and the cuckold provide comedy and tragedy, even the epic, the quasi-totality of their motifs. Since virtue has neither biography nor charm, from the Iliad to vaudeville, only the luster of dishonor has entertained and intrigued. Hence it is quite natural that humanity should have offered itself up to the conquerors, that it should seek to be trampled underfoot, that a nation without tyrants should never be talked about, that the sum of iniquities a people commits should be the sole index of its presence and of its vitality.

It was extremely formalized during the time of Hellenism to the point of being stultifying. But it also force-fed every capable student a diet of common &quot;topoi&quot; and modes and styles of reasoning and arguing that functioned as a lingua franca for the whole Mediterranean for arguably a thousand years, since classical grammar and rhetoric education was still just barely active even in the early medieval period in Italy. <br><br>If you really want to create an aristocratic citizenry, just go back to the 19th century European ideal of gymnasium and lycee, where it was normal to acquire 1-3 languages plus Greek and Latin, and know basic history and having most of the major reference points of canonical European literature in your brain. <br><br>As with most things the problem of modernity is the assumption, ingrained through propaganda and as a deliberate tactic of stultification, that the masses can&#039;t be educated or raised to a high moral standard by the state. The fascist and communist regimes proved the opposite with their work programs and education programs. Just teach people their own history, the history of Europe, give them major reference points like knowledge of classical antiquity to create a common culture, and teach them languages and probably mathematics above all, and you will fix 90% of modern problems and create a pan-European aristocracy that could easily conquer and govern the world again. Also, it will prevent most wars, as it will re-constitute an international class of cultured literati who all speak common languages, both in the literal and the extended cultural sense due to their reference points and sense of sharing in the heritages of Greece, Rome, and Christendom. <br><br>Fundamentally, states can exist in two forms: demotic or aristocratic. A demotic state is a state of aggregated individuals who have legal citizenship but not much else in common. This sort of state inevitably degrades into oligarchy, as one pressure group or another, by the &quot;iron law&quot; of Mosca and Pareto, comes to dominate the chaos of the system and impose a steady state on it. The other possibility, aristocracy, arises when you have a general hierarchical or pyramidal formation in which the masses are given every opportunity to become qualified, and the qualified rise to the top of governance. Aristocracy literally means the regime in which &quot;the best (aristoi) have power (kratos).&quot; <br><br>No matter what a state&#039;s legal or &quot;structural&quot; constitution is, fundamentally it is either demotic-oligarchic or aristocratic. And a true aristocracy can run a demotic-oligarchic &quot;structure&quot; aristocratically, just as a demotic-oligarchy can run an aristocratic structure with no real aristocrats into the ground in a single generation. <br><br>Good things to read if you are interested in this question are Jaeger&#039;s Paideia and Coomaraswamy&#039;s Bugbear of Literacy.", "time": 1668618914, "resto": 21264452}, {"no": 21264910, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:17:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21264452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21264452</a><br>Most of the standards taught were written by people who raped little boys.", "time": 1668626232, "resto": 21264452}, {"no": 21265056, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)14:56:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21264910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21264910</a><br>I can almost smell the projection", "time": 1668628593, "resto": 21264452}], "last_modified": 1668628593}, {"no": 21258844, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)00:23:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What is lit reading right now?

Hopeless at school. Incapable either of competing or co-operating.

But Adolf was sexually backward. Other boys made advances to girls, and the girls responded. Adolf was too shy, too uncertain of his manhood. And all the time incapable of steady work, at home only in the compensatory Other World of his fancy. There, at the very least, he was Michelangelo. Here, unfortunately, he couldn&#039;t draw. His only gifts were hatred, low cunning, a set of indefatigable vocal cords and a talent for nonstop talking at the top of his voice from the depths of his Peter-Panic paranoia. Thirty or forty million deaths and heaven knows how many billions of dollars\u2014that was the price the world had to pay for little Adolf&#039;s retarded maturation.</span><br><br>...Was Hitler a sperg?

After Schelling had given the world the title of God, Hegel took this literally and ascribed the world with omniscience, and since the world is god, the dialectical self-movement of abstract concepts (thoughts) was God trying to know itself and all the mysteries of the world; anyone not fooled into conflating obscure jargon filled prolixity of Hegel with that of profundity would know how stupid this idea is.

Does nobodoy watch him beyond the 3 minute clips which end up on TikTok?<br><br>Anyway, I like reading Buddhist Sutras, but I am not a fan of Buddhism in general. At the end of the day there is one massive decision one has to take, is the material world benevolent or not. Interestingly you can take both positions in Christianity, &quot;Christians&quot; who think the natural world is malevolent are precisely Gnostics. Buddhists however have no two ways around Samsara, pretty much every Buddhist thinks the natural world is malevolent and needs to be ascended through the Dharma (although ascension is the wrong word because ascending or descending into angel or demon form will still entrap you into Samsara, you need to leave Samsara sideways to reach Nirvana, which is easiest from the position of a human) <br><br>I personally love the natural world. I think it is God&#039;s creation. Hell, I love it so much I used to dabble with Pantheism/pseudo-paganism like John Keats because there is so much beauty in the world, although I have heard an interesting orthodox argument that that beauty is a fragment of the creator present in all of creation, as the divine creator is not seperate from his creation after the fact, and as such reality is shimmering with the presence of God. Loving the natural world pretty much disqualifies all philosophies and religions which try to transcend the material world for me.<br><br>Although while it seems silly at first I am not against judging religions or philosophies by the quality of their thinkers in theory. To quote Jordan Peterson from that talk with the Muslims: The best form of evangelisation is becoming a bonfire for Religion, so that others convert to your way out of respect. If the Buddhist thinkers impress you so become a Buddhist, although almost every religion has some impressively smart men advocating for it. For me buddhism is nothing because of it&#039;s inherent disdain for the natural world and existance itself.<br><br>Tl:DR: Nietsche is right, Buddhism is nihilistic, Nihilism is gay, saying it is not nihilisitic is cope", "filename": "Samsara", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668616939715150, "time": 1668616939, "md5": "Mbec+DSfUs3STzLxyDoypw==", "fsize": 64048, "resto": 21252965}, {"no": 21264454, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:00:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21264397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21264397</a><br>Thank you for your effort again.<br>I think reading Buddhism as thinking of reality as malevolent is a misreading.

That is part of the romantic theory of art, and also later &quot;situationist&quot; theories, of radical (re)appropriation of the medium by imposing form on it. But this is still rare, and sometimes the best you can get from this dynamic is something that wavers between being &quot;merely entertainment&quot; and real art, or only has moments of real art in it. Worse I think is stuff like Cyberpunk 2077 or whatever that game was called, where there is nothing being said, the actual raison d&#039;etre of Gibsonian cyberpunk is long dead, and all you&#039;re selling is a kind of vacation to kitschified Blade Runner-Land, like a smoothie made of the tropes and imagery but with no inner form of reason.", "time": 1668618080, "resto": 21263527}, {"no": 21264480, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)12:06:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21264382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21264382</a><br>alas, what truth is there, other than our own ignorance, fren ?

The physical organization, its decay, the indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief. These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes. But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.<br><br>\u2014 Leo Tolstoy, &#039;Anna Karenina&#039;<br><br><br>By the time Seymour was in mid-adolescence \u2014 sixteen, seventeen \u2014 he not only had learned to control his native vernacular, his many, many less than \u00e9lite New York speech mannerisms, but had by then already come into his own true, bull&#039;s-eye, poet&#039;s vocabulary.

Compounding, composition or nominal composition is the process of word formation that creates compound lexemes. Compounding occurs when two or more words or signs are joined to make a longer word or sign. A compound that uses a space rather than a hyphen or concatenation is called an open compound or a spaced compound; the alternative is a closed compound.<br><br>The meaning of the compound may be similar to or different from the meaning of its components in isolation. The component stems of a compound may be of the same part of speech\u2014as in the case of the English word footpath, composed of the two nouns foot and path\u2014or they may belong to different parts of speech, as in the case of the English word blackbird, composed of the adjective black and the noun bird. With very few exceptions, English compound words are stressed on their first component stem.<br><br>As a member of the Germanic family of languages, English is unusual in that even simple compounds made since the 18th century tend to be written in separate parts. This would be an error in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, and Dutch. However, this is merely an orthographic convention: As in other Germanic languages, arbitrary noun phrases, for example &quot;girl scout troop&quot;, &quot;city council member&quot;, and &quot;cellar door&quot;, can be made up on the spot and used as compound nouns in English too.<br><br>The process occurs readily in all Germanic languages for different reasons. Words can be concatenated both to mean the same as the sum of two words (e.g. German: Pressekonferenz, lit.&#039;press conference&#039;) or where an adjective and noun are compounded (e.g. Danish: hvidvinsglas, lit.&#039;white wine glass&#039;). This can create a plethora of large, but valid words in these languages, by compounding compound words with several more.<br><br>The addition of affix morphemes to words (such as suffixes or prefixes, as in employ employment) should not be confused with nominal composition, as this is actually morphological derivation.", "time": 1668607807, "resto": 21263992}, {"no": 21264004, "now": "11/16/22(Wed)09:13:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21263999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21263999</a><br>Kool!
