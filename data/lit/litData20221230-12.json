I wish I could rec you the one I read but it isnt translated into english. If you get a very basic grasp about what the general ideas of SoL are and what kind of logic Hegel wanted to establish, PoS because x100 clearer. Its still hard, but just about how hard is to read Kant. I actually find Kant harder.<br>afaik in SoL Hegel (and this comes up in a similar way in the prologue of PoS) wants to establish a logic of how concrete, real world and things inside it become what they are. For this, this logic must take in count the movement of real things, their function, without which they arent what they are (an activity thats the Essence which is a movement of pure negativity, I will go back to this later). A dead cat isnt a cat for Hegel. This doesnt mean Hegel thinks formal logic is le bad or false, it just serves a different goal, aka thinking in valid reasoning about all this (I guess?, not sure what his position is here). He just wants a logic that explains how the real concrete and historical world becomes real, why and how it becomes real, so that the real world that its in constant movement (and our existence in it) actually has its own internal logic. <br>This means that the object of the concept in a silogism or reasoning, to explain why real things come to be, must be understood now as a real subject and not only as a substance, and never as just as an abstract concept. So even something as a rock is in the movement of a subject, its concept (or just part of The Concept) since the concept of something real is its movement. This sounds weird. <br>The concept is essential for &quot;being&quot; to stop being pure abstract indetermination and become something concrete thats real, with an identity. Why is the concept movement (as in the movement of the real world?). Think about it like this: if you want to think to separate things, you dont need to think any necessary relationship between the two. I can think of a cat and a star without needing to think one before the other to understand what each one is. But, if you want to think ONE thing, you need to think another one, if you dont you stay in indetermination. If I want to think about a cat, I need to think about fur and pointy ears in something thats alive (to think a dead cat, it has to be something that was alive). By thinking all these things you have come to its genre, species and specific difference, aka its concept. And its not just thinking at least two things whats necessary, you need the &quot;movement&quot; that links the two, a movement thats &quot;pure negativity&quot;.

Jung was always interested in the relationship of psychology to the hard sciences. There are correlations which will inevitably become apparent, but which may never have without the work of Jungian typists, and there are even specialized psychologists who legitimately apply treatment under consideration of a Myers-Briggs type.

There are a lot of &quot;logical&quot; systems, that scientific attitudes will put a lot of stock in, but the success in the application of these systems is largely to do with them having a secure and self-consistent structure, often reducing to a tautology.

I thought it was a fascinating phenomenon that mainly gets shit on on account of the incapacity of regular people to understand anything in the world except insofar as they can fit it in a socially sanctioned box - if it doesn&#039;t go in the a box, then it&#039;s wrong!<br><br>No, MBTI is not a scientific theory.

To begin, we must identify who, exactly, the McCarthy fan is. Though their background may vary, McCarthy fans tend to have something in common: they read McCarthy with an annoying level of reverence, often hailing everything he has written \u2014 including the so-called &quot;flawed&quot; works \u2014 as a perfect masterpiece of literature. They quote passages from his works in everyday conversation, and are quick to criticize other authors for not meeting the McCarthy standard.<br><br>Yes, the McCarthy fan can be relentless in their devotion to his body of work. But, let&#039;s be honest, it&#039;s easy for these clueless fans to be swept up in McCarthy&#039;s grandiose, heart-wrenching tales. After all, many of his works lack basic literary elements, such as plot or character development, or any real resolution or themes. Though McCarthy does portray the horrors of war and violence in a grandiose style that is certainly laudable, his fans seem to overlook these gaping holes and shower him with adoration instead. <br><br>That&#039;s not to mention the McCarthy fans&#039; rather intense obsession with McCarthy himself \u2014 or, more accurately, the hype created around him by critics and other McCarthy fans. This hype has elevated him to cult status, with fans often claiming that no other author could ever compare to him. This has led to the rise of what I call the &quot;McCarthy Mafia,&quot; wherein McCarthy&#039;s biggest fans gather online to share their thoughts and opinions on every last word that comes from the great one. It&#039;s become tragically uncool to express any opinion on McCarthy that doesn&#039;t involve loads of praise and reverence. <br><br>Indeed, being a McCarthy fan has almost become a religion of sorts. There are even McCarthy fan conventions where these devoted followers can gather to admire and communicate their fandom. What an uncomfortable, yet fascinating, experience that must be!<br><br>And last, but not least, there is the McCarthy fan&#039;s annoying habit of assuming their taste in literature is the only valid one \u2013 and that everyone who doesn&#039;t agree is wrong. Well, here I am to say that it&#039;s okay to pick and choose which literature is better today. If you don&#039;t think McCarthy is the best author out there, that&#039;s totally fine. After all, there is more to life than being a McCarthy fan. <br><br>So, to all of you out there who are endlessly devoted to Cormac McCarthy and his works, this one is for you!", "filename": "OB-ZG115_Counse_G_20131010200800", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 553, "h": 369, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1672360654324958, "time": 1672360654, "md5": "xSxgtRZE/axPAhs8jgbR6g==", "fsize": 57322, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ah-yes-cormac-mccarthy-fans-what-can-one-say-that", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 16, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 17}, {"no": 21451289, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:44:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451249</a><br>Stop posting /tv/core authors.", "time": 1672361042, "resto": 21451249}, {"no": 21451293, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:44:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451289</a><br>gtfo tranny", "time": 1672361088, "resto": 21451249}, {"no": 21451301, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:45:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pbbbbbbtttthhhhhhhhh", "time": 1672361159, "resto": 21451249}, {"no": 21451458, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)20:21:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451249</a><br>Never heard of him.

Meanwhile, the abuse and maltreatment of Blacks has been going on and on and on for hundreds of years. <br><br>Now, don&#039;t think me dissatisfied completely. The people in this thread have had a triggering effect, so my views may be somewhat misrepresented. I am decently satisfied with what progress has been made overall, and consider at least some of what we&#039;re experiencing societally as the natural growing pains of various factors involved in our getting used to the changes which have taken place. Still, I view the overcompensations and indulgences (particularly the criminal indulgences) as counterproductive (that said, the people in this thread are precisely the sort to blame for it, as they are its justification, so it serves them right), and, ultimately, I view all of it as being perpetuated by and subservient to the global elite&#039;s ends - which, while predominantly leftist, is actually both on the right and left. <br><br>Anyway, my point was really a simple one. That while treating Blacks like royalty, whether deserved or not is a new phenomenon, racism against Blacks is not, and though our mistreatment overall is probably at all-time lows, it should not be forgotten that the only reason the pendulum is swinging so far to the side of pampering is how absolutely underprivileged Blacks were forcibly made to be.

I don&#039;t see anywhere close in my future where I could possible get what I really want from society, namely a nice gf who&#039;s thin, not a whore, can cook me food. I can cook myself, I&#039;ve taught myself over the years, but it would be nice if I could meet a woman who knows how to herself so she can cook for me since I can make enough money to pay for her as a stay at home mom. If I can&#039;t find that then what the fuck is the point? Why should I work? I hate it, I&#039;m tired of it, I have no motivation for it. I make fucking 6 figure per year and for what? Where is my housewife and my family faggot? That&#039;s all I want and I can&#039;t find it! Do you know how frustrating that is? I did everything right! If your society won&#039;t give me what I want then I&#039;ll go support the people talking about the society I want. I don&#039;t care if they&#039;re incels or whatever I&#039;ll work with whoever and I&#039;ll make their organization as efficient as possible because that&#039;s what I do as a profession.

It&#039;s PVP not story mode and you&#039;re getting your ass kicked. Also you&#039;re on /lit/, I assume you&#039;re well read and therefore should know that the vast majority of women have always been whores and men have done everything in their power to hold back the ocean of whorey-ness with varying degrees of success (up until the last 60 years I suppose). Western society has eliminated those constrictions and we are now experiencing the full force of unbidden female nature. There is no longer anything external in place to funnel non-fat virgins into early marriages. Not to get all chud-cel but it&#039;s unironically over, the genie&#039;s not going back in the bottle while any of us are alive. That said, you can still succeed but you absolutely must adapt to the new game. Finding a western woman of the archetype you&#039;re seeking is a one in a million prospect. Odds that low mean you don&#039;t just need to tick all the boxes, you also need to be in the right time at the right place AND be better than all her other available options. What do you think your chances are vs the quarterback of her high school football team? Once again, if you&#039;re going to play their game it&#039;s over. The only way for the likes of us chanmen is to short circuit the system somehow. I&#039;ve had some great success with really out of the box strategies. I&#039;m 40 now though and looking for a wife. I&#039;ll be marrying a poor farm girl in the third world but an idea I had toyed with was teaching - not like an actual school teacher, just teaching one of my areas of expertise, either small classes or one on one tutoring.

I had my fair share without being chad. Like I said, I had to think outside of the box and find ways to succeed in spite of the system. I had a 4 year relationship in my 20s and a 4 year relationship in my 30s plus maybe half a dozen other &lt;1yr relationships. I never quite found my perfect match but I had happy relationships and in fact my girlfriend in my 20s left me because I refused to marry her. I&#039;m just shifting gears now because of course as an older man you can&#039;t meet girls the same way and in the same volume as you did when you were young. I&#039;m excited to find myself a girl from another century in the third world and I&#039;m happy with my memories of the girls I got to be with. But definitely time for me to start a family in the next few years. I&#039;ll be staying in Asia. <br><br>I say the same thing in every incel thread but the real redpill on women is it&#039;s not about your stats, it&#039;s about prolonged exposure aka propinquity and access. Most of us simply can&#039;t become ingroup enough with people we&#039;ve just met, even if it goes straight to dating and fucking. You just don&#039;t value or feel invested enough in people you only just met. Don&#039;t get me wrong, obviously it does happen, but it&#039;s a very delicate thing, easy to break. Obviously the opposite is propinquity as I said. So the answer isn&#039;t to go to bars or get better photos on dating apps or even to go to where girls are. It&#039;s to be part of a group or organisation of some kind that forces you to work together with girls. And if you want to guarantee your success, be in a position of authority in the group/have higher status than them, i.e. the leader of a church youth group or the organiser of church events. I emphasise church because religion is the last external pressure that funnels women into early marriage and non-whoredom. <br><br>Again bro, get creative. Google &quot;Jane Austen larp&quot; and you&#039;ll be stunned how popular that sort of thing is. Doesn&#039;t have to be church, you just need to get yourself somewhere you&#039;re working in a group with girls. From there, girlfriending is inevitable.

In the East the Mogul prince Dara Shikoh wrote the Confluence of the Two Seas, stressing the meeting between Sufism and early Hindu mysticism. The Rosicrucians in the West adopted almost literally the teaching of the Spanish illuminist Sufis in claiming an unbroken succession of inner teaching, in which they included \u2018Hermes.\u2019 ... Count Michael Maier in 1617 wrote Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecimal Nationum (Contributions of Twelve Nations to the Golden Table), in which he showed that the Sufic tradition of a succession of teachers was still being maintained. Among the alchemical teachers were several whom the Sufis also recognize, including Westerners who had studied Saracen lore. They are: Hermes of Egypt, Mary the Hebrew, Democritus of Greece, Morienus of Rome, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) of Arabia, Albertus Magnus of Germany, Arnold of Villaneuve of France, Thomas Aquinas of Italy, Raymond Lully of Spain, Roger Bacon of England, Melchior Cibiensis of Hungary, and Anonymus Sarmata (Michael Sendivogius) of Poland. All Western alchemy, of course, is attributed by tradition to Geber (Jabir Ibn el-Hayyan) the Sufi.\u201d<br><br>The text we were extracting then continues thus:]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sufi mysticism differs tremendously from other cults claiming to be mystical. Formal religion is for the Sufi merely a shell, though a genuine one, which fulfills a function. When the human consciousness has penetrated beyond this social framework, the Sufi understands the real meaning of religion. The mystics of other persuasions do not think in this manner at all. They may transcend outer religious forms, but they do not emphasize the fact that outer religion is only a prelude to special experience. Most ecstatics remain attached to a rapturous symbolization of some concept derived from their religion. The Sufi uses religion and psychology to pass beyond all this. Having done so, he \u201creturns to the world,\u201d to guide others on their way.</span>", "filename": "A5E4AA5F-8617-4FC7-A1B6-5D5DCF9B60B9", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1132, "h": 980, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 108, "tim": 1672250928012424, "time": 1672250928, "md5": "8UayT2m6B3nH/Nk5rH8dew==", "fsize": 514719, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445043, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)14:02:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444856</a><br>A note about the bee/flower/honey analogy (one which also turns up sometimes in Sufi folk tales and teaching stories, if not identically then in a similar form): the Sufi here is the bee.

Hence, a Sufic core that could be found in Judaism, a Sufic core in Christianity, in Hinduism, and so forth. As the Qur\u2019an says, \u201cEvery nation had a Warner.\u201d Muhammad is not considered as someone bringing an entirely new revelation, never before heard of, but rather as someone who received revelation from the same God of Moses and Jesus, and various other patriarchs and prophets, and was reaffirming and more completely and perfectly expressing this timeless revelation in the form of the Qur\u2019an.<br><br>In keeping with the Traditionalists\u2019 assertion of the decay of many religions from their authentic roots, and the progressive veiling of the esoteric truths of religion by exoterism propagated for the masses, Sufism, likewise, holds that traditions like Judaism and Christianity are increasingly \u201cdead\u201d or defunct religions, corrupted relics of former authentic revelations, even if there is some wisdom or truth to be found in them in an often indirect, scattered, degraded form. <br><br>Fascinatingly enough, much of the Western esoteric movement and secret societies which fascinate us (the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, Masonry, the Kabbalah) can plausibly be tied to Sufic influence as well. Paradoxically, it was the Crusades which set up conditions for interactions between the Islamic world and Europe, and some (somewhat fantastical) conceptions of Sufism hold it as a \u201cbenevolent secret society\u201d which made veiled inroads into the West for centuries to spread what they regarded as a higher, Sufic influence which could regenerate the West\u2019s culture and restore the lost Sufi heart to Christianity.<br><br>The Rosicrucian Michael Maier (1568 - 1622) includes the Arabic world as one of the sources of the Rosicrucians\u2019 wisdom: \u201cOur origins are Egyptian, Brahminic, derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs,\u201d and the legendary founder of the Rosicrucian Order, Christian Rosenkreuz, is held to have traveled to and learned from \u201cwise men in Arabia,\u201d besides other places.

And, of course, Ibn Gabirol, the Jewish follower of the Arab Sufi, exercised an immense and widely recognized influence upon Western thought. God is called by the Jewish teacher Azriel in his system of the Cabala EN SOF, the absolutely infinite, and it was he who undertook to explain the Cabala to philosophers after its appearance in Europe ...</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This Sufi tradition is underlined by the Jewish Encyclopedia, which says, \u201cTo the spread of Sufism in the eighth century was probably due the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muhammadan countries at that period. Under the direct influence of the Sufis arose the Jewish sect called Yudghanites\u201d (Vol. xi, p. 579). The effect of the Sufi system upon the mystical Jewish Markabah-Riders was so profound that some of the phenomena (the transition of colors and then to colorlessness, for example) produced in the mystic are identical with those of the Sufi.

As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non- Jews are totally satanic creatures &quot;in whom there is absolutely nothing good.&quot; Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is &quot;inessential,&quot; whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This book is circulated in countless editions, and its ideas are further propagated in the numerous &quot;discourses&quot; of the present hereditary Fuehrer of Habbad, the so- called Lubavitcher rabbi, M.M. Schneurssohn, who leads this powerful world- wide organization from his New York headquarters. In Israel these ideas are widely disseminated among the public at large, in the schools and in the army. (According to the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, Member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda was particularly stepped up before Israel&#039;s invasion of Lebanon in March 1978, in order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from &quot;Gentile wounded.&quot; This Nazi- like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but simply to &quot;Gentiles,&quot; goyim.) A former Israeli President, Shazar, was an ardent adherent of Habbad, and many top Israeli and American politicians headed by Prime Minister Begin publicly courted and supported it. This, in spite of the considerable unpopularity of the Lubavitcher rabbiin Israel he is widely criticized because he refuses to come to the Holy Land even for a visit and keeps himself in New York for obscure messianic reasons, while in New York his anti- Black attitude is notorious.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that, despite these pragmatic difficulties, Habbad can be publicly supported by so many top political figures owes much to the thoroughly disingenuous and misleading treatment by almost all scholars who have written about the Hassidic movement and its Habbad branch. This applies particularly to all who have written or are writing about it in English. They suppress the glaring evidence of the old Hassidic texts as well as the latter- day political implications that follow from them, which stare in the face of even a casual reader of the Israeli Hebrew press, in whose pages the Lubavitcher rabbi and other Hassidic leaders constantly publish the most rabid bloodthirsty statements and exhortations against all Arabs.</span>", "time": 1672257790, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445254, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)15:04:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445251</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A chief deceiver in this case, and a good example of the power of the deception, was Martin Buber. His numerous works eulogizing the whole Hassidic movement (including Habbad) never so much as hint at the real doctrines of Hassidism concerning non- Jews. The crime of deception is all the greater in view of the fact that Buber&#039;s eulogies of Hassidism were first published in German during the period of the rise of German nationalism and the accession of Nazism to power. But while ostensibly opposing Nazism, Buber glorified a movement holding and actually teaching doctrines about non- Jews not unlike the Nazi doctrines about Jews. One could of course argue that the Hassidic Jews of seventy or fifty years ago were the victims, and a &quot;white lie&quot; favoring a victim is excusable. But the consequences of deception are incalculable. Buber&#039;s works were translated into Hebrew, were made a powerful element of the Hebrew education in Israel, have greatly increased the power of the blood- thirsty Hassidic leaders, and have thus been an important factor in the rise of Israeli chauvinism and hate of all non- Jews. If we think about the many human beings who died of their wounds because Israeli army nurses, incited by Hassidic propaganda, refused to tend them, then a heavy onus for their blood lies on the head of Martin Buber.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I must mention here that in his adulation of Hassidism Buber far surpassed other Jewish scholars, particularly those writing in Hebrew (or, formerly, in Yiddish) or even in European languages but purely for a Jewish audience. In questions of internal Jewish interest, there had once been a great deal of justified criticism of the Hassidic movement. Their mysogynism (much more extreme than that common to all Jewish Orthodoxy), their indulgence in alcohol, their fanatical cult of their hereditary &quot;holy rabbis&quot; who extorted money from them, the numerous superstitions peculiar to themthese and many other negative traits were critically commented upon. But Buber&#039;s sentimental and deceitful romantization has won the day, especially in the USA and Israel, because it was in tune with the totalitarian admiration of anything &quot;genuinely Jewish&quot; and because certain &quot;left&quot; Jewish circles in which Buber had a particularly great influence have adopted this position.</span>", "time": 1672257851, "resto": 21440565}, {"no": 21445272, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)15:11:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445251</a><br>My proof is already stated in the fact that Jewish philosophers tied to the origins of the Cabala were verifiably influenced by Sufi (and other Gentile) theologians and mystics, whom they respected enough to learn something from.

I am agnostic on the question of how exactly this played out, but you seem to insist on a sort of a priori acceptance of the notion that Cabalistic anti-goyim teachings being a later deviation not present in the original Cabala.

In the (Middle) East, its reputed place of origin, because (as you partially suggested), these are now increasingly overpopulated authoritarian shitholes, who have historically looked askance and continue to look askance at some of Sufism as potentially heterodox.

As the heart of Islam, or the secret heart of every religion? As parochial, or universal? Both sides exist, and talking about one of them will bring up someone\u2019s animus. Perhaps it\u2019s better not to talk about Sufism at all. <br><br>There are indeed major issues in trying to \u201ctransplant\u201d religious and mystical traditions from their organic roots in some area in the East, to the West. Most Westerners are not organically Muslim, organically Buddhist, organically Hindu, so trying to graft the outer cultural rituals of these religions into the West, is more likely to lead to exoticism-for-the-sake-of-exoticism<wbr>.

And even if he did not have this quality, how can one prove by referring to the quoted words \u2014 which concern a particular fact and not a principle \u2014 that he did not know the truth expressed by the had\u012bth in question? Moreover, a Vedantist might make the point \u2014 without any Sufi rushing to exalt his \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201crank\u201d \u2014 that the beyond is likewise but a dream and awakening is only in the Absolute or again thatthe j\u012bvanmukta has realized this supreme awakening without having had to pass through bodily death, which is therefore not the condition sine qua non of ultimate awakening. Finally, if the realization of Joseph\u2019s dream is not the homage of his brothers, what then us it and how does Ibn Arabi envisage a realization of this dream in the beyond?

Stilted, shallow Shakespearean romance and violent, angry ancient romance feel less authentic and resonant than your average sitcom romance today. It&#039;s just that Austen has been the only author of note recently to really give a shit about it, and developed most of the narrative technology we now use to describe it singlehandedly. Hopefully somebody in the next couple centuries will come along with enough talent to better her work. It&#039;s a shame that all the great authors of the 19th and 20th centuries were cuckoldry obsessed narcissists who could only use romantic interests as props for their self-insert main characters.

A romantic tragedy is about anything BUT the couple involved\u2013 the parents get in the way, or society, or religion, so the story is really about parenting, or society, or<br>religion. Whereas a real romance is about love and how love changes you; love is the motive force, and has to win in the end, which all the great authors since Austen have been too cynical to believe. Even Hemingway, the most optimistic author of the 20th century, kills Catherine at the end of A Farewell to Arms, because that novel wasn&#039;t about how love made Ernesto realize that his life had value, it was about how war and death didn&#039;t care whether he realized it or not. Which is why Catherine is such a hollow archetypal figure in that book.

Bere I say more, I will note a possible joke in something Meno says at 80a: the &quot;torpedo fish of the sea&quot; that he describes Socrates as is in Greek &quot;tei plateiai narkei&quot;, which may play off of Plato&#039;s name (something similar happens in Phaedrus where the broad tree Socrates and Phaedrus sit under you could render &quot;the Plato tree&quot;).<br><br>With Recollection in the Meno, there are some funny (as in odd) things going on with it; the first several uses of the word are all used in the this-worldly context of Socrates asking Meno to &quot;recollect&quot; what Gorgias&#039;s opinion of virtue was. Once it comes up in its proper place, we&#039;ve learned that Meno likes what Socrates characterizes as &quot;tragical&quot; sounding accounts like the Empedoclean one Socrates offers about color as effluences. So it might be less surprising that the account starts off as if Socrates is letting him in on some big sacred secret teaching, the culmination of which is with a math demonstration cnducted with his slave (ha!) where the answer turns out to be an incommensurable line (ha!). Socrates then immediately follows up the demonstration by stating that they&#039;ve proven the presence of *opinions* (the word &quot;knowledge&quot; gets dropped) in the slaveboy, and then they continue on as if Recollection wasn&#039;t relevant anymore to rest of the dialogue. One of its last uses ends up characterizing Recollection in a &quot;rational&quot; manner as giving an account of causes through speech. (And &quot;speech&quot; here might be important, since Socrates asking if the slaveboy speaks Greek also brings up the issue of what language anything is learned about in Hades). Altogether, this would all be consonant with the repetition of Socrates&#039; refrain &quot;try and answer,&quot; &quot;try and inquire&quot;.", "time": 1672293771, "resto": 21444338}, {"no": 21447284, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:05:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447175</a><br>&quot;Winged&quot; is from &quot;pteros&quot;.", "time": 1672293923, "resto": 21444338}, {"no": 21447384, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:37:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447175</a><br><a href=\"#p21447284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447284</a>", "filename": "Plato&#039;s myth of the Soul-Boner", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 972, "h": 3159, "tn_w": 38, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672295829156951, "time": 1672295829, "md5": "xmbgqUnI3u0h5H1wWbn/iw==", "fsize": 816302, "resto": 21444338}, {"no": 21447408, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:43:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444569</a><br>Frankly between women and Plato I choose Plato", "time": 1672296232, "resto": 21444338}, {"no": 21447434, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:55:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21445593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21445593</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leo Strauss</span><br>yuck", "time": 1672296918, "resto": 21444338}, {"no": 21447442, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)01:57:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21447125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21447125</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;something that I do not find obvious from his writings.</span><br>Which of his writings have you actually read?

I\u2019m not sure how or why I developed this obsession. I contemplate their form and movement frequently\u2026often multiple times per day. I\u2019ve developed the skill to sketch hyper-realistic breasts. I\u2019ve looked at so many\u2026pictures from the internet, in person at titty bars, my girlfriends. I once waited for a girlfriend to fall fast asleep after sex just so I could remove the bedsheet from her chest and stare at them.. I fumbled with the light dimmer on the nightstand to observe how different levels of exposure revealed the subtle features: the faint outlines of veins, the freckles, the peach fuzz. I mastered the behavior of the areola. How a warm room relaxes it into a silky smooth tan cap.. almost like a faint caramel blotch created by a dribbling watercolor paintbrush. And when I would take the nipple into my mouth and slather it with my saliva, I\u2019d marvel at how the cooling effect caused the smooth skin of it drew in to the nipple, becoming almost half it\u2019s original size. What was once a smooth landscape around the nipple became a labyrinth of darker brown wrinkles with valleys and ridges enveloping the now firm hardened peak in the center.<br>I worship large unruly natural breasts. While I acknowledge the heavy burden they bestow upon their bearers, to me they are gifts from heaven. I often ponder the sacrilege of breast reduction surgery and lament that such heinous evil can exist in our world. I\u2019ve considered making it my life\u2019s work to design a brassier for well endowed women that redistribute\u2019s the weight of the breast to their lower core to provide relief from the burdens. <br>However I also have a special place in my heart for the little breast. The larger a cup or smaller B cup with just enough flesh to create the under-boob clefts. I relish the pre-coitus body play with these marvelous little gum drops. I try to fit an entire breast in my mouth and flick and prod the nipple with my tongue when it\u2019s in there as I brave her uncontrollable heaving and gyration. Show me your breast and I will erect a monument to it\u2026 an obelisk anchored to my loins that you can grasp, consume or fill your voids with.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tldr; I\u2019m obsessed with tits</span>", "time": 1672340719, "resto": 21446918}, {"no": 21449555, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:12:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read romance of the three kingdoms and now I want to learn Chinese.<br><br>Maybe one day I will meet an Asian woman I can impress <br><br>New captcha sucks", "time": 1672341152, "resto": 21446918}, {"no": 21449566, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:14:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21449528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21449528</a><br>I think Zeus took my portion of tit appreciation and gave it to this guy because he has 190% tit love and I have 10%<br><br>I got all of someone else&#039;s ass fancy", "time": 1672341261, "resto": 21446918}, {"no": 21449600, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:21:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21449528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21449528</a><br>based post", "time": 1672341687, "resto": 21446918}, {"no": 21449642, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)14:32:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21446918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21446918</a><br>It was my birthday yesterday.

He does NOT say much about atheism, as a matter of fact, not compared to any other significant topic in Nietzsche. <br><br>Nietzsche provides various analyses of various religions, to the end of various points. They are rarely connected under some sense of the &quot;religious topic&quot;. It will more often be an analysis of a society, running alongside analysis of their politics and art as well as their religion. Never is there some rhetoric about how religion is wrong. It&#039;s just a creative way of human organization and Nietzsche will like some more than others.<br><br>What&#039;s significant to his reputation is the &quot;God is dead&quot; and Christianity-as-slave-morality stuff. Sorely misunderstood. &quot;God is dead&quot; refers to a far bigger problem than literal religiosity, it is an issue expressed outside of the religious context. The critique of Christianity, with its problematic otherworldliness and life-denial, is, again, one that goes in the broader thread of slave morality. Christianity, Platonic philosophy, democracy, egalitarianism... There is one current which these things comprise, and it&#039;s not a religious one.<br><br>In short...The hot take was right. Religion in Nietzsche is just a useful means of analyzing societies. It&#039;s just one social institution among others, and again, the &quot;meaning&quot; of religion varies utterly depending on the religion/society in question and the argument Nietzsche is citing it for at the time.<br><br>Now if OP meant that Nietzsche finds the subject of religion uninteresting or not useful, that wouldn&#039;t be true. His first profession involved extensive study of Greek religion, his central philosophical identity is as a disciple of a Greek god. But OP seems to be saying that religion serves its use more for analyzing the past, and that Nietzsche would refer less to religion if he were analyzing the current state of the world (except insofar as its a product of a history involving religion).<br><br><a href=\"#p21448327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21448327</a><br><a href=\"#p21448438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21448438</a><br>On the practical level, disagreeing with all the scholars does probably mean you&#039;re wrong.

The others she has condemned to the oldest fear and the most corro-sive one, without offering or even suggesting a means of recovery. If it is normal to die, it is not so to dally over death nor to think about it at every tum. The man who never takes his mind off it betrays his van-ity; since he lives in terms of the image others form of him, he cannot accept the notion that one day he will be nothing; oblivion being his continual night-mare, he is aggressive and bilious, and misses no op-portunity to display his temper, his bad manners. Is there not a certain inelegance in fearing death? This fear which preys on the ambitious leaves the pure untouched; it grazes them without taking hold. The rest suffer it testily and resent all those who simply do not experience it.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway.

This is defined by their respective ability to affirm life on its actual basis and engage reality constructively or their incapacity to do so. For instance, to affirm that man is essentially a body rather than a soul contained by a body is to affirm life as it is in Nietzsche&#039;s eyes, and this has a number of implications. Most importantly this makes egalitarian conceits impossible, as it affirms there are inherent irreconcilable inequalities between people. Nietzsche does not so much proscribe a system of organizing unequal people as you suggest, rather is concerned with this as a simple matter of truth. There are superiors and inferiors, and no organization nor philosophy will make this not so. The only equality between men is possible by reducing men to the state of the inferior, and this obviously relates to the condition of Nietzsche&#039;s last man. The last man is defined principally by his resentments toward those with the capacity for upward overcoming. He wishes to disguise his own inadequacies by making the world resemble his condition. Egalitarian conceits significantly also allow for the monopolization of social mores by such types, which inevitably produces a down-going of cultures and even the biological condition of men. As a simple case study we can look toward the ever growing number of obese and chronically sick. Internalized egalitarianism allows for such types to suggest that not only is their condition in fact not destructive, but in fact a virtue of its own. We&#039;ve reached the point with this matter now that even serious scientific publications will attempt to justify obesity absolutely knowing that it is basically sick and destructive. In every facet of society you see the tacit acceptance of what is a lie, simply for the sake of placating the resentful. What Nietzsche is concerned with is Truth.

If you actually think about it from a normal perspective, you wouldn&#039;t want to be a guardian, which is why the city employs so much brainwashing to create other means of reward for them, like honor. The deeper problem is that the feverish, prosperous City-in-Speech 2.0 (which, if you recall, was created because the original City-in-Speech was too &quot;boring&quot;, being the equivalent of a commune) requires libidinous people to expand. The job of the guardians is to guard the whole endeavor selflessly, allowing the natural impulses of the workers to guide the city&#039;s growth while also keeping them in check if they overreach. The regime collapses, however, when temptations (or even random fluctuations in breeding) causes cracks to form in the frame of the guardians, who then begin to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of the city. There&#039;s even a class war element here, because in demolishing the nuclear family for guardians, the guardians end up viewing themselves as one giant family. A natural &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality ensues, as the guardians begin to think that they are owed their due by lesser beings. And thus begins the (inevitable) decline of the city from aristocracy to oligarchy, etc. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But does this not mean that the workers will remain low people forever?</span><br>Keep in mind with the myth of the metals that some &quot;gold&quot; people will give birth to &quot;bronze&quot; children and vice versa.

You&#039;re also making a mistake of assuming that Plato was advocating for the City-In-Speech 2.0 with 100% sincerity.

Those who refused to do so will never know the relapse, the antipodes and the grimaces of this cult; they will remain closed off from the sources of disappointment.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We had believed with Nietzsche in the perpetuity of trances; thanks to the maturity of our cynicism, we have ventured further than he. The notion of the superman now strikes us as no more than a lucubration; it used to seem as precise as a given of experience. Thus the enchanter of our youth fades. But which one of him \u2014 if he was several \u2014 still remains? It is the expert in failures, the psychologist, an aggressive psychologist, not merely an observer like the moralists. He scans with the eye of an enemy and makes enemies for himself. But he draws such enemies out of himself, like the vices he denounces. Does he attack the weak? He is merely being introspective; and when he attacks decadence, he is describing his condition. All his hatreds bear indirectly on himself. His weaknesses he proclaims and erects into an ideal; if he execrates himself, Christianity or socialism suffers for it. His diagnosis of nihilism is irrefutable: because he himself is a nihilist, and because he avows it. A pamphleteer in love with his adversaries, he could not have endured himself had he not done battle with himself, against himself \u2014 had he not placed his miseries elsewhere, in the others: on them he took revenge for what he was. Having practiced psychology as a hero, he proposed to the enthusiasts of the Inextricable a diversity of stalemates.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We measure his fecundity by the possibilities he affords us of continually repudiating him without exhausting him. A nomad mind, he is good at varying his disequilibriums. In all matters, he has championed the pro and the con: this is the procedure of those who give themselves up to speculation for lack of being able to write tragedies \u2014 to disperse themselves in many destinies. Nonetheless, by exhibiting his hysterias, Nietzsche has spared us the shame of ours; his miseries were salutary for us.

They instead had people like Paul de la Garde, Julius Langbehn, Oswald Spengler, Werner Sombart, Georg von Sch\u00f6nerer, Eugen D\u00fchring and Rudolf Jung. Then the volkist ideas had a whole bunch of biologists including people like Ernst Haeckel and Raoul Franc\u00e9. These Volkists came up with the basis of the life laws which fascism didn&#039;t have anything close to. The ideology was basically just the application of these natural laws. It was economically far more left wing than Fascism was with many National Socialist including Hitler not even fully acknowledging private property but instead only private management of that property (which was implemented in various forms). National Socialism also just saw the role of the government and the nature of the state completely different with the state only being there as a means to an end to ensure the existence and thriving of the people and the nation not really having anything to do with the actual borders.

The difference is measured in how much sexual gratification plebs manage to emulate in any given period - an there were literally no periods or societies in human history in which rich, powerful people were largely unfamiliar with the concept of sucking dick, and neither her were any such periods where plebs did not pursue elite&#039;s lifestyles and trappings of those lifestyles from themselves. <br><br>In this specific case, it means that people did engage in non-insignificant amounts of swallowing dick and eating puss through the entire human history.

That combined with tax breaks for maintaining a healthy family would create the ultimate backbone for a strong state, healthy families.

At the end of the day, all worldviews can either be accepted or rejected, and there is no known method of convincing everybody peacefully to accept any given worldview. The worldview that &quot;all worldviews are valid, let&#039;s all get along!&quot; is itself a worldview, albeit one built on the naive hope that the &quot;niceness&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; of it will entice everybody into accepting it. As is well known, many people do not accept it. Hence all the liberal paradoxes of the need to be &quot;intolerant of intolerance&quot; (Popper), to coerce non-coercion, etc. &quot;Can&#039;t everyone just get along?&quot;-ism has been forced to force non-getter-alongers to get along since the 18th century, when early anarchists like Godwin openly stated that people too stupid to accept utopia will have to be compelled to accept it, or simply killed to prevent them from upsetting it, and when the French Revolution had to resort to Terror to &quot;force&quot; people to accept dogmatically its premises that everybody is a rational free agent and can&#039;t be forced to accept any dogma. <br><br>Back then, these were paradoxes of liberalism.

We want stories more complex than some jacked demigod killing a hydra, and we have some standards about what is and isn&#039;t appropriate for goofy kids&#039; shows.<br>I&#039;ll try to put it as simply: one finds things like the zombie Psyduck or Shadow the Hedgehog using guns while mildly swearing &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;impossible to take seriously&quot; because, when it comes down to it, they start off from concepts that are close to what is commonly accepted as &quot;kid-appropriate&quot; (not even &quot;kid friendly&quot;!), then add elements that are at odds with it... but in such a way that it is clearly &quot;not mature&quot; in itself!<br>Just because a Sonic character brandishes a realistic gun doesn&#039;t mean it suddenly becomes a Call of Duty clone: if the opponents are still purely evil demons and/or faceless mercenaries with little reason behind their existence, the character is still essentially a simple one, the color palette is still colorful, and the effect of the gun is the same as using a spin dash or whatever, you just have given a things that looks mature to a character within a setting that isn&#039;t.<br>If an Aster\u00ecx comic directly showed the rape of a woman called Slutrix, by a man called Incelix, and the rest of the comic had Obelix using his superstrenght to track the guy down and then punch him into the sky like the Roman soldiers, all the while Aster\u00ecx and Vitastatix comfort Slutrix with shopping, it wouldn&#039;t be mature because the rape would not be treated seriously in itself.<br>If Captain Haddock was presented catching HIV from eating bushmeat, and the comic, while mantaining the canon personalities, talked about it realistically, it would be mature, yes, but it also could be considered &quot;cringe&quot; because it&#039;s trying to process a real issue through the lens of fictional characters. Shit, this one issue also affects more &quot;adult&quot; comics too, because for example at no point in Marvel comics Reed Richards ever canonically tries to solve world hunger or cure cancer is because that would trivialize the actual problem.", "time": 1672349145, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21450948, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:45:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1672357519, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21451119, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:13:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450948</a><br>It didn\u2018t need a fourth one after 30 replies you nigger", "time": 1672359208, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21451659, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)21:11:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451119</a><br>Nobody made a response to my argument.", "time": 1672366317, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21452180, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)22:59:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i want the fox to fuck the bunny", "time": 1672372792, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21452311, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)23:22:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21448205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21448205</a><br>Robotnik tortures Sonics parents.", "time": 1672374156, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21453310, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450225</a><br>You&#039;ve written a whole essay about dark themes in other stories, even theoretical dark themes that\u2019d have never been added to a TV series, not today and certainly not in 1993.

This is an incontestable truth\u2026 Women are different from men in form because they are females, just as all females in the kingdom of plants and animals differ from the male of their species\u2026 According to gynecologists women, unlike men, menstruate each month\u2026 Since men cannot be impregnated they do not experience the ailments that women do. She breastfeeds for nearly two years.\u201d<br><br>2. \u201cThere are inevitable cycles of social history: the yellow race\u2019s domination of the world, when it came from Asia, and the white race\u2019s attempts at colonizing extensive areas of all continents of the world. Now, it is the turn of the black race to prevail in the world.\u201d<br><br>3. \u201cWhile it is democratically not permissible for an individual to own any information or publishing medium, all individuals have a natural right to self-expression by any means, even if such means were insane and meant to prove a person\u2019s insanity.\u201d<br><br>4. \u201cMandatory education is a coercive education that suppresses freedom. To impose specific teaching materials is a dictatorial act.\u201d<br><br>5. \u201cIf a community of people wears white on a mournful occasion and another dresses in black, then one community would like white and dislike black and the other would like black and dislike white. Moreover, this attitude leaves a physical effect on the cells as well as on the genes in the body.\u201d<br><br>6. \u201cSporting clubs which constitute the traditional sports institutions in the world today are rapacious social instruments. The grandstands of public athletic fields are actually constructed to obstruct access to the fields.\u201d<br><br>7. \u201cPlacing a child in a day nursery is coercive and tyrannical and a violation of the child\u2019s free and natural disposition.\u201d<br><br>8. \u201cLabour in return for wages is virtually the same as enslaving a human being. In a socialist society no person may own a private means of transportation for the purpose of renting to others, because this represents controlling the needs of others.\u201d<br><br>9. \u201cThe democratic system is a cohesive structure whose foundation stones are firmly laid one above the other, the Basic People\u2019s Conferences, the People\u2019s Conferences, and the People\u2019s Committees, which finally come together when the General People\u2019s Conference convenes.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1672198546, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442489, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:35:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the real tripcode</span><br>...", "time": 1672198558, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442492, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:36:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442482</a><br>The Divine Comedy<br>The Bible<br>Don Quixote", "time": 1672198593, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442514, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:43:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442423</a><br>where is this from?", "time": 1672199023, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442517, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all four James Joyce books</span><br>holy BASED", "time": 1672199072, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442538, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:52:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442461</a><br>Same /tv/boomer spamming genre shit all over the board.", "time": 1672199542, "resto": 21442382}, {"no": 21442555, "now": "12/27/22(Tue)22:56:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442382</a><br>I know Journey didn&#039;t make the list, and Demons has.

Orwell has an essay on Tolstoy&#039;s deeply buried fears of becoming himself a King Lear; Bloom blunders with the nonsense that Tolstoy&#039;s opinion is &quot;the reaction of a genius to another genius&quot;, and therefore something that is beyond the reach of &quot;our minds&quot; (us poor mortals).<br><br>But here comes Chekhov and his eyes that see everything on the souls of others. Here&#039;s Chekhov on Tolstoy:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;I admire him greatly. What I admire the most in him is that he despises us all; all writers. Perhaps a more accurate description is that he treats us, other writers, as completely empty space. You could argue that from time to time, he praises Maupassant, or Kuprin, or Semenov, or myself. But why does he praise us? It is simple: it&#039;s because he looks at us as if we were children. Our short stories, or even our novels, all are child&#039;s play in comparison with his works. However, Shakespeare \u2026 For him, the reason is different.

The Platonic-Aristotelian answer to this is to presume that the form, which (remember) astonishingly can &quot;impose itself&quot; or &quot;take up into itself&quot; the seed and placenta of the man and woman and somehow grow into a fully formal-material synthesis (hylo-morphic) dog, is something real and actual. But the form is nowhere obviously visible. The logical conclusion is that it is something &quot;real but not material.&quot; You may think this is absurd, but you yourself already draw the same conclusion about the mathematical laws &quot;governing over&quot; matter, which is also a form of Platonism - Plato was more concerned with these kinds of Pythagorean laws than Aristotle, who was more interested in observing nature. Aristotle also disagreed with Plato that the forms are &quot;substances&quot; (things subsisting on their own, outside of and logically prior to any necessary hylomorphic instantiation in material), but this leads to the equally perplexing doctrine of the location and ontological status of Aristotle&#039;s forms (eide, i.e. universals, concepts, kinds, types, species, genera).<br><br>This also raises the question: Does everything that maintains a distinct form, or every form for which we have a name (&quot;chair&quot; let&#039;s say), have a metaphysical form?

Nevertheless it is so effective at reducing nature to easily engineerable abstractions that it has become the default way of seeing nature. Chemistry, which formerly was a distinct science because chemical interactions were considered to exhibit phenomena and characteristics irreducible to mechanics, was absorbed into physics as &quot;applied physics&quot; by the late 18th century. Biology held out a little longer, because life is even harder to reduce convincingly to physicalism, but with Darwin&#039;s &quot;discovery&quot; of natural selection providing an explanatory framework that required no teleology (actually Darwin did have teleological elements but that&#039;s not relevant here), and especially in the early 1900s with the rediscovery of Mendel&#039;s ideas and the fusion of Mendelian genetics, statistics, and later molecular biology, &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; become an ironclad paradigm that begins dogmatically from a physical reductionist presuppositions and regards all talk of teleology (natural kinds etc.) as spooky mysticism. Nevertheless, there has been significant pushback against this from people like Rupert Sheldrake, and many German thinkers continued to be basically teleologically oriented (Driesch, Uexkull, etc.). You can even see remnants of this in Heisenberg&#039;s Physics and Philosophy book.<br><br>Outside of biology, in the 20th century there was a massive pushback against the mathematico-geometrical reductionist worldview described in the above posts, from German phenomenologists, Marxists and postmodernists, and from neo-Thomists and other religious types who obviously have a problem with modern materialist nihilism with Darwinian characteristics. It is safe to say that it&#039;s hard to defend or resurrect a &quot;naive&quot; Aristotelian position, in which every naturally occurring kind (dogs, trees, etc.) is simply assumed to have an ideal concept either governing over it from some transcendent realm or implanted within it in some vague way. Nevertheless, the sheer insufficiency and (it must be stressed) equal arbitrariness of the crypto-Pythagorean paradigm of modern physics requires at least a negative critique of this paradigm, so people are naturally curious about how various forms of idealism can be updated and reexamined.", "time": 1672355277, "resto": 21450484}, {"no": 21450780, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450770</a><br>(cont, final)<br>One of the best provisional ways in which this was carried out was the recovery by phenomenological writers of the Greek &quot;way of seeing,&quot; the lifeworld and assumptions of the Greeks that made them see universals &quot;in&quot; the particulars, made them feel they were engaging in intellectual intuition, etc. But most secular philosophers today won&#039;t go much farther than this, because they are of course terrified to posit any spooky metaphysical entities or be considered religious. Nevertheless, here&#039;s Nietzsche: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We say it is &quot;explanation&quot;; but it is only in &quot;description&quot; that we are in advance of the older stages of knowledge and science. We describe [the world] better, we explain [it] just as little as our predecessors. We have discovered a manifold succession where the naive man and investigator of older cultures saw only two things, &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect,&quot; as it was said; we have perfected the conception of becoming, but have not got a knowledge of what is above and behind the conception. ... The peculiarity, for example, in every chemical process seems a &quot;miracle,&quot; the same as before, just like all locomotion; nobody has &quot;explained&quot; impulse. How could we ever explain! We operate only with things which do not exist, with lines, surfaces, bodies, atoms, divisible times, divisible spaces how can explanation ever be possible when we first make everything a conception, our conception! It is sufficient to regard science as the exactest humanising of things that is possible ... (Nietzsche, Gay Science 112).</span><br><br>But if you want to go beyond the tentative secular approaches, you have to begin at least considering the possibility of a more robust, openly Platonic (or Neoplatonic) metaphysics, in which forms actually can be intellectually intuited. This is what people like Goethe and Schelling wanted to do. Now instead of having simple, obvious &quot;forms&quot; like Aristotle assumed every &quot;natural kind&quot; did, one has to cultivate the faculty of intellectual intuition and enter into a kind of sympathetic relation with some phenomenon, in order to gradually unfold the Urph\u00e4nomen underlying it, basically a Platonic idea. Modern thinkers often take ideas like this and fuse them with an acceptance that natural selection and material factors are operative on a lower material plane, while noting that this lower plane of activity nevertheless can&#039;t explain the manifest teleological behavior of many organisms (Sheldrake&#039;s books are good for many examples of this).", "time": 1672355338, "resto": 21450484}, {"no": 21450808, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:14:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450670</a><br><a href=\"#p21450675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450675</a><br>The similarities argument does make sense.

It&#039;s an example of an accidental substance, not a natural substance, in other words there is no &quot;mug&quot; essence or anything similar from Aristotle&#039;s perspective (and Plato&#039;s too), except in the human mind that creates it (which is obviously liable to modification and warping. In other words, &quot;mugness&quot; is contingent and not a real existent beyond the specific mind it&#039;s in). What separates a natural substance (something that really exists outside of our mind) from an accidental substance is something that has been investigated thoroughly by subsequent thinkers and requires quite a bit of breadth of understanding and investigation. In very, very simple terms, it is the difference between something which has a unified principle, which tends to collect all of its &quot;parts&quot; together and maintain them as part of the same organic unity which physically grows, moves and thinks (in the case of humans, with different stages of this process applying to more primitive organisms). It is also something which, when modified in its essence, results in qualitative changes in terms of its environmental interactions. What should also be stressed is that this does not only apply to living beings; it applies equally to inorganic compounds. An example would be the water molecule: there are plenty of examples of accidental substances composed out of water (a glass of water for instance, which is not something with a stable unifying principle in and of itself, with its own necessary behavior that, when altered in quantity in any way, radically changes its nature qualitatively). The water molecule, however, could be said to be a natural substance, because once it is formed out of hydrogen and oxygen, it tends to maintain that structure unless acted upon by an external mover, it has specific environmental behaviors that do not change unless its chemical structure is changed, etc.", "time": 1672384548, "resto": 21450484}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21452673, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)00:49:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "why do people say &quot;1984 predicted this&quot; when it&#039;s almost an exact copy of the soviet union during stalins time? it didn&#039;t predict any new concept it just retold them from a new prespective", "filename": "51K84pomCRL._SX305_BO1,204,203,200_", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 307, "h": 499, "tn_w": 153, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1672379397302997, "time": 1672379397, "md5": "Nfoj+Jv0fK4iJGhOY93JMw==", "fsize": 36531, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "why-do-people-say-1984-predicted-this-when-its", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 9, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21452740, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:06:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452673</a><br>Because most people don&#039;t live during that time.", "time": 1672380375, "resto": 21452673}, {"no": 21452742, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:07:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452673</a><br>Because they don&#039;t know any better.", "time": 1672380464, "resto": 21452673}, {"no": 21452754, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:10:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452673</a><br>Everyone generation thinks they&#039;re the first to experience problems that have been plaguing humanity for eternity.", "time": 1672380608, "resto": 21452673}, {"no": 21452824, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:31:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452673</a><br>Really?

It depicted simply an enormous gay face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a biker moustache and daddy-esque features. Wankston made for the stairs.

He went slowly, resting several times to catch his breath and check his DM\u2019s. On each floor, opposite the elevator-shaft, the sexy poster with the sexy face gazed from the wall. Eyes so large, it felt as though they were following you. BIG STEP BROTHER IS WANKING OFF TO YOU, the caption beneath it ran.<br><br>Inside the flat a lispy voice was sassily reading out a list of figures in a sarcastic and patronizing tone. The list had something to do with the production of piss for the town piss pigs. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque with two circular pieces of metal that seemed to hang below it, flanking the left and right lower corners respectively. Wankston cranked a knob and the voice sank somewhat, though the sarcasm and passive aggressiveness were still everpresent. The instrument (the telescreen is what it was originally called, but had later become colloquially known as \u2018The Daddy Box\u2019) could be volume adjusted to a point, but the only way to silence it completely was to not wank off for a few weeks- then have a big wank session in front of it. The facial recognition system built into the instrument would scan the users face for signs of extreme pleasure. A show of such pleasure would in turn cause the instrument itself to become horny. The instrument would then extend two mechanical arms and a mechanical appendage. The instrument would then begin masturbating itself- moaning loudly throughout. At the end of the process, the instrument would spray a foam like substance from its mechanical appendage to signify that the process was complete. The mechanical extensions of the instrument would then retract and the instrument would become unresponsive and silent for 48 hours. <br><br>Yes, it was possible to silence it- but for that silence came a burden even the strongest of men would deem uncarryable. Wankston moved over to the window: he had a smallish, sexy figure. The meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the pink overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was well kept, his face perfect- strangely not marked by wrinkles despite years of smiling and winking and various other facial expressions I don\u2019t have time to go into.

Only the Jorts Police mattered.

If you believe everything ultimately resolves into a single substance (not necessarily material substance but literally sub-stans, that which is &quot;under-standing&quot; or under-lying other things) then you are a monist (&quot;one-ist&quot;). If you believe ultimately there are two kinds of things, like two primal forces of Good and Evil, you are a dualist. <br><br>These are extremely general terms with many possible shades of meaning though. For example, monism is often used for pre-Socratic materialist monism, which is a form of materialist/physicalist reductionism (all things are ultimately just modifications or conglomerations of the one really underlying substance, which is some form of material stuff). Dualism is often used for creationist theologies like Judeo-Christian ones in which strictly speaking God is the one, true, originating &quot;substance,&quot; but once He has created creation, there are two irreducibly real things: creation (the &quot;conditioned&quot; world, since its being is conditioned by God) and the uncreated (the unconditioned condition of the conditioned: God). <br><br>Nondualism is a form of monism but it is generally and especially used for idealist philosophies in which all apparent, manifest being is reliant upon an ultimate divine being, like Plato&#039;s and Plotinus&#039; Good, Meister Eckhart&#039;s God, or the Hindu Brahman. These are often called &quot;emanationist&quot; philosophies because they describe the manifest and apparently multiplicitous/varied world as being an emanation from its non-manifest base, which is the divine being. Usually these philosophies constantly emphasize that the divine being from which everything else emanates and on which everything depends, as the unconditioned condition of all apparent being, is not itself &quot;a&quot; being, it is something beyond all being. A good source for this is The Cloud of Unknowing: God is beyond all knowing. Since we can only perceive and intuit conventional beings with our normal senses and thinking, we thus need higher forms of mystical intuition to &quot;grasp&quot; the divine &quot;non-being.&quot; But because we too are beings, dependent on this divine non-being, what we are actually doing when we grasp it is realizing that we ARE it, realizing &quot;its&quot; presence at the inmost &quot;center&quot; of ourselves. <br><br>The terms are just useful ways of talking about some of the paradoxes that arise from trying to discuss these topics. Are certain literalist forms of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity &quot;dualist&quot; because they do not allow any re-union (realization of non-duality) with the Godhead, because that would be blasphemy? Are Sufis heretics because they utter &quot;shath,&quot; seemingly heretical paradoxical statements, like &quot;I am God,&quot; in moments of mystical ecstasy? Etc.

Other systems do posit something like an ontological status for the mirror/container of ideality, like Plato&#039;s dyad in particular. But in general there is a strong preference for demoting matter to a kind of shadow of the ideal. For example in Leibniz, all material and thus all contingent/accidental aspects of a being are actually just a result of our blurred mental perception of it. Seen from God&#039;s perspective, all concepts are perfectly complete with no temporal or spatial/material contingency, and space and time properly speaking do not exist/subsist on their own.

Basically, in this moment when &quot;normal science&quot; (to use Kuhn&#039;s terminology again) had broken down and was lacking a paradigm, Galileo and Descartes were instinctively groping about for other absolute standards capable of explaining the physical and manifest world. Remember this is 200 years into various philosophical trends: nominalism justifying an increase in philosophical concern with the this-worldly since the 14th century, early experimentalism in northern Italy (especially University of Padua), Copernicus&#039; anti-Ptolemaism, etc. There was a general feeling that the sciences were both capable of being put on a new footing, and needed to be, and that a new systematic rigor was the way to begin, AND that the faded Aristotelian physics still taught in the schools was probably not going to be it. That is the true context of both Galileo&#039;s &quot;Dialogue on the Two World Systems&quot; and Descartes&#039; Meditations. <br><br>So in that &quot;moment,&quot; Husserl argues, they landed on the mathematical/geometrical &quot;Euclidean&quot; method, shot through with extremely Platonic and Pythagorean ideas (including their mystical sides thanks to Renaissance hermeticism - cf. Kepler&#039;s Neoplatonism). And of course at this time mathematics is absolutely booming, the late 16th - early 17th centuries were a period of great innovation, prestige, and perceived potential in mathematics. Also keep in mind that around this time, mythical and poetic notions of the heavens were being called into question, for example by the invention of the telescope which famously demonstrated that they are not heavenly spheres but contingent bodies - thus indicating that what we should concern ourselves with is the mathematical/geometrical harmonies underlying them and not the bodies themselves.", "time": 1672251275, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444882, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444876</a><br>Descartes suspends his belief in all philosophical systems with his method of doubt, proclaims the mathematical/geometrical method based on deduction from &quot;clearly and distinctly&quot; perceived axioms as the surest one, and recommends it to all of philosophy (including natural philosophy or what we would call science) as its model. The major implications of this are twofold: (1) Descartes wants to be extremely careful about bestowing ontological status on anything, because with his deductive-axiomatic method, he has to start from ONLY those ideas that can be clearly and distinctly perceived. He can&#039;t just posit &quot;matter&quot; willy-nilly unless he has, in his mind, an absolutely clear logical idea of it, about which nobody in their right mind could argue. <br><br>(2) Descartes has necessarily inherited the crypto-Platonic, crypto-Pythagorean, Renaissance platonist tacit ASSUMPTION that underlying all particular physical things is their ideal form, which the post-Ptolemaic and frankly proto-Newtonian celestial geometrical mechanics of Kepler reveal - he is looking for ideal geometrical structures in everything. All apparent movements of the planets are just &quot;appearances&quot; to be brought into tighter and tighter correspondence with the ideal and harmonious geometrical structures underlying them, a very Platonic/Pythagorean idea. It&#039;s often said that Galileo &quot;brought Kepler down to Earth&quot; by applying this geometrizing ideal to terrestrial matter - a huge move, because prior to this, for thousands of years basically, astronomy and geometry were considered tandem subjects precisely because the &quot;superlunary&quot; celestial realm was considered so ideal in its nature/structure/movements, radically distinct from the grittier sublunar terrestrial reality down here. Galileo demonstrated forcefully and intuitively the applicability of geometrical abstraction to ALL PHENOMENA. In doing this he effectively inaugurated what we call classical mechanics.", "time": 1672251336, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444885, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:16:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444882</a><br>This is what inspired Descartes (and incidentally Hobbes&#039; extreme mechanistic materialism also). So now he has a deductive method that absolutely must designate the bare minimum of logically possible substances (underlying really existing things) in order to function, and a very strong preference for geometrizing idealizations of ALL external phenomena. When you combine these, you get the classic Cartesian dualism: as he says explicitly, when he tries to think of all existing phenomena, he finds that he can sort them all into two categories, as all other categories reveal themselves to be really just modifications or expressions of these two categories, which cannot be reduced to one another. The categories are, basically, mind and matter. But again, it&#039;s important that Descartes is trying to avoid any ambiguity, because these are intended as the absolutely primordial, inarguable, axiomatic starting points for all subsequent philosophical deduction. &quot;Mind&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; are too vague, they are subordinate expressions of the two categories. When pushed to logical extremes, as Descartes famously did in his thought experiment about the wax, the two categories have to be formulated in terms of their absolutely minimal phenomenal properties: the &quot;extended something&quot; and &quot;thinking something.&quot; (Ultimately God is the highest substance/category, as the other beings depend upon him. But most &quot;Cartesians&quot; ignored this entirely and read Descartes as a powerful justification of mechanism - spawning for example a mechanical, and thus non-Aristotelian + non-Paracelsian school of medicine, &quot;iatromechanics.&quot;)<br><br>All thoughts, ideas, mentation, etc., are aspects or moments of the &quot;something that is thinking&quot; (res cogitans - it&#039;s important that cogitans is an active participle here), and everything non-thinking, everything real and external, is a modification or congregation of &quot;something extended.&quot; Note that extension, being a GEOMETRICAL and thus a QUANTITATIVE concept, is more primordial than any QUALITATIVE concept. Descartes has effectively divided the world into two spheres: the geometrical-quantitative and the conceptual-qualitative. From this division it&#039;s barely a hop and a jump to Locke&#039;s nominalistic &quot;primary and secondary qualities&quot; (what is real in the thing is its physicality; what is unreal is whatever qualia it causes in you, subjectively), which many readers of Locke happily interpreted as the modern distinction between &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;merely subjective,&quot; with special emphasis on the derogatory &quot;merely.&quot;", "time": 1672251398, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444887, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:17:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444885</a><br>This whole Keplerian-Galilean-Cartesian-Hobbes<wbr>ian-Lockean complex was also absorbed by Newton, who was the Einstein of the 18th century, even more famous than Einstein. He was basically considered to have &quot;finished&quot; science and conquered nature, because his method (premised on a fairly crude variant of Lockean epistemology) was so unbelievably powerful for geometrizing nature, as proved by its virtual completion of astronomy via the positing of the bare minimum of empirically observable forces (gravity acting upon abstract bodies in a geometrical plane), in a reduction similar to Descartes&#039;. But his system presupposed the geometrization of nature to the utmost degree. Even mass is just another variable, another function of a more primordial force better expressed in quantitative terms, terms that guarantee no connection to qualitative mental categories (like weightiness). In brief, the reason the Newtonian perfection of classical mechanics via calculus worked, and is still taught today prior to general and special relativity, is that it devised a method for finally reducing all apparent contingency (read: disparity between real objects and their geometrical models) to geometrizing, idealizing abstractions. Now the entire world could be &quot;reduced to physics.&quot; There were controversies about this, because there are severe epistemological problems inherent in calculus&#039; dealing with infinities and infinitesimals, but Newton was treated the way we treat Einstein. People wanted to be &quot;the Newton of X&quot; for two centuries. <br><br>And in the Newtonian system, just like in the Cartesian and Galilean systems, the idealizing geometrical abstraction of nature is presumed to be more primordial than any Lockean qualitative &quot;secondary qualities,&quot; including even those that we associate with matter, like &quot;weight,&quot; &quot;mass,&quot; etc. Competing materialist/atomist philosophies, like Gassendi&#039;s, never really stood a chance and were always relegated to being curiosities, because they were simply too qualitative, they smelled of the old qualitative physics.", "time": 1672251474, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444892, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:18:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444887</a><br>The one lingering problem in the Galilean-Cartesian terrestrializing of geometrical physics had been how to account for force. This was also a problem in late Aristotelian physics, where impetus theory was in development. The Aristotelian account of movement in his Physics is highly qualitative, involving non-geometrical categories and explanations in terms of essences etc. (this is what Galileo&#039;s &quot;Two World Systems&quot; is about). The desire was to maintain the non-qualitative, quantitative purity of geometrical space while also accounting for force and movement. Descartes&#039; answer to this was his famous corpuscularism, which famously denied void (because logically void would have to be given ontological status as a substance), and which never really worked - although it was extremely logically consequent, as it had to be according to the principles of Cartesianism. Newton&#039;s &quot;solution&quot; was simply to lean even harder into geometrization by accepting the existence of void - essentially the blank space between geometrized objects - without philosophical justification. And again because it simply worked so beautifully, corpuscularism basically died. <br><br>From then on, Newtonian physicalism has basically been our reflexive way of seeing external reality: as an ideal geometrical space or plane, that only appears lumpy and contingent at the manifest level of &quot;ordinary experience,&quot; which is implicitly inferior to &quot;scientific&quot; experience, which sees the &quot;real&quot; truth, the Newtonian and later the Einsteinian truth, which is mathematical abstraction. The original standpoint, that geometry/mechanics only abstracted natural phenomena for pragmatic reasons, and that the contingent lumpiness and qualitativeness of the manifest world was the primary, concrete reality of things, was overturned, and the basically platonic/pythagorean viewpoint of Galileo and Kepler was made reflexive and instinctive. The original relation of idealized model (IM) modelling apparent reality (AR) was changed into a relation of (IM) --&gt; (AR) &lt;-- (IR), where (IR) = ideal reality, so that both (IM) and (IR) are mathematical &quot;models,&quot; and greater truth is achieved by greater adequacy of (IM) to (IR).", "time": 1672251535, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21444897, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)13:19:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444892</a><br>From this viewpoint, even ancient atomism and materialism seem quaint and unscientific, because they are insufficiently mathematically abstract.

Thus the outer characteristic of those who choose the other mystical way, that of the God of love, is that they have the \u201cgift of tears\u201d. This is in keeping with the very essence of their mystical experience. Their union with the Divine is not the absorption of their being by Divine Being, but rather the experience of the breath of Divine Love, the illumination by Divine Love, and the warmth of Divine Love. The soul which receives this undergoes such a miraculous experience that it cries. In this mystical experience fire meets with FIRE. Then nothing is extinguished in the human personality but, on the contrary, everything is set ablaze.

For instance, the Indian philosophical school of Samkhya does not deny reality to the universe or posit it as \u201cillusory,\u201d as adherents of Advaita Vedanta often do, but affirm the existence of everything as manifesting in a hierarchical chain of Being, from the subtlest spiritual principle (the summit of Purusha) to the grossest, densest, most unconscious matter (the nadir of Prakriti).<br><br>According to a Samkhya-inspired view, the simultaneous means and goal of yoga is the progressive disentangling and liberation of the purusha (witness-consciousness) from entanglement in prakriti (materiality, which includes the subtler emotional and mental functions, as simply more refined materiality). One sees that one\u2019s real self or consciousness is subtler than material sensation and sensate reality, subtler than the psychic and emotional functions, and still yet subtler than mental functions (the light of purusha or the witness-consciousness being what allows us to even have thoughts and observe thoughts in the first place).<br><br>This does not deny reality to the world or call it \u201cillusory\u201d like followers of Advaita Vedanta do, but ends up having a similar outlook, similar practices and a similar posited ultimate end-goal of human life (in moksha, enlightenment, or kaivalya, liberation).", "filename": "DED193D7-7BA3-4EE7-AE3A-EE853CD6C3CF", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 989, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672364909881447, "time": 1672364909, "md5": "C0R2cKXocE351og2zCaoMw==", "fsize": 210275, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21451630, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)21:03:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451508</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Literally does not matter.

The Advaitin can say \u201cyes well duality is a part of the illusory samsara but its not real\u201d and the Dvaitins have no argument that actually proves its real.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What kind of horseshit mental gymnastics is this? &quot;Advaita doesn&#039;t say &quot;reality is illusory&quot;...you are identifying something as reality which is not actually reality&quot; that&#039;s the same thing.</span><br>No, it\u2019s not.

Thus conscious thoughts and perceptual experiences take place when buddhi receives representational forms, both perceptual and conceptual, from manas, the \u2018organ of cognition\u2019. So buddhi receives cognitive structures from manas, and conscious \u2018light\u2019 from puru\u1e63a, and in this manner specific mental structures are illuminated by an external source and thereby appear conscious.<br><br>To fully exploit the optical analogy, the conscious representational structures involved in, say, visual perception, can be compared to transparent photographic slides. The photographic image stored in the film is composed of matter, but it is both representational and translucent. Therefore, when the film is held up to an external light source, such as the sun, the illuminated representation is analogous to the structures of perceptual experience which glow with the sentience of puru\u1e63a. Only the subtle thoughtforms of buddhi are transluscent with the light of puru\u1e63a, while other configurations of matter are opaque to this radiance.

This contention can be made only by those who are un-informed or ill-informed about the Upani\u1e63adic philosophy. The term m\u0101y\u0101 can be traced to the Rigveda (VI, 47, 18) where the one Supreme is said to appear in many forms through his power of m\u0101y\u0101. The Shvetashvatara (IV, 9-10) describes God as \u2018m\u0101y\u012b, Lord of m\u0101y\u0101, and his wonder-working power of creationas m\u0101y\u0101. The term avidy\u0101 is often used in the Upani\u1e63ads in the sense of ignorance and appearance. The Mundaka (II, 1, 10) compares ignorance to a knot which is to be untied by the realisation of the Self. The Katha (I, 2, 4-5) says that worldly people live in ignorance and thinking themselves wise move about like blind men led by the blind. The same Upanisad (11,1,2) warns us not to find reality and immortality in things of this unreal and changing world. The Chandogya (VI, 1, 4) makes it clear that Atma is the only reality and that everything else is a mere word, a mode and a name. The same Upanisad (VIII, 3,3) says that worldly people are covered with the veil of falsity. It also says (VII, 1, 3) that he who realises the Self goes beyond sorrow. The Isha (7) assures us that delusion and suffering are gone for him who realises the unity of the Self. It also says (15) that the face of the Truth is covered by a golden veil and that the aspirant prays to God for its removal. It also compares ignorance with blind darkness (9).<br><br>The Prashna (I, 16) tells us that Brahma can be realised by those who have neither crookedness nor falsehood nor illusion. The Katha (II, 1,10) makes it clear that he who sees as if there is plurality here goes on revolving in the cycle of birth and death. The Brhadaranyaka (II, 4, 14 and IV, 5, 15) says \u2018as if there were duality\u2019 implying that duality is a semblance, an appearance, an as it were. The same Upanisad (I, 3, 28) has the famous prayer which runs: Lead me from unreality to Reality, from darkness to Light, from death to Immortality. This implies the distinction between appearance and reality, between ignorance and knowledge and between change and eternity. Quotations from the Upani\u1e63ads can be multiplied where the phenomenal world of plurality and change is declared to be mere appearance due to m\u0101y\u0101 or avidy\u0101 and Brahma is said to be the only Reality, the eternal, undeniable and non-dual Self. Prof. R.D. Ranade rightly points out the origin of the doctrine of m\u0101y\u0101 or avidy\u0101 in the Upanisads and concludes that \u201cwe do find in the Upani\u1e63ads all the material that may have easily led Shankara to elaborate a theory of M\u0101y\u0101 out of it.. . . let no man stand up and say that we do not find the traces of the doctrine of M\u0101y\u0101 in the Upani\u1e63ad!\u201d", "time": 1672370876, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21452595, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)00:34:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452045</a><br>Source?", "time": 1672378470, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21452840, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:36:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21442947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21442947</a><br>Stop worshiping semitic desert demons!", "filename": "EUvoTBHXQAANcV7", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 895, "h": 1276, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672382170936587, "time": 1672382170, "md5": "/aHnHw8/wv1FTyoQocCehA==", "fsize": 255406, "resto": 21442947}, {"no": 21452853, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:40:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21443435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21443435</a><br>Good transforms evil into good, rather than good and evil being identical.

If you actually think through the process, the choice becomes more difficult and less clear. <br><br>If Stoner did what you suggest, he&#039;d lose his employment, and it would negatively impact his ability to get a similar job in the field. People poo-poo this sort of thinking (love will conquer all, say people with little experience), but those who say this sort of thing have never faced real poverty. It&#039;s one thing to tell someone to throw their livelihood away for a relationship, but it&#039;s another thing to actually do it.<br><br>There&#039;s also Stoner&#039;s wife and daughter. Though he wasn&#039;t that fond of his wife, that doesn&#039;t mean he didn&#039;t feel a sense of obligation to her, or in some ways felt responsible for the person she turned out to be. Same with his daughter. By saying he should run away with Katherine you&#039;re saying he should put that relationship (his own happiness) over whatever sense of responsibility or affection he has for his family.<br><br>Lastly, if you&#039;re asking generally why people don&#039;t leave bad relationships for newer, seemingly better ones, it may be that people (and I think men in particular) understand that the shine may eventually wear off the new relationship, and then you&#039;ll simply be in the same boat as before but after having gone to all the trouble of getting a divorce and causing a catastrophic blow to your familial and emotional life. A man understands that he might leave his wife for another woman, but in the long run he may not end up any better off as the passion of the new relationship runs its course and the new woman, in time, also comes to take him for granted. (It may be this understanding which is the reason for so few men initiating divorce. They are romantic realists and do not engage in the sort of pipe dream thinking that causes washed up middle age women to divorce their husbands and think they&#039;ll magically find Mr. Right despite being no catch themselves.) To quote what another Anon said on this topic recently, notice how it&#039;s almost always men who recommend Stoner as a book and never women. The book has a sort of romantic realism to it that many stories do not, which is to say that many stories do not include the possibility that two people do not end up together, or end up together but are ultimately miserable. Stoner&#039;s romance with Katherine is a very real one in the sense that its ultimate consummation (a marriage and life lived out together) is not achieved, but at the same time it is perfect in its own way because that does not happen. We do not have to witness Stoner&#039;s and Katherine&#039;s relationship being drawn out into the quotidian, or flagging in its intensity to something like mutual indifference over time. What the two of them had together came to an end, but the question remains &quot;What if?&quot; In this manner, the romance achieves a sort of idealized state, frozen in time and always perfect because it did not proceed and thus could not die.", "time": 1672379942, "resto": 21452205}, {"no": 21452724, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)01:01:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21452712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21452712</a><br>/Thread<br>Great post, anon.

Miller, Jr. (1959)<br><br>A Canticle of Leibowitz is three novellas that have minimal overlap due each one taking place roughly six hundred years after the previous one. Its structure is due to it being a fix-up novel composed of previously serialized works that were revised to form a novel. As a general rule, I don&#039;t like fix-up novels, though I didn&#039;t know this was one until after I read it.<br><br>The three parts are concerned with with the Abbey of St. Leibowitz and its residents, though outsiders are also present, and there a few times where the narrative goes elsewhere. The titular Isaac Edward Leibowitz has been deceased for roughly six hundred years and serves no role other than he founded the abbey to preserve human knowledge and was martyred. Sometimes I found the story be so farcical that Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz seemed like a more appropriate reference.<br><br>This is very much an idea novel, to the exclusion of almost all else. I suppose it can be read for its post-apocalyptic nuclear fallout setting, but I don&#039;t know who would read it for the characters, as they&#039;re seemingly only for the functional purpose of delivering the narrative. The central idea, there are several, to me is that humanity is doomed to its own intentional self-destruction, over and over again. It&#039;s thoroughly fatalistic, but there are also elements of optimistic wishful thinking that are still with us today, particularly that are currently viable escapes from Earth. I also believe it to be Sisyphean, which may be what I dislike the most about it. The very concept of continually losing progress after much effort and suffering, over and over again, is disagreeable to me.<br><br>I&#039;m not able to relate to the effusive praise or awards I&#039;ve seen for this book, though I also feel the same way about Isaac Asimov&#039;s Foundation, of which it bears at least a passing resemblance. There are ideas, passages, and commentary that I enjoyed, but overall I wasn&#039;t able to engage with this is in any meaningful way. One of the main reasons for this is that I found it to be too concerned with allegory. They&#039;re of the Catholic sort, but there are many secular ones as well. I don&#039;t want to emphasize the Catholicism because despite itnearly omnipresent from beginning to end, I felt it was more a thematic choice to support the idea of cyclical history than to be religiously oriented fiction.<br><br>I won&#039;t be seeking out more from this series or author. The novel is worthwhile, but it&#039;s style doesn&#039;t suite my tastes. I don&#039;t have any issue with saying that others should try reading it and seeing what they think. If you enjoy a low-action novel about religion, long-term preservation of knowledge and tradition, philosophical contemplation, and ideals being more far important than people or anything else, then this may be something you&#039;d enjoy.<br><br>Rating: 3/5", "filename": "A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz_cover_1st_ed", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 220, "h": 315, "tn_w": 87, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672243895838252, "time": 1672243895, "md5": "Qx6G0vz1XLdNP0BhWKb9dg==", "fsize": 31478, "resto": 21443786, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21444531, "now": "12/28/22(Wed)11:30:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21444499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21444499</a><br>Nice dubs and another nice review.
