It&#039;s about Jewish murder and blood rituals. <br>The Last Days of the Romanovs by Telberg and Wilton tells of the murder of the Russian royal family by the Jewish Bolsheviks.<br>Ron Unz&#039;s American Pravda series is amazing as well. It&#039;s not a book but rather a series of articles on his website, should be mandatory reading for any &quot;redpilled&quot; person. He mentions a lot of books in these articles that are great for further reading. What particularly should be read is his American Pravda article about Holocaust Denial, as well as Oddities of the Jewish Religion.", "time": 1671555723, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409447, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)12:05:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21409401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21409401</a><br>Is this reddit?", "time": 1671555919, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409450, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)12:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21409447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21409447</a><br>yes, we&#039;re on reddit. better kill yourself.", "time": 1671556010, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409458, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)12:09:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21406067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406067</a><br><a href=\"#p21406084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406084</a><br><a href=\"#p21406185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406185</a><br><a href=\"#p21406206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406206</a><br><a href=\"#p21406454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21406454</a><br><a href=\"#p21407000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21407000</a><br><a href=\"#p21407017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21407017</a><br><a href=\"#p21408377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21408377</a><br><a href=\"#p21409273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21409273</a>", "filename": "globohomo", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 680, "h": 961, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671556184475920, "time": 1671556184, "md5": "lxtrsGvdBj3zrxxwaVGwvQ==", "fsize": 36168, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409467, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)12:12:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21409450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21409450</a><br>Hylic detected", "time": 1671556340, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409489, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)12:20:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21408609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21408609</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you haven&#039;t been touched by a woman in forever.</span><br>woman moment", "time": 1671556854, "resto": 21405844}, {"no": 21409646, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)13:13:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21409489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21409489</a><br>Someone linked me to a reddit repost of some 4chan misogyny post once and it was literally 500 replies of women saying &quot;has he even touched a woman&quot; &quot;he can&#039;t get laid&quot;<br><br>Imagine seeing 499 other people saying the same thing and saying it too.

But at the age of 21 he was already in Paris, in the world of occultism, which was in full ferment at that time, about 1906-1908. And the dangers of that world were perhaps counteracted for him by the fact that it was more open to wider perspectives. It seems to be about this time, in Paris, that he came in contact with some Hindus of the Advaita Vedanta school, one of whom initiated him into their own Shivaite line of spirituality. We have no details of time or place and he seems never to have spoken about these Hindus nor does he seem to have had further contact with them after one or two years. But what he learned from them is in his books and his meeting with them was clearly providential. His contact with them must have been extremely intense while it lasted. His books are just what was and is needed as antidote to the crisis of the modern world.

Here are some videos to start you out.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Traditional Catholicism vs Novus ordo Catholicism</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJx<wbr>M7Lo2URw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Miracles of the one true Faith Traditional Catholicism</span><br>https://youtu.be/aCeSJw3Qzls<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A primer of the apparition of Our Lady the Virgin Mary at Fatima</span><br>https://www.bluearmy.com/the-story-<wbr>of-fatima/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the traditions we had</span><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zc<wbr>VlYfZZvo<br>Jesus Christ has always and will always love you, and I will be here for you brother if you have questions.", "time": 1671328871, "resto": 21393580}, {"no": 21399143, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:21:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398457</a><br>larp", "time": 1671340880, "resto": 21393580}, {"no": 21399163, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)00:26:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "You guys need to read this book.

Pedophilia is a massive issue in our society and I was molested (not by a priest) at 3 and the only way this made my life worse was that it increased my willingness to have sex and go against the Church Magisterium - all in all, I would put being molested by a stranger as a child as something not great but nowhere near as bad as a genuinely abusive (physically, verbally, or sexually) step- or biological parent and as such I think this idea that it&#039;s a priest makes it extra bad but in another sense it is an incredible gift and challenge to use really the only value Christ gives the Church which is forgiveness. In all honesty, the main issue with pedophilia is we hold the molested to pathetic standards when the actual answer is to forgive and pray for them and not sue for the collection plate because your ass has scars.

While capital isn&#039;t perfect, it does work well as a feedback loop because it is always moving where there&#039;s demand. For example: if a lot of people want bread, the baker gets more money, which he will use to buy more flour so he can satisfy the demand, which means there&#039;s an incentive to make more flour, and so on. This process is rather fast, and, above all, it&#039;s decentralized. Without capital, on a large society, allocating resources becomes messy, because you need a centralized entity that follows the movements of consumption very closely so it can decide if more flour is needed or not. The USSR never even got to attempt this, but they did try to move towards it. Every five or ten years (I can&#039;t remember), they would copy prices from the west. This was seen as a middle ground between having a centralized economy and still using money to have a decentralized feedback loop guiding them. The idea was to eventually figure out how to take the money out of the equation. But since the prices were fixed (and not even to their own needs), black markets arisen, creating an actual free market, and overall the government had to intervene often. The whole thing was incredibly inefficient. Eventually it got scrapped and they started using regular money like everyone else. Interestingly, Mises wrote his book when the USSR was just starting, and he predicted accurately why they were not going to be able to move away from capital.

On a simple level - psychological analysis, historical analysis, a pretty compellng account of what it really means to be a &quot;philosopher&quot; as well as what the source of our values are and the distortions that have occured along the way. More than anything, a vivid picture of what is distinct in modern life.<br><br>I think it&#039;s an excellent philosophy. Nietzsche is no one&#039;s &quot;bottom line&quot; and frankly I don&#039;t think he intended that. It&#039;s a perspective, a unique vantage point with unique observations. The psychological and historiological import are evident enough if you pay attention to those fields. Psychology as we know it came to form with some significant orientation to Nietzsche. Nietzschean history people unfortunately may veer in the postmodernist/deconstructionist direction - Nietzsche is not equivalent to this, just well liked in that area. Artists loved him. Germans... Soon after Nietzsche&#039;s death, he became so significant that Heidegger said you could define who a German individual was by their interpretation of NIetzsche.<br><br>The real question, of course, is what do you get out of Nietzsche?<br><br>This is a philosophy of life-affirmation, a simple and fairly obvious principle that yet defines a major split in the way people live, think, and value. It&#039;ll force a lot of reflection on whether you are doing things for the right reasons. <br><br>My overall impression of Nietzsche&#039;s project so far is that it&#039;s aimed at inspiration.

This is not Nietzsche. He knows what he&#039;s doing, he was recognized by more than enough people as a genius, and if there is one thing he doesn&#039;t lack it&#039;s self awareness. The fact that we react as negatively as we do to someone questioning conventions or complimenting themselves folds right in with one of his main arguments... Isn&#039;t it strange that we react so violently to self celebration or being challenged by others? The Greeks were different.<br><br>As a final point... It is aimed at a specific sort of reader.

English has so many words, and a lot of flexibility of sentence structure. You can state ideas concisely and still give them personality. Meter and rhythm are always at play.

As I feel intense hatred during the whole session, unable to hang up the phone like I should, because I&#039;m stubborn, I find it really triggering the good and pure scripts, rather than blocking everything out and listening to sissy hypno like a freak.

The best you could find are some artsy paragraphs in a book focused on a singular language.<br>People who talk all the time about how great it is to read a particular language to people who don&#039;t know the language are pompous.

Many Muslims\u2014and Orientalists\u2014will tell you otherwise, of course, but the fact is that a fifth of the Koranic text is just incomprehensible. This is what has caused the traditional anxiety regarding translation. If the Koran is not comprehensible\u2014if it can&#039;t even be understood in Arabic\u2014then it&#039;s not translatable. People fear that. And since the Koran claims repeatedly to be clear but obviously is not\u2014as even speakers of Arabic will tell you\u2014there is a contradiction.

What&#039;s the point of watching a serious anime or reading a manga like Berserk or Kingdom when they&#039;re honestly not that great? They&#039;re certainly good at what they do so long as you judge them only against other, similar series in their medium, but the moment you take a step back and compare them to something outside that medium, their flaws stand out much more, and they begin to just become so tiresome to trudge through knowing you could&#039;ve enjoying yourself much more if you had picked up a good novel instead. This is why it&#039;s important to focus on what each medium does best, and for anime that isn&#039;t Dark Fantasy, that isn&#039;t Mystery, and it&#039;s definitely not Historical Fiction. It&#039;s Slice of Life and Iyashikei; Ecchi, Moe, and Comedy. Let literature be what you read when you want a riveting story, when you want to learn and sometimes even come back with some very wise, immediately applicable life advice. Let anime and manga be where you go to relax, looking for comfort in the benign.

I was into Game of Thrones but I do feel like this isn&#039;t all that sophisticated of a feature, and that the morality is not all that grey to begin with. The show is playing off a distinct sense of what is good or bad, with the inclusion of situations that are difficult to judge morally. This speaks to morality being difficult rather than insubstantial - Lord of the Rings already does this with the likes of Gollum, Boromir, and the corrupting force of the ring. It may sound contrarian but I feel like that is a more compelling version of &quot;greyness&quot;.<br><br>The most forceful and important events of Game of Thrones are the ones that are most decisively &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; morally. Bad guys winning, versus brief respites of justice. The show plays off a given sort of moral sensibility, the force and significance of its events are moral in nature. The best you could say is that there&#039;s a moral absence as far as the course of nature goes, it stands against the premise that things work out as they ought to (which will strike the modern audience as naive if not patronizing).<br><br>The show does have some cosmic moral law to it though - it is a rule that the bad guys must win more, fate and fortune will favor them, if someone is good it means that a rock is more likely to fall out of the sky and kill them. Bad events are contrived and poured in to ensure the &quot;greyness&quot; status and to keep the audience on edge, it needs to pull tragedies out of thin air to shock the audience and keep them on edge. <br><br>Anyhow, compare this to the Iliad. There&#039;s hardly a whisper about what&#039;s right or wrong, fair or unfair (the only remarks resembling this occur in trivial contexts). Who&#039;s the villain, Aggaememnon?* He&#039;s sick of the war too, he nearly leaves, and while his faults produce the feud with Achilles (in combination with Achilles&#039; faults, which were the greater factor there). Almost none of it is fair to anyone, yet the story revels in all of it. There&#039;s some concern about virtues we ought to value, the beauty of reconciliation and honor and such. But for the most part, you will watch your hero do a bad thing and you are meant to cheer for it. If you want to avoid black and white morality, I say you should commit, and go Greek.

If I were going to get into gay evo psych kind of stuff, I&#039;d suggest that I think there is something to our anxiety about being alone that is innate, and the mimetic desire for fame is a desire to not be alone. You want to know people will mourn your death, in some sense. Fame gives you the implicit option to never be alone, even when you&#039;re potentially old and annoyingly broken for most people you will be imbued with a certain social value that suggests you will have people thinking of you, wanting to talk with you, etc.<br><br>To go back to the evo psych thing, I think this gives us a good feeling because it is beneficial to have many friends. We are a social species and we know deep in our bones that we are vulnerable when we are alone. We want to belong, we want to have people who belong to us and who we belong to so when something bad happens we can find support. Most people simply fulfill that desire by building normal interpersonal relationships. Strictly aspiring to fame is a risky way to try to fulfill that desire, because you likely won&#039;t be famous. It is better to try to cultivate your own social relationships with normal people and try to maintain and grow them as best you can. Much like would be the case if you were actually famous, there will be down sides to that process. You won&#039;t always like the fact that the price of a relationship with a person is that you owe them things too. But if you retreat from it then you will find yourself in the worse position of feeling alone, and when you feel alone and you still have the will to live you increasingly get the existential dread that you are cosmically alone, that nothing matters, that no one will care what happens to you.

Attune yourself to this and you will find that women never say anything at all, they talk about themselves, food, buying things, consuming in general, but never anything real or substantial. Women&#039;s opinions mean nothing and have never affected anything historically except through men&#039;s reactions to them. Imagine seeing a thread that begins with &quot;women like...&quot; or &quot;women don&#039;t like...&quot; and actually letting it enter your mind.

Tell him to stick it up his ass, I don&#039;t care about that so much that I don&#039;t even want to anti-care about it, I just want him sealed in a room on the other side of the planet where his literally valueless purposeless babbling about something nobody gives a fuck about will not even generate noise pollution.", "time": 1671218068, "resto": 21392481}, {"no": 21392571, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)14:16:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21392561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21392561</a><br>I&#039;m sorry to have to say something as cringe as this, but...

I like those videos of interrogations and trials because even though I&#039;d never commit any of those crimes, it&#039;s so compelling and fucked up to watch people locked in a room having to reckon with the fact that they aren&#039;t going to talk their way out of this and their life is over and its their fault", "time": 1671569413, "resto": 21392481}, {"no": 21410380, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)15:55:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21396690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21396690</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Black guy is the barkeeper</span><br>Yeah, imagine being black and working at a tech company and your job is serving white women and some lanky asian boys.

Succing allows us to progress from 1 to 2 and so forth, but 1 by itself is simply 1 (that is to say, a &quot;something&quot; of the type number).

This could be either the best or (no, not really the worst, because even at its worst it couldn\u2019t be too bad) perhaps the most outlandish thing I have ever done. It all depends on how this magazine goes. If it folds, I will be out on a limb; but if it goes, I will be in on a very lucrative ground floor. As of now, I\u2019m very definitely the \u201cnumber one boy.\u201d Kramer told me tonight that I didn\u2019t have to worry about the trial period as long as I kept turning in things like the two stories I did this week. The original plan was for me to work for three months on this ridiculously low salary, and then\u2014if I \u201cworked out\u201d\u2014I would get a fairly sizable raise and a \u201cpermanent writer\u201d status.

I have no hours, no office, one story assignment a week, and I am 98% on my own all the time. The other writer\u2014hired in New York at the same time I was\u2014is a good lad, but not much of a writer. Perhaps this accounts for Kramer\u2019s enthusiasm for me.

It\u2019s one that I\u2019m going to have to write off as a total loss, work-wise, and a hellish experience, living-wise. I\u2019ve consumed an ungodly amount of liquid spirits, given in completely to the sexual spirit, and thrown all the other spirits to hell. There are sweet little southern girls here too, but they seem to be a little different here than they are in their natural setting. I thought I was a pretty hardened lecher, but even I have paled more than once at the sight of the \u201csweet little ole southern (or midwestern) mask\u201d slipping off to reveal a gin-inflamed bitch in heat. Carry me back to the womb, Daddy, just like you done with so many others!<br><br>But as Scott Fitzgerald must have said to himself more than once: \u201cnow is the time to get a grip.\u201d I have to pay the rent with this paycheck, so my task will be that much easier. No more buying a fifth of McCarthy Square gin each night, no more damn cab races to the Plaza fountain or the East River for a morning \u201cdip,\u201d no more five-course dinners on the balcony, or cocktails on the roof, or all-night orgies, or theatres: in short, the squeeze is on us; the party is over\u2014at least for two weeks. Then I\u2019ll have money again. (Overindulgence, thy name is Hunter!)<br><br>But even though all these are pretty overt signs of galloping dissipation, they really aren\u2019t my main source of concern. The real difference between this latest binge and all the others of the past two years is that I seem to have lost what I think is the most important thing a writer can have: the ability to live with constant loneliness and a strong sense of revulsion for the banalities of everyday socializing. It just doesn\u2019t seem very important anymore that I write. I can understand this, I think, in light of what I call \u201cthe psychology of imposition.\u201d This theory holds that the most overriding of all human desires is the need to amount to something. I\u2019m not talking about the old Horatio Alger gimmick, but the more basic desire to know that your life means something. As Faulkner says, writing is his way of saying \u201cKilroy was here,\u201d of imposing himself, however briefly, on reality. If only for an instant, the image of the man is imposed on the chaotic mainstream of life and it remains there forever: order out of chaos, meaning out of meaninglessness. Just as some people turn to religion to find meaning, the writer turns to his craft and tries to impose meaning, or to sift the meaning out of chaos and put it in order.<br>[...]", "time": 1671577143, "resto": 21407914}, {"no": 21410982, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:01:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21410970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21410970</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[continued]</span><br>But\u2014and here is where I\u2019m going to try to justify my reason for not feeling the need to write\u2014there is a school of thought (Oswald Spengler) which has classified men in one of two categories: the action men and the thought men. These are vague terms and Spengler\u2019s were unquestionably better\u2014but you should know what I mean, even if you don\u2019t agree with me. So we look at people like Joyce or Proust or Pound, or for that matter, almost any of history\u2019s best writers, and we find virtually the same personality type (of the two, anyway). But they were all people who depended on their writing to give them the meaning or the satisfaction, if you will, that they sought.<br><br>And then we have Rabelais, and Hemingway and to some extent Fitzgerald and certainly a host of others I\u2019m not going to take the time to think about right now. Certainly the example of Hemingway should be enough.<br><br>Pause for re-location and abstract commentary of sorts \u2026 I\u2019ve just been reading Time\u2019s biographical file on Kingsley Amis (Lucky Jim) and the new British intellectuals. Somerset Maugham has a beautiful comment which I\u2019m not at all surprised to have missed in many another article on the \u201cangry young men.\u201d He says, and I quote: \u201cit (Lucky Jim) describes a new class, the white-collar proletariat \u2026 which does not go to the university to acquire culture, but to get a job, and when they get one, scamp it. Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public house and drink six beers. They are mean, malicious, envious \u2026 they are scum.\u201d<br><br>Good old Maugham: it\u2019s good to see the sledge-hammer coming down from the top for a change, instead of striking up at the belly of society from the bottom.<br><br>Of course you\u2019re so far out of it up there that you probably don\u2019t realize that the \u201cbeat generation\u201d is taking over American literature, while the \u201cangry young men\u201d are the driving force in Britain. And although I\u2019m neither beat nor necessarily angry, I\u2019m glad to see somebody taking a stand for a change. It\u2019s the first real \u201cmovement\u201d in literature in many a year: a point of reference, if nothing else. The writing world seems at least to have settled into two very definitely opposing camps: the pedants and the hobos. Most of the best writers fit in neither camp, of course, but then very few of them ever have. A good writer stands above movements, neither a leader nor a follower, but a bright white golf ball in a fairway of wind-blown daisies. (If you\u2019ve never played golf, you won\u2019t understand how pleasant it is to walk down a fairway and see forty or fifty balls where yours should be\u2014and then come a little closer and recognize the ball, a little rounder and a little whiter than the rest, and a hell of a lot more solid. The moral of this story is: Play golf!)<br>But I forgot that you\u2019re Iceland\u2019s answer to Jane Austen, so I\u2019ll close this harangue and get back to my original thesis.<br>[...]", "time": 1671577272, "resto": 21407914}, {"no": 21410988, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:03:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21410982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21410982</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[continued]</span><br>I was talking about the need to impose oneself on reality and the difference between action men and thought men. (I think that statement makes the whole thing more clear and concise than my entire first page succeeded in doing.)<br><br>But it\u2019s obvious that the need is there and that the two categories of men have two different ways of doing it. And it seems that the ones who are either unable or unwilling to impose themselves on life through their actions are the ones who succeed most significantly in the thought (or writing, in this case) category.<br><br>Now Hemingway seems to have done it from both angles: he\u2019s not even bothered\u2014or possibly not been able\u2014to create his own world in his books (\u00e0 la Joyce, James, Faulkner, Proust, etc.) but he\u2019s mastered reality and still managed to become one hell of a good writer as well. (There are others, of course, but Hemingway serves as such a good example because his life and times are so familiar as to still apply in our day.)<br><br>But Fitzgerald tried and Fitzgerald failed and Fitzgerald didn\u2019t learn to think until it was too late. He was probably one of the great natural talents of any age and he could make a typewriter sound like a piano when he was in form, but he was not a thinker\u2014and neither was (or is) Hemingway. And yet, they\u2019re both\u2014from the point of view of natural facility with the world\u2014two of the best writers of the century, anyway.<br><br>So the difference, I think, boils down to this: you can either impose yourself on reality and then write about it, or you can impose yourself on reality by writing.<br><br>It\u2019s time to go now: I have to go down to the Village and destroy some furniture.

It is a choice we must all make\u2014consciously or unconsciously\u2014at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you\u2019ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don\u2019t see how it could have been anything but a choice\u2014however indirect\u2014between the two things I\u2019ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.<br><br>But why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he\u2019s not after the \u201cbig rock candy mountain,\u201d the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?<br><br>The answer\u2014and, in a sense, the tragedy of life\u2014is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It\u2019s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on.

If you\u2019re genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you\u2019re doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.)<br><br>But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.<br><br>But don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors\u2014but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires\u2014including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.<br><br>As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal) he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).", "time": 1671578350, "resto": 21407914}, {"no": 21411126, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:37:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411057</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[continued}</span><br>In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life\u2014the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.<br><br>Let\u2019s assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let\u2019s assume that you can\u2019t see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN\u2014and here is the essence of all I\u2019ve said-you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.<br><br>Naturally, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. You\u2019ve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn\u2019t any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.<br><br>So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.<br><br>But you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know where to look; I don\u2019t know what to look for.\u201d And there\u2019s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don\u2019t know\u2014is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.<br><br>If I don\u2019t call this to a halt, I\u2019m going to find myself writing a book. I hope it\u2019s not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it\u2019s pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo\u2014this merely happens to be mine.<br><br>If any part of it doesn\u2019t seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I\u2019m not trying to send you out \u201con the road\u201d in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that\u2014no one HAS to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that\u2019s what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You\u2019ll have lots of company.<br><br>And that\u2019s it for now.

His disciples are way worse and will take simplifications he made as representative and teach them as simple statements of historical fact, especially about Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke. <br><br><a href=\"#p21411193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411193</a><br>Strauss definitely didn&#039;t believe in progress or equality, he basically agreed with Schmitt on most things, he just thought that we had two choices once this worldview is accepted: fascist states or a world of open states. He chose the latter option, except for Israel, which is allowed to be a fascist state. Politically he&#039;s a dead end, and that&#039;s before even considering how huge and nepotistic his network of followers is. They are poison to any movement, their function has nothing to do with ideas and everything to do with stripping movements of their radicalism and turning them into vehicles for Straussianism. Strauss could have taught anything and it wouldn&#039;t matter, as long as they perform this colonizing and neutralizing function. But he&#039;s still good for critiques of liberalism and relativism. <br><br>Natural Right and History is the usual starting point, or something like &quot;What is Political Philosophy?&quot; His best writings are the hardest to get into, and his most commonly recommended writings you can only really get fully when you read them again with better knowledge. I think this was on purpose. He was trying to convert Americans he looked down on, and thought couldn&#039;t handle sophisticated philosophy. I would read the Cropsey/Strauss History of Political Philosophy maybe, and Gottfried&#039;s book. <br><br><a href=\"#p21411542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411542</a><br>Not that anon but Strauss never got over his two dominant influences: Nietzsche and Heidegger. His whole methodology and outlook, which he never shows and which his followers are too stupid to understand, is Heidegger. If you want to see it more clearly, read Strauss&#039; friend Klein. But the other influence, Nietzsche, was definitive for him. Strauss never got over his teen reading of Nietzsche, that is, radical atheism and relativism.<br><br><a href=\"#p21411548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411548</a><br>You&#039;re not that far off. For whatever reason, other major Jewish thinkers of the 20th century like Arendt are also unmetaphysical or antimetaphysical and think philosophy should focus entirely on the this worldly. Marx was the same way. You just can&#039;t find a metaphysics in Marx. He&#039;s so secular and atheistic, he takes the Enlightenment so for granted in its deconstructive aspect (like Nietzsche), that he doesn&#039;t even think it&#039;s interesting to mention or talk about metaphysics. Wittgenstein was more subtle philosophically but at least in terms of his written philosophy even he ends up with basically the same position: philosophy is therapy, the most we can do is keep the dialogue going for eternity.", "time": 1671588066, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21411625, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)21:06:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411603</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;especially about Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke</span><br>Scholars who hate Strauss like and cite his books on Hobbes, his position on Locke as having a Hobbesian basis was just confirmed a few months back by the discovery of an account of Locke from one of his friends on how he read and recommended Hobbes all the time, and if you mean numerology re: Machiavelli, then I would agree that that&#039;s very unlikely, but that aside his Machiavelli interpretation isn&#039;t even different in substance from modern interpreters who nominally disagree with him (same goes for Xenophon).", "time": 1671588395, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21411656, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)21:16:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411603</a><br>For the rest of this (and of your commets in past threads, if you&#039;re the same anon I&#039;m thinking of), there&#039;s points I agree with and points where I strongly disagree.

Take the Poet Laureate seat, for example. Every single one is a solid poet, some better than others, but even so, just one glance at the list and it is clear the politics of race play a role. However, on the flip side of that, the politics of race have excluded even more than they&#039;ve included. I do believe the pendulum has swung too far to the other side at this point, but at the time Morrison was coming to fame, it was predominantly on the basis of two things - her skill and her very open feelings on race as a window into the pain of a Black woman for White people. At least, that&#039;s how I see her. Shortly after, you may or may not remember, but Hollywood had a strong desire to pay tribute to the plight of Native Americans which went on for about a decade (the 90s). I don&#039;t have anything wrong with that. I think there&#039;s a lot we can all gain, on everyside, from examining the difficulties of one another&#039;s lives. My problem is that the recent trend is one of unjust vengeance, rather than brotherhood, or at least countrymen. On that note, I own Morrison&#039;s, &quot;Beloved,&quot; but haven&#039;t gotten into it yet, though I&#039;ve tried to start it before. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean much. I tried to watch Jacques Tati&#039;s, &quot;Playtime,&quot; three times before I actually got into it, and now I regard it as a masterpiece of modern cinema - the Book of Leviticus and of Numbers are other good examples of my initially unappreciated gems. I did want to mention, however, I once read an excerpt from a book of hers on here - Song of Solomon, I think. I found it exceptionally racist and distateful. I would never approve of something like that - no matter the race of the author. I&#039;m not okay with racism against anyone. <br><br>In case it isn&#039;t clear, my answer is: I think she&#039;s a talented writer whose race and time certainly played a role - as it does for most authors. I&#039;ve heard it said, &quot;An author is necessarily of his time,&quot; and the 1980s, the period I believe she came to fame during, were the first time in American history a generation of Black children were reaching adulthood in true freedom, and the gold line of dawn began to show. You may notice Black sung patriotic ballads were hailed in those years... Anyway, I haven&#039;t read enough of her to judge, because it hasn&#039;t yet resonated with me, despite her talent as a writer. <br><br>What do you think of her?", "time": 1671451002, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404270, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)09:19:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I read her, wanted to feel smug about disliking her, but Beloved is legit, much better, much more literary, than the slavery misery porn I was expecting<br>Jazz, Sula and the Bluest Eye are good too.<br>She&#039;s the equal of Bellow or Roth or Updike who also hoovered up a bunch of accolades at the same time but don&#039;t have threads like this made about them", "time": 1671459559, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404784, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:05:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403616</a><br>song of solomon is amazing. it has that grotesque realism in the flavor or your oe or mccarthy.<br><br>she didn&#039;t establish herself because of her race, if anything it&#039;s the opposite as her race probably held her back earlier on in her career.", "time": 1671469512, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404789, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:07:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403671</a><br>her race held her back from being included earlier on in her career, meaning she should&#039;ve been enjoying the readership she has now, many years ago.", "time": 1671469636, "resto": 21403616}, {"no": 21404906, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:38:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404270</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but Beloved is legit, much better, much more literary, than the slavery misery porn I was expecting</span><br>Agreed, the story really transcends the time and place it takes place in.

First of all, realize that there are no other civilizations left, and there haven&#039;t been for centuries, so the predicate &quot;Western&quot; is superfluous and even misleading (since it implies the existence of alternatives). Second, the fact that this question is even raised proves that the vast majority of so-called civilized individuals are nothing of the kind. I mean, you are seriously asking me whether a culture that&#039;s about to figure out how to print human organs is declining? What the fuck do all the minor symptoms of decline you are rabidly pointing out to us mean compared to such utterly astonishing and previously even unimaginable accomplishments? Not to mention the arrival of a person who has managed to reach the very end of philosophy itself, which is to say of thought! which is an immeasurably harder and more valuable achievement! (since it was thought which created the theories with the help of which the machines that print human organs were designed in the first place, and so on). \u2014 In summa, the only one who is declining here are those who are saying that we are declining, which is a classic case of psychological projection. Civilization as a whole is obviously progressing, and its highest manifestation and greatest triumph so far is blatantly obviously myself (and imagine how much more glorious and fearsome I would become with genetically enhanced printed organs... or cybernetically enhanced and cloned to infinity to spread out and take over the entire universe...)&quot;<br><br>Completely embarrassing. Doesn&#039;t think about the problem for longer than two seconds so forgets that Eastern civilization exists too. Argument for why more technology = better civilization doesn&#039;t exist (would icy like to live in a civilization where he gets stabbed in the balls constantly but the iphone 20 is out?), just shames reader and fails to grasp the necessity to point out a normative force that justifies this (through really it&#039;s just because it&#039;s another application of the muh we should create da overman). Self-worshiping narcissism calling himself genius after he did the same thing yet again, more shaming, overman fantasies etc.<br><br>Pretty much all of his aphorisms can be broken down in a similar manner.

That&#039;s how it&#039;s been with me this year. <br>Although I still feel that urge to consume and tally books and other media, I&#039;ve also realized this year that it doesn&#039;t matter how many books you read, as long as you are reading, because you can only do one thing at a time. The more important thing is how deeply engaged you are with what you read. I have a list of over 100 books I want to read, and I still find myself searching for new titles. The searching is a source of pleasure in itself. It&#039;s like window shopping. It also provides a feeling of security, in that you are satisfied at having made the best decision which will ensure pleasure and safety in the future. Additionally it&#039;s a release of tension, but the tension is due to a buildup of anxiety rather than of a physical need. I put all of this behaviour under the category of mental masturbation, where masturbation is an analogy for the release of tension.<br>I think the source of this mental masturbation behaviour is anxiety. You want to experience as much as possible before it&#039;s too late. You want other people to see you experiencing many things. Fundamentally, you want to make the correct choices from among a staggering sea of options. It&#039;s the same as what gives rise to self-improvement obsessions, as well as the tendency to categorize things into top 10 lists. Too much choice creates confusion about the future. Anxiety is born of intelligence and the overabundance of choice. The intelligence faculty is driven to strike an optimal path through the sea of choice, and arrive at an orderly route. <br>If either choice or intelligence is reduced, the anxiety does not occur. Imagine a person with access to fewer books (let alone other media). When they found one great book, they would cherish it and reread it many times. It would inform the development of their mind to a much greater degree than someone who blows through 20 profound books in a year because there are too many to read and they want to check their list off. <br>But would the person with less choice be better off? Probably, but not necessarily. If people can recognize the process of anxious tension and release, and exercise a little bit of self-control, they can utilize their overabundance of choice by narrowing their focus drastically when their they find a book or an author they engage with deeply. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr </span><br>Do one thing at a time.", "time": 1671539571, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408719, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:35:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405913</a><br>the anti audiobook thing is pure cope", "time": 1671539743, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408727, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:41:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21408719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21408719</a><br>They&#039;re okay, personally I prefer audio-reading electronic music or ASMR.", "time": 1671540100, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408739, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:47:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405898</a><br>Reading slowly and attentively is important, especially if you&#039;re reading literary fiction or the type of philosophy where the &#039;feel&#039; of the ideas counts.<br><br>For a long time I was reading things on the train on the way to work, just skimming over stories to fill time.

The coping is in part noticing all of the odd aspects of CW, but also in mixing up the mundane aspects of human life that existed prior to clown world. It&#039;s as if they take all human existence to be something just made up in the last decade and thus ready for critique. So on one hand they will accurately &quot;call-out&quot; something like the continued debasement of language among their peers, but lump in mundane language as if that is also a new debasement. They have no understanding that much of what they consider to be cogent sparks of social-critique have already been discussed widely in the 90s. <br><br>It&#039;s hard to present a list of items of this odd behavior, but I notice it like spotting an ESL.

In his own day he was said to be\u2014with Queen Victoria and Prime Minister William Gladstone\u2014one of the three most famous living persons, a reputation no other poet writing in English has ever had. As official poetic spokesman for the reign of Victoria, he felt called upon to celebrate a quickly changing industrial and mercantile world with which he felt little in common, for his deepest sympathies were called forth by an unaltered rural England; the conflict between what he thought of as his duty to society and his allegiance to the eternal beauty of nature seems peculiarly Victorian. Even his most severe critics have always recognized his lyric gift for sound and cadence, a gift probably unequaled in the history of English poetry.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A number of phrases from Tennyson&#039;s work have become commonplace in the English language, including &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw&quot; (&quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;), &quot;&#039;Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all&quot;, &quot;Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die&quot;, &quot;My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure&quot;, &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;, &quot;Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers&quot;, and &quot;The old order changeth, yielding place to new&quot;. He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Tears, Idle Tears&quot; is a lyric poem by the Victorian poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. It was originally embedded in his 1847 narrative poem The Princess, where it is sung by a court maiden. The poem is an emotionally intense meditation on the passing of time and the loss of friends and loved ones. This subject matter might be partly explained by the fact that Tennyson wrote the poem after a visit to the destitute Tintern Abbey, near the grave of a dear friend.</span>", "filename": "Lord Tennyson", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 782, "h": 1024, "tn_w": 95, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671581598329746, "time": 1671581598, "md5": "/vTs91Pa/G1lR2WvtUVVwA==", "fsize": 120496, "resto": 21411240}, {"no": 21412962, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)04:56:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411240</a><br>It&#039;s aight", "time": 1671616599, "resto": 21411240}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21404831, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:18:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "My intellectual heroes", "filename": "47E84B3F-3870-476D-9F2C-A128EBD2DD5B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 697, "h": 710, "tn_w": 245, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1671470322928730, "time": 1671470322, "md5": "LBVoj6rIXt807ZszCa+uFg==", "fsize": 337411, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "my-intellectual-heroes", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 48, "images": 8, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 21404837, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:20:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What do you think OP looks like, /lit/?", "time": 1671470415, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404842, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:21:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404831</a><br>where my bald boys at", "time": 1671470507, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404846, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:22:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404837</a><br>A retard because the text of his post directly contradicts 3 of the people in that garbage chart.", "time": 1671470555, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404847, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:22:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ayn Rand</span><br>Please tell me you&#039;re being sarcastic.", "time": 1671470569, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404850, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:23:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404842</a><br><a href=\"//boards.4channel.org/fit/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/fit/</a>", "time": 1671470607, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404932, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:45:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404846</a><br>/thread<br><br>this 3x3 makes little to no sense", "time": 1671471922, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21404943, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)12:47:18", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "C433358C-8FFA-48A9-B5E7-985572ED27B8", "ext": ".png", "w": 1546, "h": 2138, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671472038800442, "time": 1671472038, "md5": "+fi/nJkEiRd2nU77ahp2hg==", "fsize": 3204500, "resto": 21404831}, {"no": 21405013, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)13:07:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I only recognize Stirner, Rand and Nietzsche.

That spirit of bitter disgust at the world that leads you to wish death upon virtually all the human race, it is so tiresome and at this point, my spirit recoils from it. Nothing Kaczynski says has to be wrong, as such, but he takes it as a given that there is no God and that the religious worldview has already been disproven. He might have good reason for this, but it is never brought up. If you disagree with him on this presupposition, however, none of it really matters anymore. This world is rotten to its core. Alienated from its original design. Men will never be content, even in primitivist bliss. There can be no salvation in the workings of men, it isn&#039;t to be found amongst bands of hunter-gatherers in deep forests. All joy of that life is but a foretaste of Heaven. Civilization, wilderness, these are temporal affairs, yet we are immortal souls merely embodied in the temporal. Our ultimate aim is not that. Our existence here is for the ultimate purpose of unifiction with the Divine, by allowing us to ascend the ladder of spiritual ascent. In the face of this, even if everything Kaczynski says is right, ceases to be important. In fact, it is to be expected, as degeneration, decay and entropy are all inherent in the Fallen Creation, as gold turns into silver and silver into bronze.<br><br>In the view of the infinite life, I no longer care. Yes, I have given up, I am an anti-revolutionary element. I do, I suppose, what the Techno-Industrial System would want me to. Though, it&#039;s not like there is a movement, in the first place, or even any potential seed for a movement. Kaczynski has entierly failed to inspire one, and even if one were to be created, the question of if and Anti-Tech Revolution would even be possible remains unanswered, and I think there is reason to be pessimistic. As of now, I am resigned to a life of minimizing technology to the greatest extent I am capable of. I do not care to extending this life to the masses. Neither did Kaczynski, but I also accept that total liberation from the Machine isn&#039;t possible. I suppose you could put it that this age, being so far removed from the Primeval state, doesn&#039;t allow even its hermits the freedom the previous ages allowed theirs.

The industrial society is incompatible with with the theological order and bestows upon man capacity for evil unlike any other.

But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted.

Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side. History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution[35], the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some \u201cgreen\u201d party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the \u201cgreen\u201d party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.</span><br>You couldn&#039;t even remember my previous post where I mention this.

Such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous.[21]</span><br><br>?124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about \u201cmedical ethics.\u201d But a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were \u201cethical\u201d, and others were not, so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an \u201cethical\u201d use of genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. No code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today\u2019s world). Inevitably, genetic engineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial-technological system.[22]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[some more but I&#039;m keeping this short.

The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.

The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. Many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable. But we (FC) don\u2019t think it is inevitable. We think it can be stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;133. No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.

As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. French society and Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose is something along the same lines.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. But most revolutions have two goals. One is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries. The French and Russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite successful in destroying the old society.

Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we\u2019ve just described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: Individuals (at least those of the \u201cbourgeois\u201d type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more \u201csocialized\u201d than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of God\u2019s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed.</span><br>He tried to live in the wilderness and didn&#039;t want to become an adversarial agent.

No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.

It may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern man, as is shown by his shorter life expectancy; hence modern man suffers from less, not more than the amount of insecurity that is normal for human beings. But psychological security does not closely correspond with physical security. What makes us FEEL secure is not so much objective security as a sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves. Primitive man, threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger, can fight in self-defense or travel in search of food. He has no certainty of success in these efforts, but he is by no means helpless against the things that threaten him. The modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things against which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food, environmental pollution, war, increasing taxes, invasion of his privacy by large organizations, nationwide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his way of life. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;69. It is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that threaten him; disease for example. But he can accept the risk of disease stoically. It is part of the nature of things, it is no one\u2019s fault, unless it is the fault of some imaginary, impersonal demon. But threats to the modern individual tend to be MAN-MADE. They are not the results of chance but are IMPOSED on him by other persons whose decisions he, as an individual, is unable to influence. Consequently he feels frustrated, humiliated and angry. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;70. Thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or organizations that are too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them. So modern man\u2019s drive for security tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some areas (food, shelter etc.) his security is assured at the cost of only trivial effort, whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security. (The foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man.) </span><br>Bruh<br>Why are you even posting<br>Read the chapter &quot;DISRUPTION OF THE POWER PROCESS IN MODERN SOCIETY&quot;<br>I feel bad for you dude, honestly.

It\u2019s the driving intellectual force behind the nation\u2019s constitutional belief in legal equality. Educated citizens base their commitment to American ideals on it. This commitment shows up in our theories of democracy, in which each citizen has an equal vote, and our justice system, in which all humans are supposedly equal under the law. <br><br>But there\u2019s a problem: human equality isn\u2019t self-evident at all. <br><br>John Locke, whose intellectual ink is tattooed all over the Declaration of Independence, knew this. His theory of natural rights is based on the idea that God owns us as property. Human equality is self-evident only if you assume, as Locke did, that God has given us the natural rights that modern Americans take for granted. The original Constitution says that our \u201cunalienable rights\u201d are a result not of secular rationalism, but rather an omnipotent God who endows us with those rights. To that end, the pillars of American law rest as much on the Bible as on the writings of Enlightenment thinkers. Even our most \u201crational\u201d beliefs are downstream of religious thinking. <br><br>This creates cognitive dissonance for secular people who advocate for human rights. While they might not realize it, nine times out of ten, they\u2019ve unconsciously inherited a belief in human rights and are unaware of the foundational ideas which underpin that belief.

In the barbarian world, the weak were exploited by the strong and enslaved by the powerful. Ancient Rome provides an example.

It\u2019s also why Roman infants were routinely abandoned like Moses in the baby basket. To the modern mind, these actions are repugnant. <br><br>For that, we have to credit Christianity. The historian Tom Holland has called it the \u201cmost enduring and influential legacy of the ancient world, and its emergence the single most transformative development in Western history.\u201d Religious or not, every Westerner bathes in the waters of Christian ideology.

Human rights exist in their modern form because the Bible says that every person is made in the image of God\u2014imago dei. In turn, each person is granted unalienable rights, and those rights can\u2019t be taken away. But the contract breaks down if human beings aren\u2019t special. If humans are in the same category of every other animal, there is no intellectual scaffolding to uphold either human rights or the legal equality of man. Appealing to human rights just because we say so is as baseless as appealing to astrology or the will of Zeus. Even if a group of people can agree on how to treat people in the moment, consensus can change at any moment. Today\u2019s virtues can become tomorrow\u2019s vices. Like a sand castle, the tenets of morality can be destroyed by the tide of public opinion. <br><br>Without the word of God, all we have are opinions. Morality and justice are downgraded from indisputable truths to mere preferences and shared fictions. Both of those can change on a whim. In a world of one person\u2019s word against another, the most powerful person will control the moral landscape. This problem is one of the central themes of Dostoyevsky\u2019s writing: in an 1878 letter, he asked why he should live righteously in a world without a god. Assuming that there is no afterlife and that the police wouldn\u2019t catch him after a wrongdoing, he asks: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I cut another man\u2019s throat, rob, and steal?\u201d <br><br>Today, our answer boils down to human rights. To Dostoevsky\u2019s point, without the hand of God to shape human morality, many people will conclude that the benefits of a righteous life aren\u2019t worth the costs. In theory, we could base our belief in human rights on rationality and the mutual agreement that some actions are better than others. Maybe one day, people will worship the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights charter like they worship the Bible today. Doing so would take us away from the woo-woo of religion and towards the rigor of secular reason, where we can logically discern the differences between good and evil.

Immanuel Kant argued that humans deserve special respect because they are rational creatures, and therefore, ends in themselves. But that argument has problems too.

Look, I get it. The \u201cMan in the Sky\u201d idea of God seems ancient. Comical, even. Centering your life around a book written 2,000 years ago seems like the antithesis of progress.

Thus, we should deceive ourselves and become religious even though \u2014 wink, wink \u2014 it\u2019s false. <br><br>They justify this worldview with empirical data. For example, one study found that attending weekly religious services raises people\u2019s happiness as much as moving from the bottom quartile of income to the top. Moreover, doubling their rate of religious attendance raises their income by nine percent. Another study found that the percentage of Americans who rated their mental health as \u201cexcellent\u201d fell for everybody except those who attended a religious service in the past week.

Instead, she reads the scripture metaphorically. Hitchens, who was one of Christianity\u2019s fiercest critics, responded by saying: \u201cI would say that if you don\u2019t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you\u2019re really not in any meaningful sense a Christian.\u201d<br><br>Echoing Hitchens\u2019 point, Christianity is unique among religions because it has a self-destruct mechanism. The book of I Corinthians says that the truth of Christianity hinges upon the resurrection\u2019s historical reality \u2014 meaning that the story of Christ dying on the cross and coming back to life must be literally true. So if you discover that Christ was not raised, you should stop being Christian. End of story. Specifically, the text says: \u201cIf Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile\u2026 Those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.

Since Jesus\u2019 claims were so outlandish, he couldn\u2019t have been just a great moral teacher. You must take a stand. Christ was either the Son of God or a madman. Lewis writes: \u201cYou can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.\u201d<br><br>Though I find myself doing it all the time, thinking of religion metaphorically instead of literally is problematic. Christianity, and therefore the moral underpinnings of the West, is long-term stable to the extent that enough people believe in all that Christ claimed to be and the literal truth of his story. Ultimately, a religious affiliation built upon metaphors instead of hard truths is a worldview that\u2019ll crumble under the weight of scrutiny. <br><br>The Many Buckets of Faith<br><br>I have a confession to make: I\u2019ve spent my entire life in this metaphorical camp. Growing up, I attended a Jewish school where I took 40 minutes of both Hebrew and Biblical studies every day. But as early as elementary school, I thought I was above religious thinking. I \u201cknew\u201d that Moses didn\u2019t actually part the Red Sea and didn\u2019t ascend Mount Sinai to have an actual conversation with God. All that sounded as counterfeit as the tooth fairy. Even as I sang the Torah portion during my Bar Mitzvah to a crowd of a couple hundred friends and family members, I rejected the teachings I was chanting. Only after college did I discover that the ideas I passionately rejected, particularly the Old Testament and the Ten Commandments, were the bedrock of my moral philosophy. <br><br>Not just mine, all my friends too \u2014 and we didn\u2019t even know it. In retrospect, that\u2019s why we strive to treat disabled people with dignity and it\u2019s why sentences like this one from a government official inspire head-nodding agreement: \u201cA city is measured by how it treats the least of its brothers and sisters. That\u2019s what we all believe, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve grown up believing, and it\u2019s who we are.\u201d We agree with these ideas because Christianity is the invisible frame around modern thought. These moral conclusions are shaped by the Beatitudes where Christ instructs us to bless the poor, the meek, and the persecuted.

Further, the idea that the son of God was born of a virgin, traveled through contemporary Israel performing miracles, died on a cross, and came back to life seems as bizarre to me today as it did to the Romans two millennia ago. And yet, the intellectual history of Western civilization orbits around this story. <br><br>But because of my commitment to human rights, I\u2019m implicitly committed to Christian ideas\u2014or at the very least, a moral philosophy that\u2019s propped up by the Bible. And it\u2019s not just me. American law and culture are thoroughly Christian too. Though I\u2019m closer to an atheist than a believer, I shiver at the nihilistic conclusions of a world without God. One where morality follows intellectual fashion and leaders rule by the cold calculus of Excel spreadsheets. That, in turn, has opened my ears to the truth of Judeo-Christian teachings. <br><br>As for my religious odyssey, I\u2019m still not sure where I\u2019ll end up. I know I want to live critically, which starts with an examination of my worldview. I don\u2019t want to follow in the footsteps of my friends, who\u2019ve ignored the influence of religious ideas on the making of the Western Mind, not to mention my teachers, who didn\u2019t stop to investigate the words \u201cself-evident\u201d when they taught the Declaration of Independence.", "time": 1671381166, "resto": 21400581}, {"no": 21400617, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)11:33:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Their actions don\u2019t square up with their beliefs.

More plainly, contemporary right-wingers are people who were taught one thing by their parents (that was probably very much in vogue when they were taught it) and then came of age into a world where those values are long out of style. Because they are not prepared to abandon those values they pick the party (which is only one of two) that most closely resemble what their values are and ride or die with it. <br><br>Because patriotism and American exceptionalism are some of those holdout traditional values this makes for an easy fit despite the fact that the Republican Party, on closer inspection, is in reality a disgusting amalgam that, while paying lip service to the traditionalist crowd, in reality does not substantially support their interests or their values at all. We can characterize the pre-Trump Republican party as primarily being made up of poor/middle class traditionalists on one side and ultra-wealthy businessmen on the other. Due to the fact that the libertarian-leaning lingo of the businessmen uses the same keywords that the poorer party-members have learned to revere (freedom, personal choice, personal responsibility, free markets, low taxes, low government involvement etc) the treachery of the business class is hidden, and they are able to pursue interests that are very much at odds with the poorer classes while making only a few concessions that are useless anyway (gun control, abortion, Christianity). <br><br>So to answer the OP, the reason right wing books are cringe is because the Republican platform is incomprehensible and not consistent. There isn&#039;t a driving force behind it except to lower labor costs. It&#039;s a catch-all for the people that get fucked over by Progressivism. <br><br>Also important to note this is why people like Trump get elected, and why the base is so receptive to ideologies that speak to them from a more philosophically-grounded place (Populism, Carl Schmitt&#039;s existentialism).<br><br><a href=\"#p21397964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397964</a><br>Destiny is a clown.", "time": 1671346246, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399385, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)01:59:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21397583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21397583</a><br>fpbp", "time": 1671346776, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399541, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:29:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21398212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21398212</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;largely reinforced with the fact that no self-respecting intellectual wants to be associated with the embarrassment that is modern right-wing politics</span><br>This is a bit misleading.

This means that a lot of RW figures come from different walks of life and as such their takes aren&#039;t going to be as refined as they could&#039;ve been, and coupled with the thing that I&#039;ll go over below makes it an embarrassing shitshow.<br>Then the main problem is that RW politics is deliberately setup to work out an electable position and grift the shit out of it. You&#039;re the reasonable guy who doesn&#039;t encourage leftist excesses, you deserve the vote. The problem is that this spineless position means that their base can say fuck it I&#039;m voting for the guy that&#039;s further right, you&#039;re just leftists with more inertia anyway and that&#039;s something they don&#039;t want. As such when you look at political landscape in countries like Germany, Poland, the UK and the US you notice that the right wing parties are trying their hardest to make anyone to the right from them unelectable and they do it via means of public scrutiny and defamation. This means that they will actively attack people to the right from them and won&#039;t offer them support when they need it(good example of that is the cancellation of Samuel Francis by National Review crew). Leftist political formations on the other hand cultivate their radicals(they&#039;ll only get rid of the real stinkers like open and unapologetic pedophile advocates), they won&#039;t give them everything they want for political reasons, but they will setup what amounts to patronage networks to give them the ability to be subversive and &quot;generate ideals&quot;, obviously something made much simpler by the fact that the academia is captive so at this point every taxpayer pays for leftists to give patronage to their radicals in public universities, but even without it they would always do it.<br>To put it simpler - leftists don&#039;t engage in witch hunts against &quot;communists&quot;, but rightists engage in hunts against &quot;fascists&quot;(obviously both words are rendered meaningless because both communism and fascism are as dead as absolute monarchy based on divine right is, you can bring them back but it&#039;ll be just LARP)", "time": 1671352156, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399547, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:33:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399211</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studies show </span><br><br>Studies show the opposite is true actually.", "time": 1671352392, "resto": 21397576}, {"no": 21399568, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)03:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21399547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21399547</a><br>Depends on year and how do you distinguish between the two.

The right will succeed - and really, has already succeeded - insofar as it takes a disintegrative and materialist approach to political subjectivity (i.e if it moves beyond things like racialized politics and insipid populism, to a sort of extreme darwinism). The right is in the unique position to identify with the entire ecology, rather than a particular political subject. The left, frankly speaking, cannot do this. It is intrinsically caught up in certain subjectivities, and that&#039;s why it will lose. The right should identify with capital itself, against all else. How does the left plan to account for things like labour&#039;s substitution driving the creation and proliferation of AI? UBI? Fat chance of that. AI alone makes questions about environmental and demographic collapse manifoldly more complex. It is a fantastic example of the sort of boundary expansion which is absolutely traumatic to the left and right alike. The left basically operates under the basic assumption that capitalism will eat itself, and will be dialectically overcome by some revolutionary subject. But what if capitalism outlasts humanity itself? The ultimate pill is realizing that machinic superintelligence has already secured the legacy of the Anglo-American and East Asian (especially Chinese) civilizations.

Things are introduced over time, not in big exposition dumps and not (as often) as dues ex machina to move the plot along.

A big problem in the genre is shit getting wrapped up very quickly by inorganic introductions (I love Gibson, but he has definitely done this, Olympus is another example).<br><br>Brown also creates differentiated enough, enjoyable characters. Some might be caricatures, but they stand out well. GRRM is really great at this. The genre as a whole struggles with this, having characters serving as mere means to move the descriptions along. Case in point from an author I actually like quite a bit: all of Alistair Reynolds&#039; characters are emotionless engineers.

Figuring that their food supply is about to begin running dangerously low they make their way across America and Canada to the Yukon Territory and Alaska were they hope that isolated hold out towns and settlements will be able to supply them with food for the coming future (if it isnt already obvious, they eat people). Once they reach one of these towns though they come to realize that the town already has its own more supernatural problem. Obviously, werewolves (later revealed to mainly be 2 girls, hence the lvl 25/lvl80 image, along with some other randoms), who have originally come to the isolated area to escape persecution by modern scientific society and live free where they cant be hurt or hurt anyone (much) else. With the supply chain collapsing, dumpster loot is becoming scarcer and scarcer and overhunting is bringing the elk population down, forcing the werewolves to also head in to town to search for food.

(There is no contradiction here; an individual whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer from stress, frustration, defeat. His path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.) Child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in most if not all cultures. Tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone. But many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly. Is spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse? The question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in well with the existing system of society. In practice, the word \u201cabuse\u201d tends to be interpreted to include any method of child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system. Thus, when they go beyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing \u201cchild abuse\u201d are directed toward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system.</span>", "time": 1671577626, "resto": 21406114}, {"no": 21411028, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)18:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21410991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21410991</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;let&#039;s demonize psychologists and therapists, I&#039;m sure that will work great</span><br>I&#039;m not sure how that relates to my post<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who has experience with resolving problems in relationships between family members so they can grow stronger?</span><br>Anyone with a family?
