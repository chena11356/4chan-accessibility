Now, had my eyes been open, it is very likely the business might have been a great deal worse, for how many a confounded slip is daily got by man with all his foresight about him. Besides, the eyes of the understanding see best when those of the senses are out of the way, and therefore blind men are observed to tread their steps with much more caution, and conduct, and judgment than those who rely with too much confidence upon the virtue of the visual nerve, which every little accident shakes out of order, and a drop or a film can wholly disconcert; like a lanthorn among a pack of roaring bullies when they scour the streets, exposing its owner and itself to outward kicks and buffets, which both might have escaped if the vanity of appearing would have suffered them to walk in the dark. But further, if we examine the conduct of these boasted lights, it will prove yet a great deal worse than their fortune. It is true I have broke my nose against this post, because Providence either forgot, or did not think it convenient, to twitch me by the elbow and give me notice to avoid it. But let not this encourage either the present age of posterity to trust their noses unto the keeping of their eyes, which may prove the fairest way of losing them for good and all. For, O ye eyes, ye blind guides, miserable guardians are ye of our frail noses; ye, I say, who fasten upon the first precipice in view, and then tow our wretched willing bodies after you to the very brink of destruction. But alas! that brink is rotten, our feet slip, and we tumble down prone into a gulf, without one hospitable shrub in the way to break the fall\u2014a fall to which not any nose of mortal make is equal, except that of the giant Laurcalco, who was Lord of the Silver Bridge.

What it does well, it does extraordinarily well, and there are flickering moments throughout the lagging second half as solid as as anything from Darkstalker legends at times. It\u2019s an excellent entry into the series and a fantastic pov of what I consider to be one of this series\u2019 most interesting POV characters to date. I have been chomping at the bit to get Qibli\u2019s perspective, as keenly observant and wildly funny as he\u2019s proven to be in previous installments, and on that front Darkness of Dragons is excellent. It also does an unexpectedly hard pivot job into being an exploration on morals, examining the right and wrong ways to use power, and the temptation that exists in all of us to have that power against the backdrop of an emerging new dragon world order led by Darkstalker. This plot is much more of a fantasy epic than any of the other mainline books. The star of this book, Qibli, is much more interesting than I was expecting. I hesitated at the thought of Qibli as the central focus at first, as I thought I wasn&#039;t very interested in his character. But, it turns out he&#039;s the best pov besides Moonwatcher of book 7 and Darkstalker from his solo side-novel (Cannot recommend that book enough)<br><br>As a climax, Darkness of Dragons ends up stumbling in all the same ways that Brightest Night and warrior cats arcs did way back when as well. If I were to pinpoint any weakness in Sutherland/Erin\u2019s writing, it would be that--for all her brilliance in creating characters, introducing interesting and logical plot throughlines or escalating in stakes--she struggles with delivering a satisfying, climactic ending. The final decisions are made too hastily without enough build-up, and the entire first part of Darkness of Dragons feels like it could have been a novella all on its own, a really good one mind you seeing as it&#039;s on a whole the best section of this story but it having very little bearing on the rest of the arc, or even the rest of this book is iritible.<br><br>Darkness of Dragons tries to handle many different characters doing a touch too many different things at once in spite of it&#039;s thick page count which weakens the impact of the story and mucks up the pacing somewhat because of just how necessarily long the desert adventure had to go on for (again that desert adventure is the best section overall and I&#039;m not complaining about it per-say). I actually would have liked to see this book broken down into two books, with the finale being a sixth book from Kinkajou\u2019s POV since she does a number of important actions in the later third already and to give the final series of events the gravitas they deserved and detailing some events going offcreen on during Qubli&#039;s desert romp.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rating: 4.3/5</span>", "filename": "f81977801e82fb96faa15a5486951ea1[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 6338, "h": 2550, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 50, "tim": 1672704790715199, "time": 1672704790, "md5": "RYoqqumhldOxWzCAvDDR2A==", "fsize": 1858935, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470831, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:16:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21470812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21470812</a><br>your &quot;&quot;&quot;reviews&quot;&quot;&quot; are shit<br>FUCK OFF", "time": 1672704997, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470835, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:17:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21470812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21470812</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;exploration on morals, examining the right and wrong ways to use power, and the temptation that exists in all of us to have that power against the backdrop of an emerging new dragon world order</span><br>Sounds like some &quot;great man&quot;/white knight nonsense.", "time": 1672705041, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470855, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:22:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "https://warosu.org/lit/?task=search<wbr>&amp;ghost=yes&amp;search_text=%22your+%22%<wbr>22%22reviews%22%22%22+are+shit%22<br>bawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww lol", "time": 1672705338, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470869, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:25:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21470855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21470855</a><br>based ritual poster", "time": 1672705534, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470878, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:28:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468286</a><br>Ender&#039;s game, specifically the sequels.", "time": 1672705680, "resto": 21467829}, {"no": 21470939, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)19:40:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21470812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21470812</a><br>Stop yourself now drag-anon or you will end up wasting your time by wandering into the realm of bug-dragon mediocrity that is WoF&#039;s third arc.

Being from a family of perennial serfs, out of nowhere instead of being looked down by dukes and their dames, you&#039;re brotherly empathized by smart, well dressed, intelligent people giving invigorating speeches, making sense, and giving direction during confusing times (Russia WWI). Suddenly mesmerized by western style modernisation, things you&#039;ve never seen before, technology, new buildings, urbanism, apartments, radio, education. Suddenly you and your brothers are an integral part of the state, you receive education, unimagined upward social mobility, lifting this massive state engineer by engineer out of feudalism. You go on Subbotniks, you build houses for free, because you&#039;re building the future. Entire cities built in Siberian steppes and taiga. You&#039;re unquestionably part of the future and you&#039;d give your life in a heartbeat.<br><br>The individual aspect is admittedly more speculative and one of my more wild understandings. I believe there&#039;s a type of Stockholm Syndrome. People have a tendency to value things more, the more they demand from you. It&#039;s why religions, cults, sports teams, sororities etc. have high membership costs. Not money but rules, tradition, demands, expectations. This investment of energy produces a need for justifications inside members heads, meaning you will never have to remind them why they wanna belong. They do it themselves, repeatedly. Every time they partake in ritual. The Stockholm Syndrome comes in play when people die. It&#039;s WWI+civil war+forced collectivization+party cleansing Russia we&#039;re talking about. Arduous amounts of sacrifice required from members, ie most everyone. You get a glimpse here and there whereby even the leaders are deeply traumatized by what&#039;s happening, what they do, the papers they sign, the people they doom. So they rationalize.

By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England, Fourierists in France, [See Robert Owen and Fran\u00e7ois Fourier] both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in both cases men outside the working-class movement, and looking rather to the \u201ceducated&quot; classes for support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany. Thus, in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, \u201crespectable\u201d; communism was the very opposite. And as our notion, from the very beginning, was that \u201cthe emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself,\u201d there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take. Moreover, we have, ever since, been far from repudiating it.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/archive/ma<wbr>rx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/p<wbr>reface.htm", "time": 1672676907, "resto": 21460776}, {"no": 21468783, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:28:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468775</a><br><a href=\"#p21468779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468779</a><br>or rather the only communists*", "time": 1672676913, "resto": 21460776}, {"no": 21468789, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:30:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21464059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21464059</a><br>funny since central asia was one of the most fervent support bases of the bolsheviks", "time": 1672677042, "resto": 21460776}, {"no": 21468794, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)11:33:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468789</a><br>There were skirmishes with basmachi until 40s in central asia.", "time": 1672677181, "resto": 21460776}, {"no": 21469692, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)14:59:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468532</a><br>Yknow we always see people claim that the USSR lived off of Lend Lease.

I will try to be a correct animal though, and if you throw me a bone with enough meat on it I may even lick your hand.\u201d He was enough of an aesthete to modify his misanthropy with irony and to introduce a note of elegance into the economy of his disasters. His casual style lets us glimpse what we might call the charm of a broken life. I should even add that one is \u201cmodern\u201d to the degree that one is sensitive to this charm. Reaction of the disabused, no doubt \u2014 of individuals who, incapable of resorting to a metaphysical background or to a transcendent form of salvation, cling to their woes with complacency, as to accepted defeats. Disillusion is the equilibrium of the defeated. And it was as a defeated man that Fitzgerald, after conceiving the pitiless truths of The Crack-Up, went to Hollywood to look for success \u2014 always success \u2014 in which, moreover, he could no longer believe. At the end of a Pascalian experience, to write screenplays! In his last years, it was as if he no longer aspired to anything but compromising his abysses, swallowing his neuroses \u2014 as if, in his heart of hearts, he felt himself unworthy of the downfall he had just suffered. \u201cI speak with the authority of failure,\u201d he had said one day. Except that with time, he degraded this failure, stripped it of all its spiritual value. Nor should we be surprised: in the \u201creal dark night of the soul,\u201d he struggled more as a victim than as a hero. The same is true of all those who live their drama solely in terms of psychology; unsuited to perceiving an exterior absolute to combat or to yield to, they eternally relapse into themselves in order to vegetate, ultimately, beneath the truths they have glimpsed. They are, once again, disillusioned, for disillusion \u2014 retreat after a defeat \u2014 is characteristic of the individual who cannot destroy himself by a disaster, nor endure it to the end in order to triumph over it. Disillusion is the \u201csemi-tragic\u201d hypostatized. And since Fitzgerald could not remain worthy of his own drama, we cannot count him among those of high anguish. The interest he offers for us consists precisely in that disproportion between the inadequacy of his means and the extent of anxiety that he experienced.</span><br><br>Cioran, Fitzgerald<br>The Pascalian Experience of an American Novelist, Anathemas and Admirations", "filename": "the-pleasures-of-pessimism", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 350, "h": 527, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672735616290816, "time": 1672735616, "md5": "oAukVxeSdhSWS2lKucnuFA==", "fsize": 25518, "resto": 21471693}, {"no": 21472455, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)03:55:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472433</a><br>I\u2019m sure he has something interesting to say, but unfortunately my brain instinctively blocks anything with the word cioran in it.", "time": 1672736111, "resto": 21471693}, {"no": 21472535, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:39:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472455</a><br>Rent free", "time": 1672738745, "resto": 21471693}, {"no": 21472580, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)05:04:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471755</a><br>But his short stories are better than his novels", "time": 1672740242, "resto": 21471693}, {"no": 21472655, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)05:28:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471693</a><br>There are films which should be taken seriously.", "time": 1672741693, "resto": 21471693}, {"no": 21472689, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)05:43:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472433</a><br>damn.

All the parts incessantly work into each other\u2019s hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beauty </span><br>The presence of a higher, spiritual element is essential to nature&#039;s perfection. The high and divine beauty which can be loved without effeminacy, is that which is found in combination with the human will. Every natural action is graceful. Every heroic act is also decent, and causes the place and the bystanders to shine. We are taught by great actions that the universe is the property of every individual in it. Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if he will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world by his constitution.

The use of natural history is to give us aid in supernatural history: the use of the outer creation, to give us language for the beings and changes of the inward creation. Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material appearance. Right means straight; wrong means twisted. Spirit primarily means wind; transgression, the crossing of a line; supercilious, the raising of the eyebrow. We say the heart to express emotion, the head to denote thought; and thought and emotion are words borrowed from sensible things, and now appropriated to spiritual nature. Most of the process by which this transformation is made, is hidden from us in the remote time when language was framed; but the same tendency may be daily observed in children.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Discipline</span><br>Words are finite organs of the infinite mind.

He looked at the variety of sexual practices amongst the American Male and American Female around 1950. This is interesting because it gives you an idea of how weird humans are about fucking without requiring you to read an argumentative enlightenment piece of pornography like de Sade. (Its *academic* pornography*.<br><br>Lacan is an advanced post-Freudian french structuralist psychoanalyst who wants to understand how human sexuality works, and why we keep doing the same things over and over again despite being unsatisfied. (Pro-tip: when we&#039;re satisfied we stop.) Lacan is heavy fucking duty, but if you&#039;re going to try to be a boymode celebate chaste woman and expect your partners to be intimate loving and not cheat, you&#039;re going to have to do A LOT of thinking about why you&#039;d expect lovers to do that to you. Humans are structured before language on a model that men and women will root about. Human language (culture) is like 90% about sex on the side, or being married to the people you don&#039;t want to root, and so having a side bird you do actually want to fuck and do. The chief amusement of the common Italian or Englander in 1500 was making jokes about how men had horns on their head from their wives fucking other women&#039;s husbands.

But you presuppose that anger/violence is always irrational and unwise and illogical, most times it is entirely logical, entirely reasonable and well within the scope of desirable results. Without it you are entirely at the mercy of somebody who is, so while it should not always be the first response it should be well within your wheelhouse to do so.

There was clearly going to be an attempt to create a new structure of beliefs based on a nativist Germanic mindset.<br><br>The only reason people tend to think the Nazi&#039;s were obsessed with demonology, occultist practices and all manner of all other stuff is that popular media has sold that.

There was stuff like &#039;obligatory niggers&#039; and that, which has like come true, and every programme you see about young people has now got a black boy in it, I have to make a joke about that, I can&#039;t help it.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;no black man&#039;s going to come in my home and call me the oppressor, cause if I&#039;ve got any call with the English working class...the English working class created this country so that those fuckers could come over here and complain about it, I have no guilt about them, it\u2019s only the middle class and upper middle class who have any guilt about the blacks and Irish, do you know what I&#039;m saying? and I don&#039;t like people pulling that on me...black people and Irish people come over here and think they&#039;re being oppressed, the English working class know that as a fact...Do you know what I mean, no black man&#039;s going to come over to me and say &quot;You are the fuckin&#039; oppressor,&quot; because I&#039;ve never oppressed him, as far as I&#039;m concerned he&#039;s oppressing me, because I have to watch his music on TV and I don&#039;t particularly like it, it&#039;s another way of looking at it...</span><br><br>The notes on &quot;There is no culture is my brag&quot; and &quot;There are twelve people in the world, the rest are paste&quot; parts are also hilarious 2deep4you garbage.

In their research they looked across cultures and across millennia to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures. Their list includes six character strengths: wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence.

He had laughed at a very funny joke about a Negro when Irwin told it at a party, and then the following day had seen some white men lightly kicking a Negro man in the pants, and temporarily he had questioned laughter altogether. He had gone to several universities with the vague exaltation of Old Man Axelrod and had found only curves and credits. He had become drunk on the idea of God and found only theology. He had risen several times on the subtle and powerful wings of lust, expectant of magnificence, achieving only discharge. A few times he had extended friendship with palpitating hope, only to find that no one quite knew what he had in mind. His solitude now was the result of his metabolism, that constant breathing in of joy and exhalation of sadness. He had come to take shallower breaths, and the two had become mercifully mixed into melancholy contentment.

In essence, while there is a set liturgy and the Sacraments have a set order to them, ultimately you should discover your path to know God deeply and intimately (with God&#039;s grace of course) on your own.

Yes tolkien was a linguist and that is in his books. Howard was not a professor for some college, but he read an incredible amount of history and mythology while writing his stories which clearly influenced them. In addition to the previously mentioned theme of decadent civilization, Howard also wrote alot of stories about past lives and memories of those as well as ancient migrations of people (picts, celts, etc). He was probably insane (thinking townsfolk were going to come kill him at night and so would board up his home) but he produced some really great stories, consistently, in a short amount of time, which is something Tolkien NEVER did. Howard&#039;s stories also reflect the magazines he wrote for as well as his own tendencies. Bloodier, harsher, and the characters much more brooding. <br><br>If you haven&#039;t read any of Howard stories, seriously give him a chance because you&#039;re missing out. For his fantasy stories I recommend Red Nails, Worms of the Earth, the shadow kingdom, and kings of the Night. Or if you just want his 1 and only Conan novel, read the Hour of the dragon. This is to say nothing of his other stories like wolfshead, horror of the mound, hills of the dead, etc. I like tolkien as well, but Howard is very much his own thing and well worth reading.", "filename": "f2e6e878c302c55cd578a697c7aea50e", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 560, "h": 846, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1672668730054052, "time": 1672668730, "md5": "hfxHP6T2J6Kcoq1aIX4e6g==", "fsize": 98862, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21468315, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:16:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21456200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21456200</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The raging orlando</span><br>Gonna read the book this year, or", "time": 1672668968, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21468379, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:37:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21460537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21460537</a><br><a href=\"#p21468012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468012</a><br>Tolkien never had a fight in his life.Howard was an amateur boxer", "time": 1672670243, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21468452, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:52:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468379</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tolkien never had a fight in his life</span><br>fighting and being wounded in the hell of the somme will do that to you. also howard 41%&#039;d himself like a tranny. cope", "time": 1672671153, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21468470, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)09:56:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21468303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21468303</a><br>Nuance?

Kull is different in that there&#039;s less rip roaring adventure across kingdoms but more stately subterfuge and trickery, but don&#039;t worry there&#039;s plenty of action and combat, although conan is a better and more fleshed out character, kull very much feels like a prototype conan in a way.<br>Solomon Kane is a 16th century ex pirate turned puritan adventurer and slayer of evils. He&#039;s one of my favourite howard characters and IMO is more fleshed out and better than Conan in some ways. He travels through europe and africa, becomes friends with an african juju man, gains a magical staff of ancient power, fights evil with his rapier and two pistols. his stories are definitely more horror focused, which is why out of all howard&#039;s characters lovecraft liked solomon kane the best. <br>Bran Mak morn is one of howard&#039;s most underrated characters. He&#039;s the last pure king of a dying race (the picts) who fights against the romans in a futile effort to keep his degenerated people going. There are only three full stories in the bran mak morn collection but one of them, worms of the earth, isn&#039;t just considered the best Bran mak morn story but one of the greatest howard stories ever written<br>Howard&#039;s horror stories are just as good as his sword and sorcery stories and the collection is great<br>If i were you i&#039;d get the Solomon kane del ray collection. if after that you still want more conan then try kull, if you want more horror then get the bran mak morn and horror stories collection", "time": 1672709843, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21471220, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)20:47:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Reminder that leftist anti-theists will never produce good literature.", "time": 1672710455, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21471403, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)21:26:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21469348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21469348</a><br>Dangerously based post", "time": 1672712803, "resto": 21454136}, {"no": 21471519, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)22:01:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471109</a><br>I&#039;ve read the Conan ones, kull, Bran mak morn, and am currently reading the horror stories one. <br>Brank mak morn is the weakest simply due to having such a low number of stories.

Pretty much every object in space large enough to have a name is large and highly ordered enough to have a mind. Asteroids aren&#039;t commonly imagined to be &quot;highly ordered&quot; (think extreme low order: a pile of sand; extreme high order: computers. even higher would be biological systems) but the standard model asserts asteroids are the pieces of a broken planet or left overs from the stellar nebula. This is incorrect, most of them are ejecta from stars. Anyway, nearly all large space objects have a nervous system-like ion channels that &quot;give&quot; them minds on par with if not more advanced than humans&#039;.

Apollodorus,[citation needed] Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.<br><br>According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affair), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech:<br><br>22Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, &quot;You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things. 23For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#039;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&#039; What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 24The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn&#039;t dwell in temples made with hands, 25neither is he served by men&#039;s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things. 26He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 28&#039;For in him we live, and move, and have our being.&#039; As some of your own poets have said, &#039;For we are also his offspring.&#039; 29Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man. 30The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "filename": "PaulTheApostle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672453480295577, "time": 1672453480, "md5": "dFHTxDSoXDfSCWT7xazvfQ==", "fsize": 22769, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457444, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457437</a><br><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

The question is where should I build my expertise going forward? My intention was to survey people&#039;s opinions to see what people think the marketplace needs. For instance, the most viewed and read dead language content on the internet is Latin, so the demand for Latin is the greatest. There is virtually zero content for Ge&#039;ez. Perhaps, there is very little demand for it, but there might simply be an unfulfilled demand, in which case that could be a good place to specialize.<br>I&#039;m quite good at Latin and enjoy reading it, but I&#039;m inclined to think that the work I would do in Latin will go unnoticed. Plus, I&#039;d like to be a trailblazer. If I wanted safety and conformity, I&#039;d try to be a professor. However, there is no sense in blazing a trail and building a railroad if only 5 people want transportation.

They could play, dance, love and multiply their pleasures. They could leave a party, in the early hours of the morning, in the company of sexual partners they had chosen, and contemplate the dreary line of employees going to work. They were the salt of the earth, and everything was given to them, everything was permitted for them, everything was possible. Later on, having started a family, having entered the adult world, they would be introduced to worry, work, responsibility and the difficulties of existence; they would have to pay taxes, submit themselves to administrative formalities whilst ceaselessly bearing witness \u2013 powerless and shamefilled \u2013 to the irreversible degradation of their own bodies, which would be slow at first, then increasingly rapid; above all, they would have to look after children, mortal enemies, in their own homes, they would have to pamper them, feed them, worry about their illnesses, provide the means for their education and their pleasure, and unlike in the world of animals, this would last not just for a season, they would remain slaves of their offspring always, the time of joy was well and truly over for them, they would have to continue to suffer until the end, in pain and with increasing health problems, until they were no longer good for anything and were definitively thrown onto the rubbish heap, cumbersome and useless. In return, their children would not be at all grateful, on the contrary, their efforts, however strenuous, would never be considered enough, they would, until the bitter end, be considered guilty because of the simple fact of being parents. From this sad life, marked by shame, all joy would be pitilessly banished. When they wanted to draw near to young people\u2019s bodies, they would be chased away, rejected, ridiculed, insulted and, more and more often nowadays, imprisoned.

There weren\u2019t many of them in the school\u2014most of them went to the technical high school, Lycee Pierre-de-Coubertin, where the eminent Defrance did his philosophical striptease and propounded his pro-youth ass- kissing.

This black guy was going out with exactly the girl I would have chosen myself: blonde, very pretty, with a childlike face and small firm tits. They would come to class holding hands. I always kept the windows closed while they were working; the girls would get hot and take off their sweaters, their T-shirts sticking to their breasts. Hidden behind my desk, I\u2019d jerk off.

You\u2019re also having a lot of formative experiences, which means there\u2019s variety, and this means you have at least something in common with your classmates. Once you leave college and go into the working world, you\u2019re not necessarily with younger people anymore. You\u2019re with a lot of older, unfit, unaesthetic 50-60 year olds who have no interest in anything but their health care plans, paid time off for vacation, and whatever television show they\u2019re currently into. If you\u2019re a person who\u2019s intellectually inclined, the working world will be torture because you\u2019ll be constantly dealing with people who are idiots.

The end of each day has no true respite because you know you\u2019re just going to have to do the exact same thing the following day, and then the process continues for an indefinite period that sometimes lasts for decades. In school there\u2019s at least a definite ending to everything. First grade eventually ends and becomes second grade, which then builds and culminates in an eventual graduation. It\u2019s very linear, like the plot to a story. Not so working life. Each day is almost identical to the last and, at least metaphorically, will go on forever that way barring some disruption.

This alludes to the judge killing kids and if I remember correctly in real life the judge is chased off for killing kids. Anyway I could be conflating Blood Meridian and the historical book My Confession. I do think that at the end of BM the missing girl plays a part and the kid participates with the judge. Whatever happened in the jakes went beyond just rape/murder judging by the other guy&#039;s reaction.

And this happens in the &quot;biggest town for sin in all Texas.&quot; I&#039;m sure everyone there is accustomed to rape and murder. After the Kid enters the jakes the Judge locks the door behind him. When the other guy goes in it is unlocked so I believe whatever happened is over and it is empty (at least of living human beings.) I believe the third man who is pissing outside and warns the men not to enter to be the Kid. He seems to know what happened inside the jakes and is unfazed by it. &quot;I wouldnt go in there if I was you.&quot; I don&#039;t think McCarthy mentioned the missing bear girl for no reason. I think the Judge has her in the jakes and the Kid joins him in doing whatever they do to the poor girl. I think the raped and murdered corpse of the girl is left in there. So it ends with the Kid fully embracing his dark side. In my eyes the Judge actually does fully envelop the Kid and they kind of become one. &quot;Evil&quot; wins. And another note, if I&#039;m remembering correctly, when the children were found murdered/missing throughout the book McCarthy does not go into any graphic detail about their death. He just says something like their bodies were found, or that a girl&#039;s bloodied clothes were found and the girl missing, or &quot;a girl of perhaps twelve years cowering naked in the floor&quot; with the Judge standing naked behind her.

A pang of greed, green-carnal to the quick, sang, rang like a bell, his scrotum tightening; skidaddled through his loins and qualming tissues and began to burn like ice, the trembling fig on fire. And yet at the same time there was an aloofness in him \u2013 even a kind of suspicion, a perversity quite uncalled for. Something that Juno had always felt was there \u2013 something she feared beyond failure; this thing she could not compass with her arms.<br><br>Yet even worse than this, there was mixed up in him a pity for her. Pity that punctures love. She had given him everything, and he pitied her for it.

To bring it all to an end. That was the sadness of it. Not to create the deed that should set glory in motion but to bring glory to an end \u2013 to stab sweet love: to stab it to death. To be free of it.<br><br>None of this was in his mind. It was far away, in another pocket of his being. What was important, now, with her eyes bent upon him, and the shadow of a branch trembling across her breast, was the immemorial game of love: no less a game for being grave.

He was born into the family of an obscure cloth maker named John Spenser, who belonged to the Merchant Taylors\u2019 Company and was married to a woman named Elizabeth, about whom almost nothing is known. Since parish records for the area of London where the poet grew up were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, his birth date is uncertain, though the dates of his schooling and a remark in one of his sonnets (Amoretti 60) lend credence to the date traditionally assigned, which is around 1552. Spenser\u2019s reinvention of classical pastoral, The Shepheardes Calendar, was admired by Sir Philip Sidney as a major contribution to the development of English literature and national culture. His epic poem, The Faerie Queene, was written in honor of Queen Elizabeth I and in celebration of the Tudor dynasty. Along with Sidney, Spenser set out to create a body of work that could parallel the great works of European poets such as Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio and extend the line of English literary culture began by Chaucer. Among Spenser\u2019s many contributions to English literature, he is the originator and namesake of the Spenserian stanza and the Spenserian sonnet.</span><br><br>Full biography here<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ets/edmund-spenser", "time": 1672736738, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472473, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:06:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472470</a><br>And here is the link to the full canto<br>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/po<wbr>ems/45192/the-faerie-queene-book-i-<wbr>canto-i", "time": 1672736786, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472475, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:06:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21472471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21472471</a>", "filename": "de7a7c52832d96f6e6aaea9156bc3f6b", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1939, "h": 1293, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672736817729387, "time": 1672736817, "md5": "BMaSLTfbt+uY9pETx1ymKA==", "fsize": 772180, "resto": 21472470}, {"no": 21472512, "now": "01/03/23(Tue)04:32:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1672738343, "resto": 21472470}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21463801, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)09:39:52", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ROLL FOR A POEM - PotD conclusion", "com": "Thank you all for participating in the PotD threads throughout last year.

For that exact conclusion I was thinking about works such as Parcifal or Faust, and people like Goethe and Wagner in general. I don&#039;t know much about literature myself, but I can safely say that fiction of that caliber, basically any of these &quot;greatest&quot; books are perfect examples of that greatness from antithetical approach to literature from nonfiction.<br><br>The reason I say different is because that intelligence that is mostly associated with &quot;smartness&quot; is very much composed of many things. It just happened to be that it&#039;s the most clear and seemingly obvious representation of it is through subjective brain aneurysms that is non fiction literature. <br><br>Yet fiction works that achieved legendary status possesses much more of that &quot;realism&quot; or should I say &quot;truth&quot; that is mirrored from the world we live in. And so it takes a very special person to do so, one may say an intelligent one to deliver such work that would be so welcomed by the general public.<br><br>Now, I haven&#039;t completely comprehended the work that I&#039;m reciting here, but from what I understand, the main difference that is between supposed &quot;smart people&quot; and others is the amount of natural intuition they possess, or rather how little those supposed &quot;smart people&quot; have it in comparison.<br><br>This amount of intuition, considering many things, reflects on your general comprehension of reality. The fact that there is a clear difference in approach and reach between fiction and non fiction is reflective by product of the perception types that individuals possess.<br><br>Wide and shallow, thin and deep are the characteristics that define this difference. Keep in mind that this fact reaches far beyond just literature, yet it is a good example non a less. Also, it does not necessarily set a rigid rule. Wagner being proof of that, having a decently wide approach, yet absolutly not compromised in depth. It&#039;s just an approximate border from which we can work around.<br><br>Above mentioned qualities, as much as they are gross simplification, still a closest note to the true definition of difference. Both of them have equal cons and pros, being equal to the duality they are, and neither should be valued more over the other. Unfortunately this is not how we view it and depending on the time and place in our history, one is more dominant and valued than the other.<br><br>Long story short, things such as &quot;smart and dumb&quot; are mostly superficial, definition of which changes according to historical needs and periods. Both of them possess their own achievements and uses.<br><br>I&#039;ll even go as far as to say that works of fiction are more intelligent, since as much as the stories, character and themes can be much more basic and rigid, it is through equal wide reflection from all mediums combined in reference you could start to see it&#039;s true epiphany.

As he divvied out the bird seed, in the quickly failing light of a cold winter night, he thought back on the troubles of the day. He racked together all the marbles, 8-balls and rubber-band balls in his brain to bring about a solitary and wholly unique moment of bright reflection. <br>A man had argued with me today, he thought. A man from the city with his flashy clothes and universities and possibly gay manner of speaking. Darl paused in his thinking for a moment as the cool birdseed flowed through his hands into the trough, with his hens and roosters crowding around his feet in a nightly dance, a ritual that reminded one of a native rain dance deep in the woods on a night such as this, with the dim light from the lanterns swaying in the barn as the winter wind chilled past them, painting their faces in the same fiery light as the natives around their fire as the roosters prayed to their god for a torrent of birdseed. But Darl didn&#039;t pause too long in his thinking, for to pause any longer would risk his train of thought being lost, the moment of reflection slipping through the rusty gears turning in his head and plummeting straight down into a bottomless abyss, never to be found again. He brought his mind back into focus. The slow camera of his mind panned back to the city dweller he had argued with hours before.<br>He supposed that I didn&#039;t know what living really is, Darl thought. But what does he know? I sold thirty pounds of birdseed today;-- tomorrow I might sell even more. I watched Andy teach Opie a valuable lesson today. That&#039;s enough, he thought. That&#039;s enough. What do I need philosophy for? Tomorrow I&#039;ll wake up and everything will go exactly as it did today without any troubles. Farmer Fred will come at noon to buy some birdseed; a few people will come in after lunch and buy various things such as coffee, shaving cream and milk; Aunt Bee will be shocked at the audaciousness of her growing nephew; and Henrietta will happily strut up to my feet and thank me for dinner. That&#039;s enough for me.

For the longest time, &quot;German&quot; had only been a language, and a diverse cultural sphere. Without political unity, German literature was among the few things you actually could call German. There&#039;s this meme going around that Germany is the &quot;Land der Dichter und Denker&quot;, the Land of Poets and Thinkers, and it&#039;s been circulating for centuries, too. A variation of this is right there in the pic, that sign. <br>When Germany became a state they kept that line of thought alive, and the meme became a fast part of the inventory of national pride. Decades later, after World War II, this literary tradition was still useful in justifying the German state. Also, it served as a counterweight to the perceived barbarianism of Nazi Germany: &quot;Look, we have this great tradition of thinkers, artists and philosophers.&quot; This line ties in neatly with the values of democracy, even if some of these writers were fundamentally undemocratic. It&#039;s stumped national pride hailing back to 18th Century petty bourgeois Germans trying to elevate themselves by recognizing arts and literature. Germany doesn&#039;t promote literature as such, it only promotes it&#039;s very own narrowly defined literal canon. And this is a shifting canon which has been changed a lot, depending on who was in charge.

A recurring theme in Nietzsche&#039;s works is about the dichotomy between affirmation and negation. Affirmation is a positive act. For Nietzsche, a master would see an apple and he will eat it because it is good for him. A slave, while also seeing the apple as good, yet powerless to wrest it from the master, denounce apples as bad since it is a negatory movement borne out of ressentiment. I think much of our common &quot;wisdom&quot; is imbued with slave morality. Take for example, a child is being bullied by his peer or upperclassman and he feels sad about it and wants to get revenge. His mother would communicate to him &quot;if you do that, then you would be the same as him&quot;, this is a form of ressentiment par excellence. The master move would be to get revenge because it is good, while the slave would just negate the actions of whoever he hates and denounce it as evil, therefore not taking revenge is good for the slave. The master sees things and actions as good (not bad), while the slave sees things and actions as good (not evil), this is the core idea of transvaluation of values, how &quot;good&quot; becomes antonymous with &quot;evil&quot; instead of &quot;bad&quot;.", "filename": "Nietzsche", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 900, "h": 1353, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672720323505787, "time": 1672720323, "md5": "Wx43lrVQkZW3iQe2ECgOKQ==", "fsize": 255964, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "help-with-nietzsche", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 27, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 13}, {"no": 21471787, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)23:34:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471778</a><br>it&#039;s called don&#039;t hate the player, hate the game. why are continentals so fucking autistic, why do they have so many of them funny words to get their point across.", "filename": "1835 - SoyBooru", "ext": ".png", "w": 680, "h": 762, "tn_w": 111, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672720451975215, "time": 1672720451, "md5": "a98p1sPIhNHY2EeYpoVTdQ==", "fsize": 89088, "resto": 21471778}, {"no": 21471794, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)23:35:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471778</a><br>Sounds like you got the gist of it.<br>But it gets really spooky when you go beyond morality and apply that dichotomy to metaphysics, as Deleuze does through Nietzsches genealogy and concept of eternal recurrence.", "filename": "Screenshot_20221112_035039", "ext": ".png", "w": 548, "h": 919, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672720503211818, "time": 1672720503, "md5": "1LcSGOLrqtXogb7T7FI5xg==", "fsize": 604138, "resto": 21471778}, {"no": 21471798, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)23:36:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471778</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A slave, while also seeing the apple as good, yet powerless to wrest it from the master, denounce apples as bad since it is a negatory movement borne out of ressentiment.</span>", "filename": "PepeLaugh", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 83, "tim": 1672720560225178, "time": 1672720560, "md5": "q80z+Ecou9u56MywRVZ3bg==", "fsize": 59124, "resto": 21471778}, {"no": 21471814, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)23:40:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21471794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21471794</a><br>What is Deleuze&#039;s project actually?

According to Deleuze, all transcendence is found within immanence, meaning there is a common ontological ground to all of reality (a plane of immanence, as he calls it). This reality is constantly moving and changing, and Deleuze, being a process philosopher, discusses this constant movement by referring to &quot;difference in itself.&quot; Difference is the brute fact of all of reality, but to make sense of this pure difference, thought must bind it to representation and identity. So far as I understand it, all of Deleuze&#039;s thought seeks to explore this idea, namely that difference is ontologically prior to identity. Deleuze finds a similar strain of thought in Nietzsche, wherein the world is seen as the ground or departure point for everything else. There is an optimism that runs throughout the thought of both philosophers, because they both see our understanding and experience of reality as malleable and therefore full of possibility. Whereas an idealist such as Hegel looks at history as an unfolding that happens according to a sort of &quot;plan&quot; or at least towards a definable endpoint, Deleuze sees reality as more &quot;bottom-up&quot; I would say, in that our understanding seeks to capture some portion of reality as opposed to aligning our thought to some eternal logic which operates through all things. So the infamous Body without Organs (BwO gang rise up) is a pure space of possibility, as opposed to a machinic assemblage operating according to fixed principles to achieve some specific end. In other words, Deleuze wants to free us of thinking which applies rigid categories to reality and instead to see thought as a grand experiment, which we can actively tinker with to discover new ways of being.

Anything could be happening, and we can&#039;t really prove much of the assumptions we base our life on. If we conclude we can&#039;t know anything, that&#039;s not helpful. If we conclude something specific but unreasonable, ie, &quot;You have to be extremely ascetic in order to escape rebirth in this filthy world,&quot; (almost) nobody will find that helpful. Rather than try to bridge logic over to the set of things we already believe, we go back to the first thing I said, where we have to assume the actions we take matter, which means assuming that the information that seems true by common sense is actually true. Going through life, you can&#039;t prove you&#039;re not in a simulation, but you can prove that you can assume you&#039;re not in a simulation, because if that&#039;s not true, then it&#039;s not true that the actions you take matter, so it doesn&#039;t matter if you wrongly assumed you weren&#039;t in a simulation.<br>So then, what seems evident? What works for me is complete determinism and a personal God. I like the analogy of thinking of the universe as &quot;0=0,&quot; and then God goes and makes it &quot;2+9+X = 2+9+X,&quot; just for the sake of beauty, if that makes sense. I&#039;m ok with the typical Christian version of heaven as &quot;contemplating God in infinite beatitude,&quot; to me that&#039;s not &quot;standing in a choir for eternity,&quot; but getting to see what God sees when He makes all the complexity of the universe.<br><br>1/2", "time": 1672689288, "resto": 21468933}, {"no": 21469696, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)14:59:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21469668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21469668</a><br>More specific: How people function:<br>I believe each &quot;person&quot; is an abstract idea, and that things are defined as more or less that &quot;person&quot; by how close they share the aims of that abstract person. &quot;I&quot; am a person who wants an anon to read this post, more art to be produced in the world, and the body I have, whose brain contains the motives that define &quot;I,&quot; to reproduce and put more 1/2-I&#039;s in the world.

Believers are often unduly fearful of being led astray by the atheiestic sentiments which have increasingly penetrated into Western thought since Darwin.

Section included, names redacted.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually I met back up with C___ and K___. We went to get coffee in a small carpeted gym adjacent to the main church area. We mozy over and get a cup of coffee with C___, a small cup because I don\u2019t want to piss and shit my pants, lose my mind and go completely insane. Just enough to keep me awake, like a small shot. I call it zippy juice. Then the most amazing thing happened. A beautiful brown woman walked over. She had a shredded athletic build, probably 5\u20194. Very dark skin and black hair. She was wearing a beautiful dress which fell a few inches above her knees but covering her arms, it was a beautiful peach color with white patterns. She was wearing heels which combined with the dress showed off her gorgeous toned legs. Not fat or thicc like I like them but tight and athletic. I am certain she is some sort of athlete. The testosterone begins to pump through my veins as she approached the coffee pots besides us. I determine she must be south Asian, and judging by her skin tone clearly predominantly Dravidian admixture. The yearning soulful screams of one thousand aryan rapists descending from the Himalayan mountains in anti gravitational devices to impregnate the subcontinent ring in my heart. My ancestors are watching me and so are hers, they both know what should happen. I can feel the magnetism as our eyes lock. My soul is moved in 1/10th of a second and after 1 and 9/10ths of a second more I am greeting her. She begins asking about hot chocolate. I inform her there is only coffee and I begin introducing myself and the squad. I let her know my name staring deeply into her eyes. Her flesh smelled clean, as though she had taken a shower only a few hours before arriving. Her handshake was shockingly strong. I said to her \u201cyou have a very strong hand shake\u201d and urged her to shake the hand of K___ and C___ who both agreed later I was right but did not confirm this in front of her in the same autistic way I did. She clearly intended to demonstrate her immense and subtle power and control over her body. We should have started taking turns on her right there and then. Her body was ready to carry my child immediately. However before we could spread her powerful legs and enter her a woman came over and shushed us up. The service has already started. Brie was her name, and she was whisked away by an elderly white woman. All around us the service had begun and we didn\u2019t even notice. We stopped and silently prayed in the carpeted gym while I watched Brie enter the main room. I stalked her every movement with my eyes watching the way she very carefully and awkwardly place her heels down with every stride on the level above me. I tried my best to look up her skirt from the lower level but she escaped. A most Wretched and sinister devil hid her from me but not for very long.</span>", "time": 1672694682, "resto": 21463742}, {"no": 21470114, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:27:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21465810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21465810</a><br>You are only a has-been if your primary way to feel good about yourself is reflecting on past glories.", "time": 1672694843, "resto": 21463742}, {"no": 21470137, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:31:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21464261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21464261</a><br>Tell this to Pessoa, Miller or Bukowski", "time": 1672695110, "resto": 21463742}, {"no": 21470223, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)16:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21463759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21463759</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hmm it seems I falter at x y z </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here&#039;s what I can do about it </span><br>Very narcissistic bro", "time": 1672696205, "resto": 21463742}, {"no": 21470597, "now": "01/02/23(Mon)18:26:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21465670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21465670</a><br>I feel bad that I started journaling only when I was 27.
