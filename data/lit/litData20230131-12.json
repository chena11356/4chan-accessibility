I admit that it&#039;s formulated in a dangerously reductive manner, as it is ignoring the vast nuances that are inherent to any real life situation, but it does keep me up at night. Even if the former has a slight cynical edge to it thanks to the contemporary consumerist social engineering blasting the message of grabbing on to your youth with all your might as you still can, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that at its core it is any more true or false. It&#039;s all wrapped by fear/cowardice anyway. One of the reasons why I&#039;ve remained a NEET for so long until recently is the fear of signing away the most precious resource of all, Time, to a venture that would ultimately turn to an overall deficit in the long run. I worry a lot about doing a job that would not allow me to pursue what I really care about the most, despite me not being good at it for now. A job that would eat away at your soul to the point where you wouldn&#039;t have any love left to spread. But that&#039;s just the nature of our circumstances now, there&#039;s not much that we could do about it is there?

That would probably be more beneficial to life itself than the rest of my self-centered &quot;artistic&quot; leanings. Or if I really was worth a damn, I&#039;d find a way to synthesize the two into an object worth contemplating. That&#039;s it, worth. Maybe that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking for. Justifying my own chain of decisions so far in life. That&#039;s the deepest appeal of art for me, the idea that I could bring all of my experiences into one transcendental package, something that will go much farther beyond my self and my own perspectives. Scraping away the wisdom that could be found hiding behind the textures of the happenings of my life. That should serve goodness, shouldn&#039;t it? Do you think art could work for the good of the world? Or do you think it&#039;s bound to remain perverse?

I think I knew that somewhere in my psyche because that is how I read other poets like William Blake and W. B. Yeats, and I suspect its why I planned to read him again at some point. I guess my distinction originally is that maybe RWE handles the same content more directly (essays and lectures tend to be more direct than poems) but even then, as far as poets go, Whitman strikes me as one of the more direct ones.

I&#039;m a 7/10 at best, no super fit, just &quot;atletic&quot; (skinny) and tall, and very early on I realized that girls were atracted to guys who were confident and didn&#039;t brother that much about them. The worst thing you could do is look desperate. I know some of you are desperate, but please, let it go. Focus on yourself and become an interesting guy and eventually you will feel good enough to approach a girl without being seem as weirdo, and you will also learned to be rejected. Once you pass that phase of self-hate and low self steem, everything became less difficult. Also, if you really want to just have sex, be prepared to talk and spend time with some really valid and stupid whores because nothing is free.

This is a challenge. Not on account of women, but the condition of Americans generally. If you were a homosexual this would be just as tricky, or maybe a bit less, if only because openly homosexual men tend to be educated. If you were a heterosexual woman, I would tell you to be prepared to settle. You should be prepared for that anyway, in most matters. Doing so defends your sanity.<br>Nevertheless, in your search for this woman you must understand that serious reading is ultimately a leisure activity of the upper-middle and upper classes in America. All classes read, many poor kids read voraciously, but their po-dunk and shot-up schools cannot turn the appetite into taste, and by the time they are adults they have turned to the television and magazines. Serious readers are nursed by IB and AP classes and decent liberal arts colleges or very good professors nibbling at the margins of big state schools. You mentioned MFA programs but you are not a writer, and a woman in that sort of thing is more likely to accept a man who is her antithesis, a counterweight - a financial analyst or orthodontist - than she is to tolerate a dilettante and snob like you intruding on her great love.<br>You will want a girl with wounded self-esteem and a need to belong - there are plenty of those - but not so many who can discuss Turgenev and Camus earnestly. If you can, I would advise you to get committed to a haute-bourgeois psychiatric hospital like McLean&#039;s and make a show of reading easily identifiable works of literary fiction in every common area. Strike up conversations with any girl in the day room who has a notebook or decent novel in her little shaky hands, who has bandaged wrists and insomniac eyes.

Term with both Platonic and Peripatetic provenance. When used Platonically, Substance refers to Intellect or to any distinct Being in the intelligible world; Substantiality refers to the essence of Intellect or of any distinct Being. Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect. When used Peripatetically , the term &#039;substance&#039; refers to an individual &#039;this something&#039;; &#039;substantiality&#039; refers to the essence of a substance, that is, its core reality or being. For Plotinus, true ontological primacy is found in Substance and Substantiality, not in substance and substantiality. Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world. The adjective substantial, Substantial usually indicate and implicit contrast.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between Plato\u2019s demiurge and one hypostasis and the demiurge is <s>the nous.

You don&#039;t even read the actual Hanzi vs Letters differently, either. Even in the most phonetic languages, but ESPECIALLY in languages like French, you don&#039;t break a word up into characters, you view it as a discrete packet. &quot;Foot&quot; and &quot;\u811a&quot; aren&#039;t broken up into component parts, they&#039;re taken as a single discrete thing. The way that we train children to read is not to take &quot;foot&quot; and break it up into three parts (two consonants and a digraph representing a vowel), it&#039;s to repeat the sound &quot;foot&quot; in your head upon seeing an arbitrary symbol (&quot;foot&quot;). This is EXACTLY how Mandarin works.<br><br>Remember the subvocalization meme? You can&#039;t read without subvocalizing.

You do not read French and Mandarin any differently. <br><br>SOME languages have orthographies that DO let you pick apart a given arbitrary symbol and arrive at the correct pronunciation, but that is absolutely not necessary for reading, and actually requires more brain power to do (lower IQ native speakers of languages with phonetic orthographies tend to fail when forced to derive a word from phonetics because there&#039;s a higher sound-symbol load which requires more brain power).

As to your question, you&#039;re exhibiting a fatalistic mindset. There are people with one of two beliefs regarding their relationship with the world; the first has an external locus control in which the future is a series of uncontrollable events that happen to a person, i.e., what will happen was always going to happen regardless of the actions I take, and the second an internal locus in which the future is controllable and dirigible by his actions, i.e., what will happen is determined by the actions I take. People with the former tend towards fatalistic thinking and I speculate are higher neuroticism than the latter. <br><br>Let&#039;s roll the dice however. As you are (being) fatalistic, I&#039;ll say this whatever you do and wherever you are sorted will be sorted out after you have done it. Fatalism has a positive form where you take action because you believe that you were fated to do so. So if you wish to write, then write.

First, Saturn is the dimmest planet in the sky. It carries connotations of weakness, endings, the expending of strength and finality. Second, Saturn is traditionally the most external planet - if Earth is the centre, and all the other planets form concentric circles around this circle, Saturn is the final circle, the edge of the cosmos. It marks the outer limit and the end of life and light, both celestial and human. Further, as a symbol of the outer limit, it is also a symbol of time and death, hence why Saturn was also known as Kronos or the star of Kronos. Everything exists and lives on its appropriate plane, and carries on its journey, until the very end, at which point Saturn collects what is due and dispenses death - the meaning of the life is therefore forced to be constrained within a beginning and an end, giving mortal beings a kind of imperative to attend to our tasks, needs and duties - this is why Saturn is the lord of organisation, control, discipline, mastery and authority, in addition to being a lord of disaster, pain, suffering and death.<br><a href=\"#p21589629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589629</a><br>That&#039;s probably the Saturnine era conceived in cthonic terms, the cthonic demon Saturn rather than the celestial Saturn.", "time": 1675042875, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589721, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the greeks and romans are not western btw", "time": 1675042997, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589728, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585665</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I always assumed that this was merely some commonplace reactionary diatribe,</span><br>Spengler was part Jewish friend.", "time": 1675043077, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589758, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589608</a><br>Who said this 2000 years ago?

The classics, of course, are defined as such because they are of lasting cultural and literary value, and hence I don\u2019t think they should be neglected. I always think that one should at least have read Iliad/Odyssey, the Bible, and Shakespeare before moving on to other English literature. You will be missing out on very many references if you don\u2019t at least know a few common quotes and general plot points. There are also other works that can be considered essential for other languages (Don Quixote in Spanish, major works by Flaubert and Stendhal in French, etc.)<br><br>Are you just asking for good modern literature? Because if so try checking out the wiki, it has more information than this thread will bring. My recommendations would be Wolf Hall, Remains of the Day, Austerlitz, The Sense of an Ending, Gilead, The English Patient as well as the obvious choices of Infinite Jest and pretty much all of the major McCarthy stuff, along with Pynchon if he really counts as modern.

People looked sad, on the subway, in the bars; decisions were questioned, opinions rearranged. The same grave epiphany was dragged around everywhere: we were transitioning from an only retrospectively easy past to an inarguably more difficult future; we were, it could no longer be denied, unstoppably bad. Although the death of any hope for humanity was surely decades in the making, the result of many intersecting systems described forbiddingly well, it was only that short period, between the election of a new president and his holding up a hand to swear to serve the people\u2019s interests, that made clear what had happened, that we were too late. I didn\u2019t believe all this, necessarily, though as the news got worse and more bizarre I wavered. I\u2019ve always been drawn to pragmatism, just not exactly a natural at it; as my brain says, \u201cCalm down,\u201d my heart says, also weirdly calmly, \u201cA paradoxical comfort can be found in drama.\u201d It was and still is my official position, if you were to ask me at a party or something, that the popular turn to fatalism could be attributed to self-aggrandizement and an ignorance of history, history being characterized by the population\u2019s quickness to declare apocalypse finally imminent despite its permanently delayed arrival. We don\u2019t want to die, but we also don\u2019t want to do anything challenging, such as what living requires, so the volubility with which certain doom was discussed made a tedious kind of sense: the end of the world would let us have our cake and eat it, too; we would have no choice but to die, our potential conveniently unrealizable due to our collapse. Until such time, the idea that everything was totally pointless now was seductive, particularly as a mantra you could take advantage of when it suited you and abandon when life actually started to feel alarming. I myself was soon using it to indulge some of my naughtier impulses, by which I mean that in the first hours of a morning in early January, when the sky was still dark and the government still inevitably hurtling, I decided to snoop through my boyfriend\u2019s phone while he was asleep. I\u2019d never really had the urge to go through another person\u2019s things before. After a few disappointing experiences with high school boyfriends\u2019 instant-message histories, I\u2019d learned that poking around the by-products of other people\u2019s thoughts usually yielded the mundane, the predictable, and the unattractive.</span>", "time": 1675080601, "resto": 21591271}, {"no": 21591432, "now": "01/30/23(Mon)07:39:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21591391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21591391</a><br>Exerpt?

The Greek has exap\u00e9steilen, a word that also appears in the psalms, where it is read: send (emitted) your light (Sal 42,3).

It can also be interpreted in the sense that God has sent an evil spirit, as if he wanted to go among them, that is, as if he had given the evil spirit power to disturb the peace that was between them. To such an extent it has not been considered as absurd that the Lord could send an evil spirit to avenge justice, that some have even translated the exap\u00e9steilen by &quot;launched&quot; (inmisit).

In Dick&#039;s book, the police chief, Felix Buckman, meets a black stranger at an all-night gas station, and uncharacteristically makes an emotional connection with him. After handing the stranger a drawing of a heart pierced by an arrow, Buckman flies away, but he quickly returns and hugs the stranger, and they strike up a friendly conversation.

The edition features an abundance of new critical features, including a critical text that presents the edition much as it appeared in the first edition of 1837, but with a detailed record of the emendations that Carlyle made in subsequent versions during his lifetime. These volumes also contain a variety of scholarly aids\u2015literary, textual, historical, and photographic\u2015to render The French Revolution more approachable and readable to twenty-first century readers. The edition takes seriously Carlyle&#039;s claim to have produced a history of the Revolution that is rooted in his primary French sources. The extensive annotations vividly testify to his deep engagement in a wide array of histories, pamphlets, memoirs, and biographies. The notes not only demonstrate his complex method of history, but they also shed fresh light on his artistry and his rich use of language. For the first time, readers will be provided with numerous samples of engravings that Carlyle used from Chamfort&#039;s Tableaux historiques and other sources to visualize the &#039;Flame Drama,&#039; as it was conceived by revolutionary artists and printers. The appendices will also include an annotated version of Carlyle&#039;s essay, &#039;On the Sinking of the Vengeur&#039; (1839), in which he offers a detailed response to controversy surrounding the events that occurred during the naval battle between France and Britain on &#039;the Glorious First of June,&#039; 1794; an image and transcription of an unpublished MS holograph excerpt from The French Revolution located in the Harry Ransom Center, Texas; and a copy of a corrected proof of &#039;The Feast of Pikes&#039; held in the Forster Collection of the National Art Library, Victoria and Albert Museum.</span><br><br>Obviously it\u2018s still 500 bucks though, but nonetheless I would be lying if all of this doesn\u2018t sound tempting.

He approaches a cockroach in only one respect: his coloration is brown. That is all. Apart from this he has a tremendous convex belly divided into segments and a hard rounded back suggestive of wing cases. In beetles these cases conceal flimsy little wings that can be expanded and then may carry the beetle for miles and miles in a blundering flight. Curiously enough, Gregor the beetle never found out that he had wings under the hard covering of his back. (This is a very nice observation on my part to be treasured all your lives. Some Gregors, some Joes and Janes, do not know that they have wings.) Further, he has strong mandibles. He uses these organs to turn the key in a lock while standing erect on his hind legs, on his third pair of legs (a strong little pair), and this gives us the length of his body, which is about three feet long. In the course of the story he gets gradually accustomed to using his new appendages\u2014his feet, his feelers.

This first book of a seven-part series follows the journey of two sisters named Salazar (&quot;Sal&quot;) and Alela (&quot;Al&quot;) Coffy living in the small town of Lieh, where nothing is quite as it seems. Set against the backdrop of a cicada-filled midsummer and a local county fair, the story delves into the psyche of its characters as they navigate the supernatural and the power of language to shape and obscure meaning. <br><br>Sal, the younger sister, spends her days idling with friends and tagging along with Amy Voces, a wise and beneficent mage who lives on the far side of town. Alela, on the other hand, spends her time hiding in the woods and seeking escapism through drugs. Both sisters are unaware of the mysteries that constantly surround them and the fact that their entire understanding of reality is about to change in the worst way imaginable. <br><br>Featuring bright, detailed, psychedelic art reminiscent of 1960&#039;s underground comics and arranged via innovative panel compositions that evoke a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere, The Funnel combines elements of fantasy, horror, and magical realism to explore themes of grief, identity, and the search for meaning in a nonsensical world.
