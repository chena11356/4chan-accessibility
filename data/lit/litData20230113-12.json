We took my younger brother to hospital and I had to sit in the waiting room of the emergency room thinking I had turned my brother into a retard as my parents went in with my brother to get him checked out. I remember the doctor coming out and telling me in front of my family that I shouldn&#039;t be so rough with my brother and I sat there in shame.<br><br>The second was just like the first.

As he got older, he started to become a very angry child and several times he randomly attacked me in ways that could have actually killed me if we hadn&#039;t been so lucky. Whenever this happened my parents would always say the same bullshit - that I had been very mean to my brother when we were younger and that was why he acted like this.

Corey (Daniel Abraham &amp; Ty Franck)<br><br>I&#039;ve seen complaints that the second book is too much of the same. There&#039;s a lot of structural similarity and although the content itself differs that may not be enough. I don&#039;t mind that much about between book repetition, but I do have concerns about within-in book repetition. Despite these similarities this one has more silly moments, which isn&#039;t what I prefer in this context, but they don&#039;t affect much. The plot is unknown forces trying to provoke a war between Earth and Mars, protomolecule mishaps, subterfuge, investigation, and political metaphors. This series isn&#039;t so much about the plot for me, which could deliver far more on what one might presume it to eventually be about, as it is about the characters and how they make it through the various situations they find themselves in.<br><br>As for the viewpoints, I hope you didn&#039;t mind Miller because they have all similarities with him. Particularly in that they&#039;re traumatized, obsessed, and prone to recklessness bordering on self-destructiveness. James Holden retains his savior complex and sense of moral superiority that leads to the occasional narcissistic and paranoid moments. Chrisjen Avasarala is the UN deputy undersecretary who treats everything as a political game. Roberta (Bobbie) Draper is a traumatized Martian marine seeking revenge and has an especially imposing stature. Praxidike Meng is a botanist who is divorced from his wife and arguably reality, whose only goal is to find his missing four year old daughter. He&#039;s one of my least liked characters in the series, book and show. I like the female cast of characters considerably more overall. In the TV series anyway, though it seems that it&#039;ll be the same here.<br><br>My primary complaint this time is the chronology. There are seemingly conflicting statements about how much time has passed since the first book. That may be because of how unclear the durations of their space travels often are. This is one of my most common complaints, though in most cases I let it slide by without much notice. I also felt that child prostitution, which is only mentioned, was an inordinate focus. The first thought of almost every character seems to go in that direction when thinking of children, especially the aforementioned missing daughter. The population dynamics are so dumb that I try to entirely ignore them. None of this does much to damper my enjoyment, though in the context of a book that I liked less they would.<br><br>The differences from the show so far aren&#039;t of any major consequence that I can remember. Bobbie is different, mostly in her sexual effect on men and how they respond to her, which more than flirts with fetishization. There was one point where I was surprised because it didn&#039;t happen in the TV series, but it turned out not to matter that much, which was disappointing. Overall, I still rather enjoy it.<br><br>Rating: 4/5", "filename": "Caliban&#039;s War", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 500, "h": 779, "tn_w": 80, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673499638118757, "time": 1673499638, "md5": "7i334J27ZxbLRPS+qBPZzw==", "fsize": 90780, "resto": 21510242, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21514180, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:12:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514141</a><br>updooted", "time": 1673500377, "resto": 21510242}, {"no": 21514213, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)00:22:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21512701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21512701</a><br>His best imo is Transmigration of Timothy Archer.

Let&#039;s see, my favourite is probably Dungeon Crawler Carl. Recent ones I&#039;ve enjoyed are... Falling With Folded Wings was surprisingly decent.

Ripple System I enjoyed whenever it wasn&#039;t doing PvE stuff (because it&#039;s just not really interesting that part). Path of Ascension I found had actually very interesting world-building stuff going on, even if it&#039;s actually just a xianxia in a LitRPG coat. Underverse I&#039;ve enjoyed well enough, though I keep forgetting to go back to it. Primal Hunter is probably one of the bigger ones I actually enjoyed, though it&#039;s, like Unbound, sort of nothing special, though I enjoy it a LITTLE more than Unbound solely for the fact that the protagonist has a personality. Infinite Realm was messy and amateur-ishly written but had very good character and worldbuilding. One I read that I sort of enjoyed but sort of didn&#039;t, and I&#039;ll be honest I have no idea how to feel about it given it&#039;s not done, was Divine Apostasy. And for more parodic stuff I enjoyed This Quest Is Bullshit. The only ones I&#039;ve really disliked that&#039;re quite big as He Who Fights with Monsters and Defiance of the Fall. The former because it was clear that Jason wasn&#039;t ever gonna be a protagonist I enjoyed, and the Earth stuff just put me off. The latter because good god that author doesn&#039;t know how to have an interesting main character. Zac is a block of wood.<br>This turned into something of a rant, but yeah.

But the weird thing about it is that this place was loaded with large amounts of psychoactive drugs of all kinds (reported in the New York Times after the mass suicides).

The massive corruption of the DNC and MSM shown by those turbulent 4 years very well seemed to have been matched, with an obviously deliberately provocative playing-offense from the MAGA-movement, which they could not but have known would have stoked the embers of tension in this country to a bonfire.

They are usually mentally ill beyond just being trans, but overall are not necessarily morally worse than average people. They are also very shy and live ashamed of themselves because of their strong dysphoria, so they avoid bringing attention to themselves. But now there&#039;s a new type of trannies. Perhaps they have always existed as well, but now they seem to be easily the majority. They are just insane. I have no other word for it. They are usually autistic and heavily sexualize their transition. They don&#039;t seem to even understand how actual women think or feel. Their idea of becoming a woman is becoming a fetishistic idea of one. And they love imposing themselves over everyone. They get off from it. A lot of them are hideous and seem not to have any shame on it. They even seem to indulge on repulsing people but still forcing them to recognize them as &quot;real women&quot;. Some of them do kind of pass though, but by looking at them, the way they behave and interact with the world, you can tell they are basically insane men pretending to be women, like Keffals. They just have a male energy to them. And also I guess now there is also a third type. You have all these teenage girls who are transitioning because it&#039;s the new trendy thing to do, and then they regret it in their mid 20s after they had cut their boobs.

We who have been brought up in the English-speaking world have internalized the idea that law exists to do justice between individual parties, rather than to impose a uniform regime of commands. Other Western systems have also reinforced the attachment of citizens to the political order \u2013 notably Roman law and its many derivatives (the code napol\u00e9on among them). It was evident from the earliest days of Christianity that the New Testament was not an attempt to replace the law of the imperial power, but an attempt to make a space for spiritual growth within it. In his parables, Christ emphasized that the secular law is to be obeyed, and that our duty to God does not require us to defy or to replace it. Nor should we pay too much attention to the finicky edicts of the Torah, since \u2018the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath\u2019.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To someone raised on the doctrine that legitimate law comes from God, and that obedience is owed to Him above all others, the claims of the secular jurisdiction are regarded as at best an irrelevance, at worst a usurpation. Such is the message of Sayyid Qutb\u2019s writings, and of Milestones (ma\u2018alim fi\u2019l tariq, 1964) in particular. In that book, Qutb denounces secular law, national identity and the attempt to establish a purely human political order without reference to the revealed will of God: all are blasphemous in Qutb\u2019s eyes.

But you need only ask yourself whether what Nietzsche says is true, to realize how paradoxical it is. (If it is true, then it is false! -- an instance of the so-called &#039;liar&#039; paradox.) Likewise, the French philosopher Michel Foucault repeatedly argues as though the &#039;truth&#039; of an epoch has no authority outside of the power-structure that endorses it. There is no trans-historical truth about the human condition. But again, we should ask ourselves whether that last statement is true: for if it is true, it is false. There has arisen among modernist philosophers a certain paradoxism which has served to put them out of communication with those of their contemporaries who are merely modern. A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is &quot;merely relative,&quot; is asking you not to believe him. So don&#039;t.\u201d</span><br><br>Chesterton on Nietzsche <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche had some natural talent for sarcasm: he could sneer, though he could not laugh; but there is always something bodiless and without weight in his satire, simply because it has not any mass of common morality behind it. He is himself more preposterous than anything he denounces. But, indeed, Nietzsche will stand very well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence. The softening of the brain which ultimately overtook him was not a physical accident. If Nietzsche had not ended in imbecility, Nietzscheism would end in imbecility. Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot. Every man who will not have softening of the heart must at last have softening of the brain.</span><br><br>Roger Scruton on Nietzsche<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche himself has become a kind of idol. Despite his antagonism towards democracy and mass culture, despite his unashamedly racist attack on the Germans and all things German, despite his advocacy of \u2018health\u2019 and strength against the \u2018sickness\u2019 of compassion, despite his contempt for socialists, vegetarians, feminists and women generally \u2013 despite committing every sin condemned by the morality of \u2018political correctness\u2019, Nietzsche is now a cult figure. </span><br><br>Even Bertrand Russell has an insightful critique <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into a duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.</span>", "filename": "AC64AA08-FF54-4B3B-93E0-F83592709945", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 651, "h": 1093, "tn_w": 74, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673566722590792, "time": 1673566722, "md5": "++mvwKk50qZXdWq5yEMDHQ==", "fsize": 621329, "resto": 21516188}, {"no": 21517583, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:14:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517304</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nice!

A hot summers day with the glint of eve beating back the light. Lem was playing but really any entertainment to be had was forcibly ejected long ago. He only ever did what he had to. And ever since he graduated school a year ago he had nothing to have to do. The dull buzz of his computer filled his mind. There was no more youth in this world. Decades ago he could have gone to the disco. Or the socialist rally parties. But now all these youth groups were gone. Only the bleak modernity remained. The only thing for him was endless masturbation. His life felt cold. Lem&#039;s youthful day dreams were exclusively centered on taking his father&#039;s Colt revolver and running down to the substation to end his life. He would become electricity. My mind is estranged from itself. I watch streamers all day. I can&#039;t move forward. I am trapped. Its hopeless. The game is rigged. Nobody likes me. Ill never own a home. And such and such filled Lem&#039;s little head. He gazed at his bookshelf. What was once filled with books and pamphlets had been vandalized. Textbooks on American History, the Spanish language, fantastical tales of heroism, Japanese comic books. These familiar sights had been ejected and exploded onto the floor. What was on the shelf instead were works of art. Stoner by Williams, Jest by Wallace, Hegel, Cioran. Lem could hardly stand himself. In his free time during the barren hours between midnight and the Dawn he would burn his old books. Hoping that some day he would burn himself. And maybe he&#039;d become a phoenix. He was alone. Lem thought of leaving. Going to some backwards place, like Pennsylvania and changing his name to David. He day dreamed about meeting an asian girl and bedding her. Lem had never had a girlfriend in his life. He had never had a friend that didn&#039;t come in through the wire. Lem liked to imagine himself as a depressed man in his mid 30s at the end of his rope, a heap of experiences and torture on his shoulders. Failed relationships and abandoned children and broken dreams. He liked to believe he lived in a technocratic dystopia and was some kind of authority in it such as a detective. Lem liked to imagine Sisyphus happy. Sissyphus may be the name of a porn star Lem liked<br><br>Lem opened his bedroom window and looked outside. He saw nothing but a cooking suburban neighborhood. His parents driveway empty. They&#039;re on vacation. Lem thought about jumping but didn&#039;t. He sat on his four post bed and decided to masturbate again instead. He imagined himself with an amazonian woman twice his size. She could carry him around and guide him to the best fruits in the jungle.

rarely say this buzzword meme phrase, but nice cope.

For the USA to say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t drop our thousands of nukes on every single rice farmer, because then international opinion would have turned on us and our tactical victory in Vietnam would have been geostrategically pyrrhic!!&quot; is pathetic. Vietnam fought an incredible war using every single means at its disposal and proved that the pawns can outmaneuver the queens on the board of realpolitik. Vietnam&#039;s victory was so incredible that it&#039;s philosophically significant, it&#039;s a modern Thermopylae, Marathon, or Salamis. Who cares that the Persians burnt Athens? Does anyone even remember that? No, they remember Thermopylae, Marathon, and Salamis. <br><br>To say &quot;we only lost because we couldn&#039;t disregard all metapolitical factors!! if we could have done total mobilization and destroyed our geopolitical hegemonic position and caused revolution on the home front, we could have had more tanks than you!! you had a worse K:D ratio!!!&quot; is childish and shows a lack of understanding of war.

This process of becoming, as Nietzsche encourages his readers to think, is not geared towards a final destination or goal. The key of the process is the ongoing engagement, the re-examination and re-challenging of one\u2019s beliefs, rather than a system of achieving a certain state of being. Nietzsche attacks the staleness and \u201csickness\u201d that results from the lack of change, as well as the regression or corruption that comes from interrupting the process of becoming. Nietzsche saw life as a conflict of different wills, with the \u201cwill to power\u201d as the strongest drive that dominates all our other drives. Whenever we interpret something or give it meaning, we impose our will.

With that he seized a great horn from Guthl\u00e1f his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains. Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it.

The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone.

In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his 296 the fellowship of the ring close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lu\u00b4thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u00b4miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\u2019s kin, in Lo\u00b4rien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father\u2019s house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry; for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother\u2019s torment in the dens of the orcs.</span><br><br>I want you to read this and then honestly tell me Tolkien&#039;s writing compares in any way to that fat bastard. <br><br><s>Also, Tolkien managed to finish his works, even 40 years after his death.</s>", "time": 1673571422, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517748, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:57:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517743</a><br>lord of the rings is earth itself. simple incredible", "time": 1673571426, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517751, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "its honestly insane people think they can compare tolkien to martin. i guess getting adapted to the american big screen is all that fucking matters", "time": 1673571488, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21517757, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:59:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517748</a><br>It has width but not depth.

He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them.

Here&#039;s a quote by Schmitt in one of those Junger threads, from his Political Romanticism:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;To a great extent, all ecclesiastical and state institutions and forms, all legal concepts and arguments, everything that is official, and even democracy itself since the time it assumed a constitutional form are perceived as empty and deceptive disguises, as a veil, a fa\u00e7ade, a fake, or a decoration. The words, both refined and crude, in which this is encompassed are more numerous and forceful than most of the corresponding idioms of other times; for example, the references to &quot;simulacra&quot; that the political literature of the seventeenth century employs as its characteristic shibboleth. Today the &quot;backstage&quot; that conceals the real movement of reality is constructed everywhere. This betrays the insecurity of the time and its profound sense of being deceived. An era that produces no great form and no representation based on its own presuppositions must succumb to such states of mind and regard everything that is formal and official as a fraud. This is because no era lives without form, regardless of the extent to which it comports itself in an economic fashion. If it does not succeed in finding its own form, then it grasps for thousands of surrogates in the genuine forms of other times and other peoples, only to immediately repudiate the surrogate as a sham.&quot;</span><br><br>Is Junger&#039;s anarch only the result of this mindset? To go further, if we apprehend Schmitt&#039;s body of work as an attempt to elucidate a path by which we can find our own form, what does that mean for the anarch? He seems open to a legitimate and deserving authority (whatever that means), but Schmitt is quite explicit, i.e. in his work on Hobbes, about the necessity of the destruction of the distinction between public and private thought, or put properly, about that distinction being the root of the problem to begin with.", "filename": "schmitt", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1253, "h": 1548, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673560849706152, "time": 1673560849, "md5": "Z5vq5NGFUED0y9petpOTHQ==", "fsize": 905031, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21517541, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)19:02:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21516539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21516539</a><br>bump", "filename": "1280px-Henri_Matisse,_1902,_Notre-Dame,_une_fin_d&#039;apr\u00e8s-midi,_oil_on_paper_mounted_on_canvas,_72.4_x_54.6_cm,_Albright-Knox_Art_Gallery", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 1752, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673568134658250, "time": 1673568134, "md5": "gukgXu09uX56PtGjgTSqWA==", "fsize": 474470, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21518283, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:25:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517067</a><br>SOMEONE ANSWER", "time": 1673580306, "resto": 21516539}, {"no": 21518684, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:44:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21516539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21516539</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you interpret Ernst Junger&#039;s Anarch?

A computer was placed in a cage with six monkeys. After one month of hammering away at it (as well as using it as a bathroom!), the monkeys produced fifty typed pages \u2014 but not a single word. Schroeder noted that this was the case even though the shortest word in the English language is one letter ( a or I). A is a word only if there is a space on either side of <br>it. If we take it that the keyboard has thirty characters (the twenty-six letters and other symbols), then the likelihood of getting a one-letter word is 30 times 30 times 30, which is <br>27,000. The likelihood of a getting a one-letter word is one chance out of 27,000. <br><br>Schroeder then applied the probabilities to the sonnet analogy. \u201cWhat\u2019s the chance of getting a Shakespearean sonnet?\u201d he asked. He continued: <br><br>All the sonnets are the same length. They\u2019re by <br>definition fourteen lines long. I picked the one I <br>knew the opening line for, \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\u201d I counted the number of letters; there are 488 letters in that sonnet. What\u2019s the likelihood of hammering away and getting 488 letters in the exact sequence as in &quot;Shall I Compare Thee to a <br>Summer\u2019s Day?\u201d? What you end up with is 26 multiplied by itself 488 times \u2014 or 26 to the 488th power. <br><br>Or, in other words, in base 10, 10 to the 690th. <br><br>Now the number of particles in the universe \u2014 <br>not grains of sand, I\u2019m talking about protons, electrons, and neutrons \u2014 is 10 to the 8oth. Ten to the 8oth is i with 80 zeros after it. Ten to the 690th is 1 with 690 zeros after it.

Thus, Poe, considering all levels of a text from the choice of words, to the style and form, and the characters, setting, and plot, decided to write a short and accessible poem about a mourning man fearful of a knocking one tempestuous night in the grips of remembering Lenore, whereupon he checked his window after his door, flew into his room a Raven, and Quoth the Raven: &quot;Nevermore&quot;.

We both agree there is a system of controlled opposition that involves revolutionary liberal secular bloody campaigns, which still allude to Saturnalian iconography, and reactionary exclusionary Abrahamism. This is to culminate in the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies based on a linear eschatology, and this follows the principles of the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter. It is no coincidence Corona hoax began around the time of a Great Conjunction. Likewise, the Singularity will occur around 2040, which is another Great Conjunction. All of this fits within Abrahamic linear accounts of history.<br><br>While Abrahamism may have some influences from other traditions, their mythological core is made foul-proof against any attempt of a long-term symbiosis with indigenous or pagan traditions. Pay attention to what the other guy was saying, &quot;Europeans are the real Jews.&quot; This is because Christianity has certain ingrained elements in it to make Europeans ashamed of their pagan unbelieving past. Islam functions similarly with its Sayyed caste, and Hezbollah recently said all Iranians are actually Arabs. Dharmic Systems such as Mahayana do not have these problems.<br><br>There can be little to no compromise with Abrahamism. You may attempt to make it more all-encompassing and open to perennial interpretations of a Primordial Tradition, but it will not be successful in the end. This is because the &quot;The Incarnation [of Jesus]&quot; and &quot;Final Seal of the Prophets [of Muhammad]&quot; functions in a kind of analogous manner to stamp out anything deemed as perennial and respectful/integrative of different narratives. In fact, it severs one&#039;s link to the sacred elements and culminates in the destruction of the Earth&#039;s biosphere, breakdown of racial identity, erosion of communal cultures, massively scaled wars with no end, and so on.<br><br>Continued.", "time": 1673549029, "resto": 21513490}, {"no": 21516348, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)13:45:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21516344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21516344</a><br>Part 2/2<br><br>Ludwig Klages, who I consider to be an enlightened pratyekabuddha, wrote a beautiful essay &quot;Man and Earth&quot;. In it he discusses encountering Italians who are killing birds. When questioned about this, they respond, &quot;It&#039;s fine, they don&#039;t believe in Jesus&quot; (paraphrasing). However, a sincere Buddhist would never respond in such a manner, for all sentient beings, including the birds, possess Buddha nature. To claim life was created by a &quot;commandment&quot; leads to a logocentrism where life is ultimately devalued, and where the apocalyptic Messianic plans take paramount importance over inner liberation. <br><br>The Absolute is found in the solar eclipse, which leads to a love of the natural world and its tapestry of differences. There is a unity underlying a diversity. This is why those who seek solitude in natural scenery, without trying to grasp concepts or control any sentient being, are likely to become enlightened. The Buddha exists in every sentient being, even those who have never heard of him, and though few awaken to it, there is no point in enforcing it violently onto others.<br><br>This is also why Pentti Linkola died peacefully in his sleep, for his love of the sacred elements was anti-Saturalian in the truest sense of the word.<br><br>What I am arguing is that Abrahamism is akin to an invasive species on Earth, most likely from Saturn. Much like how cats are an invasive species and are culled in order to preserve biocenosis (out of necessity, not hatred), so too Abrahamism must be eliminated without any hesitancy. For this reason, I consider &quot;false compassion&quot; towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims as anti-dharmic in the modern age. I am not claiming we will have a utopia afterwards, but we will have a much more stable civilizational and environmental order once Abrahamism is purged. I am not arguing this out of hatred, but out of honesty and my own experiences. The solution isn&#039;t to promote greater escalation of Abrahamic sectarian conflicts but to adopt non-Abrahamic traditions while going back to man&#039;s default evolutionary state (i.e., homogeneous communities in close connection to the sacred elements).<br><br>Abrahamists are not content with just &quot;letting people be&quot;, accepting that they all have something like Buddha nature with their own particular upaya.

Followers of religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are practicing, at their best and ideally, Ishta Devata-Bhakti, devotion to a personal God, and at their most sophisticated theologically and philosophically, also practicing Ishvara-Bhakti, or devotion to a formless being (God, Cosmic Lord), which in Hindu theology is not necessarily regarded as existing in opposition to a more personal conception of God, but as being the substratum and true reality behind such a personal conception of God, which more personal conceptions of God can indeed be authentic routes to knowledge of God.<br><br>This conception of God, born out by some Jewish, Christian, and Muslim mystics (like Sufis) could, I think, be apposite and analogous to the conception of a Buddha-nature in all sentient beings, thereby encouraging respect for them, with the difference that they would all be seen (more sentimentally speaking) as \u201call children of God,\u201d or as the creations, emanations and manifestations of God (in a panentheistic worldview, for instance, holding God to simultaneously pervade, be the substratum of, and be the transcendent creator of the world). <br><br>Panentheism is a frequent motif in the mystics of the Abrahamic faiths, from the Kabbalists to the Sufis. This strange recursion of the immanent and the transcendent in such strains of mysticism, I think gives rise to a worldview which could be quite harmonious and compatible with that of an underlying Buddha-nature in everyone, although not necessarily identical, just as the Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist vinegar-tasters don\u2019t all respond identically but are unified in their tasting of the vinegar.", "filename": "3D8AEE77-1B0B-4962-9928-012ECA129F83", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 551, "h": 640, "tn_w": 107, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673555002248862, "time": 1673555002, "md5": "0FmLoZS8fXYSyaEe73lVfA==", "fsize": 184054, "resto": 21513490}, {"no": 21516641, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)15:23:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21513490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21513490</a><br>why is there a quran thread every time i check this board...?

For Guenon it is Advaita. For Evola it is Magic of which Alchemy and Yoga are examples par excellence. For Eliade it is shamanism. The lattermost was most accomplished scholar and rose to prominence. We must however question the politics of his move to place shamanism first. Is it most correct? Or most politically correct? Are shamans roots of all religions? Are modern so-called capitalist oppressed civilization avoidant shamanic indigineous cultures today really how all of primitive man lived? Eiade himself says drug use is degenerate shamanism lol. Many scholars nowadays also argue for schismogenetic religious experience and schismogenetic prehistoric culture. Polyphony. Plurality. Multivalence.

In short, it is very complicated and the answer is yes and no and changed with time and place. Catholics have sacraments. And mystics. Masons are initiatic too. Kept alive certain stuff. Enemies tho. But latter led to GD and Thelema and stuff now. Whole mess of masonry illuminati and rosicrucians mixing. But also gnosticism. Christian theosophy. Not to be confused with theosophical society. Tho same milieu as Crowley Evola Guenon etc. Neoplatonism and Hermeticism crosspollinated. Both integral to western proto sciences like alchemy and astrology and magic. Catholic church is ambivalent.

This has diluted the term somewhat and now there is much new age alchemy bullshit on the market but at the same time this is nothing new. Spirituality was always an integral part of such. Also, hermeticism as an esoteric philosophy is much broader than the mere practice of alchemy. Jung used alchemical principles to develop his theories of individuation and create what is now called active imagination. This latter practice he believed was more helpful and healing to the world than all his psychological theories combined -- provided people actually practice it. Which admittedly he worried was more dangerous and difficult. People like Lull also used techniques similar to active imagination to create vast memory palaces and turn themselves into what is almost like, if you&#039;ll pardon my Dune reference, a human mentat, or walking encyclopedia.", "time": 1673270410, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21501763, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)10:45:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Larry Principe is one of the few legit alchemists of our day<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ea<wbr>lYU2ICnU&amp;ab_channel=BytesizeScience<wbr>", "time": 1673279115, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21502845, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)15:28:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Any French anon alchemists here? <br>What do y&#039;all think of Patrick Burensteinas and his Voyage Alchimique and books on alchemy?", "time": 1673296090, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21503849, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)19:46:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "bump", "time": 1673311605, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21504993, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)01:52:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is the Count of St. Germain legit?

Half a century ago there was little doubt in the West. It was a superstition among ignorant ancients that, by certain manipulations, base metals could be turned into gold.<br><br>Then, when Freudian and Jungian ideas began to circulate in Europe, a new, enlightened view of alchemy became fashionable. The alchemists were psychoanalysing themselves. They were sublimating and calcining their own subconscious. Their real aim was not to make gold but to make a non-aberrated man.<br><br>As pursuits of this kind in the Middle Ages overlapped territory which the Church held to be its own, the alchemists had been obliged to conceal what they were really doing behind an apparently lunatic attempt to turn lead into gold.<br><br>Even for the new psychological avant-garde this explanation was not entirely satisfactory, because it was well known that even in the 20th century highly intelligent men in Fez, Cracow, Damascus, Paris and London were currently engaged in attempts to make perfectly tangible yellow gold. They had given up charcoal furnaces and were using Calor gas, but they were manifestly doing something with pots and pans, and not with Egos and Ids.<br><br>Perhaps all external ideas about the nature of alchemy could be put into four views, separately or in combination:<br><br>First View: It is possible to transmute one element into another. One such transmutation is lead or iron into gold. From some unimaginable antiquity, a mighty secret has been handed down which shows how to do this. It is the most closely kept secret in human history.<br><br>Second View: Alchemy is the science of purifying man\u2019s inner nature and arriving at a non-aberrated individual. Such an individual would have, by comparison with ordinary men, certain advanced powers. For political reasons, this exercise had to be concealed in a pseudo-science of metal refining to which the Church would have no reason to object.<br><br>Third View: Metals CAN be transmuted. Lead CAN be turned into gold. An alchemist knows how to do this, and also knows a greater secret. If he is in a certain relation to the crucible in which the process happens, a comparable transmutation takes place in his own common presence. As lead turns into gold in the crucible, the operator\u2019s mind is transformed. He is subjected to something like nuclear radiation. Also, certain chemical by-products in the crucible are capable of being stored and used to either make more gold or to transform other men. Hence legends of \u201cThe Sly Man\u2019s Pill\u201d and the Elixir which Saint-Germain is supposed to have offered Casanova when he was dying.<br><br>Fourth View: An alchemist is a man who knows an immensely powerful method of cleaning the Augean stable of his own subconscious mind. Pushed far enough, this process gives rise to a true soul-body inholding the properties of a different order of things. If this soul-body is directed on the base metals in a certain way (projection), it will accomplish a comparable transmutation in inorganic matter.", "filename": "803E7E06-8AC9-4A31-B6C1-27A448D86814", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 251, "h": 400, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673393798699408, "time": 1673393798, "md5": "HxhBJkP2vV1I4eCx+A9+KA==", "fsize": 19795, "resto": 21496697}, {"no": 21508123, "now": "01/10/23(Tue)19:06:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21506706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21506706</a><br>That somewhat lowers my opinion of Evola sadly.

The trouble is that you are not yourself familiar with Aquinas, but only with summaries of his arguments as presented by &#039;people&#039;. Who are these people you&#039;re referring to, by the way? Aquinas was not particularly concerned with natural theology, which is a part of philosophy really; the Summa is not an attempt to demonstrate the existence of God from naturally observed principles. Rather, since that truth is clearly observable, Aquians uses it as the starting point for the Summa, which is really a demonstration and summary of almost the entirety of Theology--a science which, in treating of higher things than philosophy, is a higher science than philosophy. Furthermore, as Aquinas explains, there are two senses to the word faith--the sense most are familiar with today is the notion of a strongly held opinion, but this is really the second sense. The first and more proper sense of the word is to place trust or confidence in someone or something--after all, Fide is the very root of the word con-fid-ence--with faith. Having faith in God is more properly believing God than it is believing that God exists. I know that if I drop an apple, it will fall; if I have faith in gravity, is that some speculative opinion that gravity exists? The Faith with which Aquinas treats, and of which scripture speaks is that first meaning of the word, less commonly understood today--believing God. That is, in knowing that God is all good and therefore cannot deceive nor be deceived, we must have a perfect confidence--we must have faith--in all that God communicates to man. This is faith properly so called. And because we can be sure of all that God reveals, we can be sure of all necessary conclusions drawn from revelation. The study of these conclusions and apparent conclusions is the science of Theology. The &#039;leap of faith&#039; as you describe it is a novelty coined by Kierkegaard which has no place in actual Catholic theology. It is debatable whether Kierkegaard&#039;s writings are orthodox. No &#039;leap of faith&#039; is necessary, and neither Thomas nor his adherents would ever suggest so. Of course, if you do not trust a man, you will not trust what he says.

The identity of God of classical theism with any particular deity is different matter.

Just try putting all the religions into one bag and then make for example what is called a history of religions. It\u2019s truly horrific. There is only one true religion, and that religion is Christian. The only thing is to know whether this truth will hold on, whether it will end up able to actually drown us in the meanings spews forth. I\u2019m sure it will be able to because it does have resources. Lots of things are ready-made for these purposes. It will interpret the Book of Revelations. A lot of people have already taken a stab at it. It will unearth correlations between everything. This is its function in fact.<br><br>The analyst on the other hand is another thing entirely. He inhabits a kind of coming-of-age moment. For a short period of time, we caught sight of what the intrusion of the Real really is. The analyst remains tied to this point. He is there like a symptom and can only endure as a symptom. But you shall see, the day will come when humanity will be cured of psychoanalysis. This symptom will eventually be repressed by dint of its being drowned in meaning, religious meaning of course.\u201d<br><br>From this, we can infer that Lacan had considered what effects different religions had on their societies and which one stood out as one providing meaning to all things - which religion was the \u201cintrusion of the Real?\u201d<br><br>Paganism did not generally deal in meaning, and pagan societies were typically inspired more by honor and glory and the like than anything more deeply real. Philosophical religions (e.g. Buddhism) had their merits, but were entirely too human and mundane: his work in psycho-analysis had convinced him that the Real lies beyond and behind, and would not be discovered by a mere teacher.<br><br>That leaves the revealed religions: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, each of which had its prophets claiming outside knowledge. Presumably, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were too narrow, being too deeply rooted in culture. Likewise, Islam seemed to be rooted in a particular culture, and mostly inspired meaning through obedience and conquest in the name of God. I think his sense of the Real went too far for that to work.<br><br>That leaves Christianity: the doctrine that the source of all being, the Real, created from nothing out of love for the something, and was so wounded by creation\u2019s rebellion that he poured the Real into manhood and thereby made the Real accessible to all things on Earth.

There are as many ways to the summit of God-consciousness as there are human hearts.

Contemplative prayer and the Prayer of the Heart, or so-called \u201cJesus Prayer\u201d, of Orthodox monks is parallel to the mantras of Hindu yoga. Hesychasm is analogous to systematizations of yogic meditation like Kriya Yoga or Patanjali\u2019s Raja Yoga. They both are ascetic. They both seek to keep the remembrance of God alive in one\u2019s heart and mind at all times.

The limits of experience and human conceptions of religion are only so much, explaining why similarities pop up so frequently across cultures, times, and lands. So, with a philosophically and theologically rich tradition going back millennia, they\u2019re not \u201ccaught off-guard\u201d by other religions. <br><br>The Christian can be considered as doing Bhakti Yoga (yoga of faith, devotion, love) with Christ as the Beloved. The Hindu can consider the Muslim as doing Bhakti Yoga with Muhammad as the Beloved. Both also are partaking in what Hindus would even more technically call Ishta Devata-Bhakti, devotion to a personal God or goddess, to God or Allah, simultaneously with their reverence for Christ or Muhammad. This is no surprise because in the vast world Hinduism itself, it can easily be considered by a Hindu, that, \u201cThis one worships Krishna, another Shiva, another Rama, and this one worships Shakti. The goal they reach is the same, and all are devoted to the same God who lies in the hearts of all living beings.\u201d<br><br>Unfortunately and paradoxically enough, though, as the OP points out, such open-mindedness doesn\u2019t, on the whole, seem to always apply the other way around so much, although there are exceptions.<br><br>Bonus allusion: Sufis have also tried to say more or less the same things as some Hindus, and also hold Christ in tremendously high regard, but often faced persecution or execution for it from more intolerant Muslims. Some were even historically accused of being \u201csecret Christians\u201d for how frequently they referenced Christ and His teachings! You\u2019d imagine this shouldn\u2019t be as much of a sticking-point for Muslims, as Christ is regarded as a prophet and a saint in Islam, as well, inspired by the same God as Muhammad, yet, once again, we can see an example of how open-mindedness on the part of one group is not always met by open-mindedness on the part of another group, or the rest of humanity.<br><br>Bonus bonus allusion: the distinction between the essence and energies of God in Eastern Orthodox theology conceived by St. Gregory Palamas, is analogous to the distinction between Paramashakti (the immanent, energetic, and feminine pole of God) and Paramashiva (the transcendental formless consciousness of God) preserved in sects like Shaiva Siddhanta, Kashmir Shaivism, and other Shaivite sects, as well as sects of Shaktism.", "filename": "B8B4517F-0770-4292-92F4-4AAEE85CC0F8", "ext": ".gif", "w": 220, "h": 565, "tn_w": 48, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673540068571441, "time": 1673540068, "md5": "nmGnmIFU+iMtaXpjJf+KEw==", "fsize": 78290, "resto": 21514020}, {"no": 21515914, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)11:47:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21514902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21514902</a><br>Use punctuation, you retard.", "time": 1673542051, "resto": 21514020}, {"no": 21515943, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)11:53:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21515543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21515543</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;insufferable icchantikas</span><br>Damn, like this post.
