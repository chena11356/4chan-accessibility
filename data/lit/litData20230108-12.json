You are, in the classical sense, projecting this onto me. I am not asserting as cosmically correct my own definition. You seem to have missed the nuance, but when I said that we were discussing our theories, I intentionally implied an openness to dissent. To an extent, I also implied humility, but this humility ends where one&#039;s definition of love promotes unhealthy views towards life. I don&#039;t profess any ideology, presuppositions, nor adherence (or even recognition of) the &#039;ismist suckdick extravaganza which characterizes 21st century discourse in all arenas. <br><br>If I have fanaticism, it is in opposition to people whose philosophies are necessarily exclusionary of others \u2014 which define themselves in opposition. If I have fanaticism, it is in the idea that the worldview in which you are so invested is not some kind of supra-real reality as is always depressively implied in these discussions. The fact that it makes you feel bad does not necessarily imply that it is more real. A set of ideas that justify your feelings of hopelessness, resignation, despair is not intrinsically correct to the exclusion of all other ideals just because you find it sufficiently justifies that feeling. Answer me honestly: what came first, the feelings that spurred on the development of these ideas of yours, or the ideas? My money is on the feelings, regardless of what you will or won&#039;t say. <br><br>My purpose here is not to replace these ideas you&#039;ve obviously spent so long developing, research, correlating. It&#039;s too instill in anyone reading this exchange who might otherwise be convinced by the dour and superficially-rigorous tone in which your ideas are related that there is wiggle-room. Your ideas are one set among many. If we recognize that logic cannot create reality \u2014 only describe it \u2014 then it becomes obvious that an argument&#039;s truth value is completely independent of its correlation with reality. You could make the world&#039;s most rigorous argument for the idea that heat is actually cold and it will only change the fact that now it&#039;s cold that burns you.

I would just start with the original End of History article.<br><br>Fukuyama&#039;s two volume opus on state development is fantastic, not just for his own theories, but because it very abley sums up 2000 years of theorizing about what makes some states strong and prosperous. It&#039;s a great work but you come away from the second volume wondering if there is something to political decay he is missing. It&#039;s a very political science take, not thinking so much in terms of a grand pattern.<br><br>But can we see a pattern in Argentina&#039;s being one of the very wealthiest countries in the world in the late-1800s, on par with the US, and then its considerable decay? I&#039;d argue the faliure of their liberal system to sublated nationalism and socialism shows the answer.

Jihad vs McWorld and The Clash of Civilizations both have major flaws but kernels of truth too.<br><br>BTW, I do think Fukuyama&#039;s diagnosis of the Last Man problem is spot on. Men in the West today fear becoming bovine consumers more than anything. The whole MRA, pick up artist, manosphere movement, and the chest thumping of various Boog enthusiasts is wonderfully predicted in The End of History. I think Fukuyama under appreciated the threat from the left with disatisfaction over inequality (median US real wages for the bottom 40% would absolutely tank, making people less well off in the decade following his book), but he was right that Last Man Syndrome would come to dominate the right.<br><br>In a way, this is cyclical. You can sew huge parallels between the hunger for war, the idealization of it as some great adventure, the fascination of people with a far off war (Ukraine and Syria), etc. with the influential clique that yearned for a war before 1914. It is similar pressures, the erosion of status, etc. that lead men to chase after wars in spite of the fact that every generation forced to actually fight them ends up overwhelmingly regretting them. There is something ominous in pictures of armed rallies today, in that the median age is probably 55, and obesity rates are probably 70+%.

And what about the information in the quran which cannot be found in christian texts? What about the christian texts which were not available or were not even translated to the arabic language or the languages in the region of those he interacted with?

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don&#039;t like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.", "time": 1673103168, "resto": 21491879}, {"no": 21492507, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)09:53:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21492501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21492501</a><br>Then there is the fact that every character you meet in the story turns up again, hundreds of miles away, to reveal that they are someone else and have been secretly controlling the action of the plot. It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

But this book really killed it for me. I was spoiled in advance that our MC gets married with a character introduced early on despite the no romantic interaction between them. <br>So, based on what we were told about high cultivation beasts, I was expecting it to be the White Tigress named Azrea, companion he is with since book 1 who we know will only be able to assume a human form once she reaches higher cultivation. The first time we see her in human form is in this book, great. She confesses she loves him, great. Our MC pulls a japcuck move &#039;I love you like a father&#039;, decides his love interest is a female we got introduced halfway into the series and who barely appeared, and they were never close, closer to enemies and who he never cared about beyond thinking she is hot, which is nothing unique in this story. Awful, but whatever, she is implied to be a reincarnation of a girl he met way before and died before he could love, since the world works that way. This is implied in this book, not before.<br>But then the author decides to character assassinate the MC, Azrea, and the MC&#039;s &#039;true love&#039;. All to move plot forward in the same direction it was going for over 10 books, and he changed in this very book. What the fuck.<br>Christ almighty, I can get over OTP being ruined even if it&#039;s the only romantic line we could have based on all context, and that makes sense in the setting. I can get over the author being horny for demon girls when he decied to write this bullshit. But to ruin the whole setup of plot,our MC&#039;s character, and to a lesser extent Azrea&#039;s character, all in order to prolong what he is draging over 10 books is amazing. If someone told me he was paid big money or held at gunpoint to write it like that I would believe it.<br>Now I know I am being a faggot to stop reading a book over romantic pairing of all things, when that isn&#039;t even the main focus of the book, but it brings into view all the dissatisfaction I had with the series that I could easily ignore due to enjoyment. The nonstop action and mundane happening that occur back to back that makes it impossible to finish the series without a hundred books, which is countered by timeskips of immense scale that depict events that sound much more interesting than events what we get in hundred pages chunks, introductions of multiple power systems that make power levels all over the place, MC being forced into constant deadly situations he shouldn&#039;t be in, which he can only overcome with deus ex machina powerups, bits and pieces of deepest lore that bog down the story due to taking at least 50% of the word count outside of battles and could be told in much better ways.<br>Overall, worth a read if you like cultivation stories, especially if you wanted a western story with eastern influence.<br>Thanks for reading my blog, this is a cry for help.", "filename": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 333, "h": 500, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673154896777019, "time": 1673154896, "md5": "QiBDdd8u8itIDyiaeA+DQw==", "fsize": 46686, "resto": 21494509}, {"no": 21495934, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)00:15:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21494775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21494775</a><br>This desu.

For example, one can think of 4chan. According to the Central limit Theorem, any sufficiently complex variable can be modeled with a normal distribution. So the propensity to use 4chan, which is obviously a complex variable involving upbringing, sex, etc., can be described with such a graph. If we can assume that actually using 4chan involves a sort of high-pass filter, so that one must have a certain propensity for 4chan to even consider using it, then there&#039;s a set of shared characteristics whose aggregate describes the average 4chan user. Of course, it&#039;s not one particular trait, but some combination of anti-sociality, racism, intelligence, and misogyny which creates the average 4chan poster. To expand the site then requires one of two things. Either you force every anti-social loser to post here, or you lower this filter. Since the first option is so unlikely as to be impossible, any expansion of the userbase requires lowering the criteria for posting here. This means that, as the site grow, the average poster has experiences that are further and further from the average chudcel.<br>In the extreme case, one could imagine a site whose userbase includes the whole planet; that site&#039;s culture would thus be indistinguishable from modern irl culture. <br>To summarize, as the userbase increases the culture of a site approximates normalfaggot culture.", "time": 1673049764, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490118, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I wish I didn\u2019t live.", "time": 1673053738, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490152, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:17:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489919</a>", "filename": "1672418363788950", "ext": ".png", "w": 1360, "h": 1358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1673054223973699, "time": 1673054223, "md5": "X8XbIcBi47fMvFOhTMYNtQ==", "fsize": 44050, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21490178, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)20:27:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486955</a><br>Finally got prescribed a PSA test.

I&#039;ll tell you a story. One time I was on a meth and benzo bender with an acquaintance and his new Canadian girlfriend, we spent a week in my bungalow just doing all sorts of drugs, meth, mdma, heroin, exotic benzos, acid. We would stay up for a couple days ranting nonsense at each other on meth, and then sleep in a pile on my floor nodding out zombied on benzos. When he was out of the room she just went for my cock, trying to suck it I assume. I thought a second then just put her to bed, she was too fucked up so it wouldn&#039;t be right (I didn&#039;t care as much about betraying my acquaintance). Thing is, a heatwave struck while we were doing this, 40 degrees celsius for days in my hotbox of a bungalow. We all just stripped down to our underwear, so pretty much the entire week this beautiful 20yo Canadian hippy with huge tits just went topless with knickers. But it was so hot and we were so fixated on drugs it had a very &#039;non-sexual&#039; quality even though I was shamelessly just zoning out staring at her tits. Her boyfriend had warned me beforehand, &#039;yeah she always goes topless&#039;, I don&#039;t care I said.<br><br>Another story? my friend broke up with his gf and had to come and stay with me and my gf for a couple of weeks, sleeping on out couch. So y gf&#039;s morning routine would be to wake up, then go feed the cats. So she would just be wearing her knickers and a singlet, bends over that way to feed the cats, which was apparently right in my friends face every day. He complains that she&#039;s bending over in her knickers in front of his face with her pussy and ass, so we kick him out for being rude. Another friend comes to stay. Less rude. Hot day. She inadvertently wears an extremely translucent white top that she hadn&#039;t worn before. Her tits are obviously completely visible but my friend is polite and cool and we just have a fun day. We decide to fill up some plastic mini-pool thing.

She was being very flirty with a handsome friend of ours, we invited him to come smoke a joint with us in the grimy pub toilet block. We crammed into the small room and she immediately sat down to pee (I&#039;ll just say once more this is very, very unusual, she was usually conservative and shy). She pulled her dress right up, her black stocking and black lace knickers down in front of us and sat down nonchalantly. My friend went red, embarrassed and turned around, apologizing profusely. We laughed and said it was fine. When she was done, she slowly pulled up her stockings and knickers, obviously flashing us her pussy but pretending she wasn&#039;t. We started smoking weed and chatting and we were joking about seeing her pee, she suddenly said &#039;hey do I have a nice ass&#039;, stood up, pulled her skirt up and bent over. I was awestruck (she is not like this, really), she was being casual like, &#039;yeah do I just have a nice ass, no big deal&#039;. Black lace knickers, stockings, bent over the toilet. It was a jokey environment and me and my friend just complemented her ass and groped it lightly. My friend took me aside again and apologized, thinking my gf was crazed and he was doing something wrong, I reassured him it was fine, not knowing myself what was going on. The one thing I was picking up: She was doing this angrily, not to please me. like: &#039;this is what u want?&#039;, drunken lady anger. Next, the tits. &quot;Do I have nice boobs&quot;, she said. We said yeah you have great boobs. &quot;Do you want to feel them&quot;, she said to my friend. He apologizes again and I say shut up dude go ahead. He just gropes her tits over her top for a while, same jokey atmosphere, just a couple dudes feeling a nice girls chest. We compliment and such. I become overwhelmed and just pull her bra down, exposing her pearl white tits and pink nipples. My friend touches her nipples and she covers herself embarrassed, we just go back to chilling, smoking weed.<br><br>Here&#039;s a couple of things that also happened tho: 1: I was going in and out of the room to get drinks the whole time. My friend later confessed, highly ashamed, that she was groping his cock every time I left the room, I never brought it up with her. 2: she had sheer black knickers that night. So when we were sitting around for hours, she had her legs spread and bare pussy visible a lot of the time, If he cared to look. 3. She &#039;showed her tattoo&#039; to another male friend. Thigh tattoo &quot;oh yeah I have a tattoo of that&#039;. Pulls up her skirt right cos the tattoo is on her thigh, completely sheer knickers, has her pussy in the face of my friend who politely nods.

That&#039;s why i said the issue with Qutb isn&#039;t form, but content.

But Qutb&#039;s ressentiment would be pernicious, even if Qutb dropped the Islam and became a particularist.

Some guy whose 12% remaining flesh is plugged into a flying death robot can kill a hundred Bios if he finds them--but he can&#039;t do shit if there&#039;s no electricity to recharge his battery, no replacement parts on hand, and the Swedish-produced immunosuppressants he relies on are at the bottom of the ocean because some guys in a speedboat suicide bombed the tanker transporting them across the Atlantic.<br><br>So things turn very asymmetrical, with the remaining Cogs desperately trying to cobble together enough of a functional supply system to avoid being wiped out, and the Bios systematically destroying everything that would make it possible. The story followed a joint-consciousness that is dispassionately (at first) trying to work out how this can be fixed, and slowly realizing that the Bios had argued that the entire transhumanist cause was inherently suicidal specifically because it relied on technology which in turn relied on a fragile ecosystem of production and industry and resources that was inherently unsustainable--and that once you go Cog you can&#039;t go back. This entire event wasn&#039;t so much a war as an illustration that they were right.<br><br>Near the end Pyrrhus (the Gestalt Consciousness) decides that though the Bios were idiots, they had actually intuited correctly that society was not and may not ever be ready for this, and self-destructs to spare itself the Hell-Program tortures that the renegades always used on captives.<br><br>And then I lost the fucking draft.

The style seems to *superficially* ornate, as well as repetitive, for this at the moment.

Over-reliance of the sort of statements I pointed out, e.g., &quot;I find myself in darkness!&quot; is not very evocative since it&#039;s a cliche.

That form, plus the leaden language and stilted diction, the fondness for sociological jargon and psychobabble, and the repeated use of \u201cwe argue that\u201d and\u201cwe now discuss\u201d and the like, make it certain that this was written by someone whose writing style, and probably whole intellectual development, was arrested in college.&#039;<br><br>https://www.scribd.com/document/260<wbr>727678/April-3-1996", "filename": "1670591496011659", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 338, "h": 345, "tn_w": 244, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673113084559962, "time": 1673113084, "md5": "GvtxF4jlPCWsENA8udVfWA==", "fsize": 47285, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-tips-would-you-have-given-ted-kaczynski-to", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 53, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 25}, {"no": 21493071, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)12:43:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21493049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21493049</a><br>His writing style was probably influenced from his time as a mathematician.

Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people are expressing themselves unclearly because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and power for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people NEED power. Modern man as a collective entity \u2014 that is, the industrial system \u2014 has immense power over nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS OP INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. Generally speaking, the vast power of \u201cmodern man\u201d over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. To the extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) The individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. His PERSONAL power over nature is slight.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect himself from heat cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible compared to the COLLECTIVE power of industrial society.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS.</span><br>Large organizations are those that have a significant amount of control over the industrial infrastructure of society. I imagine that in the future the industrial system will become so efficient at enforcing its laws that people with be biologically incapable of disobedience, or this will be a normal day:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drones flying overhead spot WAGIE#0199201 growing illegal substance ID:TOMATO#23 (Natural, Carbon inefficient)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HELLO WAGE#0199201 300USD HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM YOUR KTID PASS.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PLEASE REMOVE ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE OR A UNIT WILL BE DISPATCHED TO YOUR LOCATION</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OUR SYSTEMS HAVE DETECTED YOUR COVID-IMPLANT IS OT OF DATE.

A more likely explanation is provided by fear: Kirkpatrick was the leading &quot;Luddite&quot; writer of the time, and Kaczynski&#039;s writings certainly echoes his concerns. This was too close for comfort for Kirkpatrick, and in order to avoid public backlash for his own writing, and any suspected sympathies he might have for Kaczynski, he actively tried to distance himself from Kaczynski.

But he makes particular errors in regard to causal law and how perception comes to be. We must start with examining sensuous knowledge. \u2013 A tree standing before me casts the light rays hitting it back linearly. A few of them fall on my eye and make an impression on the retina, which is transmitted to the brain by the stimulated optic nerve. When touching a stone, the sensory Nerves direct the received sensations to the brain. A bird sings and thereby brings forth a wave motion in the air. A few waves reach my ear, the eardrum vibrates, and the auditory nerve transmits the impression to the brain. While eating some fruit it affects my taste buds, and they lead the impression to the brain. Thus, there are visual representations, in contrast to those representations that are not visible such as those based off touch, taste, smell, and hearing. The visualizable representation starts with an impression which is made on the eye, for example when I have looked at the tree. There has been a certain alteration on the retina of my eye, and this has notified my brain, if nothing else happens then the process would end here, for how could the weak change in my nerves be processed into a tree, and by what miraculous manner could I see it? But in actuality, the brain reacts to the impression, and the faculty which we called the understanding, becomes active. The understanding searches the cause of the change in the sense organ, and the transition of effect in the sense organ to the cause is its sole function, it is the causal law. If the brain did not react to changes in the sense organ with the function of the understanding, there would be no representation of the world; thus the causal law is a priori, it is possibility for representation and lies a priori within us.<br><br>Sensation that is not based of objective intuition is nothing but a local, specific feeling, capable in it\u2019s own way some variation, but is always subjective and so is different to an intuition. Sensations are a process within the organism itself and is therefore wholly subjective, touch, sight and smell present themselves as external causes but do not determine any spatial relationships. Thus, we cannot determine any objective intuitions based on the aforementioned sensations, we can never construct a rose based of it\u2019s smell nor can a blind person whom listens to music his entire life construct the image of a human being. If that same blind person were to feel a cubical body, the sensation of hardness, softness, dryness, moisture and temperature are not enough to determine the perceptual image of a construction; thus if said blind person were to feel the uniform and dimensions that are the same length, and that the edges press parts of his hands, the sensation of mere hardness does not construct anything similar to a cube.", "time": 1673171969, "resto": 21496644}, {"no": 21496653, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:00:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "For hardness can refer to various types of objects, but the understanding which detects a change in the sense organ, immediately constructs a firm body and a cubical shape due to the pure intuitions of space and time. The inborn a priori function of causality finds it\u2019s proof in the achievements of blind people such as Nicholas Saunderson who was blind from childhood but excelled in mathematics, optics and astronomy. The sensation of the retina can be reduced to light and dark, without the understanding we would have no ability to discern the proximity of objects and their spatial determinations thus only a meaningless array of sense data would be present to the consciousness. It is well known that light entering the eye is refracted as it passes through the cornea until both the cornea and lens act together as compound lens to project an inverted image, if vision was merely sensation the image would be reversed, however the understanding immediately at once detects a change in the retina from the direction that a light ray arrives it thus follows backwards in the position backwards on both lines to the cause. Thus the understanding is intuitive in contrast to discursive and abstract and causality creates from the heterogenous a priori intuitions of space and time the cerebral phenomena of the objective world, cognition of the understanding is completely different to introspective discursive thought, as can be seen in optical illusions where the understanding may have double vision, but reason cannot come to the aid of the understanding as it is merely abstract and diverged from it. Kant did not recognize that for them to be perception causality must be a priori in order for a change in the sense organ to be registered in the brain. Thus the 12 categories are wholly superfluous and discursive abstract thinking is not needed in immediate perception, this is seen above in the presence of optical illusions wherein reason may think that what is being presented is illusory but is the understanding does not budge. Because the law of causality is a priori we are not allowed to use causality to things-in-themselves.

Attendance figures are down by double-digit percentages across the board, around a third of eligible young men are serving missions, and a third of those are coming home early. Couple that with the ease with which anyone can access information that the church would rather bury, like the &#039;secret&#039; handbooks for bishops, recordings of &#039;sacred&#039; ceremonies, finance figures for Ensign Peak Holdings, et cetera, and I&#039;d wager that the church will fall into irrelevance in a few short decades, if not sooner. <br>I have complicated feelings about the impending Mormon Apocalypse. Personally, I feel disgusted with the church and somewhat dirtied by my having been brought up in it. I had no concept of the metaphysics or philosophy underlying Christianity until I moved out, because I was brought up to believe that the early Church was corrupted by &quot;Greek pagan thought&quot; during the great apostasy, blindly accepted crypto-Gnostic and blatantly Masonic rituals and worldviews despite knowing exactly where they were cribbed from because I thought such things were examples of the beginning of the &quot;restoration,&quot; and came up with elaborate copes for why evidence of a Jewish-descended civilization across the Americas did not exist. As a Trinitarian Christian now, I feel like I received a safari tour through every heresy ever devised.<br>I&#039;m also angered by the thought that my family bought into this ridiculous system, both figuratively and literally, for generations, and so did the families of hundreds of wonderful people I met while I was a believing member. On a similar scale as Scientology, the LDS church uses its tithing funds to purchase large investment properties and generate wealth, which it dispenses to its top-level executives in the form of compensation, condominiums, paid trips, and so on, while remaining completely opaque about where its money is going and refusing to provide aid to members in need unless they meet certain conditions and exhaust all other options. Furthermore, for decades members were discouraged from holding savings that they could give as tithes instead - my own parents have as much saved from 30 years of professional white-collar work as I do from 4 years in the military. <br>At the same time, I know that the collapse of the system will shunt the remaining untouched Mormon youth into the maw of the secular-liberal amoral world order. I left because I wanted to know the truth about God more than I wanted to remain in the comfortable Mormon community, but most who leave do so out of anger at the lies they&#039;ve been fed and so resolve to never enter another organized religion again. It&#039;s hard to blame them, and I expect that as membership rates and participation rates erode almost all who remain will do so as well. In the end only a few will be left - the general authorities, the hedge fund mangers, and a few true believers, alone among the ruins of their cult.", "time": 1673032278, "resto": 21485603}, {"no": 21488595, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)14:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate my sister.

That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he\u2019s not after the \u201cbig rock candy mountain,\u201d the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?<br><br>The answer\u2014and, in a sense, the tragedy of life\u2014is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It\u2019s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.<br><br>So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?<br><br>The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on \u201cthe meaning of man\u201d and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term \u201cgod only knows\u201d purely as an expression.) There\u2019s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I\u2019m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.<br><br>I\u2019m going to steer clear of the word \u201cexistentialism,\u201d but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre.12 These are merely suggestions. If you\u2019re genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you\u2019re doing, then give those books a wide berth.

As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.<br><br>But don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors\u2014but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires\u2014including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.<br><br>As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal) he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).<br><br>In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life\u2014the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.<br><br>Let\u2019s assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let\u2019s assume that you can\u2019t see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN\u2014and here is the essence of all I\u2019ve said-you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.<br><br>Naturally, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. You\u2019ve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn\u2019t any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do.

But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.<br><br>But you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know where to look; I don\u2019t know what to look for.\u201d And there\u2019s the crux.

In other words, you&#039;re overthinking a bit.", "time": 1673160503, "resto": 21490980}, {"no": 21496772, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)05:48:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21495632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495632</a><br>You&#039;re confused and thinking that Space time (really only space) is purely external and thus only of use for synthetic concepts, whereas it&#039;s pure and stands on an equal level to all possible cognitions. The question you&#039;re asking is basically transcendent: why is multiplicitous space in conformity with the categories (beyond the fact that we couldn&#039;t tell if it weren&#039;t beyond this)? This is not a question Kant can answer because he doesn&#039;t respect it: our <br>pure sensibility is attuned to the categories because it is. Attempting to draw a active causal relationship between the pure logical categories and our views of space time is how you get Heidegger. <br><br>You get number from space (and only space; I didn&#039;t make this clear) pure a priori because our pure sensibility is by divine fiat harmonised with our categories. This is important: our pure sensibility is created CONCURRENTLY to our pure categories: there is NO mutual interaction whereby one defines the other (I.E. categories &gt; sensibility). Now, there COULD&#039;VE been such an interaction (theoretically, not in the Kantian framework as made)\u2014this being Schopenhauer&#039;s view\u2014where the categories come first and inform our pure sensibility, but this would frustrate the way Kant specifically derives number. We would have the categories as a fixed object whilst our sensibility is constantly moving (like Bergson, in fact) whereas we&#039;d need to have our categories move alongside our sensibility ala Hegel/Heidegger to then produce correctly quantifying numbers. <br><br>To reiterate:pure space intuition is part of our internal cognitions naturally, even the analytic ones, as it&#039;s part of our pure sensibility, which can only exist SUPPOSING the external world to which it&#039;s reconciled in Kant&#039;s dialectic, but it isn&#039;t immediately necessary, and parts of it, number, can be used analytically, though only because those numbers WILL then conform to space conditions. A point I failed to make salient is that our time is imposed on the world, and is thus immanent, whilst space is &#039;external&#039;. If space were immanent like time then we wouldn&#039;t be able to think in &#039;pure&#039; mathematics because &#039;pure&#039; maths would necessarily be as spatial as geometry.", "time": 1673174892, "resto": 21490980}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21495325, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)20:40:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is this any good?<br><br>What can I learn with it?<br><br>It is featured in the movie Fallen (1998).", "filename": "the-secret-teachings-of-all-ages-20", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1802, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1673142052014800, "time": 1673142052, "md5": "D8O1d83974MgPp3OwBgaFA==", "fsize": 385509, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "is-this-any-good", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 2, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21495335, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)20:44:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21495325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495325</a><br>Read it and find out, nigger.", "time": 1673142299, "resto": 21495325}, {"no": 21495343, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)20:46:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21495335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21495335</a><br>First I need to know if it has value.

People will surely recommend that you read Dreyfus or watch his lectures, and he is popular for a reason - he is very good at making Heidegger understandable - but keep in mind that he is the father of the american pragmatist interpretation, and does not at all provide the whole story. <br><br>If you start with History of the Concept of Time, move on to Being and Time - I would recommend this thorough approach if you want to deeply understand him - the repetitions in the two works are slightly different, and hence, highly instructive. If you start with Being and Time, move onto The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, which moves on further from themes in Being and Time. Lastly, the Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, which mark the beginning of the infamous turn, Kehre.<br><br>This progression is necessary for deep understanding of him.

But they don&#039;t have the character of ultimacy. They can be metaphysically grounding from the perspective of beings subordinate to them and reliant on them, but if they aren&#039;t causa sui (cause of themselves), they don&#039;t stop the causal regress and explain reality. Likewise they can be extremely powerful but if they aren&#039;t all-creating it is basically meaningless.

To do that you need to posit something that transcends finite being in such a way that it itself is not even a being (because it is logically of the nature of being to be determined in some way), which is paradoxical from the perspective of discursive knowledge and, possibly, even of angelic knowledge. Hence God is in a sense paradoxical and miraculous, a mystery in the full and classical sense of the term, and can only be accessed through His miraculous (and discursively equally inexplicable) choice to reveal Himself, to intervene in history in the form of Christ, etc. The only way to describe such a being is through negative theology, which was established in the Christian tradition by Pseudo-Dionysius using Neoplatonic categories, but ultimately going back to Philo Iudaeus and the Alexandrian school&#039;s approach to reconciling the mysteries of scripture with reason. <br><br>Just like in Aquinas&#039; philosophy, ancient Greek reason basically burned itself out in its attempt at self-grounding, it had fizzled out in mutually contradictory but mutually overlapping and totally unsatisfying metaphysical schemes like the Stoics&#039;.", "time": 1673045072, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21489608, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)17:47:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489590</a><br>But <br>1.

From the premise &quot;everything has its cause&quot; we have two options regarding an an indefinite search &quot;up&quot; the chain of causes: an infinite regress or a form of cause that is not itself an effect (a causa sui, cause of itself), stopping the regress. The question why we should prefer one to the other is as old as Plato. If you want to read or listen to an intelligent conversation about it, listen to the Copleston vs. Russell radio debate, as they touch on it and are baffled by each other&#039;s positions. If you want a very difficult but comprehensive treatment of the subject, read Schopenhauer&#039;s Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason or Nicholas of Cusa&#039;s Learned Ignorance. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Why is a prime mover the God of the Bible and not just some rando?</span><br>A rando (i.e., a contingent being) that is not God would re-open the question as to the source of its own contingency, determinacy, and finitude - of its cause. <br><br>A rando that is God would still have to satisfy certain logical criteria, first and foremost ultimacy. Because Aquinas is in the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, both of which take the highest goodness to be a self-evident quality of the highest being (the most actual, most real thing is also the best thing), partly as a means of explaining why things change and attain structure at all (because it is &quot;better&quot; to have structure and tend toward &quot;perfection&quot;), needs God to satisfy the logical criterion of being the highest good, basically Plato&#039;s True, Good, and Beautiful. If you deny the ontological reality of good (and thus of the better being higher than the worse), you are burdened with explaining why a cold indifferent highest principle would do anything at all, why chaos doesn&#039;t reign instead of order, etc. A purely material first principle is just as paradoxical as a miraculously and transcendently good first principle, if not more. <br><br>If you&#039;re asking why Aquinas thinks we should believe in the Christian God of the Christian scriptures in particular, that doesn&#039;t come from rational deductions but from faith (pistis), which itself can be rationally justified as a necessary aspect of the fully actualized human being in Aquinas&#039; view. But ultimately only the act of faith itself can reveal the supra-rational truth of Christian scripture. Ultimately Aquinas can&#039;t do much to convince a committed Muslim or Jew that Christianity is the right one and not his.

Logic can at least establish the limits of what is thinkable tautologically: If we assume that reality is not an infinite regress, but must have an ultimate stopping point, then the one thing we DO know about whatever being is at the end of the chain is that it is at the end of the chain. We can make similar deductions about any contingent being: If we establish that all contingency is &quot;creaturely,&quot; then by definition any contingent being (a giant or a simulation for example) must be creaturely. <br><br>The few things we can say about God logically are that he must be there to terminate the regress (if this premise is accepted, and most people do accept it to some degree or another), and that his being must be of a kind that is beyond the being to which we are accustomed, since the being to which we are accustomed is caused, determined being, and we are looking for an entity that could explain all of it, not just another example of it. <br><br>Of course you could say this is all just our &quot;local&quot; logic, and higher realities could have different logics. This is basically the Kantian position, namely, that one can&#039;t attribute the concepts in one&#039;s mind to reality itself, or see them as reflections or microcosmic versions of reality&#039;s or God&#039;s own reasoning, like the medieval scholastics and the Cartesians (including Spinoza and Leibniz) did. But this opens up a whole host of paradoxes too, and eventually dissolves into complete solipsism if pushed far enough. That&#039;s why Kant&#039;s successors tried to find a way to argue from certain principles (like that our reason, being part of reality, must in some way reflect and participate in reality) to break out of the soap bubble Kant trapped us in, and back out into some kind of metaphysical realism.

It took the genius of Aquinas to argue that Aristotle\u2019s God is implicitly a God of providence and love. Aquinas reasons that God is self-subsisting existence, ipse esse subsistens. From this he deduces other properties which must belong to God. Aquinas notes that ipse esse subsistens, and actus purus and prime mover are metaphysical names of God and are applicable to one and the same substance. Thomas proves the infinitude and perfection of God from the notion of self-subsistence. God\u2019s eternity is proved from the same notion and also by way of immutability, which is proved by God\u2019s being simple, infinite, and actus purus, pure actuality: there can be no change or movement in God since there are no unactualized potentialities in him.

You&#039;ve actually touched upon one of the more interesting consequences of Aristotelian philosophy, in particular the interrelation of potency and act (even though, as I said, you have the relationship around the wrong way). I have two recommendations on exactly this topic, because I find it very interesting myself. The first, for a basic rundown of why what you&#039;ve said is not quite correct, is Edward Feser&#039;s &quot;Scholastic Metaphysics&quot;, and the specific chapter/section on the Potency/Act distinction. The second is Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non&#039;s book &quot;Reign of Quantity&quot;, in the chapter titled, &quot;Materia Signata Quantitate&quot;, which further elaborates upon this exact distinction in a more profound manner (alternatively you could go straight to Aquinas in his own writings on the nature of matter, unfortunately it is a harder read).<br><br>To give a brief rundown myself, what this means is that &quot;matter&quot;, and more generally &quot;potency&quot; (as matter is a specific kind of restriction and therefore a species of potency, which Aquinas defines as a limitation through quantity*), is the specific limiting condition of any act. Act, which is in this context is used interchangeably with &quot;form&quot; (or &quot;substantial form&quot;), taken by itself is actually infinite and unlimited, and is only limited by its being embodied either in matter, or more generally in any kind of potentiality or potency. The stock example here is the perfect circle, which in its essence is both Infinite and One, and is only ever limited, by potency, when it takes on a material instantiation, whether that instantiation is only imaginary (when we imagine or visualize a circle) or when we see one created elsewhere. The conclusion from this example is that any form or act is limited by the matter which it is conceived in. Hence why it is said that God is &quot;actus purus&quot; (Pure Act), and is devoid of any potentiality or potency (except for active potencies, which are quite different to passive potencies, which are what was referred to earlier). In any case, to say that &quot;God has no form&quot; is halfway erroneous at the very least; at the very least it depends on what sense you&#039;re giving to the term &quot;form.&quot; God obviously has no spatial shape, or anything similarly gross.<br><br>*Therefore Aquinas&#039;s Materia Secunda, the matter of our world, is of the essence of quantitative number in discrete mode. Gu\u00e9non goes on to make the point that continuous quantity (eg in geometric representation) is more fully act than the former.", "time": 1673108581, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21492810, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)11:25:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489768</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Bibble is true because...I-I-IT JUST IS OK?!?!</span><br><br>lol its always this", "time": 1673108736, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21492820, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)11:27:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21490075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21490075</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The proof is supposed to be in faith, which...[only happens if you trick yourself into it]</span><br><br>lmao", "time": 1673108849, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21492823, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)11:28:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21490075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21490075</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have convinced myself into playing make believe because the alternative is heckin&#039; reddit</span><br><br>Very impressive", "time": 1673108916, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21492831, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)11:30:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21490157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21490157</a><br>Ontological assumptions are not created equally.

Aristotle explains in these texts why it can&#039;t be &quot;because of their forms&quot; (the example of the bronze statue of Hermes vs Hermes himself; the statue can be created, damaged, and destroyed, but Hermes cannot, ergo it&#039;s the matter, not the form). <br><br>Aristotle&#039;s position on universals and particulars is like, Aristotle 101.

In Aristotle&#039;s scheme, this means it is without matter because only matter possesses, or is, substratum (which is why all of the other elements, like fire and water, can convert between each other according to Aristotle when they dissolve into less substantial forms; because they are composites of form, eg fire, and matter, which has no specific properties, unless it is proximate matter). This ties into a broader point which was made by Aquinas and not Aristotle, that matter&#039;s &quot;defining feature&quot;, if it must be said to have one, is signata quantitate, or principium individuationis. It individuates material substances which have the same substantial form, which is its only significance, hence why in the Books Delta and Zeta of Metaphysics, Aristotle himself rightly points out that matter is the least substantial of all kinds of being, even though it is still relevant to our kind of existence and so not wholly unimportant.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Right, and this just proves my point.</span><br>Which is what, exactly?

In a letter to the publisher she wrote:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Practically every character in The Bell Jar represents someone\u2014often in caricature\u2014whom Sylvia loved; each person had given freely of time, thought, affection, and, in one case, financial help during those agonizing six months of breakdown in 1953. . . .

There is no doubt that even the greatest musical geniuses have sometimes worked without inspiration. This guest does not always respond to the first invitation. We must always work, and a self-respecting artist must not fold his hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood. If we wait for the mood, without endeavouring to meet it half-way, we easily become indolent and apathetic.

Had I given way to my disinclination, undoubtedly I should have drifted into a long period of idleness.

I have learnt to master myself, and I am glad I have not followed in the steps of some of my Russian colleagues, who have no self-confidence and are so impatient that at the least difficulty they are ready to throw up the sponge.

Hermeneutics requires a hermeneutic understanding of the presuppositions and development of hermeneutics. <br><br>The best way to study is to wade in, pick a territory (like early modern political theory for instance), and master it. Then master an adjacent (either thematically or chronologically) territory, and reflect on how it has revised your perception of the first territory. Most likely you will feel that your initial understanding of the first territory was totally insufficient and blinkered, that you were seeing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions, and only now that you have mastered the aforementioned adjacent terrain can you really understand it properly. But mastery of the adjacent terrain was only possible by first &quot;succeeding at failing&quot; to master the initial terrain. The real noodle-scratcher comes when you realize that this process is presumably indefinite, and that a third or n+1 terrain will dialectically revise your conceptions of all the preceding terrains, and vice versa.

You have settings and compactness. Good thing bookshelves exist I guess. How often are you reading 150 books at a time? You can leave the car in the hat at home while you read if you give a mouse a cookie (example books are at your reading level). Settings? I didn&#039;t know I needed settings to look at glyphs on a page. Any decent printing of a book is carefully typeset and edited. Your kobo uses software to justify the margins and makes words spread apart when it detects a bad line. Your backlight seems impressive until you remember that lamps exist. So what are we left with? Your claim that the &quot;only&quot; thing genuine books have going for them is that they have an emotional appeal. If you aren&#039;t a sociopath (I assume you aren&#039;t cause you&#039;re retarded and most sociopaths are smart or can at least hide their lack of intellectual ability) then emotions are a huge factor in your decisions. If you didn&#039;t get lonely every night you wouldn&#039;t be coming to TikTok minors doing meme dances at 7pm instead of having dinner with friends and family like an adult. Emotions have a strong domain over ours lives, and the fact that I can touch and see and smell my books, that I can watch them change as I read and reread the , brings me immense comfort, as it does any ardent reader. And most physical book collectors augment their libraries with ebooks for when a text is hard to get for one reason or another, so your minor consoomer pros are felt by real readers anyway. I have multiple editions of some of my books and an e-book and I use my computer for books and my phone for books, but I&#039;ll never make the claim that e-books are superior to physical books because they simply aren&#039;t.

It&#039;s about self-respect, discipline, and, ultimately, success and personal fulfilment.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First and foremost, washing your genitals sends a message to yourself and to others that you value yourself and your health. A man who takes care of his body is a man who is confident, self-assured, and capable. This confidence will radiate outwards, attracting success and opportunity in all areas of your life.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But it&#039;s not just about impressing others. Proper genital hygiene can also improve your sexual health and relationships. No one wants to be intimate with a partner who is unclean or has an unpleasant smell. Showing respect for your partner&#039;s body by taking care of your own sends a powerful message and can lead to deeper intimacy and connection.</span><br><br>And let&#039;s not forget the importance of discipline. Washing your genitalia may seem like a small and insignificant task, but it is a daily practice that requires discipline and commitment. This discipline will spill over into other areas of your life, helping you to become more organized, focused, and productive.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a clinical psychologist, one of the things I learned is that many of our deepest beliefs and values are rooted in ancient stories and myths. And when it comes to the importance of genital hygiene, the Bible offers a powerful analogy.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the book of Leviticus, it is written that a man who has an emission of semen must wash his entire body with water, and he will be unclean until evening. This may seem like an arbitrary rule, but it serves as a reminder that the most intimate and sacred parts of our bodies deserve care and attention.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just as the Israelites were called to be a holy people, set apart and consecrated to God, so too are we called to be holy in all aspects of our lives - including the care of our bodies. When we neglect to wash our genitalia, we are neglecting a sacred aspect of ourselves and failing to live up to our full potential as men.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So the next time you step into the shower, don&#039;t just give your armpits and chest a cursory rinse. Take the time to give your male anatomy the attention it deserves. It may seem like a small act, but it is a powerful step towards living a life of integrity, self-respect, and personal fulfilment.

And when it comes to the importance of genital hygiene, we can look to the natural world for guidance.<br><br>You see, in the animal kingdom, there are certain behaviours that are essential for survival and reproduction. Take lobsters, for example. When a male lobster wants to attract a female, he must first engage in a ritual of self-cleansing. He washes his genital area, displaying to the female that he is a strong and capable mate.<br><br>Now, I know what you&#039;re thinking - what do bloody lobsters have to do with human males? But bear with me. Just like the male lobster, a man who takes care of his body, who shows respect for himself and his health, is a man who exudes confidence and self-assurance. This confidence is contagious, drawing success and opportunity to him like a magnet.<br><br>But the benefits of genital hygiene extend far beyond just external appearances. It is also crucial for maintaining sexual health and improving relationships. No one wants to be intimate with a partner who is unclean or emits an unpleasant odor. Showing respect for your partner&#039;s body by taking care of your own sends a powerful message and can lead to deeper intimacy and connection.<br><br>So, my fellow men, I implore you: do not neglect this essential aspect of self-care. Take a page from the lobster&#039;s book and engage in a daily ritual of self-cleansing. It may seem like a small task, but it is one that will pay dividends in all areas of your life. Remember, a man who takes care of his body is a man who is truly living up to his full potential.
