In the novel the characters are constantly running away from something, they feel like they are being chased by the great dictation. In the novel the characters are not especially oppressed however they are unhappy with the world they live in.

To Mishima, death made the greatest virtues possible. Death proves the sincerity of one&#039;s beliefs and actions and lends meaning to life. Is it really better to live for the sake of living? To chase after pleasures for 80 years and die a drooling retard in a hospice? You will die no matter what. If you live your life chasing after wealth and pleasure, you will lose everything regardless- you will even lose your death. What a meaningless death: bedridden, demented, and bespeckled with fetid sores and shit filled diapers. To the man that charges head first into death, he will gain exactly what he wished for: Death. His life and death becomes a poem crystallized into the annals of time; whether he is remembered or forgotten, his death remains eternal.<br>Mishima had a burning desire to help his people throw off the shackles of materialist nihilism, and he died to prove the sincerity of the words he had written and spoken his entire life. He did not commit suicide, he demonstrated his concept of unflinching loyalty and dedication, succinctly explain in Runaway Horses:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cLike the men of the League, I would cut open my stomach.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIndeed?\u201d The martial prince\u2019s expression indicated that he had grown used to hearing such answers. \u201cWell, then, if he was pleased, what would you do?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isao replied without the least hesitation: \u201cIn that case, too, I would cut open my stomach at once.\u201d </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cOh?\u201d For the first time a gleam of interest flashed from the Prince\u2019s eye. \u201cAnd what would be the meaning of that?

It refers to loyalty. Suppose I make steaming rice balls with rice so hot it burns my hands. My sole purpose is to present them to His Majesty, to offer them in his sacred presence. Now as to the outcome. If his Majesty is not hungry, he will curtly refuse my offering or perhaps he may even be pleased to say: \u2018Am I to eat food so tasteless?\u2019 and hurl it into my face. In which case I will have to withdraw, the grains of rice still clinging to my face, and gratefully cut open my stomach at once. Then, again, if His Majesty is hungry and is pleased to eat the rice balls with satisfaction, there will still be no course of action open to me but to withdraw at once and gratefully cut open my stomach. Why? To make rice balls to serve as food for His Sacred Majesty with hands so common is a sin worthy to be punished with a thousand deaths. But, then, suppose I were to make rice balls as an offering but keep them in my hands and not present them, what would happen then? After a while the rice would certainly rot. This, too, would be an act of loyalty, I suppose, but I would call it a loyalty without courage. Courageous loyalty belongs to the man who, with no fear of death, dares to present the rice balls that he has thus made with single-minded devotion.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhile knowing he\u2019s sinning? Is that what he\u2019s to do?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYes, Your Highness. The gentlemen of the military, Your Highness foremost among them, are indeed fortunate. For the soldier\u2019s loyalty rests in casting away his life in obedience to the Emperor\u2019s commands. But in the case of an ordinary civilian, he must be prepared to sin by reason of his unsanctioned loyalty.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201c\u2018Obey the law\u2019\u2014isn\u2019t that a command of His Majesty?

And the greatest sin is that of a man who, finding himself in a world where the sacred light of His Majesty is obscured, nevertheless determines to go on living without doing anything about it. The only way to purge this grave sin is to make a fiery offering with one\u2019s own hands, even if that itself is a sin, to express one\u2019s loyalty in action, and then to commit seppuku immediately. With death, all is purified. But as long as a man goes on living, he can\u2019t move either right or left, or take any action whatever, without sinning.\u201d</span>", "filename": "mishima", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1800, "h": 2266, "tn_w": 99, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673785791826623, "time": 1673785791, "md5": "5698dme4JBqypPEPu1Z68w==", "fsize": 649129, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21528720, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)07:30:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528634</a><br>I genuinely wonder how the Emperor must have felt when Mishima pulled his stunt.

He argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident (\u4e8c\u30fb\u4e8c\u516d\u4e8b\u4ef6, Ni-Ni-Roku Jiken) and the Japanese Special Attack Units (\u7279\u653b\u968a, Tokk\u014dtai) had died for their &quot;living god&quot; Emperor, and that Hirohito&#039;s renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain.

The life and death of this world about us took its<br>origin from the Ukei of the gods Izanagi and Izanami.

And according to this Isao is redeemed, whether Mishima personally considers it &quot;true&quot; or not is completely besides the point, Isao taking a stand and unflinchingly doing what he knows is right as a warrior of the spirit &quot;vindicates&quot; him in the sense that it puts him above everyone else in the nationalist clique and proves that he loyal to the true Japanese spirit until the end, in fact his final act is the only thing that could accomplish that as staying alive would be tantamount to accepting his fathers ways (or anyone else involved with the patriots for that matter). With all this in mind his heart being in the right place makes him a tragic hero, too pure to live on in shame. In this line of thinking Kurahara is still the most significant target as per his transgression against the spirit of Japan.

There is no mention of his personal beliefs here. The reason it&#039;s not a triumphant ending is explained in the very next sentence: &quot;too far-removed from the poetry he envisioned.&quot; You assumed I was only referring to the tangible aspects of the suicide. This is indeed my fault, since I did focus on that in the previous post. I wanted to use the same term Isao does, but I should&#039;ve elaborated. <br>Isao&#039;s poetry is one of single-minded devotion to a god-like vision of the Emperor. The time and location of Isao&#039;s suicide are important, as they relate directly to his identification of the Emperor with the Sun (constant throughout the novel). In this sense, I think the fact that he commits his crime at night and dies in a cave is important symbolically: he&#039;s been forced to give up on the &quot;illusion&quot; he &quot;chased after&quot;. <br>This is a direct result of Isao&#039;s contact with corruption. The core of his poetry is the intent of his actions. Isao&#039;s devotion allows for &quot;sin&quot; (as he says in his conversation with Toin) and crime, because &quot;man cannot move right or left without sinning, anyway&quot; (in this sense, Isao doesn&#039;t consider himself pure at all). However, they must be motivated by dedication to the Emperor&#039;s Sun. As he explains to Toin, whether the Emperor himself takes his offering or not is irrelevant. No matter the result, he can commit seppuku gratefully: the offering could have never lived up to the Emperor&#039;s greatness, but it was whole-hearted. <br>The term &quot;quxotic&quot; is commonplace, so to say I borrowed the comparison from your post is somewhat conceited. Regardless, here I see the first parallel with Don Quixote. Isao&#039;s actions may seem outrageous to observers, but he&#039;s trying to conduct himself according to lofty ideals which demand absolute dedication, and which don&#039;t concern themselves with practicalities or the matter-of-fact workings of society (in his conversation with Sawa, Isao prides himself in not knowing how the Academy got funding). Naivety, in this sense, is seen as a proof of purity.", "time": 1673857575, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532754, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:01:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531659</a><br><a href=\"#p21532674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532674</a><br>The problem is that Don Quixote&#039;s actions do not, in fact, support the ideals he intends to defend. He constantly attacks innocents or otherwise puts them in danger. In the second part of the book, he starts to question himself, and dies after renouncing chivalrous literature.<br>Isao&#039;s case is similar. Throughout the novel, he doesn&#039;t conduct himself according to shinto: he twists shinto into agreeing with what he already intends to do. One example is that he decides the date for the attack personally, after receiving no sign from the gods in the ritual. More significantly, he discovers a conflict of interests: he has profited from Kurahara&#039;s money, and cannot murder him without going against his father. From this moment on, it is impossible for him to kill him in a pure manner. This is why he initially assigns someone else to do it, and why he gets angry at Sawa: he could not kill Kurahara while maintaining full dedication to the Emperor.<br>His mindset changes after being released from prison, though. If Isao had wanted to regain his dignity after being released from prison, he could&#039;ve committed seppuku immediately, like a samurai who&#039;s about to be captured in the battlefield. In this manner, he would have shown full dedication to his code of conduct, while avoiding to give an impure offering to the Emperor. However, he changes his initial plan and kills Kurahara personally. Considering everything that had happened before, this murder can not be taken as an impersonal and devoted offering to the emperor. Indeed, Kurahara is still, in his eyes, the embodiment of an illness in the Japanese spirit. However, Isao does not kill him to strike against this disease: it is a personal assassination, in which Isao directs his own feelings of anger and frustration against Iinuma, Makiko, and by extension the hypocrisy and cowardice of Japanese society, towards Kurahara. He emulates the League&#039;s actions but fails to carry with him any of the spiritual background. Hence, his seppuku does not redeem him, and the ending is not glorious.<br>This is not me personally disagreeing with Isao&#039;s philosophy: this is my interpretation of the events in the novel.", "time": 1673859699, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532824, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:30:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528828</a><br>Good post", "time": 1673861441, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532827, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:32:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528844</a><br>This is disturbingly true.", "time": 1673861573, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532837, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:38:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528912</a><br>Mishima transcended basedness", "time": 1673861938, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532843, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:42:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531224</a><br><a href=\"#p21530975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530975</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I assert that there is a difference between suicide and seppuku</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suicide and seppuku are different things</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u6b7b\u306c\u81ea\u6bba\u306e\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5</span>", "time": 1673862127, "resto": 21528634}, {"no": 21532855, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:48:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21528948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21528948</a><br>&lt;You deserves to be ridiculed.

His ontology is based on faith, he gives no convincing arguments as to why the thing in itself exists, but expects his work to btfo skepticism (a lot of the time he uses proof by intimidation to ward off skeptics).

It has brought home the conviction that the categories of understanding are finite in their range, and that any cognitive process confined within their pale falls short of the truth. But Kant had only a sight of half the truth. He explained the finite nature of the categories to mean that they were subjective only, valid only for our thought, from which the thing-in-itself was divided by an impassable gulf. In fact, however, it is not because they are subjective that the categories are finite: they are finite by their very nature, and it is on their own selves that it is requisite to exhibit their finitude. Kant however holds that what we think is false, because it is we who think it. A further deficiency in the system is that it gives only a historical description of thought, and a mere enumeration of the factors of consciousness. The enumeration is in the main correct: but not a word touches upon the necessity of what is thus empirically colligated. The observations made on the various stages of consciousness culminant in the summary statement that the content of all we are acquainted with is only an appearance. And as it is true at least that all finite thinking is concerned with appearances, so far the conclusion is justified.

Every serious author writing in English from 1600 onwards quotes it constantly (I don&#039;t mean once per book; I mean once per page). You have to read it, you have to read it all, and you have to read it A.S.A.P..

But trying to cherrypick what you &quot;need&quot; is a lot more trouble than it&#039;s worth. Just read it all. It will be obvious which bits are more important.

Secondly, lots of these &quot;quotations&quot; aren&#039;t obvious; they&#039;re subtle allusions which give the newer work more resonance.<br><br>Here&#039;s an example taken at random.

Every evil person in the world is trying to dehumanize you by getting you to eat bugs, estrogen patties, and filtered shit water\u2014 and they all hate God. Are you convinced that everything in the world is material? As in, are you an empiricist who believes that all knowledge originates from sense data? The typical \u2018follow the data\u2019 type? That breaks down under its own weight easily. There are clearly non-material things in existence: logic, mathematics, qualia, and others. If you\u2019re the type to say, \u201cmathematics is invented not discovered,\u201d you run into unique problems. If these non-physical things are merely invented by us to understand the physical reality, instances of concepts that cannot be contained within the mind would present a serious issue. A Mandelbrot set or any fractal pattern, for example, cannot be completely conceived of in the mind and yet they \u201cexist.\u201d This applies to any infinite. Our mind cannot contain an infinity under the empirical view. As it came up in another thread tonight, take a collection of objects- to keep it simple, 3 oranges. Examine all the atoms in these oranges and you won\u2019t find the property of their \u201cthree-ness\u201d contained there. We can say, there are enough atoms here for three oranges, but the actual quality of their being three there on that table is not contained in the atoms themselves. Again we might say, yes the three-ness is just a way our mind categorizes and makes sense of reality. Okay, but if all our minds were gone, if we were all killed, that three-ness wouldn\u2019t go away. This is where the \u201cmind of God\u201d comes into play.

All of that with Charles blessing and support. I interpret the way he writes about it as some kind of deal that has been made with the press - we will give you details about our lives and in return you report positively about Camilla so that she gets accepted into the family. Which is pretty fucked up, as Charles sacrificed his sons&#039; trust in order to get good PR about his new girlfriend. It has led to his sons distrusting their bodyguards, friends, family members, staff etc. It is implied that they have understood the media strategy of their father rather early but it might have been rather recently as well<br>In addition to that Henry regularly shows how the (yellow) press has created false stories continuously about all kinds of details about whom they met, what happened, who said what, etc. Well that confirmed by impression about the yellow press, that they tend to invent semi-&#039;harmless&#039; regularly so that they have something to depict. <br>He shows the separation process between his nuclear family and the royal family as a media campaign that has not happened the way the media depicts it at all, that they are not the bad selfish spoiled people the media makes them to be. The way he shows it is that the hate is unjustified and desu his way of argumentation is convincing. If you watch the (older) interviews of him he doesn&#039;t come of as someone who would create drama for no reasons, create big lies and be a piece of shit. Of course he shows Meghan Markle as someone human in the best lights but I doubt that she is such a perfect being, you can easily see the webms here where she interrupts him during a conversation etc. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if she was a rather narcissistic, difficult unpleasant, fake-friendly person and the he is very much the simp for her as I sadly know a very similar case in my own family...", "filename": "1629804440651", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673797927463400, "time": 1673797927, "md5": "PZ2F+gIM/z/A2ZinsfCvoQ==", "fsize": 132434, "resto": 21522239}, {"no": 21529380, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)11:09:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21523497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21523497</a><br>\u2014&gt; Historikerstreit", "time": 1673798975, "resto": 21522239}, {"no": 21529398, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)11:15:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529328</a><br>(cont.)<br>Nonetheless his argument that the media has created a campaign against Harry&amp;Megan based on lies, rumors and little information as the royal family has the habit of not commenting on these matters at all. However all of that with the support with his family, his &#039;granny&#039; ex-Queen Elizabeth, his father and to some degree with the support of his brother as well. It&#039;s not exactly clear what the problems of his family with Megan are and I do think that their reasons are somewhat valid. At the same according to Harry his whole family is behaving like double-faced backstabbing lying pieces of shit, valuing a good representation with the media above protecting the family. Even though he writes only well of Queen Elizabeth, the way she acts and and has the most power in the family it&#039;s obvious that she is as awful as the other parts of the family. Plus servants around the family/Queen have been playing their power games against him as well. <br>The one thing that has struck me was how good this media campaign against Harry and Megan was, how much almost everyone agreed on something were no proper first hand information was available at all. You can find it here in the thread that people are very convinced of their own opinions while not wanting to get more information about it, and I was like them as well until I have read the book: Harry is an idiot and Megan is a narcissistic bitch who has brainwashed him. I guess it&#039;s part of the resentment against the rich, noble, powerful etc. I can&#039;t remember a recent media campaign equally successful. Maybe Obama being a saint but that was 15 years ago.

If you read it and have a &quot;omg that&#039;s so me&quot; moment you need therapy. The book has zero character development from start to finish, Holden learns nothing and is still incapable of coping with the fact he&#039;s growing up, there is little justification for his distaste of the adult world and for a 16 year old, he acts like a 10 year old.

It took me until about page 200ish or so for me to really get a grip around the plot, the cast of characters and the fascinatingly complex web of social dynamics taking place between these aristocrats lives.

I find myself liking Prince Andrew the most right now but that&#039;s probably because he&#039;s the only character that&#039;s really been elaborated as of where I left off.

In the first place, peering up at the vastness of the blue sky while lying on the battlefield at Austerlitz changed my perspective on man&#039;s ambitions and vanities, the natural world, and the human soul, and in the second place, Kutuzov and Mack would have two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about their war plans.

He just got a top of the line troika and the best horses. A couple of those big English Hackneys that can do around 15 miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand roubles. He\u2019s got a lot of dough, now. He didn\u2019t use to. He used to be just a socially awkward, endearing, genuine guy, when he was home. He inherited this terrific fortune though, from his profligate father Count Bezukhov, in case you never heard of him. The worst part of that is now he&#039;s susceptible to social corruption due to his naievity. Before all that he and a group of friends tied a police officer to a live bear. It killed me.

The answer to this seems clearly to be yes. We joke by questioning children with, if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around does it make a sound? This is essentially the same question applied to a non-material thing (logic). Some (nominalists) will argue that the laws of logic will cease to exist, as they are constructed/contained in the mind. Well, we then run into the problem of things like pi or the Mandelbrot sets. These are \u201cinfinites\u201d that cannot be contained in our minds. Yes, we can simplify them to contain them to the best of our ability, but their \u2018real\u2019 or actual existence cannot be contained in the mind. This suggests that our mind is not the determinate factor for metaphysics. These things cannot depend upon our minds to exist because we cannot fully conceive of them in our minds to begin with. Yet, they exist. This should lead us to God, as we know that non-material concepts, by definition, are not contained in the atoms or the strings or the lowest common physical denominator. Get 3 apples on a table and the quality of their \u201cthree-ness\u201d is not contained in any of the physical properties. Remove our minds and the quality of three-ness still exists in the universe.

Measurement of temperature, for example, is &quot;objective given the parameters of temperature measurement&quot;.

Consider that austrian Fritzl guy who kept all his children in a little room so he could use them for sex: I think every single one of them would qualify for an autism diagnosis.

She must have had high T levels.</span><br>Sometimes women have male souls by accident. It used to be 5%, and even grew to 10% around the turn of the last century because of how vigorous Victorian and Edwardian society was. The weird post-puritanism of the English upper classes (prior to mass education and the lumpenproletarianization of England into a universal chav state) sublimated all sexual energies into neurotic hyperproductivity, similar to how the Greeks saw unrestrained sexuality as bestial and subhuman to such an extent that they would rather fuck each other and slave catamites than their own wives half the time, because they could only regard other oiled-up hyperproductive demigods as equals and full human beings and thus as &quot;partners.&quot; In England, and in Protestant Germany for similar reasons, living a sensuous existence was only conceivable for the anonymous lower classes who presumably needed to scurry between their tenements and their servant jobs each day, in the margins and behind the scenes of the meaningful lives of the upper classes. There was thus only one &quot;gender&quot; in high bourgeois society, something like male-adult-citizen-fully human-bourgeois-educated-restrained<wbr> to the point of uncomfortably tense. Anything else was just &quot;other,&quot; &quot;presumably in the background,&quot; incidental background character tier. Women were assumed to fall into this latter category because they are generally weak, childish, selfish and wasteful in a benign way, essentially incapable of restraining themselves to the degree necessary for manhood, citizenship, and personhood. Because this was simply the nature of things, high bourgeois society gave a high bourgeois education indifferently to anyone who wanted one. It assumed women who wanted them were inconsequential anomalies, like Aspasia, it reflexively treated viragoes as curiosities and novelties. <br><br>This created a very efficient procedure for turning women with male souls into honorary men. How it worked was, if you had a female soul in a female body, you were left to ferment in the common slime with the other women and lower classes as normal. But if you showed up at the door of malehood and requested to transcend the slime, the doorman wouldn&#039;t even look up at you, he would simply hand you all the accoutrements of masculinity, as he would for anybody, and tell you to knock yourself out. This was the only brief window in history in which feminism might have worked, because a lot of women actually did go off and knock themselves out, becoming men and returning. There were signs that the Aspasia virago freakshow &quot;ha ha my wife is actually quite the author in her own right and not just my ancilla isn&#039;t that just so modern what a brave new world&quot; category was bending and beginning to break and some Edwardians were really starting to think self-consciously wow women can be humans not just as exceptions but as a rule, crazy.", "time": 1673812500, "resto": 21528282}, {"no": 21530263, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)14:56:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21530257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530257</a><br>There were signs that this phenomenon could have advanced even more, maybe even proving the feminists right that women can become &quot;equal to men&quot; over time, basically the creation of a third, transitional, intermediate gender between masculine (active) and feminine (passive), with the ultimate aim of relegating traditional femininity (woman=anonymous sensuous frivolous child, Periclean Funeral Oration type, putting flowers in her hair and ideally spinning wool) to the merely potential or formless material pole of female self-actualization, so that what today we call simply feminine in general would be only the disgraceful, child-like state against which a woman must differentiate herself, analogous to a man being a coomer who plays video games all day and still lives with his mom. But just as this possibility appeared on the horizon, the high bourgeois modernism that created it imploded into mass demotic 20th century modernism, and where you once had male-woman occultists translating Bergson and forming bicycle clubs you now had Bloomsbury skanks and puellile jazz floozies sucking every drop of puerile male attention from parading themselves as &quot;liberated&quot; thots (synonymous with gyrating to jazz and having a reputation for being loose). As with everything else in merely demotic modernity, the high bourgeois excellence that created and sustained it was dissolved into a factory produced gruel supposed to be consumed by everybody at birth, now it wasn&#039;t that women were able to become men because excellence is available to everyone, it was that everybody is excellent, now it wasn&#039;t that one could free oneself from contingency including the contingency of gender itself by genderless promethean acts of self-liberation, it was that everyone was &quot;liberated&quot; because society was &quot;liberal.&quot; <br><br>This was like a bomb exploding in female consciousness, it dispersed all the energies that had so improbably been built up over centuries. Now a woman who would have inexorably become a neurotic citizen-scholar just as queerly sexless and hypertense as her Victorian male counterpart was inundated from childhood with suggestions that the proper path to her independence as a woman was to show her holes in the jazz club and whine to &quot;the government&quot; for &quot;more equal&quot; &quot;working conditions&quot; for average women, meaning undifferentiated anonymous women, as opposed to more possibilities for excellence for select women. Not only did this new demotic-dionysian worldview disperse all those improbable apollonian conditions of female masculinization, it was doubly dangerous because it gave a new impetus to traditionally ur-feminine instincts that had been gradually suppressed.", "time": 1673812562, "resto": 21528282}, {"no": 21530271, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)14:57:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21530263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21530263</a><br>The puritan chastity that had slowly formed the conditions of possibility for a secular equal opportunity masculinity was ruptured by a volcanic eruption of primeval femininity: near psychotic competition for male attention destroying all possibility of friendship with both men and other women, bacchic desire for total irresponsibility and frivolity, longing for a paradoxically infinitely powerful but infinitely indulgent father (&quot;The Government,&quot; &quot;the Patriarchy,&quot; &quot;the West&quot;=women&#039;s schizophrenically repressive-yet-permissive surrogate daddy figure who is to be shit-tested and endlessly dialectically probed for BOTH concessions and reactionary episodes of paternal discipline, primeval womanhood&#039;s version of Russian roulette). <br><br>From the Edwardian 10%, by the time of women&#039;s lib it was 0.1% of women who could escape the YAAAAS LIBERATE ME JAZZ, HEAR ME ROAR egregore. Among millennial women it was 0.01%. Among zoomers it has reached 0.0%, lower even than the Middle Ages and ancient Greece, certainly far lower than in ancient Rome and probably various oriental cultures. It&#039;s simply impossible to be a masculine woman anymore, because every possible escape trajectory from child-womanhood has been blocked off by traps that mimic real escape trajectories. Tomboy? There&#039;s a mimicry trap for that. Unease about being a mere sex object? Mimicry trap. Against all odds, manage to notice that men are falsely praising you with ulterior sexual motives FOR rejecting false male praise with ulterior sexual motives, and that a qualitative leap of total repudiation of male attention is necessary in order to be a truly free woman, and you may have to pull the Get Insanely Fat Like Dworkin But At Least It&#039;s Better Than The Male Gaze option lever? Not so fast, there&#039;s even a mimicry trap for Dworkins. There is no escape. Transplant Dworkin to 2023 and she will become a pseudo-Dworkin with an Instagram crypto-addicted to meta-meta-meta-sublimated male attention for being a Dworkin. Even if you ascend through ten standard deviations worth of mimicry traps that would have gotten all the women below you on the bell curve, there are infinitely more, and if there aren&#039;t, your act of transcendence will only allow your path to transcendence to be modeled and turned into a new trap by the system for any future You. The last women who achieved true no-handicap Victorian-tier personhood by dint of being sheer statistical anomalies were born in the &#039;40s and miraculously pulled off needle-threading 10-point landings out of the great hippie jazz thot trap redux of women&#039;s lib. Now they are all dead or dying. Do not try to find an Edwardian man-woman any longer.

Aristocracy is a position vis-\u00e0-vis culture (as well as vis-\u00e0-vis power), and the history of Camp taste is part of the history of snob taste. But since no authentic aristocrats in the old sense exist today to sponsor special tastes, who is the bearer of this taste? Answer: an improvised self-elected class, mainly homosexuals, who constitute themselves as aristocrats of taste.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;51. The peculiar relation between Camp taste and homosexuality has to be explained. While it&#039;s not true that Camp taste is homosexual taste, there is no doubt a peculiar affinity and overlap. Not all liberals are Jews, but Jews have shown a peculiar affinity for liberal and reformist causes. So, not all homosexuals have Camp taste. But homosexuals, by and large, constitute the vanguard -- and the most articulate audience -- of Camp. (The analogy is not frivolously chosen. Jews and homosexuals are the outstanding creative minorities in contemporary urban culture. Creative, that is, in the truest sense: they are creators of sensibilities. The two pioneering forces of modern sensibility are Jewish moral seriousness and homosexual aestheticism and irony.)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;52. The reason for the flourishing of the aristocratic posture among homosexuals also seems to parallel the Jewish case. For every sensibility is self-serving to the group that promotes it. Jewish liberalism is a gesture of self-legitimization. So is Camp taste, which definitely has something propagandistic about it. Needless to say, the propaganda operates in exactly the opposite direction. The Jews pinned their hopes for integrating into modern society on promoting the moral sense. Homosexuals have pinned their integration into society on promoting the aesthetic sense. Camp is a solvent of morality. It neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.</span>", "filename": "1649551030705", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 576, "h": 767, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673830406236841, "time": 1673830406, "md5": "XJq8LsHlGJ5mJsdxmcQT+A==", "fsize": 84718, "resto": 21525746}, {"no": 21532884, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)05:04:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21525746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21525746</a><br>Her book on photography, probably.

His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his 296 the fellowship of the ring close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lu\u00b4thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u00b4miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\u2019s kin, in Lo\u00b4rien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father\u2019s house.

Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide.

OF COURSE he was influenced by older myths/histories, if your entire goal is an attempt to mirror the real world in all or certain of its aspects (in order to then make a form of commentary about Reality), it only makes sense to draw upon the source, real-world myths/histories.<br><br>That being said, I like both for different reasons. Tolkien is much more poetic and elegant, and it&#039;s clear he&#039;s dealing with big themes. GRRM i think also deals with big themes (even many of the same themes as Tolkien) but does it in such a way that it feels more natural and down-to-earth, almost mundane and matter of fact and thus easier to not notice on the surface. The grittier side sure, a more zoomed in viewpoint that shows more of the &quot;flaws&quot; and imperfections of the world (thus making it more realistic and &quot;normal&quot;), while Tolkien&#039;s has more of a zoomed out view that is like looking on a beautiful painting from a distance (even a battlefield looks less brutal when viewed from a tall mountain)<br><br>GRRM calls the story Fire and Ice, to indicate the perennial theme of opposites, which could also be said of Tolkien though it&#039;s not as clearly stated. Valar vs Melkor, Rhllor vs Death/Ice King. (even if you reverse it, and say that GRRM was equating the Valar to Death/Ice King, it still shows that same theme is being discussed, just from different sides.)", "filename": "1608510884310", "ext": ".png", "w": 698, "h": 768, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673647250175199, "time": 1673647250, "md5": "A3NuUtpQ97+DX1gn2l7rOg==", "fsize": 1027391, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21521286, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)17:01:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21517395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21517395</a><br>gormenghast is better", "time": 1673647290, "resto": 21517395}, {"no": 21521299, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)17:04:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21521282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21521282</a><br>Martin took from history.

He&#039;s described his writing method as gardening rather than scaffolding, but he&#039;s ended up writing himself into too many corners because he didn&#039;t exactly plan out the whole series and wastes time rewriting because of it.

Consumerism and liberal-democracy were at their apex and growing their strength by the moment. Rampant materialism was pandemic, covering all four corners of the globe for the first time. The youth, even when radical and national, were communistically and materialistically inclined. All traditional organisations were in full collapse and counter-traditions like Theosophy were at their peak. Contact with authentic traditional centres around the world was rare, expensive, and arduous - Evola had access only to a small fragment of the traditional texts and exponents that we have today. It was a different time, and Evola&#039;s considerations in that passage, in addition to his pessimism, were correct when he wrote them.<br>Now things are different. There&#039;s plenty of traditional material and connections one can follow. The question once again boils down to this: do you have the character for this? The answer is as in Evola&#039;s time - the vast majority, as a matter of fact, do not. Do you want to have that character? Then work at it, and indeed, &quot;strengthen your character&quot;. <br>Evola described the highest spiritual ideal, and people who set their sights on it should have the honesty to admit its infinite difficulties and the courage to tackle these difficulties anyway, with the full intention of total victory - if they really have set their eyes on this highest ideal.<br>If you have conviction and desires, then have confidence also, and fight.

Reading literature in translation you can just about get away with because there are other elements at play beyond the language, but poetry is truly entirely about the sound, rhythm, and ambigutiy/precision of language, so you pretty much have to read it in a language you speak fully to appreciate it. All said, if you&#039;re a native english speaker, there&#039;s a lot of great stuff to choose from. I love the Romantics now, as previously suggested in this thread, but as someone who didn&#039;t really &quot;get&quot; poetry I do think there&#039;s a slight difficulty with starting with them as a gateway. There are a lot of modern poets whose poetry is very prosaic that are a lot of fun, including famous prose authors like Sherman Alexie and Charles Bukowski, the latter of whom I think is actually an awful prose writer but an oddly effective poet. If you like them, then maybe move on to more traditional and slightly more challenging modernist poets like TS Eliot and Pound, then work your back into the Victorians and the Romantics, then the sonnets like not just Shakespeare but also Petrarch etc (although I&#039;m contradicting myself by recommending him). Finally, end with the best English language poem ever written, Paradise Lost. <br><br>There&#039;s also weird cool shit happening with avant garde poetry to this day, like &quot;sound poetry&quot; or &quot;concrete poetry&quot;.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1673851220, "resto": 21525406}, {"no": 21532816, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)04:26:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21525406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21525406</a><br>The vast majority of fiction.

I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird!

Fuck me in your dressing gown (I hope you have that nice one) with nothing on under it, opening it suddenly and showing me your belly and thighs and back and pulling me on top of you on the kitchen table. Fuck me into you arseways, lying on your face on the bed, your hair flying loose naked but with a lovely scented pair of pink drawers opened shamelessly behind and half slipping down over your peeping bum. Fuck me if you can squatting in the closet, with your clothes up, grunting like a young sow doing her dung, and a big fat dirty snaking thing coming slowly out of your backside. Fuck me on the stairs in the dark, like a nursery-maid fucking her soldier, unbuttoning his trousers gently and slipping her hand into his fly and fiddling with his shirt and feeling it getting wet and then pulling it gently up and fiddling with his two bursting balls and at last pulling out boldly the mickey she loves to handle and frigging it for him softly, murmuring into his ear dirty words and dirty stories that other girls told her and dirty things she said, and all the time pissing her drawers with pleasure and letting off soft warm quiet little farts behind until her own girlish cockey is as stiff as his and suddenly sticking him up in her and riding him.<br><br>Basta!

While I was writing it your letter was lying in front of me and my eyes were fixed, as they are even now, on a certain word of it. There is something obscene and lecherous in the very look of the letters. The sound of it too is like the act itself, brief, brutal, irresistible and devilish.<br><br>Darling, do not be offended at what I wrote. You thank me for the beautiful name I gave you. Yes, dear, it is a nice name \u2018My beautiful wild flower of the hedges! My dark-blue, rain-drenched flower!\u2019. You see I am a little of the poet still. I am giving you a lovely book for a present too: and it is a poet\u2019s present for the woman he loves. But, side by side and inside this spiritual love I have for you there is also a wild beast-like craving for every inch of your body, for every secret and shameful part of it, for every odour and act of it. My love for you allows me to pray to the spirit of eternal beauty and tenderness mirrored in your eyes or to fling you down under me on that soft belly of yours and fuck you up behind, like a hog riding a sow, glorying in the open shame of your upturned dress and white girlish drawers and in the confusion of your flushed cheeks and tangled hair. It allows me to burst into tears of pity and love at some slight word, to tremble with love for you at the sounding of some chord or cadence of music or to lie heads and tails with you feeling your fingers fondling and tickling my ballocks or stuck up in me behind and your hot lips sucking off my cock while my head is wedged in between your fat thighs, my hands clutching the round cushions of your bum and my tongue licking ravenously up your rank red cunt. I have taught you almost to swoon at the hearing of my voice singing or murmuring to your soul the passion and sorrow and mystery of life and at the same time have taught you to make filthy signs to me with your lips and tongue, to provoke me by obscene touches and noises, and even to do in my presence the most shameful and filthy act of the body.

Perscors knelt down near the man and placed his hand on his brow. The giant closed his eyes, but said to Perscors : \u201cWhoareyou?\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cAwanderer from another cosmos.

I also used short fiction anthologies at this phase. I moved to 300 page pop science because of the similar traits, but it took more concentration.

He stopped posting because I humiliated him repeatedly during his Xenosystems days, simply by pulling at the seams of his idiotic thought process. As for Accelerationism, it is nonsense, because it is based on false premises:<br><br>1. That Capital and Intelligence (production) are somehow isomorphic. This is he kind of claim that&#039;s not right, but is not even wrong; no wonder then that Land makes appeals to gibberish production machines like Deleuze &amp; Guattari -- via &quot;deterritorialization&quot; -- to justify this inane equivalence.

That intelligence is some kind of attractor in, let&#039;s call it &quot;universal fitness space&quot; -- which is itself based on two sub-hypotheses:<br>2a. That intelligence is evolutionarily robust, as opposed to fragile i.e. it is a perennial winning strategy. This is an empirically disproven claim. The irony here is that one of Land&#039;s pet peeves during his Xenosystems &quot;era&quot; was dysgenics. The cognitive dissonance was too much I imagine, which is why I suspect he ended up &quot;devolving&quot; into a jelly-brained boomer in recent years.<br>2b.

This is, to say the least, highly speculative (granted, it is the least stupid of his assumptions).<br><br>Given these 2 assumptions, Land&#039;s point is then that Capital, once coming into being, can only continue existing and getting better and better at outcompeting any other thing, not limited to economic systems, but encompassing any system in the universe, including life itself.

You can see it in the moves the 1st presidency has made in attempting to reverse the trend: cutting meetings from 3 hours to 2 to make them more bearable, reducing the number of key personnel in wards to allow smaller wards to function, lowering the missionary age so that young adults will be locked into the community before they move out of their parents&#039; homes and quit attending meetings. The overall growth rate of the church, usually at least a single-digit percentage, hit around .7% during the coof and only recovered to around .85% afterwards. Convert baptisms are dishonestly counted to make them seem more common than they are in reality, units are reorganized so that growth in the form of new units can be claimed, participation rates (butts in pews) are estimated to sit at 30% globally. Temples are announced and built not according to statistical growth trends as in the past but at random or because their land value will rise. Even in Africa, the hottest area of growth for Christianity at large, the LDS church has a smaller growth rate than any other denomination.<br>The Mormons also don&#039;t help their members nearly as much as they claim - access to the Bishop&#039;s Storehouse is restricted to members in good standing who have exhausted other options.

So in<br>&#039;My Confession Recollections of a Rogue&#039; by Samuel Chamberlain, which is where much of the historical basis for Blood Meridian comes from, Chamberlain states that the judge has large hands and rapes and kills kids. McCarthy explicitly states that the judge has tiny hands in BM. He also says that the kid had large hands. I think he made those distinctions for a reason. At the end the kid fucks or tries to fuck a dwarf. You can read that as him liking children. When the kid walks into the jakes and the judge locks the door behind him, what I believe is that the kid gives into his dark side in there. I think they rape and murder the missing bear girl together. I believe the guy pissing outside of the jakes who warns the other man not to enter is the kid. He seems to know what went on inside and seems unfazed. Whatever happened in there was horrific to elicit the &quot;Good god almighty&quot; from the other man. We are talking about the most wicked city in Texas where murder was normal. I think he saw something truly horrible like a raped and murdered child. In the end the kid essentially became the judge. That&#039;s my theory.", "time": 1673856112, "resto": 21530811}, {"no": 21532666, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)03:22:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21532583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21532583</a><br>I just read the book and I&#039;m certain the Gnostic theory is just a bunch of nonsense.", "time": 1673857327, "resto": 21530811}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21529675, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)12:41:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Was it autism?", "filename": "eugene-onegin-a-novel-in-verse-pushkin-first-edition-nabokov-rare", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 600, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1673804463307867, "time": 1673804463, "md5": "2oZ4ii85rWXIqvIGxszIdQ==", "fsize": 56161, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "was-it-autism", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 12, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 21529746, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:00:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 es autismo?, dices, mientras clavas<br>en mi pupila tu pupila azul,<br>\u00a1Qu\u00e9 es autismo! \u00bfY t\u00fa me lo preguntas?<br>Autismo... eres t\u00fa.", "time": 1673805602, "resto": 21529675}, {"no": 21529768, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:05:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529746</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;May\u00fascula despu\u00e9s de una coma</span><br>get rekt troon", "time": 1673805948, "resto": 21529675}, {"no": 21529788, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)13:07:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529675</a><br>Shame we will only ever have the abridged version and never this 4 volume version which runs a few grand.", "time": 1673806073, "resto": 21529675}, {"no": 21530374, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)15:22:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529788</a><br>At least we have the pdfs!", "time": 1673814160, "resto": 21529675}, {"no": 21530437, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)15:34:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529746</a><br>\u00a1AY CARAMBA NO ES BUENO!

Start small, don&#039;t try and make a massive garden the first year, just do a small garden to learn what you are doing and figure out what varieties grow well in your area. Heirlooms and old hybrids tend to be more forgiving than modern hybrids which freak out if things are less than ideal and I find I always get better yields from heirlooms than modern hybrids because of this but if you have nice clear horizon and plan to install irrigation the modern hybrids could be worth exploring. Expand your garden after you find what grows well on your land. Don&#039;t put everything into a single variety of any given plant, a few varieties known to grow well plus something new.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what resources you have in Canada but in the US we have Agricultural Extension Services which are quite good at helping you find varieties which will grow well in your area, contacting one of them in the US (probably Minnesota or North Dakota) would be useful, University of Minnesota Duluth and University of Fargo/Moorehead both operate an extension service and deal with zone 3/4 folks a fair amount. They probably will not have an issue with your being a Canadian but you can just tell them you are looking to buy land around the boarder and are not yet sure which side you are going to end up on. Tell them your plans, ask them for advice, they will give it. Canada may have a similar program, and if you are not aware of it the US AG Service will most likely be able to point you in the right direction.<br><br>Learn to love root veggies, bulbs, tubers, squash, and beans, they are easy to grow in northern climates and keep well through the winters with little extra work. They will really make your life easier and are the northern gardeners best friend.

I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora\u2019s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.<br><br>You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whore\u2019s glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover\u2019s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling\u2019s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.<br><br>Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better.

Corey (Daniel Abraham &amp; Ty Franck)<br><br>This is the book where the divergence of the TV series became noticeable in major ways for me. One prevalent difference is that the tv series has considerably more drama between characters and organizations. The plot revolves about the differing reactions to a protomolecule artifact that teases far greater expanses will be explored in the future and hints at what happened in the deep past.<br><br>James Holden is the only reoccurring viewpoint character thus far. The other viewpoints are contained to their single book. By comparison the TV series introduced several of the characters much earlier and continued following them. I think that&#039;s the better approach. It may be more realistic that once a character fulfills their role in relation to main character they fade away from the narrative, but that doesn&#039;t make it the better choice. I didn&#039;t notice it as much in TV series, but for the viewpoint characters of the books, they&#039;re all obsessive and reckless bordering on being self-destructive. I have to wonder if there will be one who isn&#039;t. I&#039;m uncertain whether that&#039;s just my perspective.<br><br>For Holden, if the first book is the exaltation, and the second the rebuke, then this is the humbling. He&#039;s no longer the Choosing One, he&#039;s now the Chosen One, that&#039;s how he sees it anyway and he detests that. The problem with being Chosen is that rather limits your personal freedom and what one can do with their life. That&#039;s not at all what Holden wants since he now thinks he&#039;s free to do anything. Holden tries to escape what he believes to be his destiny, but but he&#039;s forced to confront it, which makes its resolution all the more amusing to me.<br><br>Carlos c de Baca, &quot;Bull&quot;, the head of security for the Behemoth, isn&#039;t introduced into the tv series until what would be book 5. Bull is ok, but I like the tv version of Camina Drummer more, which is who fills most of his book role, though she hasn&#039;t been introduced in the books yet. I suppose it&#039;s because since so many characters are introduced so much earlier in the TV series that they have to displace the original roles to keep their storylines going.<br><br>Melba, and her quickly revealed actual identity, may be most baffling character in the both the book and tv series to me. It&#039;s not that I dislike the character so much as it baffles me by how often and with such intensity that she changes and how others react to that. I feel like she&#039;s more to make a thematic statement about what the series is about rather and then a fully developed character.<br><br>Annushka &quot;Anna&quot; Volvodov, a Methodist pastor, is better in the book. Too much was changed for the worse about her, especially the shift from outsider to insider status. She&#039;s also basically a different character as well.<br><br>Although this is worse than the previous books, it&#039;s not so much that I&#039;d only call it decent.

I know people meme and say he&#039;s &quot;literally me&quot; but holy shit I did not expect his struggles to be not only so relatable but so precisely and beautifully depicted. I feel like through Levin Tolstoy perfectly describes those deep human conflicts you mention. His relationship with his family and his friends, his relationship with Kitty, even his relationship with the muzhiks and the scene where they all mow the grass, it&#039;s all so human and real. And sure, the story slows down a little and has some boring parts where he talks about farming and agricultural theory but I honestly didn&#039;t mind too much since he felt so much like a real person that it was acceptable.

This is the most important thing, and I am willing to dismiss other downsides if this is aspect is done incredibly well. You could write the most perfect story ever from a plotting standpoint but if it doesn&#039;t have this human element than I will think of it as worse than another story that does have it, even if this story has a worse plot or no plot at all. Kafka&#039;s novels are unfinished and the plot-lines are incomplete but he manages to capture a human struggle more sharply than so many others which leads his work to have a stronger effect on people than a similar author who writes objectively better plots but lacks the human element. Same could be said for someone like Dostoevsky who is often criticized for his occasional clich\u00e9s. And this &quot;human element&quot; really is up to the reader to discover. It&#039;s different for everyone, and certain authors who provide it for someone may not provide it for someone else.

Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle quote the works of Homer as if they were both historical documents and spiritual containing wisdom on all sorts of topics including virtue, ethics, the nature of reality, and of &quot;the gods.&quot; Of course, by the classical period Greeks and Romans were as skeptical of the literal value of Homer as most secular Christians are of the Bible today, but that&#039;s what makes it the closest you can get to a genuine pagan text uncorrupted by external influences.<br>Neo-paganism is a shitty larp and all of the recommendations here are post-pagan reconstructions of paganism.", "time": 1673829945, "resto": 21530454}, {"no": 21531456, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)19:49:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Homer<br>Hesiod<br>Plato<br>Aristotle<br>The Eddas<br>There&#039;s a very, very, VERY large amount of Buddhist and Hindu works.", "time": 1673830162, "resto": 21530454}, {"no": 21531470, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)19:53:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21531456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531456</a><br>Didn&#039;t you see <a href=\"#p21531447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21531447</a>?
