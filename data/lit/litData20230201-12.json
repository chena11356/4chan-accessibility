Eros is unity/connection and Logos is multiplicity/discrimination; this binary works because all phenomena manifests as a unity which contains multiplicity. This can easily be demonstrated with the example of an inch: a unit of distance such as an inch exists as a span between zero and one, and within that span you can create infinite decimal subdivisions but you can never escape the fact that in order to have the phenomena even numerically there has to be a unity that contains multiplicity. This is what Aristotle said about time and what Kant described when he said &quot;all bodies are extended&quot;. <br>When Logos/Eros is replaced with Order/Chaos the feminine category switches from connection to something that can only be compared to disconnection. Order by itself simply refers to discrimination but that creates a problem being that discrimination only creates a category when unity contains it, otherwise the discrimination functions as a solution to chaos (which is why Peterson said he believes the purpose of the left hemisphere is to prevent the right hemisphere from having to turn on, as he theorizes that the role of the right hemisphere is to detect anomaly which the left tries to integrate).

The Chinese are very much about taking things they think will work for them from other systems and dropping what they don&#039;t like.<br><br>What&#039;s important here is that Schmitt&#039;s work doesn&#039;t try to criticize an &quot;authoritarian&quot; system like what China has when discussing liberalism, as a lot of political theory writing about liberalism does. And the two most important concepts in Schmitt, the concept of the political and the state of exception, are interesting to them. But I don&#039;t see those things as inherently &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; as others ITT have said. In the West, it&#039;s often the right which has been interested in Schmitt, because you have to ask yourself who in the 70s/80s was interested in looking into the works of a guy who was in the Nazi Party, and they tended to be weird conservative types.

I actually don&#039;t think the Chinese government disapproves of gay people (they&#039;re not Christians) but they don&#039;t promote it either. Their tradition comes from the Third International communist movement and that&#039;s way more apparent in domestic programming which can often feel like the Soviet Union:<br><br>https://youtu.be/75FSf_Y5Uwo", "filename": "giphy (2)", "ext": ".gif", "w": 450, "h": 252, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1675236314326432, "time": 1675236314, "md5": "DTrmEWyo1tRdVKQTu6eoCw==", "fsize": 622055, "resto": 21586631}, {"no": 21599288, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)02:52:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598008</a><br><a href=\"#p21597747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597747</a><br>The only state that actually incorporates Schmitt is the state of Israel.

The Chronicles of Barsetshire are comfy books set in a cathedral town, covering the Church politics and rural aristocracy of the area.

I think this is of more interest to the modern reader, at least it was to me. This is also a series of six books, and I would recommend all six. The series starts with &#039;Can You Forgive Her?&#039;, which is among my favourite Trollope novels and would probably be my recommendation for a starting point. <br><br>I haven&#039;t read all the standalone novels, of which there are very many, but they vary quite considerably in quality. What you get out of them depends on your interest in the core themes. Trollope books almost invariably juxtapose two contrasting themes: Ralph the Heir is about bastardy and wasted privilege; Orley Farm is about inheritance and marriage; The Claverings is about jealousy and marriage; and so on. The standout for me among the standalones is &#039;The Way We Live Now&#039;, which is about the rapacity of international finance and the fecklessness and timidity of the British to let it overtake them.

Its form and execution mainly and which tradition of writing does it fit in. In the Novel form, Dostoevsky and Thomas Mann, who was influenced by Dosto, are obvious comparisons. But the form of the conversation is quite different from Dosto and Mann. It has been compared to Sunset Limited but again the form that the conversation takes in Sunset limited is also quite different, and more abjectly Dostoevskian.<br><br>McCarthy might have revived and replenished Socratic dialogues for fiction. Dr. Cohen can&#039;t follow Alicia and it is precisely because he can&#039;t follow her or offer anything in the way of intellectual simulation is what shapes the conversation in Stella Maris. The book is 190 pages of &#039;Dialogues with the self&#039;. The therapist just provides the frame for the conversation to begin but as it progresses and deep into the book, Alicia and her mind unravels. McCarthy is possibly nodding at the history of western literature, which began proper with greek plays and its most modern renditions have been dominated by the solipsistic internal monologue/stream of consciousness. Alicia is a solipsist herself, and the confessional turn her rambles take on later into the book as opposed to the more balanced beginning is possibly an allegory for the evolving form of literature. The kind of conversation that McCarthy has become known for is also much more flexible in integrating philosophy given its origins in philosophy.<br><br>Moreover, Alicia isn&#039;t perfectly reliable, as is visible after reading The Passenger. Her digressions on the nature of hallucinations have tones of metafiction, also in the fact that we are not meant to be omnipresent passive observers of the fictive dream, a frame used by most works of realism, but rather acknowledged listeners of the tapes of her therapy sessions. The reader has been, however marginally, included in the book.<br><br>I think Stella Maris is the next step in the evolution of confessional literature, pioneered by Dostoevsky and has included among its ranks writers like kafka, Celine, Miller, Beckett etc. Modern autofiction is also a strand from this same tradition.

But here the narrator&#039;s direct listener is sitting with her forcing her to modulate herself and her thoughts. The Narrator is caught between two worlds due to the length and form of the conversation. McCarthy&#039;s form rescues Alicia from her own solipsism momentarily by providing a laconic listener, a witness. Cohen can&#039;t change her mind or even begin to reason with her, but it at least allows Alicia to listen to her own self. The witness changes the nature of the event even as he witnesses it, which is probably the foundational outlook of the two sibling novels.<br><br>It is quite amazing what McCarthy has done even if the weirdities are only felt and are not easily recognizable.

She wept so much the day she dropped me of at the garrison and we wouldn&#039;t see each other for a few weeks. We had slept together every day for the past four months, so it was hard especially for her.<br><br>Two weeks passed with me going through all the basics. It was tiring, but every single evening I called her so we could talk and be together again. After those two weeks we had our first &quot;vacation&quot; which would last a few days.<br><br>The day before the vacation, during the free time we had in the evening, I went outside into the hot July air. I had a plan, you see. I was going to pick my girl pretty flowers that I had seen inside the garrison area. Then, when we would walk out of the gates where she was to be waiting for me, I would hand her my bouquet. She would love it. She deserved it. So, I gathered the prettiest flowers I could.<br><br>The next day dawned. Two weeks in the military and it was very needed to see the outside world already even if I didn&#039;t have a girl waiting for me anxiously. Before we were allowed to leave some officers were to inspect our rooms and personal closets so that everything looked nice and soldierly. I had hid my bouquet behind all the junk.<br><br>The room I was in passed the test on the first try. Soon we would all get to go outside and form into ranks so the commander of our unit could give us a little &quot;vacation speech&quot; as it is called. Then we would be allowed to march outside of the gates.<br><br>As we rushed outside, I held my bouquet of flowers in my hand. I went into the last row, hoping that some officer wouldn&#039;t question my odd equipment. No-one did. When the commander finished, we gave one final salute and then our formation was ordered to turn right. Suddendly I was in the front row, holding a bouquet of flowers!<br><br>We marched in an orderly fashion towards our freedom. As we got closer our discipline was allowed to break and soon we started running. I ran in the front, holding my flowers.<br><br>And there she was. Waiting for me in her blood red dress beyond the gates. Her auburn hair glowing in the bright July sun. My prize, my love. I ran past the checkpoint, threw my bag on the ground so I could hug her and we embraced each other. I gave her the flowers, and her reaction was as anticipated. I could have cried of happiness, but that&#039;s not soldierly.<br><br>At home she gave me a gift in return: a medallion with a picture of us inside. The best gift I ever had. Then she lifted her dress and showed the lingerie she was wearing, and you can imagine what happened next. We had not seen each other for two weeks, after all.<br><br>This all happened in another time and space. She left me yesterday. I came home from uni to a dark and empty apartment.

Most here definitely don&#039;t go the extra mile and it is work to do so I appreciate it. <br>And secondly I do see what you&#039;re saying. Your rewrites are noticeably easier to read and it makes it apparent I do have a problem with over doing it. Yet it does lead me to another line of questioning, if that&#039;s okay. <br>This story is first and foremost a horror story that tries to blur the line between cosmic horror and psychological horror as two sides of the same coin. Leading to some primary themes being about the brain and the mind and their role in the universe. And the character we&#039;re following here is a meta attempt to self insert the reader quite literally in their mind by the reader&#039;s mind being the character&#039;s mind (I really hope that makes sense, I tried to word it simply). Which is leads me to saying that I had intended for all the &quot;Bridges&quot; or bridging chapters to just sit in the mind of the character as typically a horror or significant even occurs. This is to bring to light another staple horror theme of isolation. It&#039;s why if you skim the last three paragraphs of that chapter, you&#039;ll see what it was building to and why it kind if was just &quot;someone looking at stuff&quot;.<br>So then do you think even with that being my goal in a chapter like this (typically around 2 chapters in every 8-10), its still unpleasant or adolescent (at best) to read at best? Even with editing to have more varied verb use and smoother structuring? Or do you think that isolation and self-insertion can still be captured while writing how you&#039;re saying so long as I put the time in to figure out how?<br><br>Sorry for the TLDR, but it&#039;s about as concise as I can ask it.", "time": 1675233210, "resto": 21593992}, {"no": 21599077, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)01:41:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598953</a><br>A lot of proper names.

Another fun Tarot book is Tomberg&#039;s Meditations on the Tarot, it&#039;s not really occult per se altho certainly esoteric but nevertheless it remains an excellent example of the continuing cross-pollination between occult and mainstream threads of theology and philosophy as well as the ongoing dialogue of occident and orient and esoteric and exoteric which will also become familiar to you if you follow this list.", "time": 1675168355, "resto": 21591763}, {"no": 21595780, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)07:48:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594332</a><br>Pagels is ok historical sources wise as a scholar but she is like a feminist new age sorta interpretation of gnosticism as must be required by zog machine", "time": 1675169333, "resto": 21591763}, {"no": 21595807, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)08:00:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21594332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21594332</a><br>Pagels is accessible and clear in her writing, but she&#039;s always got an axe to grind with the church, and it&#039;s very evident that she likes the gnostics for what she takes to be a liberal attitude bucking against the church hierarchy and their acceptance of women as leaders.

For you hear them crying aloud: &quot;Man did eat angels&#039; food.&quot; And finally God sent unto them Jesus also, but unto us no prophet, no oil of anointing, no teacher, no herald to announce his love for man which should one day, though late, reach even unto us also.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nay he even looked on for myriads, or if you prefer, for thousands of years, while men in extreme ignorance served idols, as you call them, from where the sun rises to where he sets, yes and from North to South, save only that little tribe which less than two thousand years before had settled in one part of Palestine. For if he is the God of all of us alike, and the creator of all, why did he neglect us? Wherefore it is natural to think that the God of the Hebrews was not the begetter of the whole universe with lordship over the whole, but rather, as I said before, that he is confined within limits, and that since his empire has bounds we must conceive of him as only one of the crowd of other gods.

And once the whole causal chain beginning with nescience is admitted to exist, and to be revolving continually like a wheel with buckets at a well, it is found to imply that the formation of aggregates must be possible. But this is not right, as the causes so far mentioned lead to production (of the next effect in the series) only (and not to aggregation of any kind). An aggregate could be admitted if an intelligible cause were assigned for it. But it is not. Nescience and the rest may cause one another mutually in your cycle, but they only cause the rise of the next link in the chain. There is nothing to show that anything could be the cause of an aggregate. True, you claimed that if nescience and the rest were admitted, an aggregate was necessarily implied.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To this, however, we reply as follows. If you mean that nescience and the rest cannot arise except in the presence of some aggregate and so are dependent on it, then you still have to explain what could be the cause of the aggregate. Now, we have already shown in the course of our criticism of the Vaisesikas that aggregation is unintelligible even when supported by such assumptions as that of the existence of eternal atoms along with eternal individual experiencers who serve as permanent loci for the conservation of the effects of past action. So it will be all the less intelligible in a theory in which only atoms of momentary existence are admitted, without any permanent experiencer or any permanent locus for anything. If the Buddhist now claims that it is this causal chain beginning with nescience that is the cause of aggregation, we ask how this causal chain (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) could ever be the cause of aggregation (of its constituents into a united whole that can produce nescience etc) when it (the chain) depends on (that) aggregation for its own existence?</span>", "filename": "1651079351425", "ext": ".png", "w": 833, "h": 670, "tn_w": 124, "tn_h": 100, "tim": 1675218353093226, "time": 1675218353, "md5": "WFADdFzIf00HffOzI9JrBw==", "fsize": 641561, "resto": 21597675}, {"no": 21598419, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:28:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21597694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597694</a><br>Shalom!", "time": 1675218500, "resto": 21597675}, {"no": 21598424, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:29:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21597779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597779</a><br>Bible authors are just especially dumb earthly authorities.", "time": 1675218573, "resto": 21597675}, {"no": 21598429, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)21:30:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598406</a><br>Buddhism and Christianity are quite similar.

In retrospect I don&#039;t think there was a better way to do it, although each has its limitations.<br><br>I think it works well for the themes of the book. The first book introduces a lot of mysterious elements which are experienced in personal ways, with the personality of the people who encounter them coloring the truth behind them, then the second slowly puts them all together into a bigger rational picture where the difference between science and the supernatural is almost meaningless. It follows the progression from mysticism/paganism towards monotheism, and that Simmons pulled it off without feeling dry or contrived was fucking incredible.", "time": 1675237558, "resto": 21595836}, {"no": 21599442, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:55:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21598361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21598361</a><br>It really isn&#039;t.

Like the teacher was trying to comfort him, maybe a little too touchy, but with no ulterior motives, and it played into Holden\u2019s disillusionment and how he colored the whole thing.

In Dick&#039;s book, the police chief, Felix Buckman, meets a black stranger at an all-night gas station, and uncharacteristically makes an emotional connection with him. After handing the stranger a drawing of a heart pierced by an arrow, Buckman flies away, but he quickly returns and hugs the stranger, and they strike up a friendly conversation. In Acts Chapter 8, the disciple Philip meets an Ethiopian eunuch (a black man) sitting in a chariot, to whom he explains a passage from the Book of Isaiah, and then converts him to Christianity.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dick further notes that eight years after writing the book, he himself uncharacteristically came to the aid of a black stranger who had run out of gas. After giving the man some money and then driving away, he returned to help the man reach a gas station. Dick was then struck by the similarity between this incident and that described in his book.</span><br><br>Taverner\u2019s dream scene was also inspired by his own dream. He also claims it prophetically, and unbeknownst to him at the time, prefigured the United States becoming a totalitarian police state.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dick also recounts an unusual dream he had when writing the book, and how he felt compelled to get it into the text of the novel.[7][8] Years later, he came to interpret this dream as the key to understanding the real meaning of the story, stating:</span><br><br>Deciphered, my novel tells a quite different story from the surface story (\u2026). The real story is simply this: the return of Christ, now king rather than suffering servant. Judge rather than victim of unfair judgment. Everything is reversed.

Things have become just too complex for the will of a single person to bend things towards his or her desired outcome--every major social or political action these days would have absolutely unpredictable and unintended consequences for example that might leave things 1000x worse than they already are. But there is still nobility in it to damn it all despite in consequences, like Hamlet said to &#039;take arms against a sea of troubles&#039;.

As to your question, you&#039;re exhibiting a fatalistic mindset.

People with the former tend towards fatalistic thinking and I speculate are higher neuroticism than the latter. <br><br>Let&#039;s roll the dice however. As you are (being) fatalistic, I&#039;ll say this whatever you do and wherever you are sorted will be sorted out after you have done it.

First, Saturn is the dimmest planet in the sky. It carries connotations of weakness, endings, the expending of strength and finality. Second, Saturn is traditionally the most external planet - if Earth is the centre, and all the other planets form concentric circles around this circle, Saturn is the final circle, the edge of the cosmos. It marks the outer limit and the end of life and light, both celestial and human. Further, as a symbol of the outer limit, it is also a symbol of time and death, hence why Saturn was also known as Kronos or the star of Kronos. Everything exists and lives on its appropriate plane, and carries on its journey, until the very end, at which point Saturn collects what is due and dispenses death - the meaning of the life is therefore forced to be constrained within a beginning and an end, giving mortal beings a kind of imperative to attend to our tasks, needs and duties - this is why Saturn is the lord of organisation, control, discipline, mastery and authority, in addition to being a lord of disaster, pain, suffering and death.<br><a href=\"#p21589629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589629</a><br>That&#039;s probably the Saturnine era conceived in cthonic terms, the cthonic demon Saturn rather than the celestial Saturn.", "time": 1675042875, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589721, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:43:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the greeks and romans are not western btw", "time": 1675042997, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589728, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21585665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21585665</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I always assumed that this was merely some commonplace reactionary diatribe,</span><br>Spengler was part Jewish friend.", "time": 1675043077, "resto": 21585665}, {"no": 21589758, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)20:51:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21589608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21589608</a><br>Who said this 2000 years ago?

So i would say there are some humans that have wolf-like temperaments (Algernon Herbert talks about Nimrod and how he made a religion of this wolf temperament). But they&#039;re the minority.

Maybe that&#039;s the best we can hope for, though they never last because INEVITABLY the elite faction wants more (it&#039;s in their nature). Maybe it&#039;s because they have more kids, and then their kids have more kids, etc etc, so that in order to maintain their lavish lifestyles they&#039;re &quot;forced&quot; (though really, it&#039;s a choice) to squeeze the peasants more, eventually collapsing the balance and peasants are back to being cattle. <br><br>The Dionysian types, per Algernon Herbert, did often fight back, but often times would lose to being outnumbered.

The man needs an editor. <br>His realistic characters also all draw on the 5x5 stomping ground he\u2019s created as a reflection of himself and his surroundings.

It\u2019s just that your defense of him as some kind of master is stupid. He spins a good yarn and that\u2019s clearly good enough to be a publishing powerhouse. I think the archetype for a successful writer of this type is Charles Dickens. He is seen as an elevated author these days but really published stories toward the mainstream and about topics he knew (grew up alone and poor for some time) or felt strongly about (social issues, hypocrisy, charity). <br><br>There are also more authors in this vein. Elmore Leonard had the nickname \u201cthe Dickens of Detroit\u201d for instance. Personally I prefer his writing style and humor. Where King writes volumes he writes a taut yarn. Instead of schmaltzy nostalgia you get acerbic wit. The best King\u2019s written imo are the short stories and novellas where his worst excesses are reined in. <br>Thank you for reading my blog.", "filename": "4E5CA4B2-AC19-437F-BEB0-36B2300F26FC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 640, "h": 480, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1675196254039678, "time": 1675196254, "md5": "v29V9FUnFgxzYgE7Edw8hA==", "fsize": 74685, "resto": 21594692}, {"no": 21597446, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)17:09:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21597070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21597070</a><br>well, i read it at least.", "time": 1675202990, "resto": 21594692}, {"no": 21597847, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)18:54:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596179</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;</span><br>literally 6th grade tier fallacy. kys", "time": 1675209294, "resto": 21594692}, {"no": 21597962, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)19:25:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21595490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21595490</a><br>Noir is the most difficult genre, Objectively speaking", "time": 1675211126, "resto": 21594692}, {"no": 21598030, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)19:39:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21595632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21595632</a><br>Holy midwit.

Hence what is as such and immediately thought abstractly was to be identical with that which objectively exists in itself; accordingly logic was to be at the same time the true metaphysics. Therefore we only needed to think, or let concepts rule, in order to know how the world outside is absolutely constituted. Accordingly, everything haunting a skull would at once be true and real. Moreover, since the motto of the philosophasters of this period was \u2018the crazier, the better\u2019, this absurdity was supported by a second one, that it is not we who are thinking, but that the concepts, alone and without our help, perform the process of thinking, which was therefore called the dialectical self-movement of the concept and was supposed to be a revelation of all things within and outside of nature. However, this caricature was really based on another one that also depended on a misuse of words and is, even if it was never clearly stated, without doubt behind it. Following the precedent of Spinoza, Schelling had bestowed the title of God on the world. Hegel took this literally. Since the word properly means a personal being that, among other qualities completely incompatible with the world, also possesses that of omniscience, he transferred this quality as well onto the world, where it could find no place other than beneath the foolish brow of human beings, who now only had to give free play to their thoughts (dialectical self-movement) in order to reveal all mysteries of heaven and earth, namely in the absolute nonsense of Hegel\u2019s dialectic.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;observe the constructions that are built up out of abstractions like finite and infinite\u2014being, non-being, other being\u2014activity, hindrance, product\u2014determining, being determined, determinateness\u2014limit, limiting, being limited\u2014unity, plurality, multiplicity\u2014identity, diversity, indifference\u2014thinking, being, essence, &amp;c. ...because an infinite amount can be thought through such wide abstractions, only very little indeed can be thought in them; they are empty husks. But thus the matter of the whole philosophising becomes astonishingly trifling and paltry, and hence arises that unutterable and excruciating tediousness which is characteristic of all such writings. If indeed I now chose to call to mind the way in which Hegel and his companions have abused such wide and empty abstractions, I should have to fear that both the reader and I myself would be ill; for the most nauseous tediousness hangs over the empty word-juggling of this loathsome philophaster.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seriously believing that sentences like \u2018Nature is the idea in its otherness\u2019 actually say something.</span>", "filename": "schoppi_d8rw6__please_credit[palette.fm]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 476, "h": 525, "tn_w": 113, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675240012980645, "time": 1675240012, "md5": "6nQhytnFxyERCCcuoUnLmg==", "fsize": 60258, "resto": 21599112}, {"no": 21599365, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:28:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21599112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21599112</a><br>You know how you used to sort your LEGOs by size, and then by color, and then by shape, and then by EXACT shape, and then you&#039;d sort the minifigure pieces too?<br><br>Hes doing that but for everything.", "time": 1675240134, "resto": 21599112}, {"no": 21599382, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:34:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21599334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21599334</a><br>When will /lit/ find out that when you actually study philosophy, all you ever read is secondary texts?", "time": 1675240478, "resto": 21599112}, {"no": 21599402, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:43:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being - Pure Being - without any further determination</span>", "time": 1675241027, "resto": 21599112}, {"no": 21599405, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)03:45:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21599361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21599361</a><br>He was just mad that Hegel had<br>1.

Contrary to what is usually thought, it is the man of excellence, not the common man who lives in essential servitude. Life has no savour for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendent. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of serving as an oppression.

The privileges of nobility are not in their origin concessions or favours; on the contrary, they are conquests. And their maintenance supposes, in principle, that the privileged individual is capable of reconquering them, at any moment, if it were necessary, and if anyone were to dispute them. ...

In the concept of love, philosopher and artist had to part ways, and as a consequence, Wagner deepened and glorified this conception in his own fashion. In his diary of December 1st, 1858 we read: \u201cI have recently read slowly through friend Schopenhauer\u2019s major work again and this time he has extraordinarily stimulated me to amplification and\u2014in some particulars\u2014even to correction.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wagner had, in fact, without being aware of it, introduced in The Victors a Mahayanistic idea which in his days was scarcely known in Europe: namely, that the way to redemption must take, not a direct path, through perfect denial of sensual love, but rather an indirect path, first through the affirmation of sensual love, in order to arrive at the ultimate overcoming of it. This idea is essentially Mahayana and is found neither in Christianity nor in Hinayana Buddhism. Wagner had, so to speak, perceived through artistic intuition ideas which run parallel with Mahayanism. For that reason, I would like to quote further from the diary pages of December 1st: . and perhaps it had to be reserved for my very special disposition to gain insight here, which no other could conceive of in this very special time of my life. The point is to show the way to salvation, recognized by no philosopher, nor, for that matter, by Schopenhauer, which leads to the perfect appeasement of the will through love, and, to be sure, through no abstract humanitarian love, but one emerging from the depth of sexual love, i.e., from the attraction between man and woman.\u201d</span><br><br>If The Victors expresses a general Mahayana view, Tristan is full-blown Vajrayana. Only in his late Christian period did the extremes which bear the resemblance to Vajrayana cool down, and he subscribe to a practical ideal much closer to Theravada.

On a first, more superficial (and thus probably wrong) analysis, Wagner&#039;s aesthetic would seems to exacly oppose a would-be Platonic one. Wagner first articulates a dialectic between form and content, phenomenon and noumenon, light and sound, expression and feeling; then he places the primacy on the content, subordinating form to it; Beethoven&#039;s c-sharp minor quartet starts inwards, from the noumena, pours out into form as a means to communicate that inner vision (hearing?) to the audience; and so does the Tristan, etc., whereas a would-be Platonic view would put form first, and relegate the content to the inferior realm of the sensible, contingent and temporal. But this would be incorrect in at least two ways, first and most important of which is this, there is an equivocation of terms here. Form for Wagner means the phenomenal, the temporal, etc.; the exact opposite is true for Plato: form means the intelligible, the atemporal, etc.; secondly, in Plato&#039;s actual writtings about music he never deals with &quot;form&quot; as understood by modern music theory (that is, compositional structure), but with &quot;ethical&quot; side of music, namely how music moves the soul, the effects that it has on the soul.

It is conclusive, that I am able to use for this (as philosopher, not as poet, since as such I have my own) the terminology which Sch. himself supplies me. The exposition leads very deep and far, for it embraces a preciser explanation of the state in which we become able to apprehend Ideas, as also of that of Genius (Genialitaf), which I no longer conceive as a state of disengagement of the intellect from the will, but rather as an enhancement of the intellect of the individual to a cognitive organ of the race itself (Erkenntnissorgan der Gattung), thus of the Will as Thing-in-itself; whence alone, moreover, is to be explained that strange enthusiastic joyfulness and rapture in the supreme moments of genial cognition which Sch. seems hardly to know, as he can find it [i.e. that mode of cognition] only in repose and in the silencing of the individual passions. Quite analogously to this conception, I then arrive with greatest certainty at proving in Love a possibility of attaining to that exaltation above the instinct of the individual will where, after complete subjection of this latter, the racial will comes to full consciousness of itself; which upon this height is necessarily tantamount to complete pacification. All this will be made clear even to the inexperienced, if my statement succeeds; whilst the result cannot but be very significant, and entirely and satisfactorily fill the gaps in Schopenhauer&#039;s system.</span>", "time": 1675179816, "resto": 21595781}, {"no": 21596333, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:51:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596306</a><br>Schopenhauer is an arhat; Wagner is a bodhisattva.", "time": 1675180312, "resto": 21595781}, {"no": 21596342, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)10:55:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21596306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21596306</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proving in Love a possibility of attaining to that exaltation above the instinct of the individual will where, after complete subjection of this latter, the racial will comes to full consciousness of itself; which upon this height is necessarily tantamount to complete pacification</span><br>Using sexuality to achieve a state of &quot;racial will&quot; which pacifies the individual will isn&#039;t Vajrayana Buddhism, it&#039;s... esoteric natalism?

Intelligibles, that is, Platonic Forms, are variously referred to as Substances or the Subtantialiy of Intellect. When used Peripatetically , the term &#039;substance&#039; refers to an individual &#039;this something&#039;; &#039;substantiality&#039; refers to the essence of a substance, that is, its core reality or being. For Plotinus, true ontological primacy is found in Substance and Substantiality, not in substance and substantiality. Nevertheless, Plotinus follows Aristotle in making a distinction between Substance and Substantiality in the intelligible world which reflects Aristotle&#039;s distinction between substance and substantiality in the sensible world.

You don&#039;t even read the actual Hanzi vs Letters differently, either. Even in the most phonetic languages, but ESPECIALLY in languages like French, you don&#039;t break a word up into characters, you view it as a discrete packet. &quot;Foot&quot; and &quot;\u811a&quot; aren&#039;t broken up into component parts, they&#039;re taken as a single discrete thing. The way that we train children to read is not to take &quot;foot&quot; and break it up into three parts (two consonants and a digraph representing a vowel), it&#039;s to repeat the sound &quot;foot&quot; in your head upon seeing an arbitrary symbol (&quot;foot&quot;). This is EXACTLY how Mandarin works.<br><br>Remember the subvocalization meme? You can&#039;t read without subvocalizing.

You do not read French and Mandarin any differently. <br><br>SOME languages have orthographies that DO let you pick apart a given arbitrary symbol and arrive at the correct pronunciation, but that is absolutely not necessary for reading, and actually requires more brain power to do (lower IQ native speakers of languages with phonetic orthographies tend to fail when forced to derive a word from phonetics because there&#039;s a higher sound-symbol load which requires more brain power).

It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. My mother, who probably won\u2019t speak to me for a solid year after today.<br>Don\u2019t get me wrong; the eulogy I delivered wasn\u2019t profound enough to make history, like the one Brooke Shields delivered at Michael Jackson\u2019s funeral. Or the one delivered by Steve Jobs\u2019s sister. Or Pat Tillman\u2019s brother. But it was epic in its own way.<br>I was nervous at first. It was the funeral of the prodigious Andrew Bloom, after all. Adored mayor of my hometown of Plethora, Maine. Owner of the most successful real-estate agency within city limits. Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom, the most revered teaching assistant in all of Plethora.

You know who I&#039;m talking about- antinatalists, efilists, climtae extremists, militant vegans and atheists, pro cp legalization people, etc.<br><br>Like, I get it dude. I used to feel similarly about antinatalism. The world is full of pain and having kids creates the possibility of them experiencing varying degrees of this pain. I get it. But do you ever just stop and think &quot;I&#039;m being a little over the top, aren&#039;t I?&quot; I don&#039;t believe people for a second when they say their antinatalism is a result of logic. It&#039;s from a place of emotion and pain. For what it&#039;s worth, having kids isn&#039;t a decision made by logic, but emotion, as well. But I feel like intellectuals who spout antinatalism are just reacting to their own pain and the helplessness of not being able to control this mad, chaotic world and so desperately want to find any way to make it all make sense or, at the very least, less chaotic and scary. More calm.<br><br>Philosophy can help you expand your mental horizons and ponder things more deeply, but when you end up saying shit like this, you gotta take a minute to step back and reflect. If you do or don&#039;t want kids, that&#039;s your choice, but either way think very deeply about it. This isn&#039;t about the antinatalism, really, it&#039;s about going off the deep end philosophically, jumping out of one delusion and into another. The world is chaotic no matter how you look at it, whether you&#039;re an antinatalist or a christian fundie who has twenty kids.

I admit that it&#039;s formulated in a dangerously reductive manner, as it is ignoring the vast nuances that are inherent to any real life situation, but it does keep me up at night. Even if the former has a slight cynical edge to it thanks to the contemporary consumerist social engineering blasting the message of grabbing on to your youth with all your might as you still can, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that at its core it is any more true or false. It&#039;s all wrapped by fear/cowardice anyway. One of the reasons why I&#039;ve remained a NEET for so long until recently is the fear of signing away the most precious resource of all, Time, to a venture that would ultimately turn to an overall deficit in the long run. I worry a lot about doing a job that would not allow me to pursue what I really care about the most, despite me not being good at it for now. A job that would eat away at your soul to the point where you wouldn&#039;t have any love left to spread. But that&#039;s just the nature of our circumstances now, there&#039;s not much that we could do about it is there? Might as well plunge into any field and have faith that these circumstances, these factors that will always remain beyond your reach, wouldn&#039;t play a rotten game against you. Gotta face adversity somehow, otherwise there would be no manhood to wax about. <br>I hope to get an entry into humanitarian aid through this degree. That would probably be more beneficial to life itself than the rest of my self-centered &quot;artistic&quot; leanings. Or if I really was worth a damn, I&#039;d find a way to synthesize the two into an object worth contemplating. That&#039;s it, worth. Maybe that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking for. Justifying my own chain of decisions so far in life. That&#039;s the deepest appeal of art for me, the idea that I could bring all of my experiences into one transcendental package, something that will go much farther beyond my self and my own perspectives. Scraping away the wisdom that could be found hiding behind the textures of the happenings of my life. That should serve goodness, shouldn&#039;t it? Do you think art could work for the good of the world? Or do you think it&#039;s bound to remain perverse?

I too read it after seeing that one anon&#039;s posts about it. I remain unconvinced but it was decent food for thought. More crucially I found the writing to be dull and monotonous, with dry repetitions of the same very specific philosophical phrases over and over again bogging down the flow of the book at many turns. The highlight was the quotes of different NDEs from various sources sprinkled across the book which brought some much-needed personality to accompany the author&#039;s own writing. <br><br>The arguments put forth are persuasive but not compelling enough to make justice to the title of the book in my opinion. For example, Amberts shrugs off the argument that these NDEs could simply be the work of a rattled brain by saying (paraphrasing), &#039;Even if an afterlife as seen in an NDE is not actually real it might as well be real because deep NDE experiencers invariably become convinced of the reality of their experience&#039;, yet this of course says nothing of the actual objective reality of their experience. Still, despite these criticisms I don&#039;t regret reading this book.
