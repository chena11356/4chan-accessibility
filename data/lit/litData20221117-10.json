However, as soon as I got to uni and realised that girls actually existed (outside of internet pornography, which unfortunately had been my main exposure to them), I began to realise after about a year and a bit that I was lying to myself and was actually always attracted to girls. I sort of knew this, but I convinced myself that I was only capable of same-sex romantic attraction because that was all I had known previously, and it was also a convenient way of ignoring self-esteem issues which convinced me I wouldn\u2019t be capable of getting attractive girls. It actually took a girl \u2014 who unfortunately I wasn\u2019t interested in \u2014 taking me out on three dates until I realised that I could be attractive to some girls, and even then it took a couple of months to realise what I actually wanted and change my Tinder settings to women.<br>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m typical of most \u2018formerly homosexual\u2019 people at all, although the experience of people going to non-co-ed boarding schools and developing attractions to the same sex that they then grow out of is fairly common. I still feel attraction to feminine looking men, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that, I just don\u2019t act on it, mainly because there are a higher number of attractive women and also because having a woman in one\u2019s life is more of a sense of achievement and fulfilment. Check your digit ratios, whether you have gay voice, whether you have ever experienced attraction to women \u2014 if you have a high digit ratio and almost never experienced anything other than same-sex attraction then it might just be genetic and something you just have to accept about yourself, if you have low digit ratio and have experienced attraction to women before, it\u2019s more likely to be a case of inhibiting psychological factors. There\u2019s nothing wrong with homosexuality if it\u2019s natural for you, but if it\u2019s because you\u2019re genuinely confused then it may prevent you from living the most fulfilling life you can.", "filename": "EA6DB627-DDA7-42D0-B5A8-FD3403CD64A3", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 306, "h": 462, "tn_w": 82, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1668699160362649, "time": 1668699160, "md5": "YjKESo4RABd4RzqV3fW5fQ==", "fsize": 34826, "resto": 21263461}], "last_modified": 1668699160}, {"no": 21267487, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)05:02:03", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "/sffg/ - Science Fiction and Fantasy General", "com": "Last Battalion Edition<br><br>Previous Thread:<a href=\"/lit/thread/21259539#p21259539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21259539</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Recommended reading charts (Look here before asking for vague recs)</span><br>https://mega.nz/folder/kj5hWI6J#0cy<wbr>w0-ZdvZKOJW3fPI6RfQ/folder/guIyhAzS<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Archive</span><br>https://warosu.org/lit/?task=search<wbr>2&amp;search_subject=sffg<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goodreads</span><br>https://www.goodreads.com/group/sho<wbr>w/1029811-sffg", "filename": "The Last Battalion", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2560, "h": 1440, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 140, "tim": 1668679323593400, "time": 1668679323, "md5": "ls1w3bV9OTj3bBB1k85xIw==", "fsize": 460838, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "sffg-science-fiction-and-fantasy-general", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 37, "images": 11, "omitted_posts": 32, "omitted_images": 9, "last_replies": [{"no": 21268190, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:56:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21267859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21267859</a><br>recently finished Oathbringer, of the 3 Stormlight Archive books I&#039;ve read it&#039;s definitely the best, although still has plenty of sanderson&#039;s annoying qualities in it and is way too long.<br>Just started on The Judging Eye, it&#039;s nice to continue the series.<br>After that, I dunno.

Definitely an eye-opener for the uninitiated.For a more balanced worldview I&#039;d recommend Ship of Fools by Tucker Carlson, The Divide and Griftopia by Matt Taibbi, Death of the West by Pat Buchanan, and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail. All great in their own right.<br><br>For some entertainment purposes, Hunter and The Turner Diaries are fun if not particularly well-written, and Siege reads like a schizophrenic&#039;s diary. If you&#039;re looking for mindless brutality written by folks exposed as actual federal agents for the express purpose of radicalizing potential domestic terrorists, Iron Gates (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called) is kind of a WN version of an Edward Lee book replete with rape and torture.

The only thing that makes it look like he&#039;s a good dad is because Danny is a daddy&#039;s boy, just like how Jack was to his dad (and his dad was an obviously terrible person to everyone except Jack, who just happened to be his favourite).<br>At school Jack is very lousy as well: he teaches while being hangover or still being drunk 90% of the time when he teaches in the morning, the other teachers hate and avoid him (except for Al, and that&#039;s just because they are drinking buddies and are both alcoholics).<br>The only positive aspects of his career as a teacher is his debate club (which he fucks up in the end) and his small writing career, which isn&#039;t even directly a teacher thing since he&#039;s writing on the side, and his &#039;fame&#039; was only like one story that got featured in a big magazine or something similar.<br><br>Jack is a complex character: he is trying his best to be a good person, but he is heavily struggling with addiction, he has very serious anger issues without any way to talk about it or improve himself (other than just telling himself not to lose his temper), when he should obviously get therapy (which he doesn&#039;t get because he&#039;s the man and he can fix everything himself, he doesn&#039;t talk about his feelings or problems at all. The first time he actually talks about his problems in all those years is when the three of them go to the doctor to see if there&#039;s anything wrong with Danny.) He has closed off his emotions to such an extreme degree that he has only said &quot;I love you&quot; to his wife less than 10 times in his whole life.<br><br>He is trying really hard to do the right thing and be a good person, but he just doesn&#039;t know how. That&#039;s how the Hotel manages to get to him: his biggest weaknesses are his addiction, his anger issues, his money problems, and the love for his father, who was an abusive, alcoholic, violent asshole, and the Hotel uses all those mental problems/weaknesses to make him believe he should kill Danny.<br><br>Wendy and Danny know Jack is being corrupted by the Hotel, and they both love him despite his faults, problems and struggles. Wendy had been thinking about divorce for a long time, but going to this Hotel might be the solution to get everything back on track and create the perfect family. At first, everything is actually going better, but the Hotel brings out the absolute worst in Jack, and at some point it is so extreme that it is obvious to Wendy and Danny that Jack is gone and it&#039;s just the Hotel now. They don&#039;t see Jack as an angel, but they see him as a person who doesn&#039;t deserve to get turned into a mindless murder monster by the Hotel.</s><br><br>Time for Night Shift now!", "time": 1668696172, "resto": 21252982}, {"no": 21268170, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)09:50:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21265281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21265281</a><br>Cortazar has some stories that could be considered as horror/weird fiction.

She made experimental use of long, prose-like lines, and varieties of enjambment and indentation, which has been praised for its originality.

Many of Mew&#039;s poems, including &quot;Ken&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#039;s Bride&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Market&quot;, are about outcast figures, expressing Mew&#039;s feelings of alienation from the community in which she lived.

Adorno and others to measure the &quot;authoritarian personality&quot;.[1] The &quot;F&quot; stands for &quot;fascist&quot;. The F-scale measures responses on several different components of authoritarianism, such as conventionalism, authoritarian aggression, superstition and stereotypy, power and &quot;toughness&quot;, destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity, and sex. Scores acquired from the F-scale could be directly associated with background components, educational level, and intellectual capacity.[2] It is an indirect type of test that ensures the result would not be due to the individual&#039;s fake responses; this is possible because the purpose of the measurement and which attitude is being measured are initially concealed from the participants.[3] The existence of this correlation could possibly affect the way in which the F-scale accurately measures the authoritarian personality syndrome.[2] The F-scale has two principal purposes: it aims to measure prejudice and anti-democratic tendencies at the personality level.[3]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The scale specifically examines the following personality dimensions:</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conventionalism: conformity to the traditional societal norms and values of the middle class;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Authoritarian submission: a passive notion towards adhering to conventional norms and values;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Authoritarian aggression: punishing and condemning individuals who don\u2019t adhere to conventional values;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religion and Ethics;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Superstition</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Power and &quot;toughness&quot;;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-intraception, i.e. &quot;rejection of all inwardness, of the subjective, the imaginative, the tender-minded, and of self-criticism&quot;;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Destructiveness and Cynicism: Generalized hostility, vilification of the human;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Projectivity: The disposition to believe that wild and dangerous things go on in the world; the projection outwards of unconscious emotional impulses; and</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sex: Exaggerated concern with sexual &quot;goings-on.&quot;</span>", "filename": "adorno-277x300", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 277, "h": 300, "tn_w": 230, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1668659071592601, "time": 1668659071, "md5": "dSU2xuxypXki9kIUUyVl7w==", "fsize": 15113, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "subliminally-reactionary-childrens-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 15, "images": 2, "omitted_posts": 10, "omitted_images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 21267022, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:09:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21266840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21266840</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Anti-intraception, i.e. &quot;rejection of all inwardness, of the subjective, the imaginative, the tender-minded, and of self-criticism&quot;;</span><br>Yeah man let&#039;s be sensitive and imaginative when enforcing the law.", "time": 1668665352, "resto": 21266840}, {"no": 21267054, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:28:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Ewwww, chuds are so mentally deranged!", "filename": "Else Frenkel-Brunswik", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2011, "h": 1719, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1668666517782471, "time": 1668666517, "md5": "S0Xzfgm9MaLk8xRCo7wKRQ==", "fsize": 644589, "resto": 21266840}, {"no": 21267066, "now": "11/17/22(Thu)01:40:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21267022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21267022</a><br>I see where you&#039;re coming from but your strong negative response to this is also a bit knee-jerk.

And I think I came up with a very succinct, all-encompassing definition. Simpler definitions are better than very elaborate ones, who have to deal with a lot of exceptions.<br><br>Art is self-contained. A picture, a book, a musical piece are self-contained entities. There are no expansion packs for a book or a DLC for music. They are judged on their own. Context might help you to appreciate and understand them better, but the other work of an artist are all separate self-contained art pieces.<br><br>This is why games, tv shows, comics, etc are not art. Because they are not self-contained. This is why the upper class had such disdain for penny dreadfuls, who started the trend of not telling self-contained stories, but having the same protagonist, like a detective for example, always encountering new monsters, finding new lover interests, repeating the same themes over and over again. A game&#039;s lore and universe can always be ruined by a sequel, who in an effort to subvert expectations now tells you how the evil enemy you fought all along were actually dindu nuffins.
