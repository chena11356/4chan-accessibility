Tolstoy&#039;s authorship is remarkable for a number of reasons, one of them being the absolute literary genius with which War and Peace and Anna Karenina are written, the other being that he is the singular author with the most violent and irredeemable fall from artistic grace of all time. His post-1888 philosophy of art expressly forbids good literature - it is to be simple-minded fables for the moral education of the peasantry, and nothing more. He rebukes Shakespeare for immorality. This is so profoundly aestetically misunderstood that it does not even deserve an answer.<br>The Kreuzer Sonata is retarded seething - that is all it is. <br>It is completely explained by age-induced impotence before the invention of Viagra. The Kreutzer Sonata was written and published just as he passed 60 years of age.<br>One would imagine that the cooling of desire that comes about with age would lead to a cooling of temperament, but the pure seething anger contained in this tome by Tolstoy, the absolutely dripping with hatred screed he puts forward in condemnation of fucking, given on the background of a lifetime of raping every serf with a vagina around him, transparently betrays Tolstoy&#039;s profoundly sour grapes - this is not the cool-headed and kind-hearted renunciation of carnal desire by a monk in control of his urges, this is rather the unbridled and unrelenting hatred of a man who desires with white-hot intensity what his dick will no longer rise to take.<br><br>There are exactly two kinds of people who will disagree with this assessment: <br>1) plebs who know that it is Established Academic Opinion that Tolstoy is le good, who haven&#039;t read him or not much of him, who think that blindly regurgitating Established Academic Opinion makes them smart participants in the debate. Perhaps these people have also read his late moral fables, specifically designed for retarded peasants, and found them good - gee, I wonde why? <br>2) trad-larpers, who unironically agree with the idea that aesthetics should be subjugated to some sort of contingent, arbitrary and most importantly turbo-hypocritical religious morality. This is a rather extreme opinion, even for actual religious people, which is why the one who espouses it is likely a larper, whose convert zeal is still strong, as it has only been 6 months since he found out he was actually catholic all along.", "time": 1676027017, "resto": 21637851}, {"no": 21639858, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)07:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21637851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637851</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Incel</span>", "filename": "C318DEDC-8EE4-45A2-BD8D-9ED7CBEAA5F0", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1163, "h": 1258, "tn_w": 115, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1676032809528957, "time": 1676032809, "md5": "f2hEzC/1+4XX+vV48OjOFA==", "fsize": 166598, "resto": 21637851}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21638482, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)20:48:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Does your /lit/ repertoire consist of any red flags?", "filename": "1631614046999", "ext": ".png", "w": 744, "h": 806, "tn_w": 230, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675993691630749, "time": 1675993691, "md5": "y+15eFbQyQjx7lij+NiKHw==", "fsize": 123064, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "does-your-lit-repertoire-consist-of-any-red-flags", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 62, "images": 7, "unique_ips": 42}, {"no": 21638497, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)20:50:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;woman brings up the topic of literature</span><br>red flag", "time": 1675993828, "resto": 21638482}, {"no": 21638531, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)20:58:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Always makes me laugh that she lists Hegel as being ok.

Instead they treat them as subjects to be studied through the format of the interview, if they actually said the things they add as voiceovers later, the interview would simply be over because these art people are too far up their own ass to entertain any thought outside their large intestines, so it&#039;s much more fruitful and entertaining to get them to talk and then analyse what they say later. I don&#039;t think they go at it as a way of seeking a real discussion, they just try to get people to reveal something to them that they can explore and analyse from their point of view. In this way you don&#039;t get some balanced portrayel, which I don&#039;t think they even claim to offer, but simply their perspective and analysis of what their project has shown. I think it&#039;s much more enjoyable to be offered this kind of biased perspective up front to engage with instead of the usual procedural manipulation that these types of documentaries typically use to make a point.

Ma and Gardner strike me as the type to endlessly bloviate, Ma with constant jibes, trying to eek out any sense of superiority, whereas Gardner strikes me as the dullard who bores you in train stations, the person who circumambulate around a single point, the only point he knows. Waldun, however, is at least well read - perhaps the others are, but here is the crucial difference - Waldun might be a narcissist but is at least capable of self-criticism to a limited degree, and actively works to increase his knowledge than safeguard the precious little he knows. To me, this is ideal in a conversation partner - intelligent, opinionated but not boorish in self-advocacy, and willing to hear your thoughts, open to new ideas.<br>The date would go like this - an upscale restaurant - Waldun dresses well, so I won&#039;t have to worry about sticking out. Similarly, upper class places seem more willing to tolerate classy people stepping out of the norm, an obviously homosexual date wouldn&#039;t arouse any scorn, even if people find it distasteful, politeness will chide their tongues. A bottle of red wine, split between us, perhaps cocktails after. A light appetizer and main course, no dessert. I will naturally pay, both out of my rigid adherence to social norms, but also to establish me as the dominant one. Perhaps drinking more excessively at some other establishment to work up the courage to continue the second half of the date.<br>After the act, I would try hard to ghost him.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The negative utilitarian ethicist might dismiss this alluring prospect as pie-in-the-sky. Like negative utilitarianism itself - and Benatar&#039;s argument that sentient existence entails intrinsic harm to its victims - the superhappiness solution invites ridicule, ad hominem attacks, and incredulity. But a cruelty-free world is technically feasible. And unlike anti-natalism, there are strong sociological and technical grounds to predict that the application of biotechnology will wipe out the substrates of suffering for good.</span>", "filename": "The Hedonistic Imperative - David Pearce", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 279, "h": 445, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675759844213973, "time": 1675759844, "md5": "GU7wbhImRIt8qsWCkouz9g==", "fsize": 10616, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626937, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)03:51:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no meaningful arguments against antinatalism</span><br>If you accept utilitarianism.

One first response is the Caplan-Perry synthesis: You are free to reject life (in the sense that if you rationally want it, you shouldn&#039;t be stopped), and we should all work towards a society where that option is open to people (In approved medical centers, for example). That way, those who prefer non-existence can go back to it and those who prefer existence can keep it.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, when thinking about bringing someone new into existence, chances of something terrible happening to that person exist. Should a future person be subjected to the mere possibility of such things just to allow the existence of other people? Because clearly, if we accept that no amount of good can compensate a given bad within a life, the fact that somewhere, at some point, someone with such a life could be born would be a reason to stop any procreation. Which is why we have to reject that.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If on the hand hand we have the cessation of all conscious life from the universe and in the other having a minuscule minority of people who will live awful lives, it seems clear to my that we should opt for the latter. And in addition, we should also aim for a world were the number of people who regret existing is smaller and smaller. It is fortunately the case that we are not in a world where suffering is a metaphysical necessity.</span>", "filename": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Ric\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez de la Puente", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675760209237578, "time": 1675760209, "md5": "3B+bAGQUBJJDhjV+canOfQ==", "fsize": 25268, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626956, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:01:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626950</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And two, that life is, after all, nice (For most people).</span><br>Cognitive dissonance", "time": 1675760481, "resto": 21626867}, {"no": 21626962, "now": "02/07/23(Tue)04:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21626867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21626867</a><br>OMG SO TRUE DUDE LIFE IS SOOO SOOO HARD OMG SO SAD, ANYWAYS LETS GO BACK TO PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND FORGETTING ABOUT FUTURE GENERATIONS HAHA.

In general, leave &quot;Literature,&quot; the thing called &quot;Literature&quot; at present, to run through its rapid fermentations (how more and more rapid they are in these years!), and to fluff itself off into Nothing, in its own way, like a poor bottle of soda-water with the cork sprung; it won&#039;t be long. In our time it has become all the rage; highest noblemen and dignitaries courting a new still higher glory there; innumerable men, women and children rushing towards it, yearly ever more. It sat painfully in Grub Street, in hungry garrets, so long; some few heroic martyrs always serving in it, among such a miscellany of semi-fatuous worthless ditto, courting the bubble reputation in worse than the cannon&#039;s mouth; in general, a very flimsy, foolish set. But that little company of martyrs has at last lifted Literature furiously or foamingly high in the world. Goes like the Iceland geysers in our time, like uncorked soda-water; and will, as I said, soon have done. Only wait: in fifty years, I should guess, all really serious souls will have quitted that mad province, left it to the roaring populaces; and for any Noble-man or useful person it will be a credit rather to declare, &quot;I never tried Literature; believe me, I have not written anything;&quot; and we of &quot; Literature&quot; by trade, we shall sink again, I perceive, to the rank of street-fiddling; no higher rank, though with endless increase of sixpences flung into the hat.

And yet of Shakspeare too, it is not the Fiction that I admire, but the Fact; to say truth, what I most of all admire are the traces he shows of a talent that could have turned the History of England into a kind of Iliad, almost perhaps into a kind of Bible. Manifest traces that way; something of epic in the cycle of hasty Fragments he has yielded us (slaving for his bread in the Bankside Theatre); and what a work wouldn&#039;t that have been! Marlborough said, He knew no English History but what he had got from Shakspeare; and truly that is still essentially the serious and sad fact for most of us; Fact thrice and four times lamentable, though Marlborough meant it lightly.

Land occupancy is ownership, but in no legal sense. Personal property is very much what Stirner speaks of.

True, the law of value has no regulating function in our socialist production, but it nevertheless influences production, and this fact cannot be ignored when directing production. As a matter of fact, consumer goods, which arc needed to compensate the labour power expended in the process of production, are produced and realized in our country as commodities coming under the operation of the law of value. It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production. In this connection, such things as cost accounting and profitableness, production costs, prices, etc., are of actual importance in our enterprises. Consequently, our enterprises cannot, and must not, function without taking the law of value into account.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/reference/<wbr>archive/stalin/works/1951/economic-<wbr>problems/ch04.htm<br>Nice &quot;communism&quot; you got there faggot", "time": 1675963821, "resto": 21634176}, {"no": 21636505, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)12:34:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21636489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21636489</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s not communism</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Therefore it is capitalism</span><br>Vulgar political economist get out.", "time": 1675964048, "resto": 21634176}, {"no": 21636516, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)12:36:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21636505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21636505</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It is sometimes asked whether the law of value exists and operates in our country, under the socialist system.</span><br>Socialism and communism mean the same thing, thus stalin was calling his strain of capitalism socialist", "time": 1675964178, "resto": 21634176}, {"no": 21636541, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)12:44:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21636516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21636516</a><br>It was not capitalism or socialism is was an entire different mode of production.", "time": 1675964690, "resto": 21634176}, {"no": 21636547, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)12:45:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21636541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21636541</a><br>ok, what was it?", "time": 1675964747, "resto": 21634176}, {"no": 21636679, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)13:19:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21635432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21635432</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;let them sit on your shelf and read a summary</span><br>Correction, I will let them sit on my 1tb HDD until I find them necessary to read.

Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is &quot;wrong&quot;; they can&#039;t be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains \u2014 in the brains of even the stupidest person \u2014 is as &quot;correct&quot; as what&#039;s in my mind or Nietzsche&#039;s or Baudrillard&#039;s. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the &quot;truth&quot; that&#039;s hiding inside even the dumbest person&#039;s brains. For example, when a Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, he is not wrong. It&#039;s just that the concepts he designates with the words &quot;God&quot;, &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word &quot;God&quot;, going by the Christian&#039;s definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says &quot;God&quot;, he doesn&#039;t really mean an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being&quot; (since he&#039;s so dumb he can&#039;t even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means &quot;a very powerful being&quot;. Similarly, when he says &quot;universe&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;universe&quot; (i.e. &quot;everything&quot;), he simply means &quot;the earth&quot; \u2014 or at most, if he&#039;s had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps &quot;the solar system&quot;. And finally, when he says &quot;love&quot; he doesn&#039;t mean what I mean by &quot;love&quot; (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. &quot;help me&quot; (= shape me).<br>So basically, when the Christian says &quot;God created the universe and he loves me&quot;, what he&#039;s really saying, translated in our language, is &quot;A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me&quot; \u2014 which could very well be true!<br>All of this stems from Nietzsche&#039;s positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener. Ultimately, each person gives his own meaning to every word, which is only natural since this meaning is to be found inside each person&#039;s brain, and all brains are different.<br>57.

There are three tiers of thinkers. On the third tier you have people like Jordan Peterson. These people fare well enough when confronted with trifling issues\u2014like whether a language should have ten personal pronouns or ten thousand, for example\u2014and for this they are lauded by the rabble as geniuses. But when it comes to the genuinely tough subjects\u2014the definition of truth say\u2014they can talk nonsense for 20 hours without getting anywhere\u2014and that&#039;s why their opinions on these subjects never survive the test of time: they are so confused and sprawling, while simultaneously worthless, that no one can bother memorizing them. If these people were a bit smarter they would not have opined on these subjects at all, but alas they&#039;re not, and thus the rest of us have to suffer their verbal diarrhea for a few years, until time wipes it all away.<br>Then we have the second tier, that comprises people like Aristotle, whose definition of truth, while next to useless, really, is at least concise enough to be memorable: &quot;To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true&quot;. This is merely common sense transcribed in a kind of formula that makes autistic people feel they&#039;ve understood something, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if Aristotle was on the spectrum somewhere. All &quot;analytic philosophers&quot; are in the same boat/spectrum, and all their writings are equally commonsensical and worthless. But if the universe functioned commonsensically, why would we need geniuses lol? So these people are superior to the base crowd-pleasers like Peterson because they at least make a concentrated attempt at grappling with the big issues, and the results are at least readable, if not exactly useful. Their main use, however, is to function as foils for the geniuses; to serve up the balls that the geniuses will hit out of the park, so to speak.<br>And finally, on the first tier, we have the bona fide geniuses. Consider Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;Truth is will to power&quot;. Doesn&#039;t it make Peterson&#039;s 20-hour verbal diarrhea on the subject seem ludicrous?

But that the only reason for this problem is envy and resentment is shown by the fact that when it comes to other species, not only is there no problem, but inequality is taken as a given and the mere implication that, for example, a dog may be equal to a man is treated by everyone as proof of madness and cause for internment in mental institutions (and this is indeed how it will eventually be with whoever keeps insisting on the equality of humans and subhumans). And yet a simple substitution is all it takes to reveal the sheer absurdity of the business. Change &quot;men&quot; to &quot;lifeforms&quot; and the deeply reactive nature of the equality lie, the massive incapacity to unblinkingly acknowledge the simple fact that some men are superior, and even vastly superior, to others, stands revealed.

Where does he first go, the church or the hospital? If he really does believe that his God is above the doctors, why does he unfailingly heed the doctors first in every case of need, and his God only much later, if at all? Therefore he believes first and above all in the descendants of Asclepius and Hippocrates. Why asking him is pointless, as regards the truth. What he believes and what he tells you he believes are two entirely different things.

Once you have understood that power is more important than happiness (which latter is merely a tool of the former, and not the other way around, as it appears from the inverted perspective of sick, declining lifeforms), the next thing you need to understand is that phrases such as &quot;to seek power&quot;, &quot;to want power&quot;, &quot;to take power&quot; and the like are merely subhuman misunderstandings of how power actually works.<br>If you seek power, it simply means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore will never get it either, because power is something you give, not take).<br>If you want power, this once more means that you don&#039;t have it (and therefore once more will never get it, for the exact same reason I explained in the previous parenthesis).<br>If you take power, it simply means that someone is giving it to you, and is therefore the more powerful of the two, and will remain so for as long as you are drawing your power from him instead of bestowing it on him.<br>So how does power actually work? Take an extremely simple example from the physical sphere, where the mechanics are easier to understand. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, and try to figure out how he became so physically strong. The subhuman theory of power as something to be taken would suggest that Arnold took his power from somewhere, but from where exactly? From the barbells, perhaps? In this view, barbells would be magical instruments with the capacity for bestowing power on all those who... try to lift them, I guess. But if you or I tried to lift the kinds of barbells Arnold typically lifts, we&#039;d get literally crushed. Not only would we not &quot;gain&quot; any power: we&#039;d have to be hospitalized. We could of course start from smaller weights and work our way up, the same way Arnold did: but I have bad news for you here, sonny: we&#039;d probably fail at getting to his level, or even anywhere near it, no matter how hard we tried. Far more genetically gifted individuals than us in this sphere have already tried this, after all, and failed: that&#039;s why Arnold won the Mr. Olympia contest seven times while scores of his closest competitors didn&#039;t. This means that the subhuman theory of magical power-bestowing barbells is false: if the barbells do indeed play a role in the strengthening of an individual, then at the very least this individual must be of a specific type that is CAPABLE of benefiting from their effect: he has, in other words, to be WORTHY of them, which is merely another way of saying that he has to be ALREADY STRONG.<br>QED: Power is not something you can take but something that you must give, and the only reason subhumans are adamant that it is the other way around is because they are so inherently and irremediably weak, that they don&#039;t have the slightest conception of it. <br><br>460.

Though it could be argued that the Overman is the only one who is able to manifest what he wishes, because he is the only one who truly thinks himself capable and deserving of it. If the average person tried to manifest their dreams, they might fail because subconsciously they know they aren\u2019t worth it, and since they don\u2019t want to manifest that guilt along with their dreams, they can\u2019t manifest the dream at all. Also, the belief in causality and determinism can be another hindrance, which the Overman is not susceptible to. He doesn\u2019t need to know precisely HOW he gets what he wants, the universe bends its rules for him, because he creates the universe. So these things might explain why some people are able to manifest thousands or millions of dollars while others can only manifest a free coffee. But you could also argue that the \u201cmanifestation\u201d doesn\u2019t occur at all, but that the people who are confident and believe that they can manifest are the ones who are already powerful enough to attain their goals naturally, and so they attribute their success to manifestation when it was just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Again, the subhuman doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth anything, and believes in strict laws of causality and science etc. so if he fails at manifesting then he will just blame his lack of belief \u2014 a clever way of preventing blasphemers of manifestation.

In this case the question is whether our everyday intuitions about what is possible or impossible are sensible. For example, for thousands of years people were trying their hand at the geometric problem of &quot;squaring the circle&quot;, i.e., constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straight edge. Eventually, it was proven that this was mathematically impossible. Because it&#039;s impossible, it would be pretty stupid to keep trying to do it.<br><br>On the other hand, some things seem &quot;possible&quot; but don&#039;t happen. Sticking with the example of mathematical theorems, a person might try to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem, but fail. But it is nevertheless possible to prove Fubini&#039;s theorem--people do it all the time. So a person will necessarily fail to square the circle, but only contingently fail at proving Fubini&#039;s theorem.<br><br>For a long time there was skepticism about these concepts of &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;possibility&quot;, expressed especially by Quine. There were specific technical problems with trying to show how they could be incorporated into logic (in particular, modal logics were not &quot;extensional&quot;). On this basis people began to seriously doubt that there was anything meaningful about statements of possibility and impossibility, despite how intuitive they were.<br><br>Kripke revolutionized the field by introducing so called &quot;possible world semantics&quot; which overcame the technical problems identified by Quine and others. Now there was a way to make formal distinctions between impossibilities (like squaring the circle) and contingent falsehoods.<br><br>Maybe you think this is all too academic, and who cares whether some particular math problem is &quot;impossible&quot; or simply difficult.

In fact I would say having to rid oneself of resentment is just as bad as having it in the first place. The feelings which created such resentiment still exist, you have only adopted the values which you were critical of, i.e a hypocrite.<br><br>Now what is resentment? Often it is confused as simply rationalizing one&#039;s feelings of inferiority by condemning an external object for the subject&#039;s impotence. But one component is missing in this simple categorization of resentiment. That is &#039;envy&#039;. Why is envy essential for resentiment? It is because in order to feel quantitively inferior, one most also value the same measure of the external object which is being blamed for the inferiority. For example, the individual resentful of wealth values poverty over money, he still values money however he values the inverse of wealth &#039;poverty is good&#039; , &#039;wealth is bad.<br><br>Now you are saying that you have grown out of anti-Semitism by ridding yourself of resentiment. That is, not only have you never opposed Jewish values, but that you were envious of them and adopted them yourself! This only means that you were a Jew yourself, and your resentiment was simply self hatred at your ineptitude at being a Jew. <br><br>It is spiritual Jews like yourself, and that Jew Walter Kaufman who accused the NSDAP of resentiment towards both monopoly capitalism, and of course the Jewish race. That is, in your Jewishness you extoll money to be an objective value, and that one can be a master and value it, or a slave who resents it.<br><br>But this is of course far from the truth, now when I speak of the values of the NSDAP I speak of it not in individuals, not even in it&#039;s programs, but in it&#039;s form. I can best summarize it in this quote from Hitler:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]we do not say to the rich people &quot;Please, give something to the poor.&quot; Instead we say &quot;German people, help yourself!&quot; Everyone must help, whether you are rich or poor.

And now they&#039;re strangling us. Our own masculine brothers in the security forces will gun us down, if we try anything, because we have taught them to not think and simply take orders from the politicians. And now the politicians are fags and non-Whites. We have no one to blame but ourselves.<br><br>At the same time, we shouldn&#039;t blame ourselves\u2014or anyone else for that matter. We&#039;re in entirely new territory: no one has reached this level before. And like every higher level in a good game, it harbors new dangers, but also new opportunities. It&#039;s interesting and exciting as fuck! If something were to happen today, it would be biblical! Think for a moment what kind of war the Founding Fathers were fighting. The Brits were their brethren, and gentlemen to boot. War between such highly civilized people was more like a game, a chess match. But WE WILL BE FACING ARABS, MEXICANS, AFRICANS. If anything happened here, IT WOULD BE BRUTAL AS FUCK, LIKE FUCKING WARHAMMER. We&#039;re talking APOCALYPTIC VIOLENCE, drone-bombings, tactical nukes going off, mass torturings, mass graves. I can&#039;t wait! Some nights I dream about it! But I am not going to throw my life away by going out into the street and attacking the first fag or non-White I see. That&#039;s a fine gesture for what it is, I am not knocking the people who do that, it&#039;s understandable and to an extent necessary, and it&#039;s inspirational; but it&#039;s just prologue.<br><br>I want to play in the main event.<br><br>From http://orgyofthewill.net \u00a71364.

The ultimate orgy of the will in full so you don&#039;t think I&#039;m full of shit:<br>Why is the Big Bang an explosion and thus a destruction of everything including therefore whatever/whoever caused it? It can&#039;t be compulsion because the Big Bang is the greatest power in the universe, hence there&#039;s nothing to compel it, ergo it must be will, and precisely this is the ultimate orgy of the will. &quot;Every great thing is the cause of its own destruction, via an act of self-cancellation...&quot; The Big Bang is the very mechanism of the Eternal Recurrence, and note that Nietzsche wrote this HALF A CENTURY before Big Bang theory was conceived. He wasn&#039;t trying to EXPLAIN some astrophysical phenomenon with this theory\u2014since nothing at the time had been observed that was demanding such an explanation\u2014so he didn&#039;t TAKE this theory from anywhere, he simply CREATED it out of thin air (out of cultural observations that could have been interpreted in countless other ways than how he interpreted them), and lo and behold, the astrophysicists &quot;discovered&quot; it half a century later, entirely independently, since they hadn&#039;t read a word of Nietzsche... So what&#039;s going on here? Whose will precisely is the ultimate orgy of the will if not the will of those who dreamt and thus &quot;discovered&quot; it? You say, &quot;It is the will of future people with the technology to power it&quot;, but would those future people have created this technology without Nietzsche and the astrophysicists inventing the concepts of the Big Bang and the Eternal Recurrence for them? Would they have created this technology out of nothing?

Perhaps by themselves, but Jewish law and Jewish religionists consider them fully bound by those laws. Jewish people consider someone like Proust to be fully bound to the laws of Judaism in the eyes of YHWH. All religious Jews would have looked at Proust as a member of the tribe who had been misguided and who must be brought back into the fold. They would think of him as having fallen away from the Law, and consider it imperative to bring him back to Halakha observance. They would not recognize his conversion. They would not consider him a Catholic. They would have considered him, till the day that he died, to be fully Jewish in every sense of the word. <br>So, are we talking past each other here? My viewpoint is, if anything objectively binds someone to Jewish law, it is Jewish law, Jewish interpretation, Jewish scholars/rabbis/etc. By all accounts, Proust is objectively Jewish and objectively bound to Jewish law.

So how can we define his Jewish identity without recourse to a) the community itself, and b) the law that defines this identity? If we don&#039;t use the concepts of Jews themselves, what are we even talking about? We are inventing our own definition of Jewish identity that they themselves would not agree with, that has no basis in the actual community&#039;s beliefs. We are not even talking about the same thing that Jews consider Jewish identity.

This new ensouling does not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is unaffected.</span><br>(IV.3.8)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Imagine that a stately and varied mansion has been built; it has never been abandoned by its Architect, who, yet, is not tied down to it; he has judged it worthy in all its length and breadth of all the care that can serve to its Being- as far as it can share in Being- or to its beauty, but a care without burden to its director, who never descends, but presides over it from above: this gives the degree in which the kosmos is ensouled, not by a soul belonging to it, but by one present to it; it is mastered not master; not possessor but possessed.

The universe spreads as broad as the presence of soul; the bound of its expansion is the point at which, in its downward egression from the Supreme, it still has soul to bind it in one: it is a shadow as broad as the Reason-Principle proceeding from soul; and that Reason-Principle is of scope to generate a kosmic bulk as vast as lay in the purposes of the Idea [the Divine forming power] which it conveys.</span><br>(IV.3.9)", "filename": "Bhavacakra", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1133, "h": 1297, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1676002339711541, "time": 1676002339, "md5": "FPMgNdecVcBgzSHoXp6N9A==", "fsize": 388196, "resto": 21638469}, {"no": 21638954, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:16:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[3]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it.</span><br>(IV.3.11)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights, gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul.

In this sense we may truly say that the good soul is the forgetful. It flees multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed, self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual life, all that is foreign to that order.

Thompson, is a tour de force of satire, humor, and cultural commentary; capturing the essence of an era that was defined by drugs, excess, and a deep sense of disillusionment.<br>At its core, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; is a tale of two men, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, who embark on a wild and unforgettable journey to the neon-lit city of Las Vegas. Their mission is to cover a series of sporting events, but as they delve deeper into the heart of this sprawling metropolis, they find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of drugs, violence, and the surreal, hallucinatory atmosphere of the desert city. . . .<br><br>Raoul Duke is a \u2018gonzo\u2019 journalist, a rogue reporter who tears down the traditional barriers between writer and subject in order to capture the raw, unfiltered truth of his experiences. He is a lovable rogue, a mischievous prankster who revels in the absurd and the outrageous, and he serves as the perfect foil for the more sinister Dr. Gonzo.<br>Dr. Gonzo, on the other hand, is a legal counsel with a sinister edge, a man who uses his intellect and wit to manipulate those around him to his advantage. He is a drug-fueled monster, a harbinger of chaos who revels in the excesses of the counterculture movement, he drags Raoul Duke into some wild, dangerous situations.<br><br>Through the eyes of these two protagonists, Thompson masterfully satirizes American culture, exposing the dark and absurd underbelly of the American Dream. He takes aim at everything from the hypocrisy of the political establishment, to the corruption of the corporate elite, to the hedonistic excesses of the counterculture. In doing so, he reveals a world that is at once both hilarious and frightening, a world that is infused with a deep sense of melancholy and despair.", "time": 1676014074, "resto": 21634729}, {"no": 21639366, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)02:29:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The writing in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; is truly a marvel to behold. A beautiful linguistic tapestry woven from the threads of hyperbole, sarcasm, and sheer absurdity.<br>Thompson&#039;s prose is at once poetic and profane, capturing the beauty and ugliness of the world with equal aplomb. He employs a vivid and imaginative style, painting a rich and immersive picture of Las Vegas and its inhabitants. His words are infused with a sense of manic energy, reflecting the frenzied pace of life in this city of excess.<br>What makes &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; so powerful, however, is not just its writing, but also its deep insight into the human condition. Thompson&#039;s characters are complex and flawed, each struggling with their own personal demons. Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo are both men who are searching for something, but are never quite sure what it is they are looking for. Through their journey, they reveal the emptiness and loneliness that lies at the heart of the American Dream, exposing the dark and twisted side of the human psyche.<br><br>Despite its bleak and often disturbing themes, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; is a work that is also filled with moments of humor and absurdity. Thompson&#039;s wit and humor are on full display in this book, providing a counterbalance to the often heavy and serious tone. Whether he is poking fun at the conservative politicians of the time, or exposing the ridiculousness of the drug culture, Thompson&#039;s humor is always on point, providing a much-needed lightness to what could otherwise be a very dark and heavy book.<br>Another aspect of this book that cannot be overlooked is the profound impact it has had on popular culture. &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; has inspired countless other works of fiction, and has even been adapted into a critically acclaimed film. Its impact on the world of literature cannot be overstated, and it remains one of the most iconic works of the 20th century.<br>In conclusion, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; is a truly remarkable work of fiction, one that is both insightful and entertaining.

The first statement is itself not empirical at all, but metaphysical; the second is itself an absolute statement. The question of absolute truth is raised first of all, for the critical observer, by such self- contradictions; and the first logical conclusion to which he must be led is this:, if there is any truth at all, it cannot be merely &quot;relative.&quot; The first principles of modern science, as of any system of knowledge, are themselves unchangeable and absolute; if they were not there would be no knowledge at all, not even the most &quot;reflective&quot; knowledge, for there would be no criteria by which to classify anything as knowledge or truth.<br>This axiom has a corollary: the absolute cannot be attained by means of the relative.

If followed to their logical conclusion, without bias, they should lead to radical skepticism.<br><br>He admits right there in that excerpt that you can&#039;t actually reach the truth with knowledge. You literally can&#039;t know anything. Rose claims that his particular religious sect offers the correct set of presuppositions and infallible &quot;truths&quot; necessary to overcome this, but why should we believe him? What is the value of replacing one set of unverifiable presuppositions with another set of unverifiable presuppositions? <br><br>He claims that his specific sect contains a divinely-revealed truth that surpasses all other schools of knowledge. Every other religious group and ideology makes the same claims. The only way to figure out which one is the &quot;true&quot; truth would be to compare and contrast them against some kind of external standard; but Rose has already made it clear that that&#039;s impossible because you can&#039;t use thought to reach the truth. Therefore, if you&#039;re measuring any set of truth claims put forth by any group that claims to have it, you necessarily have to pick some set of presuppositions to hold to and then judge the rest of the truth claims by (all of them will fail compared to yours of course because you&#039;ve already decided on what the truth is by presupposing it). But how can you decide which &quot;truth&quot; to presuppose when you have no external method of verifying which one is correct? Effectively, randomly picking. You pick whatever you feel like, a.k.a, relativism - ironically what Rose has been trying to avoid the entire time. (We will leave out the added trouble of Rose&#039;s worldview containing demons that can invade your mind, deceive your senses, and control your environment, but this only adds to the epistemological confusion a la Descartes.)<br><br>Everyone presupposes that their viewpoint is objectively correct and automatically dismisses all others by the very nature of that presupposition. No one actually has external assurance that they picked the right &quot;truth&quot; because there&#039;s just as much of a chance that the other guy chose the right viewpoint as you did. Conclusion: NOTHING can actually be known or externally validated because the foundation of all knowledge is totally unverifiable and inaccessible to human minds. All reason is useless because none of it can be authenticated with certainty.

I merely repeated what Rose claimed: knowledge can&#039;t be used to arrive at the foundations of knowledge, ergo, the baseline truth of things can&#039;t be reached by knowledge. But you&#039;re absolutely correct: even that can&#039;t be known for sure. It also can&#039;t be known for sure that the truth CAN be arrived at with knowledge.<br><br><a href=\"#p21637228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21637228</a><br>I&#039;m aware that that isn&#039;t the entirety of his argument, but by including that portion into it, he&#039;s already shot himself in the foot. I am familiar with the Transcendental Argument, and while it can indeed establish a reasonable basis for supposing a transcendent source of rationality, it is severely wanting in its far more audacious claim to prove the exclusive veracity of the Christian concept of God. The most it can logically give us is some kind of rational noumena underlying phenomena that we can&#039;t actually directly know anything about (as even Christian theologians have claimed with the doctrine that God&#039;s essence is unknowable).<br><br>The claim is made that the reality must be personal - but other systems also claim this. The claim is made that the reality must simultaneously be both a unity and a multiplicity, or transcend that duality altogether - but other systems also claim this. Many stipulations are made that come across as pointlessly arbitrary; how, exactly, knowledge is made more or less possible by us presupposing the transcendent reality to have certain traits is not at all clear. We are still making mere claims and statements about the reality as opposed to obtaining any intuitive knowledge of it.<br><br>The &quot;one-and-many&quot; argument is even more problematic; it claims that the existence of a world of multiplicity is not explicable by appealing to a higher unity, but instead that the transcendent reality must be a unity and a multiplicity at the same time. This is, in my view, really no more than a linguistic sleight of hand. If unity and multiplicity are in fact identical or conjoined at the highest level of reality, then ultimately there isn&#039;t actually any difference between the one or the many because the source of the world is actually both at the same time. The &quot;problem of the one and many&quot; is &quot;solved&quot; in a way - but only by completely eradicating the very categories of &quot;one&quot; and &quot;many&quot;. One IS many, and many IS one: in the final analysis, the Christian God is in fact the same as the Eleatic God. The whole dichotomy is an illusion, where the appearances of the world are only apparent and stem purely from our minds. <br><br>Such monism is, obviously, the precise opposite of what Rose or Dyer attempt to get at, but it&#039;s where their arguments end up nonetheless.

Engrossed with the girl whom I was caressing, I scarcely had noticed the woman; but as she pulled up her chemise to tighten her garter, and showed much of a very white thigh, I said, &quot;I&#039;ve made a mistake, I did not mean you.&quot; &quot;No&quot;, said she, &quot;but it&#039;s all the same.&quot; She came to me, pinched my cock outside saying &quot;oho&quot; as she found it stiff, and then undressed the child to her chemise.

Then said the woman, &quot;Let me hold your cock, you must not put it far in, she is so young.&quot; I promised I would only sheath the tip; but she declared I should not unless she held it. &quot;Wrap your handkerchief round it&quot;, said she. I did so, and that left only half its length uncovered.

There seeing my balls hanging down under her little arse, I shoved and wriggled, holding her like a baby on me, her hands round my neck, she whining that I was hurting her, the woman hushing, and praying me to be gentle, till I spent again. I held her tight to me in front of the glass, her thighs wide apart, my balls showing under her little buttocks, till my prick again shrunk, and my sperm ran from her cunt down my balls.

They were present at<br>the launching of a new battleship at Devonport Dockyard which Her<br>Majesty christened _The Queen_. There was a grand procession down Union<br>Street, with troops lining both sides of the road to keep the crowds<br>back. Their Majesties had a wonderful reception, with cheers rolling<br>from one end of the route to the other. There were none in the crowd who<br>cheered more sincerely than the prostitutes did. They had turned out in<br>force to witness the procession, forming pickets all along Union Street.<br>Their Majesties were riding in an open landau and the Queen looked very<br>youthful for one of her age, and very lovely also. King Edward was a<br>jovial-faced man, very popular with the rank and file of the Army. He<br>knew the history of every regiment and was said to be the greatest<br>living authority on details of military and naval uniform. He had<br>already won two Derbys and was also supposed to be very fond of a gamble<br>at a game of cards, like the majority of his loyal troops. The Royal<br>carriage had just passed the spot where I was standing when a member of<br>one of the prostitute-pickets wriggled through the troops in front of<br>her, and shouting \u201cMy Father, my Father\u201d started running after the<br>carriage, which she had just failed to catch. This girl, who was called<br>Leaky Minnie, was not quite right in her head. She was always telling<br>her friends that her father was a Lord, but when she got drunk a Lord<br>was not important enough for her: she then told them that it was either<br>a Duke or a Prince that was her father. On this occasion the sight of<br>the King must have played on her mind already stirred up by gin and<br>patriotic feelings. The troops were taken by surprise, but a couple of<br>men grounded arms and rushed after her. They caught her before she could<br>catch hold of the back of the carriage and handed her over to the<br>civilian police. She was never seen in Plymouth again and although her<br>friends made enquiries they could never find out what had become of her.<br>There was no mention of this incident in any newspaper the next day.", "time": 1675977778, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21637668, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)17:30:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21635466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21635466</a><br>why are women", "time": 1675981813, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21638645, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:27:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "The Eastern Front - Leon Degrelle <br>Panzer Leader - Heinz Guderian", "time": 1675996031, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21638843, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)22:28:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I&#039;ve read a fuckton here&#039;s some out-of-the-ordinary favorites:<br><br>Homage to Catalonia<br>John Ransom&#039;s Andersonville Diary<br>Commando by Denys Reitz<br>Scum of the Earth by Arthur Koestler (non-combatant but very interesting)", "time": 1675999705, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21638968, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:20:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21635652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21635652</a><br>The book is actually on the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France&#039;s site, been reading it for the past hour, thanks for the rec.", "filename": "Nicolas+Sarkozy", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 768, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1676002843622840, "time": 1676002843, "md5": "2ZMn2XTGIHAaWIE1vegZTA==", "fsize": 382410, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21638978, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)23:23:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21634802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21634802</a><br>I like how they just forgot owl exists", "time": 1676003023, "resto": 21634802}, {"no": 21639448, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)03:33:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21634802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21634802</a><br>Memoirs of General Grivas: Guerilla Warfare and EOKA struggle is a very interesting book about the Cyprus insurgency (1955-1959)<br><br>He talks about the guerilla campaign, the political situation and the geopolitical factors surrounding it.

Marx is truly a bourgeois thinker when he explains all of history by work, when he formulates man&#039;s whole relation to the world in terms of work, when he evaluates all thought in terms of its relation to work, and when he gives work as the creative source of value. Although he did not believe in values, he implies that work is a virtue when he condemns the classes that do not work. He was one of the most articulate interpreters of the bourgeois myth of work, and because he was a socialist and a defender of the working class, he was one of the most active agents in spreading the myth to this class. Besides, it was through work that this class would one day win power and freedom. For the post-Marxian working class, therefore, work meant both the explanation of its condition and the certainty of seeing it end. Once the motive of doctrine had been added to the motive of necessity, how could the workers fail to be imbued with this ideology? It was the bourgeois who invented the dogma of the eminent dignity of the worker, but it was Karl Marx who led the proletariat to this thenceforth ineradicable conviction. From then on, the myth of work became a myth of the left, and the bourgeois and the worker were united in the same commonplace: work is the be-all and end-all of life. The only difference is that for the bourgeois, work tends more and more to be the work of other people, while for the worker only he himself can bear the noble title of worker.

Marx also said that the role of industrial capitalism was to cut costs of production so they could compete with industrial capitalists in other countries. You can do that if you lower wages (although that comes with downsides too). The U.S. later on during that century developed a system of higher wages which helped increase labor productivity, since it&#039;s good to have workers who are getting paid well and have enough to eat and are literate and so on.<br><br>A starving, uneducated workforce in a feudal society is not productive in comparison to that.<br><br>But then there&#039;s the problem of land and housing rent and private monopolies. So Marx saw (&quot;historically&quot;) &quot;progressive&quot; potential in industrial capitalism, but Marxism was also a critique of it, since you have financial monopolies which come into conflict with expanding productivity... like today. People read Marx and think he describes their world because they look around and everything seems to be getting shittier and poorer, but there&#039;s so much wealth that&#039;s just not being reinvested in actual production, because it&#039;s simply not profitable to do so. Marx meanwhile called for having the state to take over land and be the landlord instead of a hereditary landlord class. (Georgists favored a land tax.) Socialism would bring into public ownership (i.e. state ownership) the communications, transport, telephone services, education, healthcare and other basic needs instead of private monopolies, with these services provided freely (or basically subsidized). This sounds flatly totalitarian to people though.

That is, socialism is supposed to be more capable of &quot;scientifically&quot; and rationally allocating labor and resources, more efficient and more productive and so forth. You eliminate a lot of debt overhang and rents being charged by these private monopolists. <br><br>The 20th century communist countries like the USSR was not able to achieve that, though. It was very obvious by the 70s that they were falling behind.

Barter economies naturally designate a commodity as money in order to facilitate trade. Not every thing can be easily traded for everything and as such people will tend to trade their goods for the more tradable goods, this creates a reciprocal effect where more people want the more tradable good which in turn increases its value which makes more people want it etc. and this is also how hyperinflation happens in the reverse, in fact hyperinflation can occur in the absence of inflation and inflation can go on without hyperinflation in theory. I think it was actually keynes who made the insightful remark that hyperinflation is the people revolting against the government, it wouldn&#039;t take much for it to get started either that is why they encourage people to save so much lately. As soon as people no longer save money, as soon as people prefer to stock up on goods rather than wait for their price to go up later the process is already in motion and prices will skyrocket and money loses its value.

The object at which it aims, the reduction or prevention of immense concentrations of wealth, is good; but the method involves the employment of a large number of officials clothed with inquisitorial powers. The temptations to bribery and perjury and all other means of evasion beget a demoralization of opinion and they put a premium upon unscrupulousness and a tax upon conscience. And finally, just in proportion as the tax accomplishes its effect, there is a lessening in the incentive to accumulate wealth, which is one of the strong forces of industrial progress. If the elaborate schemes for regulating everything and finding a place for everyone could be carried out, instead of an intelligent award of duties and earnings, we should have a Roman distribution of Sicilian corn, and the demagogue would soon become the Imperator.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced, possible of realization; but such a state of society cannot be manufactured\u2014it must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine. It can live only by the individual life of its parts. And in the free and natural development of all the parts will be secured the harmony of the whole. All that is necessary to social regeneration is included in the motto of those Russian patriots sometimes called Nihilists\u2014&quot;Land and Liberty!&quot;</span><br>BTFO by Henry George", "filename": "Progress-and-Poverty-cover", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 300, "h": 472, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675994503755835, "time": 1675994503, "md5": "qaZLB2n1BXQBelNyHtO3xw==", "fsize": 31558, "resto": 21636970}, {"no": 21638556, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:05:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21638458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638458</a><br>That isn&#039;t the prime claim of the Fed.

You may personally be able to donate a lot more over your lifetime: assuming you donate $300 per paycheck, two paychecks per month for all twelve months of the year every year for sixty years, you will be able to give $432,000 in monetary contributions to charity over the course of your life. That&#039;s a lot of money, isn&#039;t it! But how much does it really help?<br>Roughly 1260 people are raped per day, or around one every 68 seconds.[2] The average cost of a rape, in numbers alone, is $122,461[3], and even more if we count the legal costs of the state prosecution (but let us ignore this). That means that you contribute, at least, the total cost of three rape victim&#039;s expenses (ignoring the unseen costs) to the good in the world, or 0.3% of the total monetary cost of rape per day, or again roughly 0.0007% of the cost per year in the USA alone.<br>That doesn&#039;t look like much, does it? But it is even worse than that. Every year, roughly 25,000 people are murdered, or 68 per day[4]. If we assume the average value of a human life is 6 million[5], that is 410 million dollars worth of human life lost per day, or 150 billion per year. Quite a lot, huh? Totalling the cost of rape and murder brings the contributions to charity over the course of your entire life to 0.000215% of the monetary costs of the evils of rape and murder every year in America alone. This is an incredibly optimistic number: I do not think a human life is worth merely its economic value, nor do I think the evil of rape is solely the cost of medical and mental health care afterwards. With these numbers now out of the way, it&#039;s time to address the elephant in the room: You cannot possibly hope to bring even a sliver of good into this world through charity alone.

De Morgan, of course, understood the formula in its true sense; he was Boole&#039;s collaborator all along. Herbert Spencer, Jowett, and Robert Leslie Ellis understood, I feel sure; and a few others, but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored [953] the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind; and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact.</span>", "filename": "George_Boole_color", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 800, "tn_w": 93, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675998940371777, "time": 1675998940, "md5": "TPQRShRR+r4VJxbzdBZJRA==", "fsize": 124543, "resto": 21638031}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21638662, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:30:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "What could be considered a worst fate than having your work become catchphrases for normies", "filename": "Uf8y it 7f", "ext": ".png", "w": 720, "h": 779, "tn_w": 231, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675996234272741, "time": 1675996234, "md5": "m7eRoUkRDHcZ/pW2LzZuQA==", "fsize": 273983, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-could-be-considered-a-worst-fate-than-having", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 10, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 7}, {"no": 21638666, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:31:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Rilke<br>Thoreau <br>Whitman <br>Aurelius<br><br>these people will never ever stop spinning in their graves", "time": 1675996293, "resto": 21638662}, {"no": 21638669, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:32:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21638662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638662</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;catchphrases for normies</span><br>truly a death by 1000 cuts as your work is whittled to null", "time": 1675996353, "resto": 21638662}, {"no": 21638710, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:45:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Having your work on wikipedia for midwits to learn about you.", "time": 1675997158, "resto": 21638662}, {"no": 21638719, "now": "02/09/23(Thu)21:49:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21638666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21638666</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whitman</span><br><br>Whitman deserves to be cliched to death.
