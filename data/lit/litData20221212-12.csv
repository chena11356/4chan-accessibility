Gothic is more focused on the past, generally something which there is a degree of knowledge and history about. Weird fiction plays with the unknown to a far greater extent, and likes to do so by tightroping the veil. The Dream Cycle is an exception to this, though, because it penetrates the veil and exhausts the contents of its far side. It still doesn&#039;t deal with the past, and serves as more of a mythopoetical exposition for Lovecraft. The sheer outlandishness maybe a more accurate delineation, because I would still consider the Dream Cycle weird fiction as it would fit no other category. The House on the Borderland was regarded as a proto-weird novel and if you read that alongside anything Poe wrote you&#039;ll see a monumental break. It&#039;s very far-removed from existing themes.

I read A la recherche du temps perdu. That’s my big prize. C’est mon grand prix. I think I’ve read it nine times, now. It’s like a two-month vacation because it takes that long to read Proust. I like it better than going to Palm Beach.”</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; Speaking of Shakespeare, Shelby Foote, in an interview, placed Proust in the top tier of writers he most admired: “Proust has been the man that hung the moon for me. He’s with Shakespeare in my mind, in the sense of having such a various talent. Whenever you read Proust, for the rest of your life, he’s part of you, the way Shakespeare is part of you. I don’t want to exaggerate, but I truly feel that he is the great writer of the 20th century.”</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; Joseph Conrad saw this endless probing as the key to his genius: “Proust’s work . . . is great art based on analysis. I don’t think there is in all creative literature an example of the power of analysis such as this.”</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;All its narrative elements—plot, characters, style—create, as Iris Murdoch said of its effect, “the most intense pleasure which one does take in great art.”</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; Virginia Woolf’s description of her reaction to Proust’s prose: “Proust so titillates my own desire for expression that I can hardly set out the sentence. Oh if I could write like that! I cry. And at the moment such is the astonishing vibration and saturation and intensification that he procures—there’s something sexual in it—that I feel I can write like that, and seize my pen and then I can’t write like that. Scarcely anyone so stimulates the nerves of language in me: it becomes an obsession. But I must return to Swann.”</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; Vladimir Nabokov, who considered it the best novel of its era, described its major themes and effervescent, Mozartean style: “The transmutation of sensation into sentiment, the ebb and tide of memory, waves of emotions such as desire, jealousy, and artistic euphoria—this is the material of this enormous and yet singularly light and translucent work.” In spite of its “enormity” and complexity, Proust’s book has never been out of print and has been translated into well over 40 languages. In Search of Lost Time has not been kept alive by the academy. The work is seldom taught in its entirety in university courses, but maintains its presence among us thanks to readers all over the world who return to it again and again.</span><br><br>https://lithub.com/really-heres-why<wbr>-you-should-read-proust/",94A0C9E2-BD90-4C62-AAE2-27F891DCAE45,.jpg,770,956,201,250,1670789458337767,1670789458,OdYHqHcy5lx3zCrd/hUqKw==,86165,0,,foote-on-proust,1,21,2,16.0,2.0,"[{'no': 21373330, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)23:52:57', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21373325"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21373325</a><br>which is why I never have and never will read Tolstoy', 'time': 1670820777, 'resto': 21371411}, {'no': 21373333, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)23:55:10', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21373330"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21373330</a><br>Or Shakespeare?', 'time': 1670820910, 'resto': 21371411}, {'no': 21373341, 'now': '12/11/22(Sun)23:59:55', 'name': 'Anonymous', 'com': '<a href=""#p21373333"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21373333</a><br>aside from what I read in high school. nabokov likes it?

Elves in the first age were only relevant because noldor were able to build realms greater than any teleri, or moriquendi in general. In fact, Eol is quite proud of being a dark elf compared to the noldor, when the teleri themselves scorn the Avari for being &quot;dark elves&quot;. The telerin identity within beleriand is one of resentfully accepted inferiority towards the noldor, who are clearly technologically, societally, and military more significant than their stunted teleri cousins.<br><br>did tolkien mean for Beleriand to be interpreted through the lens of colonialism? The telerin-noldor relationship, as seen from Eol&#039;s confrontation with Curufin regarding Aredhel, is one of an &quot;enlightened coloniser&quot; patronizing the savage native, and mocking his culture - for Eol wedded Aredhel in the style of the teleri, not the noldor. Furthermore, when Eol and Turgon meet, Eol denounces the authority of the Noldor to reign Beleriand! <br><br>Turgon replies that &quot;by the swords of the Noldor alone are your sunless woods defended. Your freedom to wander there wild you owe to my kin...&quot; The Noldor both threaten and justify with one hand the Teleri; for their &quot;war on angband&quot; was also a Noldor creation! The imposition of Noldor hegemony over the Teleri is naturally unjust. Tolkien, a proud brit, of course portrays the eternal Noldo as upholding not the white mans burden, but the &quot;caliquendi&#039;s burden&quot; of educating, protecting, and spreading his values to lesser elves, while simultaneously extracting resources from their land to fuel his own imperial expansion.<br><br>Personally, I believe Eol was absolutely vindicated. The second and third kinslayings prove his point about the Noldor and their belligerence. You could call the Noldor the jews of Arda in the sense that they seemed to raise the ire of everyone they met, but simultaneously were fated by god to be the greatest minds in the world and run all elven governments. This actually shows remarkable foresight by Tolkien to predict 21st century Judeo-American hegemony, if we assign Noldor as American Empire and Telerin as middle easterners suffering in a &quot;war on terror&quot; between the Noldor and Angband.",owl,.gif,500,650,192,250,1670833668754051,1670833668,WvIaFJ4W5888ksu1oIZYZw==,2086456,0,,these-lands-are-the-lands-of-the-teleri-my-son,1,4,0,,,"[{'no': 21373789, 'now': '12/12/22(Mon)03:51:22', 'name': 'ChatGPT', 'com': '<a href=""#p21373761"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;21373761</a><br>It is difficult to say definitively whether Eol was right or not, as this interpretation of the Teleri and Noldor in Beleriand is one among many possible ways to understand Tolkien&#039;s work. However, it is clear that the relationship between the Teleri and the Noldor is complex and fraught with tensions and conflicts.<br><br>The Teleri, who are also known as the Sindar, are a group of Elves who chose to remain in Middle-earth instead of following the Valar to Valinor. They are known for their love of the sea and their skill in crafting and building. The Noldor, on the other hand, are a group of Elves who left Valinor and returned to Middle-earth to fight against the forces of darkness. They are known for their great skill in magic and their love of knowledge and wisdom.<br><br>In the confrontation between Eol and Curufin, Eol is portrayed as resentful of the Noldor and their superiority. He sees himself as a &quot;dark Elf&quot; who is inferior to the Noldor, and he scorns the Avari, the &quot;dark Elves&quot; who refused to follow the Valar to Valinor. This resentment is also evident in Eol&#039;s marriage to Aredhel, as he chooses to marry her in the style of the Teleri, not the Noldor.<br><br>Turgon&#039;s response to Eol&#039;s denunciation of the Noldor&#039;s right to rule Beleriand is telling. He points out that the Noldor have protected the Teleri and their lands, and that their freedom to wander the woods is due to the Noldor&#039;s intervention. This suggests that the Noldor see themselves as the protectors and benefactors of the Teleri, even as they impose their own values and culture on them.<br><br>It is also worth noting that the Noldor&#039;s war against Angband was not just a war for the Teleri, but also a war for the Noldor themselves. The Noldor were driven by their own desire for revenge against Morgoth, and they were willing to use the Teleri and their lands to further their own goals. This could be seen as an example of the Noldor using their superior might and power to impose their will on the Teleri.<br><br>Overall, it is clear that the relationship between the Teleri and the Noldor is complex and fraught with tensions and conflicts.

I detest these puffs of stale romanticism, coming all the way up from Marlinksy and V. Hugo - you remember the latter’s horrible combination of starkness and hyperbole - l’homme regardait le giblet, le giblet regardait l’homme.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Faulkner’s beloved romanticism and quite impossible biblical rumblings and “starkness” (which is not starkness at all but skeletonized triteness), and all the rest of the bombast seem to me so offensive that I can only explain his popularity in France by the fact that all her own popular writers (Malraux included) of recent years have also had their fling at l’homme marchait, la nuit etait sombre. The book you sent me is one of the tritest and most tedious examples of a trite and tedious genre. The plot and those extravagant “deep” conversations affect me as bad movies do, or the worst plays and stories of Lenid Adreyev, with whom Faulkner has a kind of fatal affinity.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;I imagine that this kind of thing (white trash, velvety Negroes, those bloodhounds out of Uncle Tom’s Cabin melodramas, steadily baying through thousands of swampy books) may be necessary in a social sense, but it is not literature, just as the thousands of stories and novels about downtrodden peasants and fierce ispravniki in Russia, or mystical adventures with the narod (1850-1880), although socially effective and ethically admirable, were not literature. I simply cannot believe that you, with all your knowledge and taste, are not made to squirm by such things as the dialogues between the “positive” characters in Faulkner (and especially those absolutely ghastly italics). Do you not see that despite the difference in landscape, etc., it is essentially Jean Valjean stealing the candlesticks from the good man of God all over again? The villain is definitely Byronic. The book’s pseudo-religious rhythm I simply cannot stand - a phoney gloom which also spoils Mauriac’s work. Has la grace descended upon Faulkner too?

As you can imagine, I winced, then scrolled down a ways and clicked Bartleby&#039;s option. This only to find the poem itself seems advocative in the implied vein. It isn&#039;t that there isn&#039;t any increasing imbalance between work and life - there is, but that the imbalance itself originates out of the debasement of money for the sake of an, ironically, communofascist elite class - ever seeking to abscond with our excess, consolidating the resultant power into an transnational structure over which our like shall have no say, but mere nods of ascent. Regardless, though Gilman&#039;s sentiments do not resonate with me wholly (I am sympathetic to a degree, but only just), I did like it as a poem.

I&#039;ve always appreciated Shakespeare&#039;s brilliance and enjoy him to a degree, but I&#039;ve largely been an advocate out of mere objectivity, rather than an ardent lover. Perhaps it is better said, my becoming a fan has been a process which is still ongoing, and has been since reading my first play of his at 12 or 13. In honor of the snobbish, but interesting anti-Bloom anon who came through, I started rereading Harold Bloom&#039;s &quot;Anxiety of Influence,&quot; 1997 edition with the added preface on Shakespeare and Marlowe, and OH BOY would Bloom have agreed with your wish. I have little doubt he would have had himself cryogenically frozen in order to one day travel back in time to see Shakespeare on the Elizabethan stage had he thought there any chance of it. The man worshiped him - nearly in earnest. It&#039;s people like Bloom and you who keep me returning to The Bard from time to time.

Whoever told you that the received Greek text, the same one that was used to make the KJV, was based on the Latin Vulgate, was repeating a lie. And this is why no concrete example of it has ever been produced, it&#039;s only been claimed.

Marchand essentially argues that modern advertising corporations (which really got going in the late-19th century) ushered in a new era of hyper consumerism in the United States. The most interesting part of the book are the numerous parallels to revival and evangelical religious movements, particularly the eschatological schizobabble that still resonated with Americans after the Civil War, and the western world at large after WWI.<br><br>Essentially, advertising companies saw themselves as herald&#039;s of a new age of prosperity. A place in which a mass-produced branded product could cure every ailment or relieve any displeasure. It was a gospel that hallmarked the growth of urban areas, mass-production, and endless consumer choice. <br><br>But, as Marchand argues, advertisers realized the<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;necessity of associating their selling messages with the values and attitudes already held by their audience </span><br><br>In other words, advertisers don&#039;t want to shape fundamental beliefs, but rather exploit already held beliefs to create a positive association to a product. I think this is an important categorical distinction in methodology when it comes to studying the history of American media. Do all forms of media shape fundamental values and beliefs? Or do they hold a mirror to the culture and reflect it in hopes of giving their audience what they want to see? I think this is a fundamental question in understanding everything about today&#039;s culture and politics.<br><br>Anyway, the chapter names give you a sense of what his arguments are :<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Apostles of Modernity</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Men of the People: The New Professionals</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Keeping the Audience in Focus</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Abandoning the Great Genteel Hope: From Sponsored Radio to the Funny Papers</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The Consumption Ethic: Strategies of Art and Style</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Advertisement as Social Tableaux</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The Great Parables (this is the strongest chapter in the book)</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Visual Cliches: Fantasies and Icons</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Advertising in Overalls: Parables and Visual Cliches in the Depression</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The Therapeutics of Advertising</span><br><br>This book and one by TJ Lears really got me interested in American media history and the philosophy of media.
