Densification is accounted for by the invention of empty interstices therefore, and these are spoken of as if they were actually present, although they have not been demonstrated by physics, despite its claim that it bases itself upon experience and observation. The fact that a bar of iron which is balancing on its fulcrum will lose its equilibrium when it is magnetized, so that the weight of one of its poles will show itself to be greater than that of the other, is an example of the existence of the specification of gravity. One part is so infected here, that it becomes heavier without changing its volume. Consequently the specific gravity of the matter increases, without any augmentation of its mass. Physics attempts to explain density in its own way, by assuming certain propositions, i.e. (1) That given an equal number of material parts of equal size, there will be no difference in weight. From this it follows (2) that it is the measure of the number of parts which determines the weight. It also determines the space, so that (3) two entities of equal weight also fill the same amount of space. Consequently, (4) when two entities of equal weight have different volumes the amount of space they occupy as materials is the same, and their difference is assumed to be the result of their pores. The first three propositions make it necessary to postulate the pores in the fourth. These propositions are not based upon experience however, they are based merely upon the understanding and its proposition of identity. They are therefore formal apriori inventions, as the pores are. Kant has already opposed intensity to the quantitative determination of amount, and posited a constant number of parts with a higher propensity for filling space, instead of more parts in an equal volume. In this way he has initiated a so-called dynamic physics. The determination of intensive quantum would be just as valid as that of extensive quantum, although the popular conception of density mentioned above has confined itself to the latter category. In this instance however, the determination of intensive magnitude has the advantage of implying measure, and above all of indicating a being-in-self which in its Notional determination is immanent determinateness of form, and which only appears, by means of comparison, as a general quantum. Dynamic physics gets no further than regarding these differences as extensive or intensive, and so fails to express any reality (\u00a7 103 Rem.).</span>", "time": 1669037327, "resto": 21281538}, {"no": 21284601, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)08:35:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21284401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21284401</a><br>Yes, going in the ISS makes you weightless.

He is often called England&#039;s national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.

William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world&#039;s pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare&#039;s writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world\u2019s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.</span>", "filename": "William Shakespeare", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2220, "h": 1248, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1669029018642775, "time": 1669029018, "md5": "kwq3VFue65p0SA/J6odwCQ==", "fsize": 243362, "resto": 21284267}, {"no": 21284385, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)06:57:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21284267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21284267</a><br>Went back and read back through to Nov. 9th in your series (the earliest date present in the on-site archives right now).

It\u2019s awful and bad and no one should read it. But it fills in a piece of the puzzle for me. Before I\u2019ve talked about how areas of American online culture, as in Hong Kong, express their sadness for a \u201cfuture of the past\u201d of eighties/nineties certainty that they didn\u2019t grow up in through a hip kind of nihilism, and about how the ultimate expression of fascism is an irrational desire for glory, which we can see in the erratic actions of the American government today towards both foreign powers and its own people. These two trends dovetail into one another, the disaffected remnants of the 4chan generation with no memory of the past and the older and more irrational of those who remember the actual eighties and want them back. QAnon, after all, started in Chan culture and now is becoming mainstream Republican thinking. What about this book? The Bear and the Dragon was published in 2000 \u2013 2000, as everyone knows, was the last normal year of American history.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s often said that the fascist tendency in American politics welcomed the War On Terror \u2013 and I believe it did, insofar as it was a chance to massively extend the militarisation of US society and to fight a gleefully evil foe in Islamic extremism. But the fight America was gearing up for, even if in the innocent nineties they didn\u2019t know it, was this fight here, with the dragon, the bad guy of the last arc (the bear) now on their side and everyone else with them in this battle against a revitalised China, the cold and backwards culture of the east \u2013 the brutal Oriental \u2013 in its final form. The Bear and the Dragon is the American dream. Not the dream of most Americans \u2013 but the dream of the people in charge right now for sure, and it would be dishonest to say that it isn\u2019t rooted in a lot of aspects of American culture. The strong, principled individual Jack Ryan makes his stand against the evils of the world, cleaving through domestic problems (there\u2019s a great/terrible scene where he bans abortion or something) and foreign policy alike, he and his cadre of CIA graduates and former businessmen takin\u2019 no shit, kickin\u2019 ass, makin\u2019 the Dems and the pansy Europeans fall in line and drinkin\u2019 hard with the Russians and finally chasin\u2019 out the Bad Evil Chinese and makin\u2019 sweet love ole\u2019 USA-style to the good ones.</span><br>https://lateralthinkingtechnology.w<wbr>ordpress.com/2020/07/27/the-bear-an<wbr>d-the-dragon-a-review-or-on-the-hor<wbr>niness-of-white-americans-for-chine<wbr>se-babes-and-justified-wars/", "filename": "Fh9Wdo6WQAMmZlA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 450, "h": 368, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1669019211783257, "time": 1669019211, "md5": "52T+Ki+EoMzrvgQERnopfQ==", "fsize": 27865, "resto": 21283191}, {"no": 21284245, "now": "11/21/22(Mon)06:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21283191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21283191</a><br>His early books are all great.

Rainbow Six, released between the last two, was at least enjoyable in a big dumb action movie way though. 9/11 basically broke him (along with a messy divorce apparently) and pretty much everything he wrote after that is even worse. Red Rabbit is a jumbled mess and Teeth of The Tiger is laughably bad but it (almost) loops back around into &quot;so bad it&#039;s good&quot; territory.

This link also:<br><br>https://www.nateliason.com/blog/mul<wbr>tiple-orgasms-men<br><br>That gives a simple step-by-step program but the gist is just to develop some orgasmic awareness. Try to feel your nut as it develops, and recognize the moment you start to cum. Once you learn to recognize that moment, you can learn to notice it earlier and delay it. Biggest advice I would give is, when you start to feel yourself cum, do a quick &quot;tension inventory&quot; in your body and literally just do a deep breathe and feel those spots relax. The link above goes into this, but the benefit of developing this orgasm awareness is you&#039;ll be able to have much better orgasms, that last longer and reach parts of your body you didn&#039;t know could feel orgasms.<br><br>On the porn problem, I know it&#039;s not always as easy as &quot;just quit porn,&quot; but I found it helpful to replace high-intensity video porn with something a little slower, that is easier to turn away from when it&#039;s time for my imagination to take over. Think of masturbation as a workout for your imagination, some time for you to explore the parts of your mind that make your dick hard. Cooming to videos of women being degraded can put you in a really fucked up place mentally. Try to get your hands on a piece of pornography that holds up artistically and think of it as a kind of partner, something that gets your motor revving if your imagination gets tired.

I&#039;m mid-twenties in the work force. The past few years while I was in school I happened to get a job at a funeral home thanks to family connection, it was great pay and the staff was great or I wouldn&#039;t have done it. Mainly running errands, picking up paperwork, delivering flowers, going to the grave site pre ceremony to confirm everything was good that sort of thing. <br>Anyways that put me in the position of constantly encountering funerals, the family and loved ones having to deal with tragic deaths to almost welcomed ones (when they&#039;ve been painfully sick for a long time). This culminated in working a funeral for a boy my age who was my contemporary who had died of a brain tumor. Seeing his family around his open casket saying their last goodbyes had a switch in me flip some kind of direction.<br>At same time I was living with my grandfather in his final year of life, watching him slowly decline to the in inevitable end. My uncle also approached death&#039;s door and my father had a sudden near-death health scare. All of this occurring alongside the &quot;Big Cough&quot; pandemic that had everyone looking at their health.<br>What I&#039;m getting at is I&#039;m a young, in-shape healthy guy and I feel like I&#039;ve spent these past few years too close to the &quot;Realm of Death&quot;. I constantly think about death from the perspective of my own decay. Obsessed with thinking about the fact that I could have a heart attack or aneurysm and die on the spot. It&#039;s like the real fragility of life entered my worldview and mental space like a freight train and I don&#039;t know what to do with it. I&#039;m wondering if any of you have any book suggestions for this feeling, maybe if I could read about a protagonist who deals with the same thing or a similar issue I could help work myself through it. I already read Death of Ivan Ilych on my grandfather&#039;s suggestion. He said he read it as a young man and it suddenly hit him in his infirm state that he was Ivan Ilych. <br><br>Want this to focus around literature whose major themes and motifs are death and decay.
