John gave me only his first name and informed me that I was the first to be told what he was about to tell me. He said he was &quot;gender dysphoric&quot; and that he was &quot;desperate.&quot; Feelings that were once &quot;controllable through sheer force of will,&quot; had increased to where he now was having protracted periods where he would close his office door, lie on the floor and weep quietly while curled up in the fetal position, holding his genitals in pain. Other than intrusive and repeated fantasies of being female, he had refused to allow himself any overt form of female gender expression. He reported feeling that if he was to cross-dress and be caught, he would dishonor his wife and family. Having attained international recognition for his work, he was also concerned about his professional reputation.

But they don&#039;t have the character of ultimacy. They can be metaphysically grounding from the perspective of beings subordinate to them and reliant on them, but if they aren&#039;t causa sui (cause of themselves), they don&#039;t stop the causal regress and explain reality.

To do that you need to posit something that transcends finite being in such a way that it itself is not even a being (because it is logically of the nature of being to be determined in some way), which is paradoxical from the perspective of discursive knowledge and, possibly, even of angelic knowledge. Hence God is in a sense paradoxical and miraculous, a mystery in the full and classical sense of the term, and can only be accessed through His miraculous (and discursively equally inexplicable) choice to reveal Himself, to intervene in history in the form of Christ, etc. The only way to describe such a being is through negative theology, which was established in the Christian tradition by Pseudo-Dionysius using Neoplatonic categories, but ultimately going back to Philo Iudaeus and the Alexandrian school&#039;s approach to reconciling the mysteries of scripture with reason. <br><br>Just like in Aquinas&#039; philosophy, ancient Greek reason basically burned itself out in its attempt at self-grounding, it had fizzled out in mutually contradictory but mutually overlapping and totally unsatisfying metaphysical schemes like the Stoics&#039;.", "time": 1673045072, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21489608, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)17:47:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489590</a><br>But <br>1.

Because Aquinas is in the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, both of which take the highest goodness to be a self-evident quality of the highest being (the most actual, most real thing is also the best thing), partly as a means of explaining why things change and attain structure at all (because it is &quot;better&quot; to have structure and tend toward &quot;perfection&quot;), needs God to satisfy the logical criterion of being the highest good, basically Plato&#039;s True, Good, and Beautiful. If you deny the ontological reality of good (and thus of the better being higher than the worse), you are burdened with explaining why a cold indifferent highest principle would do anything at all, why chaos doesn&#039;t reign instead of order, etc. A purely material first principle is just as paradoxical as a miraculously and transcendently good first principle, if not more. <br><br>If you&#039;re asking why Aquinas thinks we should believe in the Christian God of the Christian scriptures in particular, that doesn&#039;t come from rational deductions but from faith (pistis), which itself can be rationally justified as a necessary aspect of the fully actualized human being in Aquinas&#039; view. But ultimately only the act of faith itself can reveal the supra-rational truth of Christian scripture. Ultimately Aquinas can&#039;t do much to convince a committed Muslim or Jew that Christianity is the right one and not his. Conviction about such matters takes place at a different level, including the presence of the Holy Spirit in one through grace and faith, esoteric symbology directly revealing the mystical truth of the Trinity to contemplatives, mystical union with God, etc.", "time": 1673050916, "resto": 21489472}, {"no": 21490000, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)19:33:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21489969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21489969</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Said reality would have the same question as to its ultimacy, its own cause</span><br>You can&#039;t possibly know this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But ultimately only the act of faith itself can reveal the supra-rational truth of Christian scripture</span><br>This is why guys like Aquinas annoy me.

Logic can at least establish the limits of what is thinkable tautologically: If we assume that reality is not an infinite regress, but must have an ultimate stopping point, then the one thing we DO know about whatever being is at the end of the chain is that it is at the end of the chain. We can make similar deductions about any contingent being: If we establish that all contingency is &quot;creaturely,&quot; then by definition any contingent being (a giant or a simulation for example) must be creaturely. <br><br>The few things we can say about God logically are that he must be there to terminate the regress (if this premise is accepted, and most people do accept it to some degree or another), and that his being must be of a kind that is beyond the being to which we are accustomed, since the being to which we are accustomed is caused, determined being, and we are looking for an entity that could explain all of it, not just another example of it. <br><br>Of course you could say this is all just our &quot;local&quot; logic, and higher realities could have different logics. This is basically the Kantian position, namely, that one can&#039;t attribute the concepts in one&#039;s mind to reality itself, or see them as reflections or microcosmic versions of reality&#039;s or God&#039;s own reasoning, like the medieval scholastics and the Cartesians (including Spinoza and Leibniz) did. But this opens up a whole host of paradoxes too, and eventually dissolves into complete solipsism if pushed far enough. That&#039;s why Kant&#039;s successors tried to find a way to argue from certain principles (like that our reason, being part of reality, must in some way reflect and participate in reality) to break out of the soap bubble Kant trapped us in, and back out into some kind of metaphysical realism.

It took the genius of Aquinas to argue that Aristotle\u2019s God is implicitly a God of providence and love. Aquinas reasons that God is self-subsisting existence, ipse esse subsistens. From this he deduces other properties which must belong to God. Aquinas notes that ipse esse subsistens, and actus purus and prime mover are metaphysical names of God and are applicable to one and the same substance. Thomas proves the infinitude and perfection of God from the notion of self-subsistence. God\u2019s eternity is proved from the same notion and also by way of immutability, which is proved by God\u2019s being simple, infinite, and actus purus, pure actuality: there can be no change or movement in God since there are no unactualized potentialities in him.

Not only have Jews adapted better than many other groups to living in the modern world, they have become the premiere symbol and standard of modern life everywhere.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Slezkine argues that the Jews were, in effect, among the world&#039;s first free agents. They traditionally belonged to a social and anthropological category known as &quot;service nomads,&quot; an outsider group specializing in the delivery of goods and services. Their role, Slezkine argues, was part of a broader division of human labor between what he calls Mercurians-entrepreneurial minorities--and Apollonians--food-producing majorities.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since the dawning of the Modern Age, Mercurians have taken center stage. In fact, Slezkine argues, modernity is all about Apollonians becoming Mercurians--urban, mobile, literate, articulate, intellectually intricate, physically fastidious, and occupationally flexible. Since no group has been more adept at Mercurianism than the Jews, he contends, these exemplary ancients are now model moderns.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The book concentrates on the drama of the Russian Jews, including migrants and their offspring in America, Palestine, and the Soviet Union. But Slezkine has as much to say about the many faces of modernity--nationalism, socialism, capitalism, and liberalism--as he does about Jewry.

It must certainly have some extraordinary usefulness!\u201d But looking up, he saw that the smaller limbs were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters, and looking down, he saw that the trunk was pitted and rotten and could not be used for coffins. He licked one of the leaves, and it blistered his mouth and made it sore. He sniffed the odor, and it was enough to make a man drunk for three days. \u201cIt turns out to be a completely unusable tree,\u201d said Ziqi, \u201cand so it has been able to grow this big. Aha!\u2014it is this unusableness that the Holy Man makes use of!\u201d The region of Jingshi in Song is fine for growing catalpas, cypresses, and mulberries. But those that are more than one or two arm lengths around are cut down for people who want monkey perches; those that are three or four spans around are cut down for the ridgepoles of tall roofs; and those that are seven or eight spans are cut down for the families of nobles or rich merchants who want side boards for coffins. So they never get to live out the years Heaven gave them but are cut down in midjourney by axes. This is the danger of being usable. In the Jie sacrifice, oxen with white foreheads, pigs with turned-up snouts, and men with piles cannot be offered to the river. This is something all the shamans know, and hence they consider them inauspicious creatures. But the Holy Man, for the same reason, considers them highly auspicious.</span>", "time": 1673063125, "resto": 21490174}, {"no": 21490711, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:49:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com":

I think the way people use the word \u201cdeep\u201d could either be to mean \u201cthis is a multilayered work with multiple layers of meaning\u201d, so a metaphorical sort of \u201cdepth\u201d that the observant/intelligent/educated person can penetrate, but there is also the possibility that when people use the word \u201cdeep\u201d they are saying \u201cthis work cuts deep\u201d or \u201cit left a deep impression on me\u201d, which is a slightly more feminine use of the word, suggesting the work itself penetrated the observer. In some ways this is literally true: light goes in the eye holes, music goes in the ear holes, abstract concepts go in the abstract concept hole, and consuming literally anything in any medium, even just living, has a feminine element, and one way or another something will \u201cget to one\u201d deeply: whether its that a piece of literature or media profoundly effects you because you received it at the right time, your friend died in a car crash, or you experience the joy of holding your first child. Idk man, in the biosemiotic sense I can understand what people mean when they say experiences are deep or deeply effecting: in the sense that the experience itself penetrates the soul of the observer.<br>And I do think ideas, themes, and messages can be encoded in a work, that need to be decoded through reference to external ideas or through cross referencing symbols in the work itself.<br><br>With all that said, the only level of depth I get out of Evangelion is that it\u2019s a critique of the audience at the time: Evangelion critiques otakus, and the rebuilds critique anyone still watching Evangelion.<br>But even then, I don\u2019t think the \u201cEvangelion critiques otakus\u201d idea is really present in the original show at all, as much as it\u2019s something arising out of Anno making up the show as he went along, and then solidifying the idea in EoE where he directly makes fun of the audience (Shinji masturbating, showing death threats written to him, etc.).<br>The actual show has very little going on \u201cwithin the text itself\u201d so to speak. People bring so much into it, projecting their own philosophies and psychology reads into it all, but what\u2019s actually there is about as complex as your average anime at the time. Indeed: even less complex and \u201cdeep\u201d than anime classics that remain fortunately out of reach of normalfags with no real knowledge of the genre.<br><br>I could understand it much more if people said \u201cEvangelion affected me deeply\u201d, because despite not being layered, at all really, it does \u201ccut deep\u201d in terms of being very well produced: it does \u201cmake an impression\u201d with the above average showmanship on display.<br><br>And I\u2019ll assert again that \u201cexcavation site\u201d \u201cdepth\u201d can exist.", "time": 1673063121, "resto": 21487879}, {"no": 21490699, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:47:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No man is worth the aggravation", "time": 1673063225, "resto": 21487879}, {"no": 21490744, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)22:57:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21488109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21488109</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;afromentioned is a great Joycean pun.</span>", "time": 1673063879, "resto": 21487879}, {"no": 21490782, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)23:08:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21490685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21490685</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I could understand it much more if people said \u201cEvangelion affected me deeply\u201d, because despite not being layered, at all really, it does \u201ccut deep\u201d in terms of being very well produced: it does \u201cmake an impression\u201d with the above average showmanship on display.</span><br><br>I agree with this<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And I\u2019ll assert again that \u201cexcavation site\u201d \u201cdepth\u201d can exist.</span><br>I think you could be right, but I believe that most people don&#039;t properly understand &quot;excavation site&quot; depth.

Case in point, Tolstoy&#039;s late authorship, which, in an attempt to become simple moralizing fables for illiterate peasants, as was the requirement for Tolstoy&#039;s philosophy of aeshtetics, became excruciatingly boring, and lost the brilliance that it had had before. The regeneration of morals led to the degeneration of the aesthetics. The exact opposite you find in something like the early Hamsun (who, hilariously in Mysteries, had Nagel say that (roughly translated) he was tired of Tolstoy&#039;s dirty, self-righteous and holy drool), where you see a complete disregard for common mores leading to that much greater aesthetic worth.", "time": 1673014529, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21487633, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)10:14:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21487461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21487461</a><br>Sin is not fun, contrary to popular opinion", "time": 1673018054, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21487740, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)10:53:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486955</a><br>wanna kms <br><br>these threads are shit too btw", "time": 1673020419, "resto": 21486955}, {"no": 21487745, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)10:55:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21487633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21487633</a><br>Here&#039;s a tip to all the missionaries and moralfags: if you want to actually spread the word and have an effect, you have to stop being so boring and insufferable.

For example, one can think of 4chan. According to the Central limit Theorem, any sufficiently complex variable can be modeled with a normal distribution. So the propensity to use 4chan, which is obviously a complex variable involving upbringing, sex, etc., can be described with such a graph. If we can assume that actually using 4chan involves a sort of high-pass filter, so that one must have a certain propensity for 4chan to even consider using it, then there&#039;s a set of shared characteristics whose aggregate describes the average 4chan user. Of course, it&#039;s not one particular trait, but some combination of anti-sociality, racism, intelligence, and misogyny which creates the average 4chan poster.

He passed her and wished her a good evening and then he stopped and asked if she was all right and she said that she was. She said that she was going to visit her daughter and he nodded and went on. He knew that he still hoped for that small and half forgotten figure to fall in beside him. Leaning into the salt wind with his hands in his pockets and his clothes flapping. He\u2019d seen him one final time in a dream. God\u2019s own mudlark trudging cloaked and muttering the barren selvage of some nameless desolation where the cold sidereal sea breaks and seethes and the storms howl in from out of that black and heaving alcahest. Trudging the shingles of the universe, his thin shoulders turned to the stellar winds and the suck of alien moons dark as stones. A lonely shoreloper hurrying against the night, small and friendless and brave.<br><br>He climbed into the loft and sat at the tower window wrapped in his blanket. Spits of rain on the sill. Summer lightning far out to sea. Like the flare of distant fieldpieces. The patter on the tarp he\u2019d stretched over his bed. He turned up the wick of the lamp at his elbow and took the notebook from its box and opened it. Then he stopped. He sat for a long time.

In the cool metallic waters the hammered shapes of great fishes. The reflection in the swells of a molten bolide trundling across the firmament like a burning train.<br><br>He bent over his grammar in the light of the oil lamp. The straw roof hissing in the bellshaped dark above him and his shadow on the roughtroweled wall. Like those scholars of old in their cold stone rooms toiling at their scrolls. The lenses of their lamps that were made of tortoiseshell boiled and scraped and formed in a press and the fortuitous geographies they cast upon the tower walls of lands unknown alike to men or to their gods.<br><br>Finally he leaned and cupped his hand to the glass chimney and blew out the lamp and lay back in the dark.

The Transhumanist faction were simply better at fighting, but they had the critical weakness of requiring a ton of infrastructure in order to function. Silicon, aluminum, lithium, advanced chip manufacturing, these things all have really long supply chains that span multiple continents. So the Bio-Purists, realizing that in direct fighting they would lose, simply started blowing these things up and sabotaging the system. Some guy whose 12% remaining flesh is plugged into a flying death robot can kill a hundred Bios if he finds them--but he can&#039;t do shit if there&#039;s no electricity to recharge his battery, no replacement parts on hand, and the Swedish-produced immunosuppressants he relies on are at the bottom of the ocean because some guys in a speedboat suicide bombed the tanker transporting them across the Atlantic.<br><br>So things turn very asymmetrical, with the remaining Cogs desperately trying to cobble together enough of a functional supply system to avoid being wiped out, and the Bios systematically destroying everything that would make it possible. The story followed a joint-consciousness that is dispassionately (at first) trying to work out how this can be fixed, and slowly realizing that the Bios had argued that the entire transhumanist cause was inherently suicidal specifically because it relied on technology which in turn relied on a fragile ecosystem of production and industry and resources that was inherently unsustainable--and that once you go Cog you can&#039;t go back. This entire event wasn&#039;t so much a war as an illustration that they were right.<br><br>Near the end Pyrrhus (the Gestalt Consciousness) decides that though the Bios were idiots, they had actually intuited correctly that society was not and may not ever be ready for this, and self-destructs to spare itself the Hell-Program tortures that the renegades always used on captives.<br><br>And then I lost the fucking draft.

That&#039;s why i said the issue with Qutb isn&#039;t form, but content.

Freud called oceanic feelings those that make it seem like there&#039;s something infinitely bigger than yourself that still somehow makes you feel comfortable. I was just sitting on a rock one day, trees surrounding me and I looked at them. They look like they connect the earth and the sky, their bark houses insects, fungi and other lil critters. To the bugs the tree seems like their whole world, who knows how they perceive it with their little bug senses. To me the tree is just something that&#039;s there, something that i can&#039;t walk through and i have to walk around, something under which i can hide from light rain and so on. To birds it is a place where they can perch, sleep, hunt for bugs and build their nests. It seems like every living being is intentionally (intention as in phenomenology) directed towards things in its environment. Consciousness cannot exist without intentionality, as any consciousness is necessarily a consciousness of something, e. g. consciousness of my surroundings, consc of my body and so on. What if everything that is intentionally directed towards its environment is conscious to some degree? That would make consciousness be one of the few constants in the universe. All I can think of are times when I am conscious. They say death is like eternal sleep, but i only remember when i&#039;m awake or when i dream. Even after my body deteriorates to a degree to which it cannot keep fueling the fire of my soul, it will just spark and catch fire in a different being. To that being it will seem like there was nothing before it and like there won&#039;t be anything after it, just like it does to me now. Individuality is just an illusion, it&#039;s just a product of the differentiation of oneself from one&#039;s environment, from the things one has a feeling of and the things one has a feeling for.

But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.

Attendance figures are down by double-digit percentages across the board, around a third of eligible young men are serving missions, and a third of those are coming home early. Couple that with the ease with which anyone can access information that the church would rather bury, like the &#039;secret&#039; handbooks for bishops, recordings of &#039;sacred&#039; ceremonies, finance figures for Ensign Peak Holdings, et cetera, and I&#039;d wager that the church will fall into irrelevance in a few short decades, if not sooner. <br>I have complicated feelings about the impending Mormon Apocalypse. Personally, I feel disgusted with the church and somewhat dirtied by my having been brought up in it. I had no concept of the metaphysics or philosophy underlying Christianity until I moved out, because I was brought up to believe that the early Church was corrupted by &quot;Greek pagan thought&quot; during the great apostasy, blindly accepted crypto-Gnostic and blatantly Masonic rituals and worldviews despite knowing exactly where they were cribbed from because I thought such things were examples of the beginning of the &quot;restoration,&quot; and came up with elaborate copes for why evidence of a Jewish-descended civilization across the Americas did not exist. As a Trinitarian Christian now, I feel like I received a safari tour through every heresy ever devised.<br>I&#039;m also angered by the thought that my family bought into this ridiculous system, both figuratively and literally, for generations, and so did the families of hundreds of wonderful people I met while I was a believing member. On a similar scale as Scientology, the LDS church uses its tithing funds to purchase large investment properties and generate wealth, which it dispenses to its top-level executives in the form of compensation, condominiums, paid trips, and so on, while remaining completely opaque about where its money is going and refusing to provide aid to members in need unless they meet certain conditions and exhaust all other options. Furthermore, for decades members were discouraged from holding savings that they could give as tithes instead - my own parents have as much saved from 30 years of professional white-collar work as I do from 4 years in the military. <br>At the same time, I know that the collapse of the system will shunt the remaining untouched Mormon youth into the maw of the secular-liberal amoral world order. I left because I wanted to know the truth about God more than I wanted to remain in the comfortable Mormon community, but most who leave do so out of anger at the lies they&#039;ve been fed and so resolve to never enter another organized religion again. It&#039;s hard to blame them, and I expect that as membership rates and participation rates erode almost all who remain will do so as well. In the end only a few will be left - the general authorities, the hedge fund mangers, and a few true believers, alone among the ruins of their cult.", "time": 1673032278, "resto": 21485603}, {"no": 21488595, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)14:18:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I hate my sister.

I think your point, re: misology, has something plausible to it, but I think it falls short to this extent:<br><br>1) The philosopher is the one who experiences insight (whatever one wants to call it) into the Idea of the Good.<br><br>2) The non-philosopher does not experience insight into the Good, and, we&#039;ll suppose, is subject to becoming a misologist.<br><br>3) But every regime that isn&#039;t the philosopher-ruled kallipolis is ruled by non-philosophers, presumably subject to misology.<br><br>4) But three of the defective regimes, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, are all better than tyranny.<br><br>5) Therefore it cannot be that the Good is necessarily introduced to ward off tyrannic misology per se.<br><br>(And it would be perhaps paradoxical; the mystical reading of Plato veers very close to misology in emphasizing and unspeakable and therefore irrational principle. I&#039;m not saying that as a judgement, mind, just a paradoxical feature, maybe akin to, to be on topic, Plotinus&#039; disavowal of matter while refusing to go as far as the gnostics in calling it simply evil.)<br><br>Re: mathematics, that seems to be what Socrates suggests, but it&#039;s never spelled out how (and he, after all, refuses to share his own opinion about the Good with Glaucon). One could imagine in a general way how the two might be related, but it&#039;s much harder to say how with precision.

I suspect one has to ask what the sake of the kallipolis is for, and initially it seems to be twofold: 1) a model or paradigm through which we understand what Justice is in order to answer Glaucon&#039;s demand to Socrates to show that practicing justice provides the practitioner with some kind of good or well-being, and 2) as the simply good example of just and good political life, even if improbable to ever practically found. Once the philosopher is discovered to be the most suitable for ruling the city, attention is paid to how to rear such a specimen. But this raises the question: why do we need the philosopher to rule? To keep the city Just (and good). But why do we need the city? And it might be that the best or simply good product of the city is the philosopher it produces. Why should the philosopher be the best product of the city? Because the philosopher is the only citizen of the kallipolis who strives to know the Whole, and not just a part apart from the Whole. That is, there seems to be a kind of long argument about why political life is flawed but good, because the philosopher can only come about through the recognition of the errors of the city (= the cave). Somehow, the imperfect and flawed is the condition upon which something better can come about. (To use a, forgive me, Hegelian way of looking at it, the philosopher, as a human animal produced by nature, is that part of nature who, in inquiring into nature, brings about nature coming to know itself.)<br><br>Re: math, I imagine it has to be some argument akin to that.

Also a complex system of alliances and satrapies, that was threatened by rebellion whenever the centre lost control, see the Egyptian Revolt in Thucydides.<br>Once we get to a point where technology is a effective force multiplier the weak can no longer oppose the strong on their own, and the powers who can effectively oppose the actions of another come from further afield. I don&#039;t think that this undermines Thucydides&#039; argument in the Dialogue though. <br>Could the Ionians have organised themselves and effectively fought off the Athenians on their own? Unlikely, given the difficulty of organising and fighting the simultaneous revolt that would have threatened Athens hegemony. In Thucydides he makes it clear that the isolated rebellions against Athens&#039; League/Empire were no threat to its power.<br>But Athens&#039; imperialism was still opposed by rival powers, particularly Sparta and Persia. The Africans weren&#039;t going to be able to make a serious defense of themselves against European Colonialism (which, just like the Roman&#039;s still required the cooperation and compliance of existing local elites), but the Great Powers of Europe were constantly treating and compromising between each other. None of them, even the British Empire, was able to enforce its will with impunity. So instead of these nations running roughshod over the continent and the strongest grabbing what they can, you have the Berlin Conference. <br>Russia and China couldn&#039;t spread Communism and can&#039;t even take back what they claim is their own territory. <br>America between 1991 and 2014 is probably the closest the world has ever come to an undisputed hegemon, able to enforce its will in the Balkans, the Gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan (for a while at least). I don&#039;t think it has the same power today for several reasons; war weariness and dysfunctional government, the Western World&#039;s loss of unity, rising anti-American sentiment, the slow rise of powers like China. <br>Ultimately technology Thucydides wouldn&#039;t have dreamed off have made possible for one power to fight the rest of the world more effectively, but I don&#039;t believe we&#039;re at the point, or ever will be, where one nation holds such an insurmountable superiority over their subjects and rivals that they can act as the Athenians did in the Melian Dialogue. The purpose of the Dialogue is to show that the Athenian&#039;s hubris had reached the point that they believed they were invincible and that they could simply take what they wanted and do as they wished- a sentiment that Thucydides had forshadowed as early as the speech of the Spartan Tribune at the very beginning of the War.

But I had had all my life to watch him in, since apparently and for what reason Heaven has not seen fit to divulge, my life was destined to end on an afternoon in April forty-three years ago, since anyone who even had as little to call living as I had had up to that time would not call what I have had since living.", "time": 1673002962, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21486933, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:06:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The reality is, is\u2026</span>", "filename": "5A6112A7-1B4A-4204-8E84-D3074E26E187", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 771, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 120, "tim": 1673003160070044, "time": 1673003160, "md5": "PgVZcDvGgO0YcPGq/8JnMQ==", "fsize": 96272, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21486992, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:33:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486357</a><br>You know what you need to do, anon", "time": 1673004780, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487003, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:39:30", "name": "Anonymou\u1e61", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486933</a><br>All nature is but art, unknown to thee;<br>All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;<br>All discord, harmony not understood;<br>All partial evil, universal good:<br>And, spite of pride in erring reason\u2019s spite,<br>One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.<br><br>\u2014 Pope, Essay On Man", "filename": "Pepe von Goethe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 512, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673005170167502, "time": 1673005170, "md5": "aohTcpsuYVm1xCQioeUmZw==", "fsize": 32482, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487011, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:41:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486350</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;snape snapped</span>", "filename": "3567545", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 400, "h": 400, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673005285490739, "time": 1673005285, "md5": "y4SQy7Tyl3hk9bsSze5U4A==", "fsize": 23899, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487908, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)11:35:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486353</a><br>Is Slabhead really retarded?<br>CAPTCHA: P0MMY", "time": 1673022908, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487952, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)11:44:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;...one you figure out that, that will really help.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;...so you need to figure out which is which, which is the hard part.&quot;</span><br><br>These are fine spoken, but you can virtually always avoid having the same word repeated in writing while also improving the writing.", "time": 1673023477, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487960, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)11:46:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486933</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the reality is is that that</span>", "filename": "1665722560813737", "ext": ".gif", "w": 400, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1673023592525188, "time": 1673023592, "md5": "EZzWTLbS+lgrIllAe6TryA==", "fsize": 946482, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21487982, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)11:50:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486350</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will Will</span>", "filename": "74177301-89F1-4961-99BC-43F6D78CFD70", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 226, "h": 192, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 106, "tim": 1673023849086678, "time": 1673023849, "md5": "S843wF638u6bm5GR87zSYQ==", "fsize": 14133, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21488079, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)12:17:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Will have had having had having trying to have had the will to have had enough will to have had the will.", "time": 1673025470, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21488855, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:19:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486350</a><br>Meanwhile in Sweden:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00c4r det det det \u00e4r?</span>", "time": 1673036340, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21488946, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:43:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;you</span>", "filename": "Dee_DuH", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1024, "h": 953, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 116, "tim": 1673037811580498, "time": 1673037811, "md5": "8wUTFMI6aAGh573CB5QfJw==", "fsize": 153876, "resto": 21486350}, {"no": 21488961, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)15:45:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21486350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21486350</a><br>I had had a great gilfing milf once!

I remember going straight to the bar, getting a double vodka red bull, and immediately heading for the dance floor. <br><br>The dance floor had about 15-20 people on it, a lot of them women. There was one curvy, big titted blonde that caught my attention immediately. She also noticed me and we danced alone, in different locations, while making infrequent eye contact. I danced around with a few different women, but my attention and thoughts were on the big titted blonde. Eventually, we made it close to each other and started dancing. At the same time, some other guy, much older than me and Arab looking, was also trying to ween his way in with her.<br><br>Unluckily for him, she chose me and we ended up dancing (modern dancing, not really dancing). We grinded, we kissed, and we talked about something, but I can&#039;t remember what. It was impossible to hear anyone due to the loud music. She then dragged me outside for a cigarette. I did not see any of my friend after this. Before we even finished smoking it, she dragged me to her apartment. I do mean quite literally dragged, she took me by the hand and started walking me to her apartment. Which was nearby.

She was very loud and at times, my thoughts wondered to the guy in the room next door. For a few moments, I felt awkward knowing he was listening. I was so dehydrated at this point that my back was cramping up as I was fucking her, but I didn&#039;t want to disappoint so I continued. Eventually we had to stop because she was in too much pain. We ended up falling asleep.<br><br>In the morning, her demeanour had changed. I sensed regret and embarrassment. We had a smoke. During the smoke, she told me she had a boyfriend and she showed me the pictures of them together near the bedside table. I had missed them during the night because it was dark. They were in some tropical location. On holiday most likely. She told me we can&#039;t see each other again and that she only did it because &quot;he was not treating her right&quot;. I felt bad for the guy, but I didn&#039;t feel bad about not seeing her again. It was a fun night. She let me out of her apartment and we said good bye. Then I realised I had lost my wallet.
