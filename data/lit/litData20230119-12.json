Most people only see others as a reprieve from loneliness and any ability to dive deep into their own thoughts which can make them better people and form better connections with others rather than actual people. You can see it in the meaninglessness in most conversations: nothing is learnt, nothing about anyone&#039;s life philosophy or experiences are really discussed nor are there any sort of deep conversations about preferences that reveal a deeper aspect of that person. It&#039;s just bland chit chat with fake smiles and agreeableness. If that&#039;s what it takes to fit in, I&#039;d rather not deal with that unless I am getting paid or I am learning something.

Both are trivial but the latter has more inherent meaning in it than expressing some preference and then not going into &quot;Why&quot; that matters. Sometimes being too deep is too mich work or it is basically impossible and that&#039;s fine.

The modern version of the procedure is outright mutilation with the complete excision of a highly complex and innervated structure that not only protects the penis from desensitisation and the elements but also facilitates intercourse between husband and wife so that it is not abrasive to the woman. There are a number of studies which highlight how the bare contact of keratinised glans causes irritation and discomfort to the woman and scrapes out all the lubrication that also facilitates the act. The same studies also have women themselves confirm this and the degree of discomfort it brings. Obviously marriage isn\u2019t merely about sex but it is a key part of bringing a man and woman together in a loving relationship and to facilitate fruitfulness. Plus a poor sex will often translate into poor relations in other aspects of the marriage. <br><br>I say modern version because circumcision in the Biblical context was only the cutting of the very end of the foreskin so as to leave the overall structure and function together as God designed it (brit milah). In effect, it was a ritual minor cut with spiritual significance and the prefigurement of baptism and the circumcision of the heart as St Paul puts it. It was only when the Pharisees seethed at Jews pulling down their foreskin to enter into Greek gymnasiums that they decided to just cut off the whole prepuce off to make the process of restoration far more difficult (brit periah). Jews themselves admit that the modern iteration is an innovation in their own texts. Theologically, I cannot see the process other than one that destroys God\u2019s design of the human what intentions He had for its function. I view it as a mockery of God. <br><br>What also messes me up is the fact that I was strapped down when I was born and had a healthy part of my body excised for no reason and subject to extreme pain. I cannot see it as anything other than a profound violation and mutilation. That thought really messes me up too. <br><br>However, I can also see the perspective that foreskin restoration should be avoided due to potentially lustful desires that may arise, that it would take time away from God and that I may be placing stock in things of this world and creating an idol. But then again we don\u2019t condemn a woman who has had a mastectomy to have reconstructive surgery to restore a part of her body. Also my whole intention about engaging in restoration is for me to offer my body to the woman I marry - I have no desire to engage in sexually licentious activity. <br><br>I\u2019ve tried to speak to a contact a priest about this via email given that I can\u2019t take to one in person given certain circumstances at the moment but none have responded so I guess I\u2019m just venting here so mock away.", "filename": "FknF5zTUUAAiFYk", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 600, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674088013141155, "time": 1674088013, "md5": "T0EF4QKbLt8RpDlvsVvwMg==", "fsize": 117717, "resto": 21543467}, {"no": 21543545, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)19:27:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21543467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21543467</a><br>I just had an amazing date, he slid his hand on my waist.

He made an exception for the case where the man and woman explicitly gave up sex for spiritual renewal , the implication being sex is supposed to feel good for men and women, but it is only non-sinful in a context that is within marriage and open to being fruitful(&quot;multiply and be fruitful&quot;) and centered around genuine love. This is in 1 Corinthians 7 or 13. He also said circumcision is unnecessary and possibly even sinful to force any Christian to go through in Acts. Really, you should have the self conttol to not have sex outside of marriage as a man. Agree with thebpoint on FGM though. Basically, you are supposed to deny the pleasures of the flesh but only the ones that can and will lead you astray from God. Marital sex is perfectly licit form of pleasure that God demands a man and woman joined in holy matrimony partake in since that was always part of His plan anyway, so long as the union is aimed towards marital union and fruitfulness( i.e. the man and woman being joined as one flesh and aiming towards the poasibility of having kids).", "time": 1674101252, "resto": 21543467}, {"no": 21544237, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)23:09:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21543881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21543881</a><br>I feel you bro.

But... uhh...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why had the merchants, artists, bankers, officials, and lawyers, from the first quarter of the seventeenth century on, begun to call themselves masons and tried to recreate the ritual of the mediaeval guilds? What was all this strange masquerade about? Gradually the picture grew clearer. The old guild was more than a producing organization; it regulated the ethics and mode of life of its members as well. It completely embraced the life of the urban population, especially the guilds of semi-artisans and semi-artists of the building trades. The break-up of the guild system brought a moral crisis in a society which had barely emerged from mediaevalism. The new morality was taking shape much more slowly than the old was being cut down. Hence, the attempt, so common in history, to preserve a form of moral discipline when its social foundations, which in this instance were those of the industrial guilds, had long since been undermined by the processes of history. Active masonry became theoretical masonry. But the old moral ways of living, which men were trying to keep just for the sake of keeping them, acquired a new meaning. In certain branches of freemasonry, elements of an obvious reactionary feudalism were prominent, as in the Scottish system. In the eighteenth century, freemasonry became expressive of a militant policy of enlightenment, as in the case of the Illuminati, who were the forerunners of revolution; on its left, it culminated in the Carbonari. Freemasons counted among their members both Louis XVI [false - ed.] and the Dr. Guillotin who invented the guillotine. In southern Germany, freemasonry assumed an openly revolutionary character, whereas at the court of Catherine the Great it was a masquerade reflecting the aristocratic and bureaucratic hierarchy. A freemason Novikov was exiled to Siberia by a freemason empress.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although in our day of cheap and ready-made clothing hardly anybody is still wearing his grandfather\u2019s surtout, in the world of ideas the surtout and the crinoline are still in fashion. Ideas are handed down from generation to generation, although, like grandmother\u2019s pillows and covers, they reek of staleness. Even those who are obliged to change the substance of their opinions force them into ancient moulds. The revolution in industry has been much more far-reaching than it has in ideas, where piece-work is preferred to new structures. That is why the French parliamentarians of the petty bourgeoisie could find no better way of creating moral ties to hold the people together against the disruptiveness of modern relations than to put on white aprons and arm themselves with a pair of compasses or a plumb-line.

But you need only ask yourself whether what Nietzsche says is true, to realize how paradoxical it is. (If it is true, then it is false! -- an instance of the so-called &#039;liar&#039; paradox.) Likewise, the French philosopher Michel Foucault repeatedly argues as though the &#039;truth&#039; of an epoch has no authority outside of the power-structure that endorses it. There is no trans-historical truth about the human condition. But again, we should ask ourselves whether that last statement is true: for if it is true, it is false. There has arisen among modernist philosophers a certain paradoxism which has served to put them out of communication with those of their contemporaries who are merely modern. A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is &quot;merely relative,&quot; is asking you not to believe him. So don&#039;t.\u201d</span><br><br>Chesterton on Nietzsche <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche had some natural talent for sarcasm: he could sneer, though he could not laugh; but there is always something bodiless and without weight in his satire, simply because it has not any mass of common morality behind it. He is himself more preposterous than anything he denounces. But, indeed, Nietzsche will stand very well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence. The softening of the brain which ultimately overtook him was not a physical accident. If Nietzsche had not ended in imbecility, Nietzscheism would end in imbecility. Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot. Every man who will not have softening of the heart must at last have softening of the brain.</span><br><br>More Scruton on Nietzsche<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nietzsche himself has become a kind of idol. Despite his antagonism towards democracy and mass culture, despite his unashamedly racist attack on the Germans and all things German, despite his advocacy of \u2018health\u2019 and strength against the \u2018sickness\u2019 of compassion, despite his contempt for socialists, vegetarians, feminists and women generally \u2013 despite committing every sin condemned by the morality of \u2018political correctness\u2019, Nietzsche is now a cult figure. </span><br><br>Even Bertrand Russell has an insightful critique <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into a duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.</span>", "filename": "C35D5CBF-4484-4B8B-A841-22F293784141", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1125, "h": 1685, "tn_w": 166, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1674048813136376, "time": 1674048813, "md5": "eslfy3S2RPcZfE3H0Hwk6A==", "fsize": 962483, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "traditionalist-literature-general-part-iv-the", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 64, "images": 16, "unique_ips": 37}, {"no": 21541613, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21541596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21541596</a><br>Isn&#039;t the bald goatfucker in jail for human trafficking?", "time": 1674049209, "resto": 21541596}, {"no": 21541623, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:46:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21541596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21541596</a><br>First quote reminds me of when people say 90iqs can&#039;t understand recursion", "time": 1674049577, "resto": 21541596}, {"no": 21541636, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:52:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21541613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21541613</a><br>He defied the Matrix", "time": 1674049968, "resto": 21541596}, {"no": 21541641, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:55:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21541613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21541613</a><br>Still detained and awaiting trial.", "time": 1674050101, "resto": 21541596}, {"no": 21541649, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)08:58:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21541596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21541596</a><br>Both are your enemy.

This is not only true of the man standing in front of an execution squad as the representative of some political faction, but of anyone who dies believing that he is going to meet his Maker, because his faith is also the faith of a community to which the dying man belongs. Moreover, the mortality of man entails the possibility of his violent death. It is precisely the fact of violent death, however, that determines the entire range of possible relationships between men: extreme friendship is demonstrated when I sacrifice my life for someone, and extreme enmity when I kill someone.

I&#039;m reading his Faux-Monnayeurs. What do I think of it is this, that it&#039;s certainly Gidean, but I feel at times that he&#039;s trying too hard to write a novel. His dialogue is remarkably good, but it was already good in his fiction which weren&#039;t proper novels. His &quot;abstract&quot; prose sequences(that which is neither narration nor dialogue) is obviously excellent, but why wouldn&#039;t they be(see : his Journal).<br>What I have most trouble with is the actual narration. It seems like he&#039;s forcing himself to tell a story despite himself. He tries to break it up with the Journal chapters sure, but I almost wish he had taken the format he had used for La Porte Etroite, where first came the story itself and followed by an &quot;alternative angle&quot; through the personal journal.<br><br>I have the softest affection for Gide so I can&#039;t help but find beauty in this novel, but I am disappointed, at least in this first reading(which has been done in a rather depressive state, and so maybe that is why I have been unpleased with it at times),with how unkempt the structure seems. He&#039;s never been a very architectural author, but in this novel I feel like it&#039;s especially loose. Also, he uses certain narrative voices, particularly at the beginning, which really didn&#039;t please me(Diderot-ish &quot;well let&#039;s see what our characters are up to now). It just seems that he&#039;s throwing everything into this work, with little mediation, little discernment.<br><br>Any other Gide fans here, who weren&#039;t too satisfied with this book on their first reading?

The story follows its protagonist, a young boy named Faggot Gardner (no relation to F. Gardner, the author), as he searches the grimy streets of Chicago for &quot;the Crocodile&quot;, a local leather daddy notorious for putting bad little boys like Gardner in their place.<br>Young Faggot Gardner searches high and low for the fabled dominant: in dilapidated crack dens, in public restrooms, in subterranean glory holes. Yet no matter how assiduously he searches, how quickly he moves from clue to clue, how many dirty men&#039;s toes he sucks (an activity constantly referred to in the novel as &quot;pussing the boots&quot;), Gardner seems always to be one step behind the object of his obsessive desire.<br>The twist comes near the end of the novel, during a scene reminiscent of Polanski&#039;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;, where the beautiful Carole, played by a young Catherine Deneuve, finally descends into madness, and hallucinates human arms reaching oot of the walls of her apartment and grabbing her, thereby externalizing her fear not only of sexual assault, but of any form of intimate contact whatsoever. F. Gardner (the author) parodies this scene, effectively turning its tone and implications upside down, by having his protagonist, the now cock-starved and desperate Faggot Gardner (again, no relation) crawl on his knees through a dark apartment, groping along the walls to find his way, only to feel, poking proudly oot of the holes in the walls, not scary arms with grabby hands, but dozens of diamond-hard dicks. They poke him in the eyes. They shoot gobs of bitter gravy into his nose and ears. They wag reproachfully at him, like the index fingers of the stern private school teachers who buggered him in his earliest childhood memories, as he slowly makes his way to the end of the hall. The twist is this: when he finally reaches the end of the hall, and opens the door there, he finds himself staring into a blinding white light. He believes that when his eyes finally adjust to the glare, he will see there, waiting for him, horse-whip in hand, croc-skin chaps pulled snugly against his obese thighs, the man he has been seeking for so many days, seeking, in a way, for all of his life. But instead what he sees is a hospital room. He is lying in a hospital bed. The bright light is coming from the naked bulb above him. There is a nurse at his side, changing his IV fluids.<br>&quot;Where am I?&quot; he asks.<br>&quot;Loretto Hospital,&quot; the nurse replies.<br>&quot;I was eaten by a crocodile, wasn&#039;t I?&quot; he asks.<br>&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;You were violently assaulted by hundreds of corpulent and diseased men, with disgusting rotten teeth and putrid breath. That&#039;s why you smell like corpses and semen.&quot;<br>&quot;No,&quot; he says firmly. &quot;I was eaten by a crocodile. It caused my family to go insane. I&#039;m going to write a novel aboot it, and force people to read it.&quot;<br>&quot;Whatever you say, Faggot,&quot; the nurse replies.", "filename": "1D34D933-BF09-43C3-80C7-474420BF48AB", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 314, "h": 494, "tn_w": 79, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674125168079832, "time": 1674125168, "md5": "GMwskYdm7gVCi/CTWlHf6g==", "fsize": 78143, "resto": 21545038}, {"no": 21545052, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)05:49:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Kant died a virgin and avoided masturbation his entire life.<br><br>Many people believe this made him some sort of awkward loser, the kind you might imagine meeting today, you know, wearing a outdated hat or posting on this very site.

He stopped posting because I humiliated him repeatedly during his Xenosystems days, simply by pulling at the seams of his idiotic thought process. As for Accelerationism, it is nonsense, because it is based on false premises:<br><br>1. That Capital and Intelligence (production) are somehow isomorphic. This is he kind of claim that&#039;s not right, but is not even wrong; no wonder then that Land makes appeals to gibberish production machines like Deleuze &amp; Guattari -- via &quot;deterritorialization&quot; -- to justify this inane equivalence.

That intelligence is some kind of attractor in, let&#039;s call it &quot;universal fitness space&quot; -- which is itself based on two sub-hypotheses:<br>2a. That intelligence is evolutionarily robust, as opposed to fragile i.e. it is a perennial winning strategy. This is an empirically disproven claim. The irony here is that one of Land&#039;s pet peeves during his Xenosystems &quot;era&quot; was dysgenics. The cognitive dissonance was too much I imagine, which is why I suspect he ended up &quot;devolving&quot; into a jelly-brained boomer in recent years.<br>2b.

This is, to say the least, highly speculative (granted, it is the least stupid of his assumptions).<br><br>Given these 2 assumptions, Land&#039;s point is then that Capital, once coming into being, can only continue existing and getting better and better at outcompeting any other thing, not limited to economic systems, but encompassing any system in the universe, including life itself.

What would be the resulting IQ-gene correlation? Close to zero. Now imagine an environment where most people get metaphorically hammered to the head while a select few do not. The IQ of those few will inevitable be higher on average, regardless of their genes. The factor of environment plays a large role in determining IQ, leaving no room for genes. Now imagine an egalitarian environment where nobody gets hammered to the head. Suddenly all IQ differences are down to genetic differences, for the factor of environment has been removed in producing differentiation.<br><br>This was also one of the main worries of Herrnstein and Murray in The Bell Curve, that the modern egalitarian meritocracy will produce an essentially gene based class system, filtering people by genes, not environmental factors. Previously a peasant could always turn out to be genetically gifted, but decreasingly so. The lower classes are being left behind in every metric measurable, as the best and brightest are being plucked into higher classes. Funnily enough, as this process develops and social mobility decreases, as people settle where they belong by merit, many people who do not understand it, will turn the reasoning upside down, decrying this decreasing social mobility as a sign of inegalitarianism. They will have great difficulty realizing and accepting we will have arrived at what&#039;s essentially social darwinism by that point. There will be some sort of existential crisis in humanity around the idea of tabula rasa.<br><br>If you want scientific literature on this, I remember there was plenty about height-genes correlation, which obviously has the same mechanism.

Plotinus seems to extend that rule to everyone, that in sum total, people who do evil always just don&#039;t know any better. <br><br>There is still responsibility Plotinus seems to assign everyone of trying to possess the Good, but punishment of an evil may instead be treated as whatever brings the evil to zero, or what balances it, prevents it&#039;s reoccurrence, or increases the thought associated with it and which necessarily will result in the opposite good.<br><br>A lot of early Christian scholarship equates evil as merely the lack/privation of goodness. I don&#039;t remember who. Plotinus seems to have this but with a source for evil, &quot;Absolute Evil&quot;, which has at least less reality than the Good, since he calls it a substratum/hypostasis for evil. Matter is evil, and translated as &quot;Non-Being&quot;, so unless there&#039;s some difficulty with the linguistic traditions or if everyone had an altered state of consciousness then vs. now, I don&#039;t comprehend why evilness can have a quality and act as a substratum while also being nothingness. Temporal space, I guess isn&#039;t nothingness by every quality, since it has the quality of space-time at least from our point of view.", "time": 1673913769, "resto": 21499617}, {"no": 21535526, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)19:06:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21535312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21535312</a><br>I have, my negro.

These sections are typically neighborhoods, walled off from the outside and accessible only via those major roadways. Within each neighborhood are schools and parks, many fenced off from non-residents, but never shops. Interspersed at some major intersections are large outdoor shopping centers that service the needs of the residents. Some sections are not residential neighborhoods; there are a few business districts which feature some of the biggest names in the tech industry, two universities, a college, and the Spectrum Center, the Mecca of upscale outdoor shopping malls.<br><br>The residents of Irvine are tremendously diverse, but are universally governed either by a landlord or a homeowner&#039;s association. Many are successful whites or immigrants (from Asia) that work in the business parks and, besides location, have little in common with their neighbors.

These neighborhoods are not self-contained in the important sense; there is no work in these neighborhoods. The necessities are not only produced outside, they are bought outside as well. There is no intermingling of work and play, in fact they are kept strictly segregated. That these communities are nonproductive stems from this fact, not the safety/prosperity/homeless-less aspect. There is no genuine opportunity for exposure to a more holistic conception of how life is lived.<br><br>Compare again the experience of the child that lives in a suburb like this to the experience of a child that lives in a more &quot;traditional&quot; town, of which there are a few near Irvine: Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente. Obviously things have changed to the point that even in these towns it is very common, for example, that the parents commute to another town for work, but humor me. The children don&#039;t use the parks and schools to play at; they use the town. A few minutes walk and they are at the commercial center of town where real human beings live and work career jobs from low to high end and everywhere in between. Small business owners manage and run stores. Maybe to get home from school they have to walk a couple miles. Maybe their parent(s) work in the area, i.e. as contractors, shop owners, policemen, professionals, etc. Maybe they come home for lunch, etc.<br><br>Even if it is not strictly true that these traditional towns are more self-sufficient in that they produce more of what they consume internally, I hope you don&#039;t think I make a large leap when I say that that appears to be the case to a much higher degree than in the isolated suburbs of Irvine.

The answer to this seems clearly to be yes. We joke by questioning children with, if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around does it make a sound? This is essentially the same question applied to a non-material thing (logic). Some (nominalists) will argue that the laws of logic will cease to exist, as they are constructed/contained in the mind. Well, we then run into the problem of things like pi or the Mandelbrot sets. These are \u201cinfinites\u201d that cannot be contained in our minds. Yes, we can simplify them to contain them to the best of our ability, but their \u2018real\u2019 or actual existence cannot be contained in the mind. This suggests that our mind is not the determinate factor for metaphysics. These things cannot depend upon our minds to exist because we cannot fully conceive of them in our minds to begin with. Yet, they exist. This should lead us to God, as we know that non-material concepts, by definition, are not contained in the atoms or the strings or the lowest common physical denominator. Get 3 apples on a table and the quality of their \u201cthree-ness\u201d is not contained in any of the physical properties.

If something seems right to someone, he believes it. I do not believe there is a &quot;great truth&quot; waiting to be discovered by man, that one &quot;true&quot; philosophy will eventually reach. I believe there is the world &quot;as it is&quot;, and people talking about it - having their own ideas, theories, analyses about it. Particularly smart people make particularly elaborate ideas, theories and analyses about the world - philosophies. But these, man-made, philosophies, objective as they seem, are in the end no less subjective than a child licking honey and saying &quot;I like this, it tastes good&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Okay, which one or ones are not?</span><br>One rather objective topic is simply &quot;existence&quot;. There is something. Man came about and put this something into categories, so that he can mentally interact with that something, but these categories are subjective ideas that do not actually correlate to the something that exists. Matter arranged in the form of a chair is not actually a chair, since &quot;chair&quot; is a man-made, subjective, idea that we use to talk about the matter arranged in the form of a chair. But there is something that exists. The chair-arranged matter is objectively existing, but it is subjective that it is supposed to be a chair.<br>From here on, it is hard to pin down topics as objective. I think it is easier to find topics that are &quot;objective within given parameters&quot;.

Narcissists believe in the deception I just said, they can&#039;t confirm others are as real or sentient as them so they fear us and therefore in order to get an ounce of love instead of being kind they attack people for negative attention to get the little bit of love they need from us reacting to their malevolent tactics, and after we are used they go about their day. Ways I&#039;ve started to change a narcissists mind is explaining soul overlap and how we are a little bit overlaped in the spiritual realm, (this is how love kinda works), since they recognize the other sentience this way they become (a little) more considerate. To completely &quot;cure&quot; a narcissist takes years of explaining a: you are as real as them and b: how their tactics are not how others get the attention, and it&#039;s a fucking heartbreaking subject which is why no one wants to have it because in reality after this is shown to them they may have suicidal tendencies.", "time": 1673992303, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21539331, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)16:53:24", "name": "ben&#039;s evil rabbit twin", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539318</a><br>if you have a good relationship why the fuck not? women are the same as men they want it sometimes they just don&#039;t like it forced and men can&#039;t cope when it happens.", "time": 1673992404, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21539369, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)17:06:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21529188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21529188</a><br>&quot;meaning&quot; is a feeling, so if someone says life is meaningless, you don&#039;t refute them, you recognize that that&#039;s how they feel. if you think life is meaningful, then it is, just like if you think strawberries are tasty then they are. if someone else says &quot;strawberries are bad&quot; you don&#039;t start thinking &quot;how do I refute them?&quot;", "time": 1673993189, "resto": 21529188}, {"no": 21539596, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)18:08:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539323</a><br>Very interesting.

The Argument from Motion: Our senses can perceive motion by seeing that things act on one another. Whatever moves is moved by something else.

The Argument from Necessary Being: Because objects in the world come into existence and pass out of it, it is possible for those objects to exist or not exist at any particular time.

The Argument from Gradation: There are different degrees of goodness in different things.

Therefore, there must be a being of the highest form of good. This perfect being is God.</span><br>If that is true, then God must not exist yet, since animal complexity is still being evolved.

He characterizes Polus&#039;s first speech about Gorgias&#039; s art as rhetorical, because it failed to say what the art is and instead said *what kind of* thing it is and praised it as if it had been attacked. Dialectic, we are left to presume, answers the question *what a thing is*. But when Socrates later overturns Polus&#039; s assertion that doing injustice without paying a just penalty is better than suffering injustice, the whole refutation turns on the premise granted by Polus (474c) that doing injustice is baser than suffering injustice; it rests, in other words, on an assertion of *what kind of* thing injustice is without making clear *what* it is. At this crucial point of the discussion, then, Socrates refutes rhetorically rather than investigates dialectically. May we not infer that Socrates is concerned with rhetoric to an exceptional degree in this dialogue?</span><br><br><a href=\"#p21538309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21538309</a><br>Why would Bloom have to have done a &quot;complete works&quot; translation, if we&#039;re just comparing translations?

If I happened to be a foreigner, you would surely sympathize with me if I spoke in the dialect and way in which I was raised, likewise I also beg it of you now, and it is just as it appears to me. Disregard my way of speaking, for perhaps it is worse, perhaps better, but rather consider this alone and apply your mind to it: whether or not the things I say are just.

Fowler, West, Rouse, and Kremer all agree on that reading, though Rouse and Fowler translate &quot;dikaion&quot; as &quot;fair&quot;, which isn&#039;t necessarily so far off the mark, but which implies &quot;fairness&quot; in the modern sense, when the Greek word Socrates uses is the same that&#039;s the theme of the Republic, &quot;justice&quot;; Jowett turns the passage into a rhetorical question by Socrates and renders &quot;dikaion&quot; as &quot;unfair&quot;.<br><br>Later in the same sentence, Socrates judges how his speaking might come across, &quot;perhaps x, perhaps y&quot;; Socrates uses the words &quot;cheiron&quot; and &quot;beltion&quot;, &quot;worse/inferior&quot; and &quot;better&quot; respectively. Jowett reduces the two words to &quot;good&quot; (&quot;may or may not be good&quot;); Rouse switches the order, perhaps to suit more natural English phrasing (no biggie, not compared to Jowett).

There are two verbs, &quot;skopein&quot; (lit. look/watch) and &quot;prosechein&quot; (hold fast); Fowler, West, Rouse, and Kremer all render the verbs just fine, though only West and Kremer preserve Socrates&#039; use of &quot;noun&quot; (&quot;mind&quot;) with the second verb. Jowett elides it with the following clause in a curious way. All the translators but Jowett render the Greek such that what Socrates tells the Athenians to attend to is whether his speech is just (&quot;dikaia&quot;) or not; Jowett translates &quot;dikaia&quot; as &quot;truth&quot;, which covers up the philosophically interesting issue of whether speaking justly is the same as speaking the truth (consider the Republic on medicinal lies).<br><br>Finally, Socrates makes a claim about what judges and orators do. Fowler, West, and Kremer are close here, bringing out that Socrates speaks of the virtue (&quot;arete&quot;) of a judge and the corresponding virtue of an orator; Fowler&#039;s minor change is a repetition of &quot;virtue&quot; that isn&#039;t in the Greek, but no biggie. Rouse translates it curiously as &quot;merit&quot;, which is alright but imprecise in the sense of being good at something (the other accurate translation of &quot;arete&quot; is &quot;excellence&quot;), but it would be wrong if it implied having to earn something, instead of the innate characteristic excellence of a being, as Plato uses it. Jowett doesn&#039;t acknowledge the word in his rendering. He turns Socrates statement into something hortatory, &quot;let x do y&quot;, switches the order of the judges and orators, and supplies a verb and adverb not present in the Greek (&quot;decide justly&quot;). His choice to translate &quot;rhetoros&quot; (&quot;rhetors/orators&quot;) as &quot;speaker&quot; seems poor since Socrates has just made a big effort to show how he&#039;s not a skilled speaker like the rhetoricians/orators, who, after all, are represented by one of his three accusers, Lycon.<br><br>All in all, West and Kremer, the Straussians, are slavish to the Greek and usually attentive to the order of Greek phrasing.

The deepest root of things is, in fact, matter, not just the \u201cmateriality\u201d of the four elements, but something coursing beneath these, eternal, moving, not accessible to perception, and not really accessible to the intellect either. The existence of this ultimate matter can be much more plausibly inferred than can the existence of separate ousiai, but only as a kind of limit case of what the human intellect can infer.

We cannot even be sure that the claims we venture to make about it are governed by the principle of non-contradiction.

The human intellect is no more than a possibility, so to speak, that was always latent in this matter. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. On the other hand, the human intellect, as tossed up by this matter and then impinged upon by it, constitutes, somehow, a world, an ordered whole that is more or less knowable, by physics in particular.

The struggle here isn&#039;t really interpretation besides, but rather against ambiguity and its encroachment upon meaning. Very few people embrace ambiguity, and those who do so are typically individuals who do not profit much from reading in the first place, because their narcissistic echo-chamber hardly lets the mind of anyone else pierce its halls. Unfortunately, ambiguity gets a bad rap for this reason, since the greatest authors have the capacity to utilize ambiguity in such a way that it not only gives the reader space to bring themselves &quot;to the table&quot;, but also can be a sort of trap, that guides one through research into a seeming void that leads exactly where the author wants the reader to go. Chalking everything up to openness of infinite interpretation is an intellectually lazy thing to do, but so is insisting upon there being a definite reason to any piece. Interpretation overall is for the weak. The great man siezes objective meaning from the wraith, upon ripping the author&#039;s ghost from the ether, invoking their eternal souls to dispel all that could not be made seen in their lifetime, whilst leaping upon their phantasmic shoulders, and forming brave new meanings the author could never even come up with himself.", "time": 1674002652, "resto": 21539484}, {"no": 21539955, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)19:44:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21539939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21539939</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seethe</span><br>You adopt the jargon of this site as a substitute for original thought: you will me to be angry, and pretend it is the case so as to make yourself feel superior.

He said it&#039;s because he learned Latin in high school the normal traditional way, and thus actually learned how grammar and syntax work, so every language he learns is just a permutation of that structure for him.<br><br>All of these pseudo-debates are between first and second year learners who, again, would rather speculate about ideal methods for ten years on social media than learn anything. The anti-LLPSI crowd deserves a good deal more respect because at least they are probably actually learning Latin as undergrads or something, and getting rankled by false promises and lazy methods, since they have firsthand experience of both how seriously you ought to take learning Latin grammar, and how powerful and surprisingly easy it is once you just get to it. Notice how all the LLPSI people are your typical terminally online &quot;hobbyists&quot; who really just follow social media and watch videos by influencers who themselves have the hobby. <br><br>Just read a Latin book you like. IF IT WORKED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, IT WILL WORK FOR YOU. Even LLPSI can work, even the magic baby learning CI method would work if any of these LLPSI idiots actually did it instead of arguing about it for eternity because they have personality disorders and feel real animosity for the people criticizing them and now it&#039;s yet another thing they &quot;debate&quot; about online. Just go get any book from any library and read it.

Music is not only sound, it is also silence in combination of rhythm. The sound of the notes can be produced by various instruments at the same time and with different dynamics between them. You can also use a microtonal scale if you think you&#039;re lacking in notes. These are just some, not all, of the variables found in music. So no, it is not just 11 notes that describe music. This would be like saying math is limited because it has only ten digits.<br>Secondly, arguing that written word is more variable just because English has 172k words is meaningless. Without structure it has no meaning. You can arrange all of them in all the different ways you want but, without grammar and syntax, it will all be gibberish.

McCarthy explicitly states that the judge has tiny hands in BM. He also says that the kid had large hands. I think he made those distinctions for a reason. At the end the kid fucks or tries to fuck a dwarf. You can read that as him liking children. When the kid walks into the jakes and the judge locks the door behind him, what I believe is that the kid gives into his dark side in there. I think they rape and murder the missing bear girl together. I believe the guy pissing outside of the jakes who warns the other man not to enter is the kid. He seems to know what went on inside and seems unfazed. Whatever happened in there was horrific to elicit the &quot;Good god almighty&quot; from the other man. We are talking about the most wicked city in Texas where murder was normal. I think he saw something truly horrible like a raped and murdered child. In the end the kid essentially became the judge.

Images of lean, sculpted men and women dominate the cultural landscape and are now ubiquitous on billboards, in magazines, film, television, and video. Science and popular culture are profoundly mixed in the contemporary scene, and have lead to a host of exercising and dieting technologies that will make actual bodies fit the taught, muscular ideal. Many people desire this body and the attractiveness, health, longevity, and personal security that it represents. But, as Brian Pronger argues, this approach transforms more than the body&#039;s functions and contours; it diminishes its transcendent power, compelling it conform to a profoundly limited imagination of what the body can do.<br><br>Calling upon an impressive array of philosophers and other writers who have been critical of modern techno-scientific approaches to life, Pronger pries open the texts that form the technology of physical fitness in order to consider what they try to produce. Body Fascism views technology not simply as a tool for other projects, but as a project itself, producing its own realities that Pronger argues are ultimately nihilistic. Indeed, he says there are disquieting parallels between what technology has done to the environment and what it is doing to the body. Exploring fascinating intersections between postmodern Western and Zen approaches to life, he develops a theory of the body and of science and technology that shows how the body&#039;s energy is vulnerable to insidious forms of exploitation as well as harbouring the potential for transcendence. The sheer scope of this book make it unique in the discipline and it will be of great interest not only to scholars of the body, society, science and technology, but also to those who are personally drawn to modern technologies of physical fitness.", "time": 1674073427, "resto": 21542512}, {"no": 21542748, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:24:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21542512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21542512</a><br>Parmenides is the only philosopher who ever lived that never made a false statement", "time": 1674073469, "resto": 21542512}, {"no": 21542772, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)15:31:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21542742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21542742</a><br>Thanks bro.
