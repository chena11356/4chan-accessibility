Anyway, nearly all large space objects have a nervous system-like ion channels that &quot;give&quot; them minds on par with if not more advanced than humans&#039;. Think Gaia theory but instead of the biosphere being a sort of super organism the literal rock of the Earth is it&#039;s own organism (I guess that makes us more a kind of microbiota). The classical planets have already know to have Planetary Intelligences and Spirits. Uranus, Neptune, and the Keplar belt dwarfs have such a thing but they are not communicable due to their distance. The asteroid belt, the moons of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and comets (when they get close enough) also have such a thing, and are communicable.", "filename": "1650497224181", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1049, "h": 737, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 87, "tim": 1672450347602758, "time": 1672450347, "md5": "9b3cDKzOPsf8OzKNvROMgg==", "fsize": 60379, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457200, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)20:34:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457182</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sterile &#039;intellectual wankery&#039; of the Mathers and Crowley types took over.</span><br><br>Oh please.

Apollodorus,[citation needed] Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.<br><br>According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affair), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech:<br><br>22Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, &quot;You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things. 23For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#039;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&#039; What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 24The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn&#039;t dwell in temples made with hands, 25neither is he served by men&#039;s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things. 26He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 28&#039;For in him we live, and move, and have our being.&#039; As some of your own poets have said, &#039;For we are also his offspring.&#039; 29Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man. 30The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent, 31because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.&quot;<br><br>\u2014Acts 17:22-31", "filename": "PaulTheApostle", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 200, "h": 289, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672453480295577, "time": 1672453480, "md5": "dFHTxDSoXDfSCWT7xazvfQ==", "fsize": 22769, "resto": 21456762}, {"no": 21457444, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)21:26:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21457437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21457437</a><br><br>Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul&#039;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;.

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&#039;s greatest dramatist. He is often called England&#039;s national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. He remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.</span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shakespeare&#039;s influence extends from theater and literatures to present-day movies, Western philosophy, and the English language itself. William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world&#039;s pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare&#039;s writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world\u2019s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death.

Sorel was pretty much not important at all in National Socialism. Nietzsche&#039;s influence had pretty little to do with Plato and more with Heraclitus. Heidegger was also not that important. Just in general most of the figueres in the development of Fascism were not important at all in National Socialism. They instead had people like Paul de la Garde, Julius Langbehn, Oswald Spengler, Werner Sombart, Georg von Sch\u00f6nerer, Eugen D\u00fchring and Rudolf Jung. Then the volkist ideas had a whole bunch of biologists including people like Ernst Haeckel and Raoul Franc\u00e9. These Volkists came up with the basis of the life laws which fascism didn&#039;t have anything close to. The ideology was basically just the application of these natural laws. It was economically far more left wing than Fascism was with many National Socialist including Hitler not even fully acknowledging private property but instead only private management of that property (which was implemented in various forms). National Socialism also just saw the role of the government and the nature of the state completely different with the state only being there as a means to an end to ensure the existence and thriving of the people and the nation not really having anything to do with the actual borders.

Meanwhile, the abuse and maltreatment of Blacks has been going on and on and on for hundreds of years. <br><br>Now, don&#039;t think me dissatisfied completely. The people in this thread have had a triggering effect, so my views may be somewhat misrepresented. I am decently satisfied with what progress has been made overall, and consider at least some of what we&#039;re experiencing societally as the natural growing pains of various factors involved in our getting used to the changes which have taken place. Still, I view the overcompensations and indulgences (particularly the criminal indulgences) as counterproductive (that said, the people in this thread are precisely the sort to blame for it, as they are its justification, so it serves them right), and, ultimately, I view all of it as being perpetuated by and subservient to the global elite&#039;s ends - which, while predominantly leftist, is actually both on the right and left. <br><br>Anyway, my point was really a simple one. That while treating Blacks like royalty, whether deserved or not is a new phenomenon, racism against Blacks is not, and though our mistreatment overall is probably at all-time lows, it should not be forgotten that the only reason the pendulum is swinging so far to the side of pampering is how absolutely underprivileged Blacks were forcibly made to be.

I think you&#039;re either a teenage contrarian or a foreigner.<br>Baldwin captured a unique instance of the human condition. He was a product of American (and thus Western) intellectualism, and could never shake its influence, but he was also Black, and saw himself as being inherently alienated from it - his exodus to Europe is very interesting to think about, and his writings reflect his rejection of many American cultural assumptions (of his time). He&#039;s got a Dick Cavett interview that demonstrates this. At the same time, he was gay, and a writer, and wasn&#039;t really comfortable in the black community he came from. More than that, though, he was a &quot;poet&quot; in the modernist sense, and saw himself as being isolated from everybody, really. A lot of his personal essays get at his inability to connect with any particular group. If you listen to his speech, &quot;The Artist&#039;s Struggle for Integrity,&quot; you&#039;ll see that the people he feels most connected to are the &quot;poets,&quot; and the things he&#039;s got to say about the poet&#039;s condition are very interesting. Refer, for example, to his response to &quot;the White Negro.&quot; It&#039;s easy to reduce his writings to &quot;racial commentary,&quot; but it&#039;s immature, since he&#039;s really trying to work against America&#039;s obsession with race while recognizing that to do so is impossible.", "time": 1672413965, "resto": 21452213}, {"no": 21454458, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)10:26:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21453727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21453727</a><br>Wrong.

He had to clean his bedroom, because once he had dope he<br>would not leave his bedroom except to go to the refrigerator and the bathroom, and even then the trips would be very quick. He<br>had to throw out all his beer and liquor, because if he drank alcohol and smoked dope at the same time he would get dizzy and ill,<br>and if he had alcohol in the house he could not be relied on not to drink it once he started smoking dope. He&#039;d had to do some<br>shopping. He&#039;d had to lay in supplies. Now just one of the insect&#039;s antennae was protruding from the hole in the girder. It<br>protruded, but it did not move. He had had to buy soda, Oreos, bread, sandwich meat, mayonnaise, tomatoes, M&amp;M&#039;s, Almost<br>Home cookies, ice cream, a Pepperidge Farm frozen chocolate cake, and four cans of canned chocolate frosting to be eaten with a<br>large spoon. He&#039;d had to log an order to rent film cartridges from the Inter-Lace entertainment outlet. He&#039;d had to buy antacids for<br>the discomfort that eating all he would eat would cause him late at night. He&#039;d had to buy a new bong, because each time he<br>finished what simply had to be his last bulk-quantity of marijuana he decided that that was it, he was through, he didn&#039;t even like it<br>anymore, this was it, no more hiding, no more imposing on his colleagues and putting different messages on his answering device<br>and moving his car away from his condominium and closing his windows and curtains and blinds and living in quick vectors<br>between his bedroom&#039;s InterLace teleputer&#039;s films and his refrigerator and his toilet, and he would take the bong he&#039;d used and<br>throw it away wrapped in several plastic shopping bags. His refrigerator made its own ice in little cloudy crescent blocks and he<br>loved it, when he had dope in his home he always drank a great deal of cold soda and ice water.

Your shoes\u2019 brand incised in the dew. An alfalfa breeze. Socks\u2019 burrs. Dry scratching inside a culvert. Rusted wire and tilted posts more a symbol of restraint than a fence per se. NO HUNTING. The shush of the interstate off past the windbreak. The pasture\u2019s crows tanding at angles, turning up patties to get at the worms underneath, the shapes of the worms incised in the overturned dung and baked by the sun all day until hardened, there to stay, tiny vacant lines in rows and inset curls that do not close because head never quite touches tail.

I never heard of him having issues with staying within the confines of the form, but perhaps you know of something which I do not?<br><br>Freedom is the only Franzen I have read so far but from what I know he is on his own thing, there is just overlap with DFW. I may change my mind after I read more of him, Freedom is not the best to judge this from since it is pretty much his take on Infinite Jest and an homage to his dead friend.", "time": 1672466142, "resto": 21455421}, {"no": 21458273, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)01:01:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21456049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21456049</a><br>ADHD?

They are the single most banal people you can imagine, often belonging to the managerial class or the academic class - the kinds you&#039;d see hiding in the corner of a public / news office seeking the bare minimum and never once thinking greatness in life as an achievable. They are children of an existence without risk, depressed journalists or lawyers acting as hobbyists and distracting themselves from an expendable overpaid profession. As one writes what they know, these people know nothing of love, life, of great voyages or risks, so they will write tales so cynical, introspective and skeptical of life that Murakami would cry (see Machado de Assis, who is referred to many times in this thread). <br><br>Nowadays, those same depressed and detached brazilians are still at work. All they know of the world comes through ideological lenses, knowledge which will incarnate as characters. Thus the writers proselytise nothing besides ideology. They will write the &#039;gay man&#039; whose only trait is being &#039;gay&#039; (see any soap opera), as well as the &#039;union man&#039; whose life is ruled by the &#039;union&#039; (see Black Tie or modern theater). They will even revel in making art that no one understand at all, confusing literary for useless. Those who attempt to escape this paradigm will often escape into genre fiction like fantasy - thus nulling any contribution to our literature. <br><br>Simply put, Brazil will go the way of China. <br><br>They have invented the printing press and all they&#039;ve done with it was publishing the same books from the 15th century over and over again.

He is himself more preposterous than anything he denounces. But, indeed, Nietzsche will stand very well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence. The softening of the brain which ultimately overtook him was not a physical accident. If Nietzsche had not ended in imbecility, Nietzscheism would end in imbecility. Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot.

Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world.

That is why in him this hatred could become creative and tragic. Creative \u2013 because it called him to seek for what he missed in Schopenhauer, and it forced him to turn away from him who had not taught him Kant. Tragic \u2013 because he was not great enough to struggle independently, with his own pure strength, through to Kant, whom he had never read. That is why he never arrived at *religion*; when he affirmed life most passionately, life denied him \u2013 that is, the life which resists untruthfulness. Nietzsche&#039;s decline is to be explained by his lack of religion. A person can perish from nothing other than a lack of religion. The genius shows this most horribly, for the man of genius is the most devoted man, and when *devotion* leaves him, his genius has left him. It was not without deep reason that the \u201cunscrupulousness of the mind\u201d became a problem for Nietzsche; the \u201cunscrupulousness of the mind\u201d is the \u201cclever\u201d man, and the \u201cclever\u201d man was the fate that menaced Nietzsche, and the abyss that finally dragged him down. Would he otherwise have considered it necessary to stress explicitly when he meant something seriously, and really wanted to be taken seriously? What Nietzsche lacked was *mercy*, but without mercy, loneliness, even Zarathustra&#039;s, is not bearable. Thus logic was not a uniquely valuable good for him, but an external constraint (for he felt too weak not to scent danger everywhere). However, he who negates logic has already been abandoned by it, he is on the road to insanity.&quot;<br>- Weininger", "time": 1672458826, "resto": 21455798}, {"no": 21459015, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)06:25:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21456015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21456015</a><br>Fpbp", "time": 1672485935, "resto": 21455798}, {"no": 21459074, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)06:46:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455798</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all angl*s</span><br>Why do anglos seethe about GVRMAN philosophy so much?", "time": 1672487167, "resto": 21455798}, {"no": 21459084, "now": "12/31/22(Sat)06:50:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21459074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21459074</a><br>It\u2019s mutual.

This matter is of essential concern: prior to the discovery of the godswheel the gathering of life-energy was only possible through blackest magics or demonic pacts. However, the godswheel has not solved all problems. Life-energy woven in the wheel is limited in quantity and ephemeral in nature. This treatise discusses a way to construct and use a false heart of childsbane to grasp these threads of fate.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Firstly, obtain childsbane, brimstone, and cave ash. Using a sin chest, induce breath to liquor. Burn the brimstone and cave ash within the breath. The miasma will produce cursewater within a turn of the glass.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secondly, place two pieces of childsbane in a vessel of alchemical quality and then add the cursewater. The childsbane plates should not be fully immersed. The arrangement of these items in this way forms a false heart, but it must be given life using a godswheel. Place the left hand of the godswheel on one piece of childsbane and the right hand of the godswheel on the other. Upon spinning the godswheel, life is introduced to the vessel. Any drive howsoever driven will suffice, but for the creation of life-energy at scale a spit drive (e.g. a Nyctimite mover) is practical. As the false heart is innervated it will take on a healthy pallor.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the pallor is set the false heart is complete. The false heart can now be used in place of a godswheel at the sorceror&#039;s leisure, with no need to spin, by the same method as the laying of hands of the godswheel. As the false heart is used its life will diminish and it will grow pallid in the fasion of a corpse. By reintroducing life through the further application of a godswheel the false heart can again be returned.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By these methods have I conducted many contemplations on the nature and use of life-energy, and I share them here for my colleagues.</span><br><br><s>it&#039;s a lead acid battery</s>", "time": 1672447371, "resto": 21445170}, {"no": 21456982, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)19:47:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;write scene months ago</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;queue up chapter</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;realize right now that I accidentally referenced the Dark Knight (very slightly) even though I didn&#039;t intend to because I haven&#039;t seen that movie in close to ten years and forgot the dialogue</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15 minutes before chapter releases</span><br>Fuck it, it&#039;s going live.

You can shut off your hearing and call it &quot;IP brainrot&quot; all you want, but you won&#039;t be left with anyone who wants to read your story, other than (both) people who think that Kirby raping Meta Knight is a deep and interesting twist.<br> It&#039;s cultural standards. Times have changed. We&#039;re not a bunch of superstitious peasants farming potatoes. Just because something occurred sometime in the past, doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s timely or relevant now. We want stories more complex than some jacked demigod killing a hydra, and we have some standards about what is and isn&#039;t appropriate for goofy kids&#039; shows.<br>I&#039;ll try to put it as simply: one finds things like the zombie Psyduck or Shadow the Hedgehog using guns while mildly swearing &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;impossible to take seriously&quot; because, when it comes down to it, they start off from concepts that are close to what is commonly accepted as &quot;kid-appropriate&quot; (not even &quot;kid friendly&quot;!), then add elements that are at odds with it... but in such a way that it is clearly &quot;not mature&quot; in itself!<br>Just because a Sonic character brandishes a realistic gun doesn&#039;t mean it suddenly becomes a Call of Duty clone: if the opponents are still purely evil demons and/or faceless mercenaries with little reason behind their existence, the character is still essentially a simple one, the color palette is still colorful, and the effect of the gun is the same as using a spin dash or whatever, you just have given a things that looks mature to a character within a setting that isn&#039;t.<br>If an Aster\u00ecx comic directly showed the rape of a woman called Slutrix, by a man called Incelix, and the rest of the comic had Obelix using his superstrenght to track the guy down and then punch him into the sky like the Roman soldiers, all the while Aster\u00ecx and Vitastatix comfort Slutrix with shopping, it wouldn&#039;t be mature because the rape would not be treated seriously in itself.<br>If Captain Haddock was presented catching HIV from eating bushmeat, and the comic, while mantaining the canon personalities, talked about it realistically, it would be mature, yes, but it also could be considered &quot;cringe&quot; because it&#039;s trying to process a real issue through the lens of fictional characters. Shit, this one issue also affects more &quot;adult&quot; comics too, because for example at no point in Marvel comics Reed Richards ever canonically tries to solve world hunger or cure cancer is because that would trivialize the actual problem.", "time": 1672349145, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21450948, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)18:45:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1672357519, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21451119, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)19:13:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450948</a><br>It didn\u2018t need a fourth one after 30 replies you nigger", "time": 1672359208, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21451659, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)21:11:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21451119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21451119</a><br>Nobody made a response to my argument.", "time": 1672366317, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21452180, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)22:59:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "i want the fox to fuck the bunny", "time": 1672372792, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21452311, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)23:22:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21448205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21448205</a><br>Robotnik tortures Sonics parents.", "time": 1672374156, "resto": 21441062}, {"no": 21453310, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21450225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21450225</a><br>You&#039;ve written a whole essay about dark themes in other stories, even theoretical dark themes that\u2019d have never been added to a TV series, not today and certainly not in 1993.

Creators of both shows were left with different impresions after watching the game footage. AoStH creators , as you can tell from watching the show, chose the lightheartedness, after seeing pastoral Green Hill Zone and Sonic&#039;s funny reactions when he&#039;s waiting for the player to move, or his interactions with Tails. SatAM creators saw the same thing and this more ligthhearted side is present in SatAM, but they also saw the darker and industrial Oil Ocean Zone and Wing Fortress Zone. And they decided, that Sonic can be a darker show, and that it can also have environmental message.<br><br>Sonic franchise could\u2019ve gone in two different direction from there. As you know, it went with the lightheartedness and that\u2019s why you think SatAM strayed away from the series tone, show\u2019s interpretation of Sonic\u2019s world was valid back then and I think it still is now. It&#039;s different, but that&#039;s what&#039;s great about it. Apart from being a good series, SatAM gives us a glimpse of what Sonic would have been like if the franchise went in a different direction.

Stilted, shallow Shakespearean romance and violent, angry ancient romance feel less authentic and resonant than your average sitcom romance today. It&#039;s just that Austen has been the only author of note recently to really give a shit about it, and developed most of the narrative technology we now use to describe it singlehandedly. Hopefully somebody in the next couple centuries will come along with enough talent to better her work. It&#039;s a shame that all the great authors of the 19th and 20th centuries were cuckoldry obsessed narcissists who could only use romantic interests as props for their self-insert main characters.

A romantic tragedy is about anything BUT the couple involved\u2013 the parents get in the way, or society, or religion, so the story is really about parenting, or society, or<br>religion. Whereas a real romance is about love and how love changes you; love is the motive force, and has to win in the end, which all the great authors since Austen have been too cynical to believe. Even Hemingway, the most optimistic author of the 20th century, kills Catherine at the end of A Farewell to Arms, because that novel wasn&#039;t about how love made Ernesto realize that his life had value, it was about how war and death didn&#039;t care whether he realized it or not. Which is why Catherine is such a hollow archetypal figure in that book.

Particularly, and ironically, about sexual matters they are neurotically fearful of anything which does not neatly fit their sensibilities. Though maybe everyone&#039;s like that to an extent if I&#039;m honest. There&#039;s probably some necessary social function to the creation of all these social standards of proper v.s improper behavior. The only difference is progressives are deceitful, pretending they don&#039;t have any standards so as to project a pretense of superiority.<br>To give a concrete example, in a literature class we were reading &quot;A Tale of Two Women&quot; by D.H Lawrence.

Even the supposedly open rhetoric about sex on college campuses, the &quot;sex out loud&quot; groups I remember, were duplicitous. These groups make the realities of sex more obscure by trying to promote their fictitious vision of a perfectly clean, rational sexuality. Yet in trying to promote these standards they ironically end up recreating the same prudish standards they profess to hate. <br>These types very much resemble the Christian moralizing reformer of yesteryear. Think of the progressive Christian reformer of the early 20th century proselytizing against the uncouth behavior of new immigrants who did not hew to their protestant standards. They watch media with the same breathless moralizing hysteria, with the express purpose of encountering certain no-nos, which they secretly love (because if media were devoid of these no-nos, then there would be nothing for them to complain about). They wait excitedly to encounter whatever &quot;ism&quot; outrages their moral sensibilities the most: racism, classism, sexism ... so many isms.

Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1672439321, "resto": 21456085}, {"no": 21456355, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)17:29:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21456330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21456330</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one of which doesn&#039;t speak or write in Russian and the other is barely fluent in English</span><br>this is factually wrong. they&#039;re both familiar with both languages<br><br>they are highly regarded by experts in their field, taking issue with a particular piece of translation work they&#039;ve done does not do justice to the translations they&#039;ve done as a whole. again, i regard them as among the better translators.<br><br>you should also note that if they&#039;re writing in a &#039;bad&#039; style, they may be reflecting the original author&#039;s style choice. it retains the fidelity of the original--not a valid point of criticism.", "time": 1672439363, "resto": 21456085}, {"no": 21456357, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)17:29:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I quite like Katz, reading it now infact, is it really that bad of a translation?", "filename": "1671773418963206", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 750, "h": 740, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1672439396899587, "time": 1672439396, "md5": "qSLEMbq76Z1mZLv5G9/gzw==", "fsize": 44899, "resto": 21456085}, {"no": 21456358, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)17:30:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21456085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21456085</a><br>Niggers are too autistic about translations.

It&#039;s nothing special either way. Dostoevsky&#039;s only appeal is to Westerners and teenagers in general. Once you grow out of that phase you realize what Dostoevsky truly writes about is pure, unadulterated cope. The torment of being the statistical exception of a normal human being surrounded by subhumans makes one invent all sorts of stories and forced reasonings to try and make sense of things. It&#039;s literally no different that today&#039;s SJWs playing the &quot;muh socioeconomic factors&quot;. Dostoevsky simply couldn&#039;t come to terms with the fact that his nation is utterly subhuman and tried to paint their actions as some sort of precursors to a salvation and attribute some fantastical and intricate inner monologues to &quot;people&quot; who are in fact devoid of any such things.<br><br>Of course this would appeal to the literary equivalent of blue-haired freaks screeching about the oppression of some group they know nothing of.

By which I mean, are they all dialogues that present a question but don&#039;t establish a concrete answer?</span><br>Not necessarily, there are dialogues that seem more prone to expositing something or other about a subject: Republic on Justice, the Laws on Legislation, the Timaeus on Nature, the Symposium and Phaedrus on Love, the Phaedo on the immortality of the soul, the Sophist and Statesman on Sophistry and Statesmanship. These works seem more prone to teaching some kind of doctrine, even if these dialogues also heavily qualify the extent or circumstantial character of our knowing the subjects. It is certainly the case that most dialogues end as though nobody knows what&#039;s what, but there might be positions even in these dialogues where their rejection isn&#039;t a real rejection, that we might have to invest ourselves in working out the position more. (For example, towards the end of Euthyphro, Socrates offers his own suggestion of how to understand piety, and it falls away less because a strong argument is made against it than because Euthyphro suddenly takes a stance that requires the to answer a harder question they had already asked earlier and he leaves. Something similar happens in Ion, where Socrates makes an interesting position that gets sidelined by Ion getting distrated by some other issue.)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do most people take away from the dialogues if they often end in aporia?</span><br>This is tricky to answer, because we have a great idea how the aporetic dialogues were treated centuries after Plato, but not how he may have used them in the Academy. Later Platonists took these dialogues to be good introductions to Plato&#039;s thought, perhaps with the idea that a student would have to think them over carefully to see if they found a solution that dealt with the problems, or to see if it would inspire students with the philosophical attitude to keep inquiring either on their own or through other dialogues to pursue the answers to important questions.

Euthyphro is about the fact that Socrates is going to be judged in court, and there is ambiguity in Plato&#039;s retelling of Socrates life about who can judge who and on what grounds. Euthyphro is coming to court to judge his father, and the manner in which the dialogue is led to a discussion of the status of the gods and piety is basically an analogy for judging your father. Socrates actually feels that he is having the same dilemma, because Socrates believes that his life and the ideal life (or good life) is only possible because of the polis. Socrates is being judged by HIS father, the city, and Socrates feels the judgement of him is mistaken. But at the same time he feels that the polis is essential to the good life, the polis is a larger whole that begets a Socrates, like his father, and so he is torn about on what grounds he can dismiss the judgement of the polis.<br><br>For Euthyphro it is posed as the question of how one can judge justice relative to the supreme standard of justice, which is God. So you get Euthyphro&#039;s dilemma (which I&#039;ll paraphrase because you can present it in a number of ways), if we take what is dear to God to be the standard for the good, is what is dear to God good because it is dear to him, or is it dear to God because it is good? Basically, is there a good that precedes God and he just knows it, or does it emanate from him? <br><br>The significance of the question is that if there is a good that precedes God, then if you know what that good is you can judge whether God is being good. But if good emanates from God, then what is dear to God is always good. In both cases though you have an unanswered question, they both seem to fold back into their opposite. How do you know who God is? What if you trust that good emanates from God, but you&#039;ve misidentified God? That is like a gnostic position that God can be a deceiver. But also if you are asking how to figure out who God really is by judging if he is truly good, then you have to figure out what is truly good, but then you run into the bizarre dilemma that you have lost your manner of measuring it (God) and are forced into the position of just having faith in whatever standard of good you land on. It can&#039;t be grounded, so it is as though you are forced back into the position of just trusting that your chosen God is the right one and he is the measure of the good.", "time": 1672437234, "resto": 21455817}, {"no": 21456160, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)16:54:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455817</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just finished Euthyphro.

It&#039;s a true dilemma, we don&#039;t know what the good is and we do actually erect standards of the good and have faith in them. There is an irony in Euthyphro, that Euthyphro is very likely judging his father for duplicitous or self-serving reasons, rather than an honest dedication to the belief that his father must be punished for a wrongdoing. His whole family is against what he is doing, and at the end of the dialogue Euthyphro evades Socrates rather than actually try to answer his questions and settle on a manner of discerning the justice of what he is doing to his father. So Plato is pointing out how, practically speaking, what motivates us to abandon &quot;God&quot;, or motivates us to judge our father, is something else like self-interest. We will believe in the goodness of our standards, like God, until enough terrible or unfortunate things happen that we begin to judge God, or alternatively until opportunities arise for our fortune that require judging God. <br><br>Socrates ultimately chooses to kill himself, as an expression of his devotion to the polis. He believes the polis has misjudged, but he also can&#039;t live in exile because it would go against his belief that he owes his life to the polis, so he simply ends it as the court commanded. I think Plato is laying his cards on the table there to an extent, that he thinks Euthyphro is bad and Socrates is virtuous, but personally I think Socrates is just faithful. Socrates doesn&#039;t give the &quot;right&quot; answer, but also not necessarily the &quot;wrong&quot; one.

Longfellow\u2019s achievements in fictional and nonfictional prose, in a striking variety of poetic forms and modes, and in translation from many European languages resulted in a remarkably productive and influential literary career. His celebrity in his own time, however, has yielded to changing literary tastes and to reactions against the genteel tradition of authorship he represented. Even if time has proved him something less than the master poet he never claimed to be, Longfellow made pioneering contributions to American literary life by exemplifying the possibility of a successful authorial career, by linking American poetry to European traditions beyond England, and by developing a surprisingly wide readership for Romantic poetry.</span>", "filename": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1153, "h": 1600, "tn_w": 90, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672405327486585, "time": 1672405327, "md5": "ZDqYnTQlIoyEU+QqMcFLrw==", "fsize": 189633, "resto": 21454033}, {"no": 21454192, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)09:11:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wow that&#039;s a beautiful poem.

Western society has eliminated those constrictions and we are now experiencing the full force of unbidden female nature. There is no longer anything external in place to funnel non-fat virgins into early marriages. Not to get all chud-cel but it&#039;s unironically over, the genie&#039;s not going back in the bottle while any of us are alive.

I had my fair share without being chad. Like I said, I had to think outside of the box and find ways to succeed in spite of the system. I had a 4 year relationship in my 20s and a 4 year relationship in my 30s plus maybe half a dozen other &lt;1yr relationships. I never quite found my perfect match but I had happy relationships and in fact my girlfriend in my 20s left me because I refused to marry her. I&#039;m just shifting gears now because of course as an older man you can&#039;t meet girls the same way and in the same volume as you did when you were young. I&#039;m excited to find myself a girl from another century in the third world and I&#039;m happy with my memories of the girls I got to be with. But definitely time for me to start a family in the next few years. I&#039;ll be staying in Asia. <br><br>I say the same thing in every incel thread but the real redpill on women is it&#039;s not about your stats, it&#039;s about prolonged exposure aka propinquity and access. Most of us simply can&#039;t become ingroup enough with people we&#039;ve just met, even if it goes straight to dating and fucking. You just don&#039;t value or feel invested enough in people you only just met. Don&#039;t get me wrong, obviously it does happen, but it&#039;s a very delicate thing, easy to break. Obviously the opposite is propinquity as I said. So the answer isn&#039;t to go to bars or get better photos on dating apps or even to go to where girls are. It&#039;s to be part of a group or organisation of some kind that forces you to work together with girls. And if you want to guarantee your success, be in a position of authority in the group/have higher status than them, i.e. the leader of a church youth group or the organiser of church events. I emphasise church because religion is the last external pressure that funnels women into early marriage and non-whoredom. <br><br>Again bro, get creative. Google &quot;Jane Austen larp&quot; and you&#039;ll be stunned how popular that sort of thing is. Doesn&#039;t have to be church, you just need to get yourself somewhere you&#039;re working in a group with girls. From there, girlfriending is inevitable. I&#039;m impressed with your optimism and I believe you will make it.", "time": 1672388027, "resto": 21448951}, {"no": 21453189, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:19:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21449724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21449724</a><br>Notes from underground", "time": 1672388357, "resto": 21448951}, {"no": 21453209, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)03:23:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21449896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21449896</a><br>Cause doesn&#039;t exist.", "time": 1672388597, "resto": 21448951}, {"no": 21453695, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)05:46:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21453189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21453189</a><br>Stop pretending like you&#039;ve read notes from the underground", "time": 1672397163, "resto": 21448951}, {"no": 21453870, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)07:09:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21453695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21453695</a><br>Kill yourself you fucking subhuman nigger.

The Sound and the Fury is a little too Europeanly experimental to be ideal Faulkner. Still, it was just this bridgelike quality to which I initially responded. If he wrote in the world of Joyce, he had to be all right.

To use another Gass quote:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The funny, comical, side-splitting thing about Nabokovian thing is that Nabokov&#039;s novels are frequently formless, or when form presides it&#039;s mechanical, lacking instinct, desire, feeling, life (nostalgia is the honest bloodstream of his books, their skin his witty and wonderful eye); ... Nabokov&#039;s novels often, especially as described by Proffer and by Dembo&#039;s dozen, seem like those Renaissance designs of flying machines\u2014dreams enclosed in finely drawn lines\u2014which are intended to intrigue, to dazzle, but not to fly.</span><br>This perfectly (almost to an alarming degree) sums up my experience with Nabokov as a whole, and this experience was solidified when I dug into his series of lectures on other novels. Nabokov is too damn artificial; I read the books he lectured on and then read them a second time with his lecture as a guide, and he reduces all of it, every single book, to patterns. It&#039;s all patterns and designs to him. It&#039;s hard to describe but there&#039;s no life in him. It feels like he tried to bring literature closer to science, to set down some objective facts and measures against which books could be judged, but its all patterns and designs. Going back and reading his novels, especially his early ones, you see that even the emotional moments feel like they&#039;re on tracks; all the characters move on tracks, the plot turns and shifts exactly when he wants too.

Solaris has been more difficult for me to properly express what I felt than anything else I&#039;ve read in a long while, and I don&#039;t know that I did so that well. Maybe that&#039;s to be expected for a book about human limitations. The greatest limitation to my enjoyment was that I had already accepted and agreed to the premises, but also moved past them, so their demonstrations were met by indifference rather than any kind of strong emotional response. Yes, humanity is limited in many ways, I find that to be self-evident and obvious. Yes, rationality and empathy can be easily manipulated, perhaps especially through self-delusion. Yes, simulacrum can be treated similar to the original, or on its own terms. Yes, there exists that which is beyond our current comprehension, and perhaps it always will be.<br><br>This was like two books for me. One was a relationship drama and the other was a fictional nonfiction work about the specific details about the alien/planet. I liked the former more than the latter, which is what the movies focused on, though I haven&#039;t seen them and I probably won&#039;t. Solaris was iconoclastic, which was amusing, but also a killjoy. My response to almost all of that was, &quot;Ok, sure, but so what?&quot;. Overall there wasn&#039;t much entertainment for me, which is understandable, because I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what it was about.<br><br>In both the book and reader reactions, much is made of the inscrutability of the alien, that they&#039;re truly alien in their lack of comprehensibility. Humanity is unable to accept this, and thus must impose meaning upon it in any way possible. Many decades of theories are presented and much action is taken, but none of it matters. Humanity feels that it remains insufficiently acknowledged. I&#039;m conflicted about whether Lem should&#039;ve gone all the way by not having any sort of response or reaction at all. That would&#039;ve driven the point even further, but I don&#039;t know if it would&#039;ve been readable, let alone popular, if he had done so. It&#039;s all very allegorical. The proper approach to me would be to accept our limitations and disengage. If it ever wants to contact, then it can do so, or not. Uncertainty has to be tolerated, because too often the resolution is the elimination of its source, which may also be the end of the uncertain ones. I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s any inherent value in incomprehensibility, as sometimes seems to be the case for the literary where obscurantism almost seems to be a virtue. If something can&#039;t be understood, then it must be great, is certainly one of the reactions they have to the alien, and I feel like that may also apply to many of the readers. It&#039;s also why I don&#039;t think it is. All of this may seem like I disliked the book, but I didn&#039;t. It&#039;s just that I believe the ideal time for me to have read it has long since passed.<br><br>Rating: 3/5", "filename": "Solaris", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 467, "h": 700, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672427133244890, "time": 1672427133, "md5": "ETgxH2MMDKUYPQAz4dfJzQ==", "fsize": 220493, "resto": 21453564, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21455324, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:12:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455230</a><br>take ur meds boomer<br>the russians bots are not real and they are not in this room rn", "time": 1672427552, "resto": 21453564}, {"no": 21455346, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:16:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455293</a><br>Huh?", "time": 1672427783, "resto": 21453564}, {"no": 21455347, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)14:16:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21455097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21455097</a><br>Sure, I agree more with the spirit of your comment rather than the literal meaning.

As for the third book, its disappointing. that book probably deserves better than two stars, but I just can&#039;t bring myself to call it good, because I didn&#039;t really enjoy it even though I read it fairly quickly. Don&#039;t get me wrong: it&#039;s interesting enough, and the characters are still vaguely engaging, and there&#039;s plenty of action. By all means, the formula is there (even though it does feel a little bit tired).<br><br>So what&#039;s the problem? I guess I was just hoping Abercrombie would be able to salvage some of his characters and bring the story to a satisfying conclusion, but frustratingly, most of the characters end up less likeable at the end than they were at the beginning, and the book&#039;s &quot;conclusion&quot; feels loose and sloppy.<br><br>I&#039;m okay with a &quot;no good and no evil&quot; sort of world, with ambiguous heroes, but for crying out loud, Abercrombie can&#039;t seem to come up with a sympathetic character, or any sort of heroic progression. His characters are in turn spineless, self-centered, vengeful, ruthless, feckless, and amazingly passive. Unlikeable in the extreme. Logen seems to be a completely different character from one book to the next, Ferro is static, Glokta becomes boring (can he stop tonguing his gums for a page or two, please?), and Jezal crumples into a worthless sack of dookie. By the end of the book, there was not a single character I was rooting for, and I really didn&#039;t care whether they lived or died. In fact, I was kind of hoping they would die, since then there wouldn\u2019t be any sequels. Whatever happened to characters like Elric of Melnibone, Raven of the Black Company, Caine, Tyrion Lannister, Riddick, et al?<br><br>The humor seems to have disappeared by the third book, as well. This is too bad, since humor actually makes the characters a lot more sympathetic.<br><br>There is also some odd plotting. The logic of Bayaz is baffling: why exactly is he spending so much effort to build an empire when he could have accomplished his goals with a lot less hassle (he is, after all, incredibly rich and powerful and all that). And why does he show so little interest in &quot;his&quot; empire? Not even a hint of pride? What\u2019s the point?<br><br>In the end, that\u2019s what I came to. What exactly was the point of the story?<br><br>Oh well.
