The only reference to it comes from James Clear in his book Atomic Habits (where it&#039;s framed as a pottery class) but iirc there&#039;s no citation there either. The truth is quantity does not trump quality (as evidenced by the millions of words written by fan fiction authors and amateur web novelists that never get any better). If you really want to improve you need to work fewer hours with more focus and intensity. You need to apply the principles of deliberate practice: break down the activity into sub-skills, then train those sub-skills, (starting with your weakest), via repeatable drills that provide immediate feedback. <br><br>In the past, novice writers would be able to get feedback (even if only in the form of rejection) by submitting to the numerous magazines that were available. Before that, there were writer&#039;s groups, either in universities or private clubs (or even family, e.g the Bronte sisters), where they would share their writing with each other. Nowadays the options are limited. Magazines are on the decline, publication is biased by identity politics, and writing groups have moved online (and are filled with overly sensitive types that barely know the rudiments). <br><br>What you can do instead is to try and learn by imitation. A dozen or so of your favorite volumes of literature, emblematic of the kind of material you want to produce, can take you to a professional level very quickly. But you have to train in a systematic way. I&#039;ve seen people on this board recommend things like just typing out the words of a novel or taking notes while reading. These are not sufficient. Something like the Franklin Method is closer to the point. On the more extreme side there&#039;s things like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8<wbr>1Q3osi8c (I don&#039;t necessarily recommend such detailed abstraction). A middle ground would be an exercise like the following (taken from: https://usermanual.wiki/Pdf/Michael<wbr>20KardosThe20Art20and20Craft20of20F<wbr>iction20A20WriterE28099s20GuideBedf<wbr>ordSt20MartinE28099s202012.20115098<wbr>23.pdf): <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First, analyze a short story to uncover the function of each of its sections.

The idea is that there are two parts to the human condition. On the one hand, we are immanent, in the world, as the totality of objective facts. This is also called &quot;facticity.&quot; It is the facts that are true about us. We share this with the rest of the world&#039;s inhabitants (objects, animals, etc). On the other hand, as human beings there is a second aspect, we are transcendent and go beyond the facts about us, having an inward, subjective experience, we are importantly free. This is also known as &quot;freedom.&quot; Many existentialist authors have further things to say about this duality, and how it relates to authenticity, to alienation, to anxiety, and so forth.

Yes, left is associated with the occult, and evil, but also simply unorthodox or hidden paths. Death is certainly a mystery, and a fearful thing. The left makes sense.<br><br>Death is the wise advisor because you can turn to him at any time and ask him &quot;Is this my time?&quot;. Mostly it will not be your time. So you keep on living.<br><br>The whole point of the Death example is to point you towards a feeling, a state of mind, that he wants to get you to tap into. This was best exemplified, for me, in the section of Ixtlan where he is made to face the tiger/lion. The feeling of good living is one of urgency, as though every moment is your last. And it may well be your last. So keep Death in mind. Live fully, now. This state of mind is found in many mystical writings. It is essentially being present, &#039;now&#039;, it&#039;s a fluid state where you make no second guesses and act instinctively with courage in spite of the fear. Finding this feeling and learning to maintain it is the key to good living for Castaneda, as well as the key to magic for him, and also for other mystical traditions.<br><br>As for your bit about &#039;lover killer&#039;, well, I think an essential part of love is dying. In occult writings they speak of dying before death to fully live. A man must die twice. Love itself, also, could be seen as dying as you pour your essence into another, you live for another, you essentially move the point of your soul into another location, in the same way that Jung spoke of his goal of individuation being to move the consciousness from the ego to the Self (Self here being the witness, or God-mind.

According to Egyptian mythology, the latter had arrived on the coasts of Africa from an Eastern country beyond the sea. It is fair to think that it was India. There are many clues proving this origin, as the form in which the Horus priests appeared: they had a\u015bikh\u0101on their shaved head, and wore a whitedhotiunder a leopard skin, as the\u015baivaascetics.

However, this is not the case. Rural settings are only ever exploited as places of danger for urban or suburban protagonists, and their denizens are suspicious and vile. The crime genre (as well as literary fiction centered around crime) gravitates to small towns and portrays them as dens of murder and hypocrisy despite the fact that large cities are usually far more dangerous. Only a handful of working authors, almost all of them over 50 and rural born, portray the vast hinterlands of the USA with any measure of sympathy. The rest of the literary elite are islanded in a handful of mega-metropolitan areas and, it must be said, do not view the provincials as their countrymen, nor, often, as full human beings.

Stanislaw Lesniewski was the founder of contemporary mereology, especially when cast in a formal language. The Warsaw School was founded by Kasimierz Twardowski who was a student of Franz Brentano, who also taught Husserl and another proto-analytic (Alexius Meinong), so there&#039;s some connection there to both analytic and continental history.<br><a href=\"#p21280942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21280942</a><br>I don&#039;t know of a good pre-history book like you&#039;re describing but I can try to tell you a pre-history myself, not an expert but I have some idea. Dummett&#039;s book is fantastic but long and difficult, so it&#039;s worth a look eventually, however maybe not as a direct first introduction to Frege (I am OP).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Husserl</span><br>I feel what happened here that led to continental 20th century philosophy is that, though he was sort of doing stuff similar to analytics initially, mostly making very conservative (relative to the later phenomenologists) analyses of mental experience, later phenomenologists basically got much more creative and especially turned to analyzing aspects of lived experience (like for example, anxiety) that go well beyond what analytics tend to focus on (for better or worse). So that&#039;s what Heidegger, Sartre, and so forth are doing. Here their antecedents really are Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, more than Husserl, since Kierkegaard was basically doing proto-phenomenology, giving analyses of anxiety, faith, irony, and other feelings and lived experiences. Nietzsche is also similar, and what he&#039;s doing analyzing moral conscience on the one hand, and even our use of categories like susbtance, causation, oneness, etc, is kind of like what Heidegger and Sartre do. Other proto-phenomenologists like Kant and Hegel are also important to them. Husserl kind of limits himself to Kant I think, and so does Frege, they&#039;re of course both going past Kant sometimes, critiquing him, etc. But you don&#039;t see Frege engage Hegel, Kierkegaard, etc.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pre-history</span><br>The main thing necessary is to understand Kant, and especially knowing the neo-Kantians were becoming a thing around the time, since Frege is willing to grant that geometry might be synthetic a priori, but he strongly rejects seeing arithmetic as synthetic. He is more influenced by Leibniz when he conceives of them as analytic, this shows through in the Grundlagen/Foundations of Arithmetic. His next main influence was Cantor, who came up with the modern notion of a set and began set theory. He was also reacting against some mathematicians (Hilbert later is a good example) who saw mathematics as just the manipulation of symbols according to some rules, and thus not as objective or truth-apt. And he of course is responding to Kantians in another way, by rejecting psychologism, heir to transcendental idealism.", "time": 1668965606, "resto": 21277936}, {"no": 21281691, "now": "11/20/22(Sun)12:47:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21280942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21280942</a><br><a href=\"#p21281634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21281634</a><br>(Con&#039;t)<br>If you are interested in knowing proto-analytic history,not always leading up directly to Frege but still foreshadowing other things, I recommend you look into the following names: Herbart, Bolzano, Comte, Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick, the neo-Kantians, Avenarius, Mach, Brentano, Meinong, and Dilthey. Also Peirce, James, Dewey. Maybe even Green, Bradley and McTaggart (I&#039;ll explain).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;neo-Kantianism</span><br>These guys like Cohen and Natorp and later Cassirer are indicative of a revival of pre-Hegelian Kantianism in the later 19th century. What people like Frege and Russell were doing was in a way continuing this return to Kant and earlier, but in their own ways.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;early positivism</span><br>This is Comte as well as utilitarians like Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick, and the &quot;empirio-critical&quot; German positivists like Avenarius and Mach. Comte aside (not sure about him) these guys were phenomenalists, so it&#039;s a nice link between Hume (the first phenomenalist) and later ones like the middle-stage Russell, logical positivists like Schlick and the early Carnap, and other sense data theorists like C.I. Lewis and H.H. Price. Mach was very influential to the early positivists, while Mill was Russell&#039;s godfather.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brentano circle</span><br>Brentano may have influenced Frege. Meinong certainly influenced Russell directly. Since Husserl was Brentano&#039;s student it&#039;s also good to check out how this is the origin of the divide. Brentano has influenced later analytics because of his views on intentionality, which also influenced continentals via Husserl. So in a weird way he, rather than Kant, is the last philosopher they both share. Chisholm is an analytic who especially likes Brentano, but he matters to many in philosophy of mind.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bolzano</span><br>This guy is basically Frege before Frege, and influenced Frege, Brentano, others. He argues that propositions exist as abstract objects, and is a good bridge from Kant to Frege.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Herbart</span><br>Totally forgotten now but he&#039;s the earliest example of how not all post-Kantian philosophy was Hegel/Schopenhauer idealism and the stuff that came out of that. Herbart was coming up with mathematizations of psychology and has interesting views like his theory of color blending. Probably the earliest proto-analytic in spirit, but didn&#039;t influence anyone other than being anti-psychologistic apparently.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dilthey</span><br>Very influential to Carnap. Also influential to continentals, mainly via Heidegger. As weird as it seems Carnap and Heidegger are actually very very similar, and it probably owes to Dilthey.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pragmatists</span><br>Peirce was doing symbolic logic stuff. With James and Dewey, they&#039;re antecedents of the constructivist and neo-pragmatist brand of analytic philosophy, especially in America (Goodman, Quine, Sellars, Davidson, Putnam, Rorty), so quite influential.

McTaggart gave an argument against the reality of time which lays down the basic idea of A-theory vs. B-theory of time, which has been very influential to analytics.
