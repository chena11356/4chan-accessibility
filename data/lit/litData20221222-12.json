You&#039;re physically inferior to men in virtually every way, the entirety of history is built by the accomplishments of men while your gender was treated as part of the household with no access to education until around the 19th century, you&#039;re biologically made to take care of kids while men go on adventures and shit, and with exceptions like Hannah Arendt, women thinkers only ever talk about gender issues cuz they don&#039;t have anything original to say. I guess for an intelligent women who&#039;s aware of all these things it must be a very concerning or at least interesting state of affairs, especially if you want to be seen as an individual and not just a baby making machine but aren&#039;t satisfied by all the woke feminist bs, if not outright reject it. One thing that separates men from women is that men are detached from their gender, they don&#039;t ever think about &quot;being a man/male&quot; in that existential sense, they just see themselves as human beings first and foremost who just so happen to have xy chromosomes. In short, men are genderless in a way, or rather, they&#039;re the default, whereas women are the secondaries that follow behind and compare themselves to men, either positively or negatively. So if I were you, try to detach yourself from your gender, look at women perhaps how men would, and go from there. Studies show female average intelligence is the exact same as male average intelligence, so there&#039;s no reason you couldn&#039;t do this. If you were a man, do you think you&#039;d be more sexist? I feel like if I were a woman I&#039;d be a little misogynistic and just consider myself an outlier or whatever. Just a final note: a lot of feminists claim that men are fragile because they feel threatened when women act confident and smart and talk back to you. We&#039;re not threatened, we just find it obnoxious that you think acting like a stuck up bitch equals to being more respected.", "filename": "2d72c84104001cfe1a33db8c880a0e88", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1671639696951947, "time": 1671639696, "md5": "zObE59YOu/aeTZ+msDBG8A==", "fsize": 65207, "resto": 21413935}, {"no": 21414034, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21414023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21414023</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re physically inferior to men in virtually every way</span><br>Women are actually physically superior to men in every respect except brute strength. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Love longer</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Endure disease better</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Higher pain tolerance</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More aesthetically pleasing</span>", "time": 1671640059, "resto": 21413935}, {"no": 21414036, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:28:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413970</a><br>lol, high effort bait by low iq subhuman", "time": 1671640127, "resto": 21413935}, {"no": 21414037, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:29:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413970</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Eventually someone would have come to the same conclusions and written the same insights</span><br>Maybe, but it would\u2019ve been someone just like them.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In fact, if women and POC were allowed to give their insights to the world and not denied education and careers these insights would undoubtedly have been made far more quickly</span><br>Colossal cope.

Typically male political philosophy has worried about how to get from the state of nature to the state of society, what is lost in this transition, etc. But feminists have been taught to BEGIN with a mixture of both premises, basically, to begin with the assumption that one can have one&#039;s cake and eat it too. <br><br>This is because the men who originated these theories (state of nature, social contract, natural rights of man, war of all against all, etc.) were working and thinking in the context of the Reformation, with its mutually exclusive claims to ultimate authority, the French Wars of Religion, the monarchomachs and politiques, Calvinist claims of the right of resistance, Stuart and Valois claims to absolute authority, the English Civil War, etc. They either saw up close people who were killed or exiled for their beliefs, or were themselves killed, exiled, or suppressed for them, like Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Algernon Sydney, etc. All of these ideas come out of a context of men trying to get down to brass tacks, to give answers to ultimate questions of how political life can or must be organized and what this means for the individual. <br><br>Women entered into this discourse only two or three centuries into it, with Wollstonecraft&#039;s response to Rousseau, which was actually a good response insofar as it simply argued that women should be treated as men (fully responsible adults) and not as dependents (children). But in the 19th century liberalism and individualism came to be so taken for granted by whiggish histories of progress and &quot;democracy&quot; that mediocre male thinkers began forgetting the original, problematic and polemic (agonal) context of the ideas of liberty and the natural rights of the individual, and as rare female thinker is generally equivalent to a mediocre male thinker, all female thinkers began from this position of simultaneously forgetting the roots and taking for granted the fruits of the Enlightenment.", "time": 1671658685, "resto": 21413935}, {"no": 21415300, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:39:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415293</a><br>It&#039;s not that women&#039;s reflexively assumed version of the Enlightenment is naive or childish.

He assumes all civil wars are fundamentally tractable. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so interesting to pair him with Hobbes.

This is almost like a scientific approach to the text. which arguments are consistent and brilliant and which ones one sided and blind? what is left out? what is assumed? can we swap out or take over parts of arguments and leave out others or are they necessarily intertwined? Using this approach you&#039;ll find that Schoppenhauer and Nietzsche made some brilliant critiques and arguments of some philosophical assumptions while being profoundly uncritical of others in a way that have nothing to do with the rest of their system. Nothing in Nietzsche&#039;s or Schoppenhauer&#039;s arguments naturally leads to their views on women. In fact in many cases its even antithetical to it, and in this mode of thinking, should simply be discarded as trash. <br><br>2. look at the work as written by a specific thinker with specific experiences, intuitions and temperament. What sort of person in what sort of position in society produced this? what were they dealing or struggling with and how did this lead to their philosophical insights? in this mode, if you find a completely wrong argument, it is not simply to be discarded, but should be questioned. if this specific part of the writers temperament produced this obvious error, we should be suspicious of other places where this temperament is applied in similar ways. Why is Nietzsche, a man that was physically weak and unwell for most of his life, so obsessed with health and power? is he hypocritical or must we refine our interpretation of health and strength as intimately tied with the overcoming of suffering? if his views on women so obviously reflect a resentment stemming from his love life, how should we treat his views on resentment? perhaps we might start to suspect that it is not just the oppressed that create resentment, but that its something intimately tied to those in power as well<br><br>The two approaches should inform each other i think. The first approach is used to find the particularities of the text that start to inform you of the temperament of the writer, and vice versa, the temperament and resulting blind spots of the author can start to raise suspicions of logical arguments you previously considered sound.", "filename": "Minerva-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 569, "h": 901, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 124, "tim": 1671712232596106, "time": 1671712232, "md5": "Wr+nsR8qScTJVXWFrZKNrg==", "fsize": 276875, "resto": 21413935}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21414046, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:31:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Worth a read?", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 1669, "h": 2560, "tn_w": 162, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1671640292658584, "time": 1671640292, "md5": "dmfOYWOpXX163oa85EuhvQ==", "fsize": 2036033, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "worth-a-read", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 27, "images": 3, "unique_ips": 19}, {"no": 21414055, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:34:32", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21414046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21414046</a><br>No, sorry.", "time": 1671640472, "resto": 21414046}, {"no": 21414059, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:36:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21414046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21414046</a><br>Yes, actually.

Another saddening thoughts is that even if I manage to fix my life, there&#039;s no going back to the past and reliving the experience with a different mindset. Who&#039;s to blame? Maybe it&#039;s God, Destiny or me. I&#039;m so confused about life and nothing makes sense, like I want to carve my own path but I do not trust myself over other people.", "time": 1671638413, "resto": 21412413}, {"no": 21413995, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:14:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It&#039;s like a fog I guess.

I was born at a unique time so I age with the century. <br>The realization that I&#039;m no longer an adolescent and all the things afforded to adolescence is now gone from me feels like a giant rugpull. Time is moving faster and faster and it feels like the years are emptier and more hollow. Less intense, less exciting, less meaningful. And thats how I came to feel the full weight of time. I really came to understand the meaning of finitude. I talked a lot about it on this general back at the turn of the last year. I had some funny ideas about how humans walk on the edge of eternity and temporality. Someone reccomended I read Unamuno whom I enjoyed. <br>So I guess it&#039;s twofold. I feel the march towards death as the final end, but I also feel the process of agingand how it affects me within the duration of life. I dont want to be a tired old man with creaky knees and aching joints. I dont want a wrinkled face and receeding hairline. I want to be able to run and jump and go on benders and really feel the full presence of life. But I know that at least half of my natural life span will be beyond that point, with the enjoyment of life as such as only a memory and a regret.

Nobody could teach me or train me, I had to find a way to do it myself. My quest eventually led me to the fundamental problems of existence: metaphysics, and to process philosophy, which gave me the tools I needed to synchronize my wings.

But that&#039;s where I see stoicism stop; analysis is confined to the context of the present moment. Rather than getting to the root of why your emotional response is occurring, you&#039;re expected to recognize that you&#039;re response is inappropriate then act differently. But that only works to change your verbal response to the situation and not your emotional response; in the future you&#039;ll likely react in the same unreasonable way to a similar situation unless you introspect and get at the root cause of why your emotions are your enemy in these situations. I don&#039;t believe reasoning in the moment alone is enough to shift your baseline emotional response; you need to do deep introspective work so that your emotions eventually work in your favor.

One of the most effective ways to remember what you have read is to take notes as you read. This can help you focus your attention on key points and ideas, and it gives you something to refer back to later.<br><br>2. Practice recalling information: Try to recall what you have read without looking at your notes or the original text. This can help you test your understanding and retention of the material.<br><br>3. Review your notes and summaries regularly: Reviewing what you have learned on a regular basis can help reinforce the information in your memory. You can also create summaries of the main points to help you review and retain the material more effectively.<br><br>4. Use mnemonic devices: Mnemonic devices are memory aids that can help you remember complex information by associating it with something more familiar or easier to remember. For example, you could use an acronym or create a mental image to help you remember a list of items.<br><br>5. Engage with the material: Try to actively engage with the material you are reading by asking yourself questions, discussing it with others, or applying the concepts to real-life situations.

Indeed, the animus power does need more limitations in general. Darkstalker and Anemone throw around spells as fast as a greeting. However, Turtle doesn&#039;t use his animus power flippantly. He&#039;s careful and timid and i can think of ten ways he could have trivialized this story in as many minutes. He was just being used as a tool so the reader can see what&#039;s going on around Darkstalker. I didn&#039;t feel like he grew whatsoever by the end of the book. I really, really wanted to love him because he was awesome in the other books as part of the friend group and I was very disappointed with him. There was so much he could&#039;ve done but he&#039;s mostly static.<br><br>Tui&#039;s particular brand of humour continues - though more muted than Book 8. Turtle is not the most exciting of protagonists as he is a self-admitted coward and generally passive wishing to stay in the background. It&#039;s strong trait for him to carry as a character but makes for slower reading than Peril\u2019s book. Resultantly, I found the book bit slow, especially in the middle/end where my interest meandered a bit. At first, I loved the spying, but after a while it just felt...pointless. Like, if he had been axed out of this book, it wouldn&#039;t really have affected anything. <br><br>Darkstalker is frankly the real main character here with turtle keeping hidden the whole way and he continues to be one of the most devious and best-written villain characters in general I&#039;ve seen in a long time. He&#039;s this sticky oily kind of evil that thinks he&#039;s charming and lovable and a generous guy everyone should like, but he&#039;s just scary underneath. Maybe he&#039;s just controlling. He does these horrific petty, and vast reaching vindictive acts that everyone tells him are bad and it all just washes off him like water to a duck . . .. He&#039;s a black pit of malice and pride that&#039;s willfully ignorant of itself like a scorpain that stings the frog and denies it would ever do such a thing in one breath and then says the frog deserved it in the next. <br><br>As much as I love the new books (6, 7, 8, and 9), the dragons in them have too much power. There seems to be too much focus on special powers (mindreading, fire scales, animus magic) rather than sheer characterization. I liked that about the first books, the dragonets had to rely on cleverness and each other rather than powers. I&#039;m hoping the 10th book will be about a powerless dragon (and a little searching shows the pov character should be Qibli, whom I preferred over Kinkajou anyway).<br><br>Normally I like special-powered characters. I&#039;m not sure why it bothers me in this series Maybe it&#039;s that the animus power doesn&#039;t have enough limitations and overshadows the other powers too much.<br><br>3.8/5", "filename": "2000[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 854, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 53, "tim": 1671676438702876, "time": 1671676438, "md5": "7lDGSCh0ZWWihIFrN6QO+A==", "fsize": 294070, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416418, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:47:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just bought Joe Abercrombie&#039;s The First Law books and Brandon Sanderson&#039;s Mistborn Era 1", "time": 1671677275, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416422, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:49:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416332</a><br>Please explain to me how endless worldbuilding isn&#039;t masturbatory<br>Howard wrote fuck all compared to tolkien yet his hyborian age feels more real and lived in than any part of middle earth", "time": 1671677394, "resto": 21413185}, {"no": 21416434, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:54:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;DCC dude&#039;s patreon two months out of date on kemono</span><br>Get to it, paypigs.

Despite the widespread attention it received, the tweet remains a mystery to this day, as Trump and his administration never offered an explanation for its content.</span>", "time": 1671638473, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21413974, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:05:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413695</a>", "filename": "1627385141480(3)", "ext": ".png", "w": 810, "h": 469, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 72, "tim": 1671638708285423, "time": 1671638708, "md5": "/Xxe4pHuG4TOX9Yih64ZDg==", "fsize": 169445, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21413984, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:09:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413965</a><br>what else would it be, master detective?", "time": 1671638992, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21413991, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:13:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": ".", "filename": "A826733D-1C3D-4E99-9EC2-7D6A7B38754B", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 843, "h": 996, "tn_w": 105, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671639197093531, "time": 1671639197, "md5": "Ert9JcI1RbHdRXRUz6T8bw==", "fsize": 204362, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21413992, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:13:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "I love the Diet Coke one.<br>His longer form writing isn&#039;t that bad either.", "time": 1671639238, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21414091, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:45:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413992</a><br>It is optimized, you just can&#039;t just a single character.", "filename": "Trump diet coke", "ext": ".png", "w": 600, "h": 277, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 57, "tim": 1671641120476669, "time": 1671641120, "md5": "0bc24t5JkPR6fcgBW3t0bw==", "fsize": 13128, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415356, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:53:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413695</a><br>And in one tweet this orange motherfucker memes covid into existence", "time": 1671659627, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415361, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:55:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413695</a><br>I mean, undeserving cunts like Churchill and Russell won it, so why not.", "time": 1671659709, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415419, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:05:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413695</a><br>I would gladly watch Trump hang if one from the Left was also chosen.", "time": 1671660357, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415434, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:08:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Omg I can\u2019t belief that idiot wrote covfefe what even is that and people VOTED for him Lol", "time": 1671660538, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415454, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:12:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "... oh for a muse of fire, that ascends the highest reaches of invention, a kingdom for a stage... monarchs to act... and rosie o&#039;donnelll looks like a pig, sad", "time": 1671660767, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415471, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:16:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21414091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21414091</a><br>Really makes you think.", "time": 1671660962, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415484, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:18:43", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "j1tpe4ae6sn01[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 699, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 121, "tim": 1671661123759384, "time": 1671661123, "md5": "02nxy5/sLpJZpzrn+iGWcA==", "fsize": 32129, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415559, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:37:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415471</a><br>The sequel isn&#039;t too bad either.", "filename": "Trump diet coke india", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1318, "h": 1078, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 102, "tim": 1671662276945931, "time": 1671662276, "md5": "8QKKH0y3tu8TSVaOvh7Tag==", "fsize": 152699, "resto": 21413695}, {"no": 21415585, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)17:45:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21413695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21413695</a><br>There&#039;s nobody better at tweeting than Donald Trump.

Now I no longer care because I see possible solutions. I independently discovered open individualism through the intuition that I will be reincarnated but with no order, karma, or souls whatsoever. A few weeks ago I was bored so I decided to solve the problem of the edge of space, and after thinking for 7-10 minutes I realized that this universe has no edge and is finite at the same time, because it is a 3-torus, a slice of a 4D space. So the only \u201cedge\u201d is in an entirely imperceptible dimension. I view everything through the lens of evolution, the emergence of order and complexity from chaos. For this reason I don\u2019t believe in God, since causality evolved, the universe evolved, life evolved, and religion evolved. Who can blame ancient humans for crediting the gods with lightning?

That&#039;s how it&#039;s been with me this year. <br>Although I still feel that urge to consume and tally books and other media, I&#039;ve also realized this year that it doesn&#039;t matter how many books you read, as long as you are reading, because you can only do one thing at a time. The more important thing is how deeply engaged you are with what you read. I have a list of over 100 books I want to read, and I still find myself searching for new titles. The searching is a source of pleasure in itself. It&#039;s like window shopping. It also provides a feeling of security, in that you are satisfied at having made the best decision which will ensure pleasure and safety in the future. Additionally it&#039;s a release of tension, but the tension is due to a buildup of anxiety rather than of a physical need. I put all of this behaviour under the category of mental masturbation, where masturbation is an analogy for the release of tension.<br>I think the source of this mental masturbation behaviour is anxiety. You want to experience as much as possible before it&#039;s too late. You want other people to see you experiencing many things. Fundamentally, you want to make the correct choices from among a staggering sea of options. It&#039;s the same as what gives rise to self-improvement obsessions, as well as the tendency to categorize things into top 10 lists. Too much choice creates confusion about the future. Anxiety is born of intelligence and the overabundance of choice. The intelligence faculty is driven to strike an optimal path through the sea of choice, and arrive at an orderly route. <br>If either choice or intelligence is reduced, the anxiety does not occur. Imagine a person with access to fewer books (let alone other media). When they found one great book, they would cherish it and reread it many times. It would inform the development of their mind to a much greater degree than someone who blows through 20 profound books in a year because there are too many to read and they want to check their list off. <br>But would the person with less choice be better off? Probably, but not necessarily. If people can recognize the process of anxious tension and release, and exercise a little bit of self-control, they can utilize their overabundance of choice by narrowing their focus drastically when their they find a book or an author they engage with deeply. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr </span><br>Do one thing at a time.", "time": 1671539571, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408719, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:35:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405913</a><br>the anti audiobook thing is pure cope", "time": 1671539743, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408727, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:41:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21408719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21408719</a><br>They&#039;re okay, personally I prefer audio-reading electronic music or ASMR.", "time": 1671540100, "resto": 21405898}, {"no": 21408739, "now": "12/20/22(Tue)07:47:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405898</a><br>Reading slowly and attentively is important, especially if you&#039;re reading literary fiction or the type of philosophy where the &#039;feel&#039; of the ideas counts.<br><br>For a long time I was reading things on the train on the way to work, just skimming over stories to fill time.

What&#039;s the point of watching a serious anime or reading a manga like Berserk or Kingdom when they&#039;re honestly not that great? They&#039;re certainly good at what they do so long as you judge them only against other, similar series in their medium, but the moment you take a step back and compare them to something outside that medium, their flaws stand out much more, and they begin to just become so tiresome to trudge through knowing you could&#039;ve enjoying yourself much more if you had picked up a good novel instead. This is why it&#039;s important to focus on what each medium does best, and for anime that isn&#039;t Dark Fantasy, that isn&#039;t Mystery, and it&#039;s definitely not Historical Fiction. It&#039;s Slice of Life and Iyashikei; Ecchi, Moe, and Comedy. Let literature be what you read when you want a riveting story, when you want to learn and sometimes even come back with some very wise, immediately applicable life advice. Let anime and manga be where you go to relax, looking for comfort in the benign. That&#039;s not to say a book can&#039;t comfort you, travel literature is great for that, but in my experience it&#039;s been a very different sort of comfort; a sort which again, I wouldn&#039;t look for in another medium, but allow it to stand out as being distinct in its function and and in its worth.", "filename": "1650815206407", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 960, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1671402194975201, "time": 1671402194, "md5": "XQyaf5OHgN5ZZjVHIsZnug==", "fsize": 97002, "resto": 21400647}, {"no": 21401644, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)17:24:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "hey I remember this thread", "time": 1671402243, "resto": 21400647}, {"no": 21401663, "now": "12/18/22(Sun)17:28:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21400647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21400647</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What the fuck, /lit/?

They are not talking about desires as in bodily impulses. Desire is harmful and seeds ignorance because if that desire is fulfilled, you simply want more of it, but if it is unfulfilled, you suffer. Thus all desire eventually culminates in suffering. This is speaking about spiritual/mental suffering, not the suffering your body experiences when it begins failing for lack of nutrients. The Buddha himself mastered the practices of ascetics and was at one point living off of a single grain of rice per day, but discovered that this could not give him enlightenment. Buddhism is all about the &quot;middle path,&quot; where one still lives out their life, but without getting attached to their actions and their consequences. <br><br>So before receiving buddhadharma, I would desire food for its flavour and other qualities. If I did not receive any food, yes I would eventually starve, but initially I would suffer purely because I was denied the experience of that sensory high. Even if I was offered something bland/bad but nutritional, I would turn it down.<br>With the buddhadharma in mind, one can (hopefully) detach themselves from desire, so that when denied food in this example, I would not suffer in this sense. Going further, I would also not suffer (beyond my body&#039;s pain) from starvation, as my desire for life is extinguished, meaning that I am indifferent to whether I live or die.<br>Why eat and drink when one is indifferent to their life?<br>Because the balance of karmic merit is only affected during life. Live so that the buddhadharma can continue to be spread, not to satiate your ego. The accumulation of merit not only affects your future lives, but the lives of those around you.<br>If you undeniably are living an unmeritous and harmful life, then I suppose choosing to no longer live is preferrable.", "time": 1671664283, "resto": 21414235}, {"no": 21415743, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:25:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21414289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21414289</a><br>The cause of suffering is grasping at a permanent self", "time": 1671665118, "resto": 21414235}, {"no": 21415749, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:27:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415115</a><br>Explain why driving in a Lamborghini is something satisfying to strive for", "time": 1671665271, "resto": 21414235}, {"no": 21415771, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:34:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "It is noble to control desires for created things, but the perfection of man is in his absolute desire for his Creator.", "filename": "11S17__39261", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 883, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 86, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671665647668206, "time": 1671665647, "md5": "p9Hzlr9YJ94iDrr945DqEg==", "fsize": 511864, "resto": 21414235}, {"no": 21415795, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:39:45", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415743</a><br>This.", "time": 1671665985, "resto": 21414235}, {"no": 21415805, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:42:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415743</a><br>Yes, and that is just another desire.

They open to us, in his own phrase, &quot;a mine of rich and pregnant fancy.&quot; His metrical style was influenced by Jonson and his imagery by Donne, for whom he had an almost servile admiration. Carew had a lucidity and directness of lyrical utterance unknown to Donne. It is perhaps his greatest distinction that he is the earliest of the Cavalier song-writers by profession, of whom John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, was a later example, poets who turned the disreputable incidents of an idle court-life into poetry which was often of the rarest delicacy and the purest melody and colour. The longest of Carew&#039;s poems, &quot;A Rapture,&quot; would be more widely appreciated if the rich flow of its imagination were restrained by greater reticence of taste.

This too, I believe, was stated by us before.<br><br>Cronos was aware of the fact that no human being (as we have explained) is capable of having irresponsible control of all human affairs without becoming filled with pride and injustice; so, pondering this fact, he then appointed as kings and rulers for our cities, not men, but beings of a race that was nobler and more divine, namely, daemons. He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them. In like manner the God, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of daemons who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Cronos, as tradition paints it, and order both our homes and our States in obedience to the immortal element within us, giving to reason&#039;s ordering the name of \u201claw.\u201d But if an individual man or an oligarchy or a democracy, possessed of a soul which strives after pleasures and lusts and seeks to surfeit itself therewith, having no continence and being the victim of a plague that is endless and insatiate of evil,\u2014 if such an one shall rule over a State or an individual by trampling on the laws, then there is (as I said just now) no means of salvation.", "filename": "Dionysus-or-Plato-Herculaneum-papyri-Villa-of-the-Papyri-Barker", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 548, "h": 746, "tn_w": 91, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671677819656849, "time": 1671677819, "md5": "9xFs0rzLQc7J/g5jwGZ5tw==", "fsize": 121507, "resto": 21416419}, {"no": 21416453, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)22:00:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416444</a><br>Sauce?

But no one has told the event which is the cause of them all, and so I must tell it now; for that will help us to make clear the nature of the king.<br><br>During a certain period God himself goes with the universe as guide in its revolving course, but at another epoch, when the cycles have at length reached the measure of his allotted time, he lets it go, and of its own accord it turns backward in the opposite direction, since it is a living creature and is endowed with intelligence by him who fashioned it in the beginning. Now this reversal of its motion is an inevitable part of its nature for the following reason.<br><br>&quot;What reason?&quot;<br><br>Absolute and perpetual immutability is a property of only the most divine things of all, and body does not belong to this class. Now that which we call heaven and the universe has received from its creator many blessed qualities, but then, too, it partakes also of a bodily nature; therefore it is impossible for it to be entirely free from change; it moves, however, so far as it is able to do so, with a single motion in the same place and the same manner, and therefore it has acquired the reverse motion in a circle, because that involves the least deviation from its own motion. But to turn itself for ever is hardly possible except for the power that guides all moving things; and that this should turn now in one direction and now in the opposite direction is contrary to divine law. As the result of all this, we must not say either that the universe turns itself always, or that it is always turned by God in two opposite courses, or again that two divinities opposed to one another turn it. The only remaining alternative is what I suggested a little while ago, that the universe is guided at one time by an extrinsic divine cause, acquiring the power of living again and receiving renewed immortality from the Creator, and at another time it is left to itself and then moves by its own motion, being left to itself at such a moment that it moves backwards through countless ages, because it is immensely large and most evenly balanced, and turns upon the smallest pivot.<br><br>Then, in the light of what has been said, let us consider and gain understanding of the event which we said was the cause of all those wonderful portents; for it is really just this. At certain periods the universe has its present circular motion, and at other periods it revolves in the reverse direction. We cannot help believing that of all the changes which take place in the heavens this reversal is the greatest and most complete. Therefore we must also believe that at the same time the greatest changes come upon us who dwell within the heavens.", "time": 1671681713, "resto": 21416419}, {"no": 21416670, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:05:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416653</a><br>And animals cannot well endure many great and various changes at once. That is a familiar fact, is it not? Inevitably, then, there is at that time great destruction of animals in general, and only a small part of the human race survives; and the survivors have many experiences wonderful and strange, the greatest of which, a consequence of the reversal of everything at the time when the world begins to turn in the direction opposed to that of its present revolution, is this. <br><br>First the age of all animals, whatever it was at the moment, stood still, and every mortal creature stopped growing older in appearance and then reversed its growth and became, as it were, younger and more tender; the hoary locks of the old men grew dark, and bearded cheeks grew smooth again as their possessors reverted to their earlier ages, and the bodies of young men grew smoother and smaller day by day and night by night, until they became as new-born babes, to which they were likened in mind and body; and then at last they wasted away entirely and wholly disappeared. And the bodies of those who died by violence in those times quickly underwent the same changes, were destroyed, and disappeared in a few days.<br><br>It is clear that being begotten of one another was no part of the natural order of that time, but the earth-born race which, according to tradition, once existed, was the race which returned at that time out of the earth; and the memory of it was preserved by our earliest ancestors, who were born in the beginning of our period and therefore were next neighbors to the end of the previous period of the world&#039;s revolution, with no interval between. For they were to us the heralds of these stories which are nowadays unduly disbelieved by many people. For you must, I think, consider what would result. It is a natural consequence of the return of the old to childhood that those who are dead and lying in the earth take shape and come to life again, since the process of birth is reversed along with the reversal of the world&#039;s revolution; for this reason they are inevitably earth-born, and hence arises their name and the tradition about them, except those of them whom God removed to some other fate.", "time": 1671681924, "resto": 21416419}, {"no": 21416760, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:36:24", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No, the life about which you ask, when all the fruits of the earth sprang up of their own accord for men, did not belong at all to the present period of revolution, but this also belonged to the previous one. For then, in the beginning, God ruled and supervised the whole revolution, and so again, in the same way, all the parts of the universe were divided by regions among gods who ruled them, and, moreover, the animals were distributed by species and flocks among inferior deities as divine shepherds, each of whom was in all respects the independent guardian of the creatures under his own care, so that no creature was wild, nor did they eat one another, and there was no war among them, nor any strife whatsoever. To tell all the other consequences of such an order of the world would be an endless task. But the reason for the story of the spontaneous life of mankind is as follows: God himself was their shepherd, watching over them, just as man, being an animal of different and more divine nature than the rest, now tends the lower species of animals. And under his care there were no states, nor did men possess wives or children; for they all came to life again out of the earth, with no recollection of their former lives. So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty from the trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from agriculture. And they lived for the most part in the open air, without clothing or bedding; for the climate was tempered for their comfort, and the abundant grass that grew up out of the earth furnished them soft couches. That was the life of men in the reign of Cronus; but the life of the present age, which is said to be the age of Zeus, you know by your own experience. Would you be able and willing to decide which of them is the more blessed?<br><br>Well, then, if the foster children of Cronus, having all this leisure and the ability to converse not only with human beings but also with beasts, made full use of all these opportunities with a view to philosophy, talking with the animals and with one another and learning from every creature that, through possession of some peculiar power he may have had in any respect beyond his fellows perceptions tending towards an increase of wisdom, it would be easy to decide that the people of those old times were immeasurably happier than those of our epoch. Or if they merely ate and drank till they were full and gossiped with each other and the animals, telling such stories as are even now told about them, in that case, too, it would, in my opinion, be very easy to reach a decision.", "time": 1671683784, "resto": 21416419}, {"no": 21416771, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:40:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "However, let us pass those matters by, so long as there is no one capable of reporting to us what the desires of the people in those days were in regard to knowledge and the employment of speech. The reason why we revived this legend must be told, in order that we may get ahead afterwards. For when the time of all those conditions was accomplished and the change was to take place and all the earth-born race had at length been used up, since every soul had fulfilled all its births by falling into the earth as seed its prescribed number of times, then the helmsman of the universe dropped the tiller and withdrew to his place of outlook, and fate and innate desire made the earth turn backwards. So, too, all the gods who share, each in his own sphere, the rule of the Supreme Spirit, promptly perceiving what was taking place, let go the parts of the world which were under their care. And as the universe was turned back and there came the shock of collision, as the beginning and the end rushed in opposite directions, it produced a great earthquake within itself and caused a new destruction of all sorts of living creatures. <br><br>But after that, when a sufficient time had elapsed, there was rest now from disturbance and confusion, calm followed the earthquakes, and the world went on its own accustomed course in orderly fashion, exercising care and rule over itself and all within itself, and remembering and practising the teachings of the Creator and Father to the extent of its power, at first more accurately and at last more carelessly; and the reason for this was the material element in its composition, because this element, which was inherent in the primeval nature, was infected with great disorder before the attainment of the existing orderly universe. For from its Composer the universe has received only good things; but from its previous condition it retains in itself and creates in the animals all the elements of harshness and injustice which have their origin in the heavens. Now as long as the world was nurturing the animals within itself under the guidance of the Pilot, it produced little evil and great good; but in becoming separated from him it always got on most excellently during the time immediately after it was let go, but as time went on and it grew forgetful, the ancient condition of disorder prevailed more and more and towards the end of the time reached its height, and the universe, mingling but little good with much of the opposite sort, was in danger of destruction for itself and those within it.", "time": 1671684013, "resto": 21416419}, {"no": 21416786, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)23:44:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Therefore at that moment God, who made the order of the universe, perceived that it was in dire trouble, and fearing that it might founder in the tempest of confusion and sink in the boundless sea of diversity, he took again his place as its helmsman, reversed whatever had become unsound and unsettled in the previous period when the world was left to itself, set the world in order, restored it and made it immortal and ageless. So now the whole tale is told; but for our purpose of exhibiting the nature of the king it will be enough to revert to the earlier part of the story. For when the universe was turned again into the present path of generation, the age of individuals came again to a stop, and that led to new processes, the reverse of those which had gone before. For the animals which had grown so small as almost to disappear grew larger, and those newly born from the earth with hoary hair died and passed below the earth again. And all other things changed, imitating the condition of the universe and conforming to it, and so too pregnancy and birth and nurture necessarily imitated and conformed to the rest; for no living creature could any longer come into being by the union of other elements, but just as the universe was ordered to be the ruler of its own course, so in the same way the parts were ordered, so far as they could, to grow and beget and give nourishment of themselves under the same guidance.<br><br>And now we have come at last to the point for the sake of which this whole discourse was begun. For much might be said, and at great length, about the other animals, their previous forms and the causes of their several changes; but about mankind there is less to say and it is more to our purpose. For men, deprived of the care of the deity who had possessed and tended us, since most of the beasts who were by nature unfriendly had grown fierce, and they themselves were feeble and unprotected, were ravaged by the beasts and were in the first ages still without resources or skill; the food which had formerly offered itself freely had failed them, and they did not yet know how to provide for themselves, because no necessity had hitherto compelled them.

Keep Classical and Modern pronunciations separate. Learning any language requires effort. Only learn one if you really want to. Getting around Greece with just English is pretty easy.

It cannot be carried out on a nation-by-nation basis. Whenever it is suggested that the United States, for example, should cut back on technological progress or economic growth, people get hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in technology the Japanese will get ahead of us. Holy robots! The world will fly off its orbit if the Japanese ever sell more cars than we do! (Nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) More reasonably, it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like China, Vietnam and North Korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world. That is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. True, there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at approximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators. That is a risk that has to be taken. And it is worth taking, since the difference between a \u201cdemocratic\u201d industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one.[37] It might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable, because dictator-controlled systems usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break down.

You are still advocating for indirectly killing almost everyone alive today because the alternative is worse. This would most likely include yourself and your family. Everyone you know would either die of starvation, disease, or murder. And if the ends justify the means, this is truly the right option. It allows men to go to that extremity, thinking it is moral. That spirit of bitter disgust at the world that leads you to wish death upon virtually all the human race, it is so tiresome and at this point, my spirit recoils from it. Nothing Kaczynski says has to be wrong, as such, but he takes it as a given that there is no God and that the religious worldview has already been disproven. He might have good reason for this, but it is never brought up. If you disagree with him on this presupposition, however, none of it really matters anymore. This world is rotten to its core. Alienated from its original design. Men will never be content, even in primitivist bliss. There can be no salvation in the workings of men, it isn&#039;t to be found amongst bands of hunter-gatherers in deep forests. All joy of that life is but a foretaste of Heaven. Civilization, wilderness, these are temporal affairs, yet we are immortal souls merely embodied in the temporal. Our ultimate aim is not that. Our existence here is for the ultimate purpose of unifiction with the Divine, by allowing us to ascend the ladder of spiritual ascent. In the face of this, even if everything Kaczynski says is right, ceases to be important. In fact, it is to be expected, as degeneration, decay and entropy are all inherent in the Fallen Creation, as gold turns into silver and silver into bronze.<br><br>In the view of the infinite life, I no longer care. Yes, I have given up, I am an anti-revolutionary element. I do, I suppose, what the Techno-Industrial System would want me to. Though, it&#039;s not like there is a movement, in the first place, or even any potential seed for a movement. Kaczynski has entierly failed to inspire one, and even if one were to be created, the question of if and Anti-Tech Revolution would even be possible remains unanswered, and I think there is reason to be pessimistic. As of now, I am resigned to a life of minimizing technology to the greatest extent I am capable of. I do not care to extending this life to the masses. Neither did Kaczynski, but I also accept that total liberation from the Machine isn&#039;t possible. I suppose you could put it that this age, being so far removed from the Primeval state, doesn&#039;t allow even its hermits the freedom the previous ages allowed theirs.

The industrial society is incompatible with with the theological order and bestows upon man capacity for evil unlike any other. I&#039;m sure it needn&#039;t be explained the surgical monstrosities, lobotomies, chemical horrors, and of course, the coming integration of technology with the nervous system that are made possible by industrial technology. These are simply the things we can imagine in our lifetimes; there is no telling the evils the future holds.

It is undeniable.<br>But lastly, remember that you will not only be judged for what you did do, but also for what you did not; turning a blind eye on the suffering of your brothers- closing your ears to the blood that cries out from the ground; can you really say that you love your brother as you love yourself? There is no reason to throw your life away or bring harm even for a greater purpose to anyone.

We certainly don\u2019t mean to knock that right; it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example.

Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side. History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution[35], the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some \u201cgreen\u201d party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the \u201cgreen\u201d party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.</span><br>You couldn&#039;t even remember my previous post where I mention this.

If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW, just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your children. Such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous.[21]</span><br><br>?124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about \u201cmedical ethics.\u201d But a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were \u201cethical\u201d, and others were not, so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an \u201cethical\u201d use of genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. No code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today\u2019s world). Inevitably, genetic engineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial-technological system.[22]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[some more but I&#039;m keeping this short.

Keep in mind that your mindset and the idea that you would &quot;suffer&quot; without technology may simply be because you were raised in a technological society.

Almost everyone is guaranteed to die simply because we need industrial agriculture; but if industrialism was never a thing you wouldn&#039;t &quot;suffer for literally 0 reason.&quot;<br><a href=\"#p21405199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405199</a>", "time": 1671480960, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21405509, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)15:20:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21405199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21405199</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. Many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable. But we (FC) don\u2019t think it is inevitable. We think it can be stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;133. No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation. A change in the political wind, and those barriers begin to crumble.</span><br>Eventually those &quot;good technologies&quot; could be used for terrible things, or a simple unforseen accident could result in a level of suffering for worse than death.

As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. French society and Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose is something along the same lines.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. But most revolutions have two goals. One is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries. The French and Russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite successful in destroying the old society. We have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. Our goal is only to destroy the existing form of society.</span><br><br>Every single complaint was addressed directly in his most simple work.

Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we\u2019ve just described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: Individuals (at least those of the \u201cbourgeois\u201d type, who are integrated into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more \u201csocialized\u201d than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of God\u2019s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed.</span><br>He tried to live in the wilderness and didn&#039;t want to become an adversarial agent.

No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.

It may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern man, as is shown by his shorter life expectancy; hence modern man suffers from less, not more than the amount of insecurity that is normal for human beings. But psychological security does not closely correspond with physical security. What makes us FEEL secure is not so much objective security as a sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves. Primitive man, threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger, can fight in self-defense or travel in search of food. He has no certainty of success in these efforts, but he is by no means helpless against the things that threaten him. The modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things against which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food, environmental pollution, war, increasing taxes, invasion of his privacy by large organizations, nationwide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his way of life. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;69. It is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that threaten him; disease for example. But he can accept the risk of disease stoically. It is part of the nature of things, it is no one\u2019s fault, unless it is the fault of some imaginary, impersonal demon. But threats to the modern individual tend to be MAN-MADE. They are not the results of chance but are IMPOSED on him by other persons whose decisions he, as an individual, is unable to influence. Consequently he feels frustrated, humiliated and angry. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;70. Thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or organizations that are too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them. So modern man\u2019s drive for security tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some areas (food, shelter etc.) his security is assured at the cost of only trivial effort, whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security. (The foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man.) </span><br>Bruh<br>Why are you even posting<br>Read the chapter &quot;DISRUPTION OF THE POWER PROCESS IN MODERN SOCIETY&quot;<br>I feel bad for you dude, honestly.

It should take very little empathy to understand why creating a media sensation through murder (which was a huge cultural touchstone at the time, by the way) would be a maximally effective publicity campaign, considering you&#039;re already throwing optics out the window by declaring war on the entire social structure.<br>I mean, you&#039;re asking for the most illegitimate possible ideas to be presented in a legitimate way, which is simply an arbitrary and pointless expectation.<br>I assume I&#039;ll get another dismissive reply but what the hell, I tried.", "time": 1671610684, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412775, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:23:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412760</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re asking for the most illegitimate possible ideas to be presented in a legitimate way</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most illegitimate possible ideas</span><br>Uncle Ted cultists have an odd habit of saying the quiet parts out loud...", "time": 1671611031, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412778, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:25:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412775</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reading comprehension: 0</span>", "time": 1671611137, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412780, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:26:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412778</a><br>Your words, buttfucker.", "time": 1671611176, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412782, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21403386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21403386</a><br>even more delusional pipedream than communists. what an utter retard. glad hes rotting in prison. i agree with him that we are in hell but there is not escape", "time": 1671611259, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412794, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:32:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21404207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21404207</a><br>nah. hes has been consistently posted about and gaining a lot of traction since the trump era.", "time": 1671611571, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412798, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:34:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;When your own brother recognizes your unique brand of incoherent ramblings and outs you to the FBI</span><br>kek, at least old Teddy boy&#039;s story is good for a laugh", "time": 1671611682, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412799, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:35:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412798</a><br>stupid kekposter", "time": 1671611709, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412807, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:36:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412799</a><br>kek", "time": 1671611795, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412810, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:36:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412775</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my concept of legitimacy is literally entirely defined by the status quo</span><br>This confirms you fundamentally do not understand principle and are simply driven by arbitrary autistic fixation<br>I guess mommy really hammered home how you should be a good boy at all times, am I right?", "time": 1671611817, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21412814, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)03:39:52", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412810</a><br>Even worse, he thinks you meant to say Ted was &quot;illegitimate&quot; in the sense that you were saying he was wrong, rather than at odds with society&#039;s values.

They think video games are super great and life is shit, they play games like minecraft or stranded deep and think about how great it would be to do whatever they want or go on an adventure without having to worry about getting shanked by hobos, or laughed at by strangers, or just not having the money to eat.<br>This is the human call for nature; the natural instinct. They think that wild nature is horrible, unforgiving, and terrifying, but they don&#039;t realize that they are earth&#039;s true apex predator. Even a weak incel basement dweller could learn to survive in the wilderness if he put his mind to it.<br>Unfortunately, it is illegal to survive in the wild without paying monthly for hunting permits(and only in the correct season) and you can&#039;t even catch more than 8 fish per month in some counties. You certainly aren&#039;t legally able to build a dwelling place. These stressors make it so that very few besides the insane really run off into the woods and listen to that natural drive for true autonomy. This is compounded by the fact that from birth every man has his desire for autonomy crushed at every turn. School turns them into drones that cannot think for themselves(and punishes them for falling out of line, and zero tolerance policies teach them to rely on other&#039;s for judgement), and law causes them to feel safe only in the clutches of industrial society. The forest is wild and untamed, outside the watchful eye of the government. There is no familiar structure, cetainty, or safety. All of this together, along with the comforts of modern society, make man unwilling to part with the single most destructive thing in his life. He believes that the world is total shit unless he has his cola, vidya games, funko-pops, anime, and air-conditioning. He doesn&#039;t realize that what makes the world shit- what causes him to need things that his ancestors would have laughed at- is the unnatural condition of industrial society.", "time": 1671675777, "resto": 21403329}, {"no": 21416366, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)21:29:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21416352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21416352</a><br>Video games provide simulated autonomy.

The later ones aren&#039;t as good.<br><br>The esoteric writing stuff is not exactly a minor part of Strauss but it isn&#039;t the most important part either. You can completely ignore that and still benefit from his ideas. Basically he has the same views as a lot of others like Voegelin and Arendt, and like Arendt he was inspired by Husserl and Heidegger to try to recover Greek phronesis as a basis for liberalism. Although Arendt understood far more that this was dishonest if it also tried to suppress the other, less &quot;liberal&quot; parts of the Greek experience, which fascist Germans like Heidegger tried to recover. <br><br>Strauss himself is alright.

Very roughly, the split is over three factors: 1) How seriously to take political life (Jaffa encourages political engagement and defense of the American constitution while the ECers tend to be ambivalent and focused more on scholarship and overt philosophy), 2) how Strauss understood what he termed the Theological-Political Problem (WCers defend religious belief as an alternative to philosophy while ECers tend to treat it as an exoteric tolerance for the sake of protecting philosophical atheists), and 3) the status of the American founding (WCers see it as having ancient roots via an Aristotelianized Locke while ECers consider it a step dow from the ancients).

Something else I\u2019ve written which is an unpublished manuscript. In 1996, it was, Charles Kesler had a conference here on the American regime. I wrote a piece, it was about a hundred pages. I called it the \u201cDecline and Fall of the American Idea.\u201d And among those who had put on the wrong side of the fence were the Straussians who interpreted the founding as a Hobbesean document masqueraded by Locke, and they all took their stand, by the way, from Strauss\u2019s chapter on Locke in Natural Right and History, the chapter which is hard to explain because it makes Locke the opponent of everything that we identified as good Americanism based on the Declaration of Independence, based in turn on Locke. And my reply to that criticism is that in Natural Right and History Strauss offers us an interpretation of Locke, not of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson\u201455</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SG: So. Strauss would not have been pleased there were a group called Straussian?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: I know what I was going to tell you: that near the end of this little piece of mine, I had read a review by Harvey Mansfield, Jr. He used to call himself Junior. I don\u2019t know why he took the Junior off, because his father was a published author and you can\u2019t tell which is which. But for some reason or the other he dedicated one of his books to his father too. He was personally attached, but in other respects detached. Anyway, Harvey is an interesting case study of Straussianism, and he is a very clever guy and a very shrewd writer, and he can be both obscure and clear depending upon what he wants to be. Anyway, he was reviewing this book edited by the famous writer on the American founding at Harvard. Anyway, it was a collection of the documents dealing with the ratification of the Constitution between 1787-1789. About two thousand pages of documents, and Harvey began by praising the book and saying what a wonderful level of discourse that it was, and too bad we don\u2019t have anything like that today. He didn\u2019t give any real account of what was in the substance of the book. </span><br>(1/?)", "time": 1671663063, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415731, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:22:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415599</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HJ: But then he went on to\u2014I don\u2019t know how he got on to the subject of the Declaration, but he spoke about the self-evident half-truth of the Declaration of Independence, which means no truth. It\u2019s not a half-truth, but it\u2019s still a truth. Worse than that, in the literature on the Declaration, the other people who rejected the Declaration, like Calhoun, rejected it because of the idea of racial equality, and Harvey certainly did not have any reservation as to the rights of Negroes; but that\u2019s what he said about hat. Anyway, [he] then went on to give pure eastern Straussian interpretation: Locke is just a\u2014only Hobbes with a veil over him. Which means that\u2014Walter Berns has also said that the beginning of the Declaration and the end contradict each other because the beginning is really Hobbes, and that means that there\u2019s no nobility in the idea of courage. And Harvey then later went on to write a whole book on manliness. Of course, the word manliness is only a translation of the word virtue. So anyway, I took the strongest possible exception. And then, later on when the conference\u2014Harvey Jr. made a terrible, terrible personal attack on me before the audience, you see, without any explanation as to why. Just that the chap attacked everybody and he finally got around to me. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, since then I\u2019ve written three open letters and I have a manuscript of a book with over two or three pages devoted to this dispute. I haven\u2019t decided yet if I want to publish it or not. But the most important feature of it is the discussion by Strauss and the reply to Koj\u00e8ve of the classic idea of friendship, [in] which Strauss describes how the philosophers have to have friends because they can\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about unless they have something reflecting back to them. And so philosophic friends begin, in effect, to form a kind of club or class by themselves. But when the association of philosophers turns into\u2014it becomes dogmatic and they just attack everybody outside and have internal dissonances. The Communist Party is a perfect example of what began as a philosophic friendship turned into a political party. So that whole process, there is about a page in which Strauss talks about\u2014this is the only place that I know that he really describes the meaning of friendship in the highest sense, when he says that the philosopher, when he finds himself now inside of a sect, has got to leave the sect and has got to return to the marketplace. This is a political action. A political action, according to Strauss, is the foundation of the integrity of the classical idea of friendship, which I think is a complete vindication of everything that I\u2019ve ever done. </span><br>(2/?)", "time": 1671664920, "resto": 21410804}, {"no": 21415750, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)18:28:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415731</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And well, Harvey\u2014you see, Harvey\u2019s father was my teacher at Yale. I think I told you that. And when I went to Columbus in the fall of 1951, Harvey I think was still a student at Harvard. But we got to know each other and he used to come to my office and we had long discussions. He was defending Talcott Parsons, his Harvard professor, against Strauss and it was very unequal conflict. I most often said that Harvey\u2019s conversion was\u2014hard conversions make good principles. And later on, Harvey was teaching at Berkeley when Strauss was at Stanford, at the Behavioral Sciences Institute, and Strauss always had a weekly seminar. I don\u2019t think he could live without his seminar. It was like whiskey to an alcoholic. [Laughs] And I remember Harvey used to go over once a week from Berkeley to the seminar and he wrote me a letter in which he said that sitting across the table from Strauss he discovered for the first time what it meant to admire greatness from a distance, which was a beautiful phrase and Harvey\u2019s capable of that. Well, he\u2019s made several visits here since that episode and he always came over here and visited with my wife, which I really appreciated. [HJ shows SG photos of his wife.]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyway, Harvey wrote me a beautiful letter after she died and I believe it was an attempt to mend the fences that were broken down because of that eruption. It was a very unfair . . . of him . . . It was a completely non-intellectual attack on me just because I was wrong because I attacked my friends. But what is the basis for friendship, then? I mean, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, there\u2019s one book on justice and two books on friendship. So anyway, I\u2019ve got a lot of other things to get. I don\u2019t know whether\u2014but it\u2019s easy to see from that eruption on the floor of the conference, which was paralleled later on by the eruption of Tom Pangle telling me before 200 people that he had to pull rank on me. Twenty years my junior, he pulls rank on me. That Strauss confided in him. By the way, at that same banquet, Pangle went on\u2014and this also reveals a great deal about eastern Straussiansm\u2014that Socrates encouraged young men to become homosexuals as a way of\u2014and this is the phrase he used\u2014softening their souls for philosophy. And he gave a reference to the Memorabilia. The minute I got home, I dug out the Memorabilia. There was no such reference there. In that same introduction\u2014but Joe . . . real philosophers. They patronize the morality because it protected them. But at the same time, they went on to enjoy the \u201cquote the pleasures that were naturally sweet.\u201d So they all\u2014anyway, I don\u2019t know that Strauss ever\u2014. Of course this was in a post-mortem publication.

I was into Game of Thrones but I do feel like this isn&#039;t all that sophisticated of a feature, and that the morality is not all that grey to begin with. The show is playing off a distinct sense of what is good or bad, with the inclusion of situations that are difficult to judge morally. This speaks to morality being difficult rather than insubstantial - Lord of the Rings already does this with the likes of Gollum, Boromir, and the corrupting force of the ring. It may sound contrarian but I feel like that is a more compelling version of &quot;greyness&quot;.<br><br>The most forceful and important events of Game of Thrones are the ones that are most decisively &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; morally. Bad guys winning, versus brief respites of justice. The show plays off a given sort of moral sensibility, the force and significance of its events are moral in nature. The best you could say is that there&#039;s a moral absence as far as the course of nature goes, it stands against the premise that things work out as they ought to (which will strike the modern audience as naive if not patronizing).<br><br>The show does have some cosmic moral law to it though - it is a rule that the bad guys must win more, fate and fortune will favor them, if someone is good it means that a rock is more likely to fall out of the sky and kill them. Bad events are contrived and poured in to ensure the &quot;greyness&quot; status and to keep the audience on edge, it needs to pull tragedies out of thin air to shock the audience and keep them on edge. <br><br>Anyhow, compare this to the Iliad. There&#039;s hardly a whisper about what&#039;s right or wrong, fair or unfair (the only remarks resembling this occur in trivial contexts). Who&#039;s the villain, Aggaememnon?* He&#039;s sick of the war too, he nearly leaves, and while his faults produce the feud with Achilles (in combination with Achilles&#039; faults, which were the greater factor there). Almost none of it is fair to anyone, yet the story revels in all of it. There&#039;s some concern about virtues we ought to value, the beauty of reconciliation and honor and such. But for the most part, you will watch your hero do a bad thing and you are meant to cheer for it. If you want to avoid black and white morality, I say you should commit, and go Greek.

A milder form of purge is one of the following kind:\u2014when, owing to scarcity of food, people are in want, and display a readiness to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the wealthy,\u2014then the lawgiver, regarding all such as a plague inherent in the body politic, and in the friendliest possible way they should be (as it will be tactfully put) &quot;transferred to a colony.&quot;", "filename": "Herma_of_Plato_-_0042MC", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 501, "h": 800, "tn_w": 78, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671667237396831, "time": 1671667237, "md5": "fChRHJ9NLDWtslwQo5OTuA==", "fsize": 344945, "resto": 21415756}, {"no": 21415886, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)19:04:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21415870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21415870</a><br>By some means or other this must be done by every legislator at the beginning, but in our case the task is now even more simple; for we have no need to contrive for the present either a form of emigration or any other purgative selection; but just as when there is a confluence of floods from many sources\u2014some from springs, some from torrents\u2014into a single pool we have to take diligent precautions to ensure that the water may be of the utmost possible purity, by drawing it off in some cases, and in others by making channels to divert its course.

It&#039;s usually said that Christianity has a hatred of the body, which is wrong also, but here the critique comes out of someone who is of the opinion that weakness and infirmity of the body is a good thing, and accusses the Church of the opposite. Catholicism has a great ascetic tradition which Protestantism and almost wholly abandoned as unbiblical. Compare the fasts of the Catholics with the Protestants. What is further interesting is that she also conflates health and bodily robustness with obesity and glottonous excess, which are, in reality, diametrically opposed.

This, as well as her comparison with Lucifer, are both, again, based on a conflation between obedient trust under the guidance of a spiritual superior with laxity. She is using this silly conflation to attack the notion of a spiritual hierarchy of persons in favour of her Protestant individualism and egalitarianism. See, the Church has always had overseers. It had apostles and episkopoi. Receiving the spiritual guidance of men who are closer to God doesn&#039;t abdicate a very great personal responsibility to purify the soul and flee from sin. Faith in Christ is exactly the same submission and obedience in Him as fulfilling the role of Priest-King that the pastoral relationship between the priesthood and the laity is a mirror of. That obviously doesn&#039;t mean that faith in Christ is a Lucifician gambit of ignorant trust that, if only you follow Him, you will have to worry about nothing.

For there are twenty-two letters of which five are double, and so they come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mem, Nun, Pe , Sade are double. And thus the number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined on to Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second books of Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of Kings: and also the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and second of Esdra. In this way, then, the books are collected together in four Pentateuchs and two others remain over, to form thus the canonical books. Five of them are of the Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the code of the Law, constitutes the first Pentateuch. Then comes another Pentateuch, the so-called Grapheia , or as they are called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following: Jesus the Son of Nave , Judges along with Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and fourth Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena which are one book. This is the second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job, Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of Songs of Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz the twelve prophets constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. Then come the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther. There are also the Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach.

For just as the tree planted by the channels of waters, so also the soul watered by the divine Scripture is enriched and gives fruit in its season , viz. orthodox belief, and is adorned with evergreen leafage, I mean, actions pleasing to God. For through the Holy Scriptures we are trained to action that is pleasing to God, and untroubled contemplation. For in these we find both exhortation to every virtue and dissuasion from every vice. If, therefore, we are lovers of learning, we shall also be learned in many things. For by care and toil and the grace of God the Giver, all things are accomplished. For every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened. Luke 11:10 Wherefore let us knock at that very fair garden of the Scriptures, so fragrant and sweet and blooming, with its varied sounds of spiritual and divinely-inspired birds ringing all round our ears, laying hold of our hearts, comforting the mourner, pacifying the angry and filling him with joy everlasting: which sets our mind on the gold-gleaming, brilliant back of the divine dove , whose bright pinions bear up to the only-begotten Son and Heir of the Husbandman Matthew 21:37 of that spiritual Vineyard and bring us through Him to the Father of Lights. James 1:17 But let us not knock carelessly but rather zealously and constantly: lest knocking we grow weary. For thus it will be opened to us. If we read once or twice and do not understand what we read, let us not grow weary, but let us persist, let us talk much, let us enquire. For ask your Father, he says, and He will show you: your elders and they will tell you. Deuteronomy 32:7 For there is not in every man that knowledge. 1 Corinthians 8:7 Let us draw of the fountain of the garden perennial and purest waters springing into life eternal. John 4:14 Here let us luxuriate, let us revel insatiate: for the Scriptures possess inexhaustible grace. But if we are able to pluck anything profitable from outside sources, there is nothing to forbid that.

Yes, the culture surrounding us plays a huge part in how we perceive reality. Fairy tales and media we consume as children are a large part of that. However, simply &quot;having terrible stuff happen in fairy tales prepares kids for real life&quot; is a gross oversimplification to begin with, for several reasons. It ignores that fairy tales are far from the only product of culture accessible to kids. In a modern environment, kids are going to be exposed to the fact that there are terrible things happening in the world either way. The argument also ignores that they have a limited effect. Even if a fairy tale gives someone a basic idea of death, it&#039;s still gonna hit hard when their loved one dies for real. Regardless of how many gritty stories they&#039;ve read, because experiencing something by yourself is always different than just being a passive observer to a fictional scenario. I know you&#039;re gonna reply with some vague slogan like &quot;oh but reading these stories is gonna make them more prepared&quot;, but that is an extremely moot and vague notion that also leads me to my next point: there are so much more factors influencing how a person grows up than the culture they consume. It&#039;s also about their parents, their peers, their upbringing, their social environment. It&#039;s possible for one to have never read a single Grimm brothers story but have seen some horrendous shit as a kid.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As children&#039;s tales, kids still love them because kids like to be excited, swooned, and frightened, and these stories do that, so it&#039;s not dumb in that regard. </span><br>It is. If a teenage girl reads a hundred YA dystopias about the evil government killing and tornuring its helpess citizens in cruel ways, she&#039;s not gonna get a comperehensive understanding of how governments like this are actually formed, how they realistically rise to power, or how governments work in general. Works like this are not going to make her a better, smarter person, they&#039;re not going to make her more prepared to become a politician and change the society in productive ways herself. All they are going to do is pander to the feeling of rebeillous youthful maximalism. No matter how overly dark and edgy they are, they are worthless in actually preparing one for the complexities of the real world.<br>Engaging in dark fiction is still escapism. For an average person, there are mundane things much scarier in life than the distant horrors of dark fiction. Watching someone get dismembered on-screen is easier than having to struggle with a job you hate. It does not make you a more &quot;mature&quot; person, you can still end up a fucking failure no matter how much dark fiction you consume. <br>Modern audiences need something more fulfilling than &quot;Grugules the Demigod killed a snake-monster and stole a mystic doodad.&quot; Stop pointing to precedent we&#039;ve evolved beyond.", "time": 1671640204, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21414061, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)11:37:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21411807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21411807</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beautiful, and much better than the shitty version of the sisters having their eyes plucked out</span><br>They&#039;re both bad.

The genre of folk tales that the Grimm&#039;s were drawing upon were NOT initially considered explicitly for children in the way that you seem convinced that they are, they were just common stories that everyone knew. Reproducing them for children was at least partially a project to provide a corpus of literature for bourgeois children that would both aid to properly socialise them with bourgeois values and provide a valuable material object to act as a conspicuous commodity. The lushly illustrated books of the late 19th century were created for the purpose of being purchased as expensive gifts.<br>Of course, tolkien believed that the relegation of fairy tales to children&#039;s literature was more of an accident of history, that they were deemed not serious enough and handed down to children. I think that misses some of the socialisation aspects. As he himself notes, the fantasy story is ultimately about the depiction of the world as it should be in opposition to how it is, things why they largely focus on unusual turns of justice and happy endings, a phenomenon he recognised enough to give it a name, &quot;eucatastrophe&quot;. This tendency produces the unusual contradiction people see in the fairy tale genre, since it&#039;s stories have accumulated over hundreds of years as society had changed drastically.<br>Compare the explicitly medieval notion of justice in &quot;the snake who bore witness to a maiden&quot;, in which a snake forces a prince to marry the commoner girl he has raped lest the snake strangle him to death, to the more bourgeois and child focused world view of something like Hansel and Gretel, where the grandeur and temptation of fairy if medieval fairy stories is scaled down to a house of tasty treats that middle class children would desire. Compare also how in some stories women are largely passive objects, while in others women, and young girls in particular, evade danger or are rewarded for obedience, politeness, or observing social norms. Competing social norms over centuries generated a huge variety of stories that were later repackaged in to the fairy tale genre you recognise. This continues in fiction written during the period, look at Alice in wonderland for a great example of the &quot;girl survives encounter with faerie through force of manners&#039;.<br><br>And since you seem determined to pull hot opinions out of your ass, here is a bibliography for this post to flex on your dumb ass.<br>Zipes, fairy tales and the art of subversion<br>Zipes, the irresistible fairy tale<br>The Cambridge companion to fairy tales<br>The Oxford companion to fairy tales<br>Tolkien, on fairy stories<br>A Washington college lecture series called Fairy and Fantasy, available on the professor&#039;s podcast feed.", "time": 1671657262, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21415371, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:58:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412993</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. never read La Fontaine or Charles Perrault</span>", "time": 1671659888, "resto": 21411807}, {"no": 21415378, "now": "12/21/22(Wed)16:59:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21412989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21412989</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disney changed the originals!</span><br>Disney did not make these changes, there are variants across time and cultures<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but Disney removed anything scary and intense</span><br>Okay but I can watch these Disney movies and see that that\u2019s not true.
