I&#039;ve used a few introductory textbooks and I finished Wheelock and thought it was rather mediocre compared to M&amp;F so I recommended it. If I ramble on about how to get fluent - ask me if I&#039;m fluent. If I&#039;m talking about an A-level introductory textbook, feel free to ask me if I&#039;m A level. You guys really need to understand that people do not learn Latin to order pizzas. Some people want to read full speed without a dictionary and others are fine with a 2,000 vocabulary reading a parallel text or with a dictionary slowly. Not every has your goal.

The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination.

Never forget Bilderberg was made up of state officials, heads of unis, media heads, and corporate zombies. Bilderberg never died, it just became unnecessary. They use the WEF, the WHO, the IMF, the BIS, the G20, etc., now. LOL! Their power has grown that much into the open. Just listen to the anti secret society talks of JFK. This was a known problem in his day, and the reason for his death. He attempted to expose what he said was a &quot;global conspiracy with arms in military, political, business, academic, etc.,.&quot; He spent the year before campaigning against the central banks, promoting an audit of them and a return of the printing press to the American treasury. He was killed by the same cabal now offing journalists, crypto prodigies, Epstein, and whoever else happens to be both a problem and killable without unmanageable collateral damage. Certainly, most certainly, greed plays a huge role, but in the long-term game these globos are playing, the corporate players who aren&#039;t in on it are still just marks - to be juiced and squeezed during this phase of the game - the consolidation phase. Pay attention to the career beaureaucrats - those who came up out of the filter programs and elite-run institutions, who now play musical chairs either serving as career CEOs, board members, or executives of companies - one after another - on the one hand, and then serving in gov&#039;t or supranational institutions the next. These people literally just bounce around, playing games with our lives from their early 20&#039;s until their deathbeds. It&#039;s amazing, and rancid.

During this &quot;immediate aftermath&quot; period, even the black SNL actor/comedian Tracey Jordan exhorted authority figures to &quot;shake &#039;em down&quot;, referring to muslims in general. By which he meant not that they should be mistreated, but that they should be profiled and watched with respect to the specific sort of terrorism that they are wont to wage. (The later San Bernadino shooting, IIRC, also comes to mind). Jordan made this comment with some understanding of racism himself, and he was in the city at the time, so his feelings are sensible. It&#039;s true that there are many racial forms of terrorism, and the arab/muslim one was foremost in people&#039;s minds at the time.<br><br>In short, it was very culturally safe to be bigoted against muslims during the early 2000s, and with good reason.<br><br>For Hitchens, as for myself (a lifelong atheist, I was 17 years old at the time of the attacks so I have clear formative memory during the transition to adulthood, the event did much to shape and cement my worldview), 9/11 was a major cultural event which showcased the very worst of religion. Muslims fly planes into a building (yes, that is what actually took place) in part because they are aggrieved over occupation of their lands, but above all because, together with their generally lower intelligence, they are benighted and socialized into a backward and violent traditional culture which entails A FALSE PROPHET AND A FALSE GOD. In response to this, a christian blames the events on gays and feminism. You can make a fair argument that these groups are responsible for social decline, but Falwell&#039;s invocation within hours of the thing was still a disgusting display, mostly because it was irrelevant to why it had actually happened, because it assumed &quot;god&#039;s punishment&quot;. Third, a bunch of Scientologists cynically used the event to be little goody-two-shoes and volunteer as clean-up helpers while wearing identifying &quot;we are Scientologists&quot; vests. While having awareness of the Great Leap Forward and the Stalinist purges as atrocities waged by atheists (the religion in this case however was not atheism as such, but communism), 9/11 remains more convenient for myself as a formative display of the worst of religion. And let&#039;s not forget the jews, but given Hitchens&#039; stances, I don&#039;t know exactly how I want to go about assigning blame to them, apart from the general things like occupation of Israel and influence in American foreign policy.

I introduced myself, and I sat and listen. Occasionally, I asked questions and made a few comments. I looked at family photos of these two while remembering how boring my life is.

I saw a car with the headlights on and realized that the couple have not left yet. I walked across the street, hoping that they would not see me, and concluded that I only left because they did themselves. I then walked around the stream of towering houses all with their decorations. The scenery reminded me of a pre-sentient time when I was at the old house, and my infantile eyes saw the Christmas lights all over the endless street that was once my home and the large luminous cherub on the neighbor&#039;s yard that locked itself into the recesses of memory.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search.

Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway.

A lot of things that were once taken for granted are now doubted simply because they can&#039;t be empirically proven. Philosophers like Nietzsche or any other nihilist (very broadly speaking, a la Fr. Srph. Rose&#039;s use of the term) clearly don&#039;t feel comfortable saying things like &quot;it is just cause... it is, okay?&quot; because it&#039;s a &quot;pseud&quot; thing to do.

There are three paths available at the end game of philosophy:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Eternal Cope of fake ethical systems to justify the morality you hold irrationally</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Incomplete systems that will get &quot;btfo&#039;d&quot; once someone figures out the spot in which you inserted your unproven assumption.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Accepting the pseud-dom and appeal to a higher unprovable and &quot;irrational&quot; &quot;principle.&quot;</span><br>I pick the last option because it&#039;s objectively true. I cannot prove objective morality but it is just cause... it is, okay? I believe in God, I believe we have souls, and I believe that it is possible to intuit good and evil to some degree even if it cannot be rationally explained.<br>Now you&#039;ve obtained yet another batch of autismal pseud spergout.

I&#039;ll may write some basic things that outline what I believe or I may get distracted shitposting all day. However, I&#039;ll outline some things:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Desire is evil. Why? Because humans do not &quot;deserve&quot; anything. When you desire, you covet that which you do not deserve, or you assume you deserve that which you do not.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Any act which is intended to benefit the self at the expense of another is evil. Why? Because... because it just is okay?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. An act is objectively good or evil based on how in alignment it was with the will of God(or whatever you want to see as the universal truth).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. We may not know the ultimate results of our actions, and ignorance is what preserves innocence.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. Normies cannot understand suffering, pain, good, and evil. They are innocent and virtually good due to their ignorance.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. Cynics, people who understand these things, are almost always evil and NEVER innocent. This is because it is nearly impossible to avoid coveting that which is not deserved, and they are not shielded by ignorance from the corrupting effect of harming another person.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7.

Just rush in and get your filtered experience out of the way, then pick up the pieces and start learning. <br><br>If you are just starting I recommend picking an easy but high quality early dialogue like Charmides and just seeing how you feel about the style and seeing if you can follow the ideas. From there try reading any of the following, which all have &quot;classic&quot; Platonic arguments or ideas in them, and a good balance of either dramatic set piece elements (Socrates&#039; death) or weird stuff that is fun to read (compelling mystical allegories e.g.):<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meno (read as early as possible)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Euthyphro (for the famous Euthyphro dilemma, but also more Charmides-esque introduction to the Socratic method of isolating ideal unities underlying linguistic/conceptual multiplicities)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crito (for the famous Crito dilemma) </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phaedo (obvious reasons) </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phaedrus (some of the most famous allegories)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Symposium (obvious reasons, chock full of famous and memorable stuff) </span><br>You can read the Apology at any time since it&#039;s not really a dialogue. Optionally read in the dramatic order as the above poster says, so you get the pre-trial build-up (Euthyphro), the trial (Apology), the post-trial (Crito), and Socrates&#039; death (Phaedo). But I still recommend reading Charmides and Meno first, just to get a basic idea of the Platonic style + Socratic method. <br><br>After these early dialogues you can really read anything. There are several more Charmides-like early dialogues, some of which may even be brilliant &quot;studies&quot; written by students at the Academy because they are fairly formulaically Platonic (the Hippiases). The major anti-Sophistic &quot;middle&quot; dialogues are well worth reading as a prelude to Plato&#039;s late philosophy: Gorgias + Protagoras. They would be a good next move. <br><br>From there the question is whether you read the Republic, which is the transitional middle-to-late dialogue but the longest dialogue by far, or whether you start sniping at the famous late dialogues that interest you most. I suggest cheating: do both. Read the Republic, but also just jump head-first into the Timaeus, the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, even the Philebus. That way you don&#039;t risk burning out or getting overloaded by the Republic. Also, the Republic starts out slow, so give it time to build. <br><br>If you need help with the later dialogues, try reading Plato&#039;s Trilogy by Klein. It&#039;s short and may give you a way to do structured reading of some of the most difficult dialogues in a way that shines light on them, which light can then be transmitted to your reading of the other dialogues. Klein also has the best reading of Platonic noesis I&#039;ve seen. If you need secondary literature help, look up Dillon&#039;s Roots of Platonism (short and sweet) and Gerson&#039;s books.", "time": 1671240547, "resto": 21394057}, {"no": 21394171, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:36:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394146</a><br>If it will take that long is it really even worth it for me to dive into?", "time": 1671240990, "resto": 21394057}, {"no": 21394198, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)20:44:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394057</a><br>Want an interesting experience?

Shankara specifically addresses the Yogachara position in some detail in his writings and he patiently explains why he thinks it is wrong/illogical and he highlights why Advaita is different. Even before Shankara came along Gaudapada was already criticizing the doctrines of the Yogacharins a few centuries earlier, and in Shankara&#039;s commentary on Gaudapada&#039;s text he unpacks these criticisms of Yogachara in greater detail. Shankara does not hold to Yogachara positions, he criticizes them instead.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vasubandhu, the Buddhist who wrote the initial philosophical treatises of the Yogacara school, argued that &#039;external dharmas&#039;, a class of objects which depending on the school could include atoms or gross objects such as apples, did not really exist in a mind-external way. With regards to mind-external objects, the Yogacara school has an identical position to the Advaita Vedanta school. </span><br>No, that&#039;s incorrect, Yogachara does not &quot;have an identical position&quot; to Advaita. Shankara criticizes Vasubandhu&#039;s/Dinnaga&#039;s/Dharmakirti&#039;<wbr>s position with regard to external objects in his Brahma Sutra Bhasya and he calls their position illogical. According to Shankara, objects exist conventionally in a mind-independent way and he says there is no rational grounds for denying that they are mind-independent. Shankara only accepts the dream-analogy to the extent that it can be used to undermine belief that the waking world is itself the actual true reality (instead of Brahman being reality) but he does *not* accept it as a valid basis for rejecting the independence of exterior objects from the mind and he instead calls this irrational. <br><br>&quot;Consequently, Sankara\u2019s attempt is not to show that Vasnbnndhu is wrong in rejecting proof of externality, for Sankara himself accepts that rejection. To say that Sankara\u2019s argument does not prove that externality exists would be to miss the point His attempt, rather, is to show that Vasubandhu is wrong to reject the assumption of externality in any account of experience. So, the argument is over whether a coherent account of experience can be given while rejecting the externality of objects\u2018 i.e., without referring to objects as extrinsic to cognition. Vasubandhu holds that that is possible and right, Sankara disagrees.<br>- Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, Advaita Epistemology and Metaphysics: An Outline of Indian Non-Realism, page 64", "time": 1671160542, "resto": 21385199}, {"no": 21390158, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)23:04:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389918</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the equivalent of practice in Advaita Vedanta? </span><br>There is no &quot;practice&quot; per se. Once initiated into an Advaita monastic order you are told the truth about your true Self and so on, and then you study Shankara&#039;s works (sometimes other works too) and teachings under the close guidance of a teacher. If someone is ready to fully grasp the teaching then liberation and enlightenment will just naturally dawn on them at some point during this process, and if it doesn&#039;t happen that is just because they didn&#039;t cultivate the necessary qualities first or didn&#039;t study and focus long enough until they overcame their own misunderstanding.<br><br>There are lists in the Advaita writings of certain qualities and things like self-control and purity of intention etc that someone is supposed to cultivate first before even being qualified to pursue liberation as a monk. The normal steps in the process of arriving at liberation are held to be Sravana (listening to the teacher or teaching), Manana (reflecting on the teaching and grasping its meaning) and Nidihyasana (focusing on or meditating on the core truth of the teaching to the exclusion of all else or directly intuiting it), but these can all occur just in a normal session of studying Shankara&#039;s writings with a teacher or listening to their verbal teaching by a riverside etc somewhere. Sometimes, a particular lineage of teaching Advaita will teach a certain mantra to recite or meditation to perform that will a supplementary practice that one can do when not studying Advaita texts, but this differs by lineage and it&#039;s never taught to be what produces liberation itself (which happens via knowledge and not an act) but it is only supplementary. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apart from the liberaion through gnosis what sort of practices form part of the Advaita Vedanta tradition?</span><br>They will do things like hatha yoga or worship deities.

Instead, you can just go about your life or even practice other religions and spiritual teachings while still appreciating and benefiting from the wisdom offered by Advaita.

The question I have regarding philosophy is the following, how do you read German idealists and someone like Nietzsche in the context of the 21st century and all the scientific and technological advances that have happened hundreds of years after they were doing philosophy, how has that impacted the merit of their thought and how should that affect the way I&#039;m reading Hegel&#039;s Phenomenology of Spirit or Kant&#039;s Critique of Pure Reason and his categorical imperative, let alone Nietzsche&#039;s philosophy of the body and his critique and insight into the faults of philosophers of his time and philosophy as a field in general. I&#039;m mainly familiar with sociological authors and my favorite novelists, but I have always struggled with the more metaphysically oriented philosophers, and one of my professors told me people like Hegel and Kant weren&#039;t as fortunate as we are these days and that they didn&#039;t have all the methods and scientific breakthroughs we take granted. Is there a book covering this that can help me with it or should I also read contemporary philosophy and pay close attention to what critiques and comments they point to those I&#039;ve mentioned here? And of course, I take it that you should never read philosophy as an insular field, much like you shouldn&#039;t do that with anything else - sociology, biology or psychology, and that you should have some sort of knowledge of the context and what a particular work is dealing with or referring to and how you can take that valuable insight that&#039;s present and contrast it with another field to get a more &quot;complete&quot; perspective, right? <br><br>And for all those that have their own questions, you are free to post them here and I kindly beg anons with more knowledge to help if they can. I would also like to say that this should be filled with earnest posting and is strictly for those that want to know more and need help, not those that want to shitpost and make a travesty of yet another thread that at least tries to get a valuable discussion going and is here to keep the spirit of /lit/ alive, no matter how foolish it may be these days.<br><br>Pic symbolically related.", "filename": "fin", "ext": ".png", "w": 910, "h": 620, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 170, "tim": 1671273337463723, "time": 1671273337, "md5": "50Sk4XRRXX+DExnRWK6IpQ==", "fsize": 632606, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "questions-about-philosophy-for-newcomes", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 21395746, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)07:08:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21395487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21395487</a><br>Fuck you&#039;re cringe.

There were gods, demons, curses, possession, magic, interdimensional traveling, and other stuff, but it&#039;s not what the novel is about. There&#039;s a lot about how the Pallesand Archipelago is conquering and oppressing everyone in their quest to establish what they believe to be utopian socialism. It didn&#039;t explicitly say that, but it was heavily implied. The name may or may not have been a reference to Solzhenitsyn&#039;s Gulag Archipelago, and/or the British Isles and Empire, especially as depicted in Orwell&#039;s 1984. They&#039;re all about controlling every aspect of behavior to come closer to their arbitrary ideal of perfection.<br><br>The novel had an unusual narrative structure where the viewpoint moved from one character to another from chapter to chapter. Some characters only had a single chapter and others had several. It began by establishing the primary viewpoints which were often included in the other viewpoints. A minor character in one viewpoint became the viewpoint in the next chapter and so on. I wanted to call this a mosaic novel but the paths of the characters are too overlapping for that to seem accurate. A few chapters were explicitly called mosaic because the narrator is the viewpoint in them, which was odd because there wasn&#039;t a frame story. The author simply described what happened as an omniscient narrator. The chapters open with similar narration.<br><br>The narrative was also different in its neutrality, as it&#039;s more an exploration of ongoing events through the lives of the characters rather than being about the characters themselves. So, in a way, the city could be considered a character, which is something I&#039;ve seen in several books published in 2022. The downside was that because of the constantly changing perspective the characters were underdeveloped. I also disliked them. They&#039;re almost all stock characters with nothing to particularly distinguish them. The most egregious to me were the overeager and blindly idealistic college students eager to be martyrs for the revolution.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what this novel was meant to be about. To be entirely reductive, it&#039;s about the consequences following the theft of a magical item that leads to the death of one of the most important government officials. Everyone then wanted wanted to know who had the magical item and where it was. There were also various factions that worked towards revolution, but each had their own methods and incompatible end goals. I wouldn&#039;t be so concerned about what it meant if it weren&#039;t that it seemed like it was constantly trying to say something meaningful. Maybe that was intended or I read too much into it, but it left me unsatisfied.<br><br>Rating: 2.5/5", "filename": "60147395", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1600, "h": 2458, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671222050267490, "time": 1671222050, "md5": "L781DbQI3JGvikqfbEIK0w==", "fsize": 1074791, "resto": 21391224, "trip": "!SFFG.n1h7M"}, {"no": 21392891, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)15:22:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21392882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21392882</a><br>I&#039;ve now read a book that was published in each month of 2022 in the month that it was published.

It was more of a side quest than the previous books and probably could have been reworked into a solo novel with minimal changes, it does tie into the story nicely at the end and I had a great time with it. This book felt different. It felt like it was written for little children- and children only . There were many caps, too much emphasis, and Peril is an extremely childish character who largely acts like she was born yesterday and is a hair-trigger away from mass murder multiple times. Tui absolutely nailed Peril as a point of view. Every word mirrored Peril\u2019s possessive, childish, bloodthirsty and and altogether very unstable personality. Some of it was over-exaggerated, but it is very clear that Peril is a completely different dragon than others, with her unique one tracked mind because she has been killing since she was a dragonet (baby dragon), when someone is hostile or irritable to her, she hopes that they attack her so she can freely murder them.<br><br>Peril to other dragons is a weird, crazy sociopathic dragon who can kill effortlessly and that&#039;s exactly how I felt when I first read Escaping Peril. across the story I realized that she changed. From the beginning she always obsessed over Clay, Scarlet and her Killing potential, but near the end, she thought less about aproval and more as a normal-ish sane pov, completing her arc. Peril is hilarious. Honestly, the author&#039;s writing style ensures that all her books are humorous, She has no filter, and says whatever she&#039;s thinking regardless of how awkward that makes other dragons feel. Which leads to some pretty damn funny conversations.<br><br>The plot moves at a fast clip and lot happens in this story both to Peril and dragon society as a whole desu, You wouldn&#039;t expect it from the more personalized stakes involved here but there were actually a large number of twists happened throughout.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.<br><br>Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.<br><br>I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.<br><br>The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself.

It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.<br><br>Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I&#039;ve read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.<br><br>This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe&#039;s story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.<br><br>I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator&#039;s unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there&#039;s nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.<br><br>At that point, it&#039;s just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it&#039;s a cardinal sin of storytelling: don&#039;t add something into your story unless it needs to be there.

His father gave him a mission \u2014 one that he did not know how to accomplish. He was almost sixteen years of age and needed to wed. The princesses of the nearby kingdoms were too old or he did not find them to be suitable in one way or another. He could not possibly marry a commoner, that would be against the rules of the kingdom. <br>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d he bemoaned, \u201cperhaps a bit of fresh air would be for the best.\u201d Taking his horn, he blew a bellowing cry for his steed; a Dragon given to him by his godfather, the Wizard of Pillarime.<br>A gust of wind and a loud thud could be heard on his balcony. The large red dragon knelt in front of the prince, knowing what was desired. Securly mounted, the two took flight across the kingdom of Pillarme. They flew past the forests and into the mountains, finally landing near a large secluded lake surrounded by the snowy peaks that guarded it. It was their spot, a spot no one else knew, except one other; a girl of ashen hair and hazel eyes. She was drinking from the lake undisturbed nor worried about the man and beast in front of her.<br>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Prince, \u201cI\u2019ve never met another person here. How did you get up here?\u201d<br>\u201cMy name is Meredith. Don\u2019t tell anyone but I used magic.\u201d<br>\u201cMagic?\u201d <br>\u201cYes, magic. Let me show you.\u201d<br>With a wave of her hand, sparks of mana took shape. She performed for the Prince, dazzling his mind with the beauty she conjured. <br>\u201cWow! How did you learn to use magic? And can I do it too?\u201d<br>Meredith smiled at the Prince. Her eyes welled with tears and her smiling lips drooped into a frown. <br>\u201cIt is a curse which I would never wish upon another. To mock Nature is a crime upon itself.\u201d<br>\u201cI wish to learn anyways. A talent this powerful could never be a curse. I\u2019ll do anything to be able to cast magic!\u201d<br>\u201cAre you prepared to sacrifice what you love?\u201d<br>\u201cYes!\u201d<br>Meredith\u2019s eyes glowed a yellow that shocked the dragon.

For example, I can&#039;t take the name Asher Lockman seriously; it sounds too edgy, even though it&#039;s a real-enough name. The sentence &quot;there were goofy mechanical rubber hands that removed her clothes, sort of like the famous contraption from Wallace and Gromit.&quot; needs to stop at the comma; goofy mechanical rubber hands is enough, and insisting that the reader imagine exactly the thing from that TV show that one time is... too insistent. The further crudity at this point is again undermining the writing.<br><br>The tweest at the end is good and I like it, but it doesn&#039;t seem fully developed. The crudity makes more sense when you get the tweest but the problem is that the crudity just feels crude until you make it that far. It would be better if it felt sinister - instead of making the reader feel like he&#039;s reading someone&#039;s bad erotic fiction you want him to feel like he&#039;s reading a well-written horror story about a woman who is trapped in someone&#039;s bad erotic fantasy; you want it to read sinister instead of reading crude. As for the &quot;point&quot; that Asher makes, it&#039;s fine to make it so briefly but only if the rest of the work is adding context to it. You want the &quot;point&quot; to tie together all of the &quot;evidence&quot; that your story has presented in a lightbulb moment.

If you could keep only one, it would be TP.<br><br>\u2014 The project as a whole is a lot more successful than I expected. (That serves me right for having any faith in critics &amp; advance readers. They&#039;re all idiots.) CM did a fine job of making a novel (two novels) out of basically un-novelish material.<br><br>\u2014 Cohen is slightly annoying because he isn&#039;t sharp enough. I understood at least half the things Alicia said that he didn&#039;t. (Maybe that was Cormac&#039;s intention \u2014 make Alicia more intelligent than the reader, and Cohen less so. It worked for Arthur Conan Doyle.)<br><br>\u2014 Alicia is likeable. Her worst habit is constantly saying &quot;I know&quot; when Cohen says &quot;I don&#039;t understand&quot;. She sounds like a smart-aleck twelve-year-old taking a euphemism/colloquialism literally. She&#039;s meant to be a bit like that but not that much. I think Cormac slightly misjudged it.<br><br>\u2014 The two books should be a single volume, as originally intended. Cut down the Alicia-Kid banter sessions and have the SM transcripts after them, all alternating with Bobby&#039;s narrative. Get rid of the duplicate stuff (there isn&#039;t much). You would end up with one 550-page novel instead of a 400-page novel with a 200-page appendix. Begin with Alicia&#039;s suicide &amp; end with Bobby&#039;s last five pages.

Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.<br><br>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Ach\u00e6ans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant&#039;s wreath, and he besought the Ach\u00e6ans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.<br><br>&quot;Sons of Atreus,&quot; he cried, &quot;and all other Ach\u00e6ans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.&quot;<br><br>On this the rest of the Ach\u00e6ans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. &quot;Old man,&quot; said he, &quot;let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.&quot;<br><br>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto had borne. &quot;Hear me,&quot; he cried, &quot;O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.&quot;<br><br>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.", "time": 1671114911, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387123, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:07:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386929</a><br>I bet you haven&#039;t read it in homeric greek", "time": 1671116871, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387181, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:24:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21383093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21383093</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw got the FAGles translation</span><br>bros there&#039;s absolutely no metre, it&#039;s horrid<br>it&#039;s truly over", "time": 1671117862, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387214, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:32:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;hasn&#039;t read the old Attic version</span><br>it&#039;s like you aren&#039;t even trying, \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03ce\u03c0\u03b5\u03b5\u03c2", "filename": "sneed", "ext": ".png", "w": 635, "h": 724, "tn_w": 109, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671118350970904, "time": 1671118350, "md5": "5W4hTLK6wBS0WFAJTFOkeA==", "fsize": 1382248, "resto": 21382971}, {"no": 21387233, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)10:39:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21387014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21387014</a><br>Is this E.V.

J. P. Taylor, the eminent British historian, and hardly a Nazi sympathizer, writes:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Fascism, it was claimed, represented the last aggressive stage of capitalism in decline, and its momentum could be sustained only by war. There was an element of truth in this, but not much. The full employment which Nazi Germany was the first European country to possess, depended in large part on the production of armaments; but it could have been provided equally well (and was to some extent) by other forms of public works from roads to great buildings. The Nazi secret was not armament production; it was freedom from the then orthodox principles of economics . . . the argument for war did not work even if the Nazi system had relied on armaments production alone. Nazi Germany was not choking in a flood of arms. On the contrary, the German Generals insists unanimously in 1939 that they were not equipped for war and that many years must pass before \u201crearmament in depth\u201d had been completed.&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Answering predictions of ruin by orthodox economists throughout the world, Hitler explained that Germany had not withdrawn from world trade but had bypassed the international financial system by means of barter, stating:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;If certain countries combat the German system this is done in the first instance because through the German method of trading their tricks of international currency and Bourse speculations have been abolished in favor of honest business transactions. . . . We are buyers of good foodstuff and raw materials and suppliers of equally good commodities!&quot;</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More recently a professional economist, Henry C K Liu[18], who can hardly be suspected of Hitlerism, analyzed the methods by which Germany emerged from the Depression:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, at a time when its economy was in total collapse, with ruinous war-reparation obligations and zero prospects for foreign investment or credit. Yet through an independent monetary policy of sovereign credit and a full-employment public-works program, the Third Reich was able to turn a bankrupt Germany, stripped of overseas colonies it could exploit, into the strongest economy in Europe within four years, even before armament spending began. In fact, German economic recovery preceded and later enabled German rearmament, in contrast to the US economy, where constitutional roadblocks placed by the US Supreme Court on the New Deal delayed economic recovery until US entry to World War II put the US market economy on a war footing. While this observation is not an endorsement for Nazi philosophy, the effectiveness of German economic policy in this period, some of which had been started during the last phase of the Weimar Republic, is undeniable.&quot;</span>", "filename": "1653939673591", "ext": ".png", "w": 956, "h": 1804, "tn_w": 66, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671244709359835, "time": 1671244709, "md5": "5pi4TTPLY09rsfNpvdN+Ww==", "fsize": 680731, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394370, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:41:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>That analogy is stupid and doesn\u2019t fully work.", "time": 1671244914, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394377, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:45:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394281</a><br>Most Greek philosophers were what we today would call fascist", "time": 1671245112, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394381, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:47:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21390680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21390680</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5&#039;1&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dark complexion</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bavarian (embarrassment)</span><br>Shall I continue?", "time": 1671245243, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394384, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:48:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refusal to give a clear condemnation and breakaway from Nazism after WW2, seems to have been a matter of principle and intrinsic distaste to what he, in his own way, saw as the rise of \u201cglobohomo\u201d, and the West essentially trying to claim it was significantly moral superior to Germany, even with its own firebombing of Dresden, the detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the like.</span><br><br>True, and there\u2019s also no end to apologising, as the recent history of Germany has shown", "time": 1671245289, "resto": 21390680}, {"no": 21394392, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)21:49:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21393125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21393125</a><br>I don&#039;t care about persecuting Jews, Gulf Arabs, or blacks.

They had boosted their personnel from approximately 100,000 regulars (fully equipped) up to approx. 13 million regulars through WW2. This force was spearheaded by relatively small but fully operational armored divisions, which for the most part had their basic combat effectiveness close to 100%, because they had the necessary tanks, equipped with newly produced radio gear, already produced by German industry. What was required by the infantry and motorized divisions was transports, let alone armored transports, in a huge quantity given the relative size of the infantry compared to the mechanized. This was a quantity which could not be supported even when the entire German economy was fully deployed, which is why the majority of the German &quot;motorized&quot; divisions (IIRC the figure was between 70-80% in 1941) were using horses and horse-drawn guns pulling them through Russia. The armored spearheads were highly effective and German soldiers already had small arms, the problem was producing such a large quantity for such a large force in such a small time (ultimately 1933 - 1939, but more realistically it was 1936 - 1939), which is what the generals were referring to. They were always scared that the armor would outpace the infantry and cause severe catastrophes due to encirclement (which didn&#039;t happen at the start of the war due to the disorganization of France, Britain and Russia, as well as the skill of German spearheads and special operations units).

The legal inequality of the two partners, bequeathed to us from earlier social conditions, is not the cause but the effect of the economic oppression of the woman. In the old communistic household, which comprised many couples and their children, the task entrusted to the women of managing the household was as much a public and socially necessary industry as the procuring of food by the men. With the patriarchal family, and still more with the single monogamous family, a change came. Household management lost its public character. It no longer concerned society. It became a private service; the wife became the head servant, excluded from all participation in social production. Not until the coming of modern large-scale industry was the road to social production opened to her again \u2013 and then only to the proletarian wife. But it was opened in such a manner that, if she carries out her duties in the private service of her family, she remains excluded from public production and unable to earn; and if she wants to take part in public production and earn independently, she cannot carry out family duties. And the wife\u2019s position in the factory is the position of women in all branches of business, right up to medicine and the law. The modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual families as its molecules.</span><br>https://www.marxists.org/archive/ma<wbr>rx/works/1884/origin-family/ch02d.h<wbr>tm", "time": 1671095466, "resto": 21386174}, {"no": 21386260, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)04:48:33", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21386174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21386174</a><br>Engels has evidence for his claims regarding the past.

Men generally spend more hours in paid work than women. Women are often forced to seek employment by the meagreness of their partner&#039;s wage. But since they are trying to earn a mere increment on top of their partner&#039;s wage, an additional sum to secure the family&#039;s survival, they don&#039;t need to be as picky with their choice of employment as men - they take up part-time, poorly remunerated jobs. Men, by contrast, need to earn enough to function as the primary &#039;breadwinner&#039; so that their wives can look after the household.

One interesting thing about it is that author said that the communist regime was much more competitive than capitalism in fact, it was ultra-competitive in comparison to capitalism, but it was through education like getting really good grades at school, or learning multiple languages, because that was the main asset in a system in which money wasn&#039;t a factor in your success in that system.

Even the people who made out in the best in the 90s were former communists who turned into capitalists. There were a lot of secret police guys who were sheltering dissidents, and dissidents were who spies. So when people rejected that for democratic freedoms of expression and association (which she thinks are good), they rejected everything about socialism and Marxism because that was the only way they could cope with what had happened, you attack ideas rather than the people who were all complicit, and that led to extreme hostility to everything that smacks of Marxism, socialism, or communism and all these ideas that have been part of the discourse of propaganda of the communist regime. Therefore, the democratic freedoms also became bound up in &quot;economic freedoms&quot; which is liberalism and privatizing everything and free markets, which produces a whole new group of victims, which is what happened when the main pro-capitalist party that took part bankrupted the country in a giant pyramid scheme which took the shine off and resulted in a civil war.

By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England, Fourierists in France, [See Robert Owen and Fran\u00e7ois Fourier] both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in both cases men outside the working-class movement, and looking rather to the \u201ceducated&quot; classes for support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany. Thus, in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, \u201crespectable\u201d; communism was the very opposite. And as our notion, from the very beginning, was that \u201cthe emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself,\u201d there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take.

The result is that society becomes monomaniacal. The only possible deviation, change, etc, then, is the destruction of society. His example is the USSR: after a certain point, the only possible action that one could take in regards to the USSR was destroying it. The metaphor of the Warrior Caste rejecting the Priestly Caste is apt: a warband that no longer fights for a cause, but simply to fight. When they run out of enemies, who will they fight? Each other. When the last enemy is dead, the last warrior will have no one to fight but himself. &quot;Microfascism&quot; is the potential in any given thing that demands totalitarianism (that is, demands to be the CENTRAL thing in society that defines EVERYTHING) to become a macrofascism. You can see this in a lot of SJW stuff, like Woke activists demanding that the entirety of society be viewed through their special snowflake intersectionalism (&quot;blxck trans jewish bodxs of coloxr&quot;). But, it&#039;s also present in Christianity, in literal actual Italian Fascism (which was literally about totalitarianism of the state), etc. Microfascisms aren&#039;t so much something to be rooted out as much as they are something to be untangled, as any microfascism is deriving from some kind of issue that, when untangled, resolves itself. There&#039;s some kind of kernel embedded in each, and that kernel causes agitation, which builds up as the microfascism, which becomes the pearl in the clam. Neutralize the kernel, and you neutralize the threat.<br><br>This, alongside his rejection of Freud, rejection of the Labor Theory of Value, and rejection of Marxist historiography, is one of the takes that got him excommunicated from Communism. He wasn&#039;t really a Liberal, but more so a Classical Republican. His ideal society is one with several overlapping centers, each of which is actually incomplete to some degree (and thus cannot become totalitarian because each center cannot actually totalize society), and thus is reliant upon the others. Society can never be totalized, meaning that it&#039;s always in a state of organic, virile flux, producing novelty and rejuvenating itself. If you want to see what this looks like, imagine Ancient Greek city states plus what the Chinese do with Daoism/Buddhism/Confucianism but with like six more religious traditions.<br><br>It should be noted that Nazism is less Fascist than actual literal Fascism, or, humorously, Christianity and Feminism, as Nazism was still rooted in (what Deleuze would call the) Pre-Signifying Regime. In essence, because Nazism was still rooted to the biological realities of race and the spiritual realities of religion, it had less potential to become totalitarian than actual literal Fascism, because the ideology was still bound to something real (constructed =/= unreal).

Germans brought to perversion all their vehemence and love of system. Made-up boys with artificial waistlines promenaded along the Kurfustendamm. Even ancient Rome had not known orgies like the Berlin transvestite balls, where hundreds of men in women&#039;s clothes, and women in men&#039;s clothes, danced under the benevolent eyes of the police. Amid the general collapse of values, a kind of insanity took hold of precisely those middle class circles which had been unshakeable in their order.

All the better, more subtle ones with basically the same ideals were either too effete and modernist themselves (like Junger) or too bourgeois, too unwilling to be truly revolutionary (the Jungkonservativen around Papen/Schleicher). Waste time in a crisis by waiting for the perfect solution, and you get the second best solution: the NSDAP. Doesn&#039;t really matter anyway, since it would have levelled out, like all movements do, and produced a basically sane political consensus, like all movements do. Read Evola&#039;s Notes on the Third Reich for an overview of this perspective, it&#039;s good. <br><br>The Fascist regime was the same thing. Mussolini knew he was sitting on a powder keg of fifteen different kinds of well-meaning retards like the Futurists who all disagreed with each other on details, and only agreed in one thing: Italy needs a future that is non-bourgeois, non-parliamentary, non-faggy, non-Weimar. So Mussolini did the only thing one can do, and realized his job was to bind all these retards together into a mighty faggot and wait until the best tendencies among them can trickle down into a new generation not raised under Weimar conditions. Mussolini&#039;s main political strategy for Fascist Italy wasn&#039;t the implementation of any one autistic program, it was &quot;durare,&quot; &quot;to last/survive,&quot; i.e. to last long enough that the healthy impulses can percolate into the body politic and reawaken it, while the unhealthy and disintegrative impulses are purged. I give credit for this interesting point to fascistanon who posted about it recently. <br><br>Judging the fascist states by what they did in their first 10 years of existence is like judging France by the Terror or judging America by all its early expediencies and mistakes (it had its own Terror for example and suppressed its &quot;internal&quot; rebels during its own rebellion against Britain).

But what it boils down to is an obscurantist heriarchy of traditional philosophical concepts and how Deleuze in reality fits in none of them. Badiou wants it to reduce into a thing, such as the rhizome, immamnce, differance but fails to do any of that becuase it is his won philosophical thinking that boils to one thing, such as , the one, absolute, infinity etc. If isn&#039;t clealry enough Deleuze yawns with these concepts and with academic philosophy in general. Look at who are Deleuze&#039;s fathers: Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, and Hume. All non academic &quot;outsiders&quot;, it is they who allowed him to embrace an anarchic style of thinking which is non stratified, non historicaly determined, non traditional.

It&#039;s the technology, my girls, I\u2019m sure you know. Satellites, weather buoys, telecommunication, all this helps to play chess with the sea. But in the end no one knows the consciousness of the ocean. There are days when he&#039;s in his pajamas, yawning, so calm you could squeeze him into a bottle and feed him to a baby. But sometimes, without warning, he becomes so ferocious that all his waters seem to be made from the frothy marrow drawn from the bones of some monster.

The world goes dark. The sun, the heart of the day, is clogged with the cholesterol of the salty fog, stuffed with a swelling of spongy syrup, and for that reason it disappears and becomes silent and no longer pumps out light. There is only light in lightning. There is so much thunder and lightning in the sky that it looks like a cleaning lady is scrubbing and rinsing the floors of the Heights with a bucket of bubbling thunderbolts.

A spiritual tradition that fixates on authenticity at the expense of validity is usually slipping down the chute toward extinction, because people don\u2019t generally practice a spiritual tradition because they want to feel more authentically (insert label here) than the next person; they practice it because they want results, and if they don\u2019t get results, they\u2019re normally going to head somewhere else in due time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a certain sense, Druidry\u2014the spiritual tradition descended from the 18th-century Druid Revival\u2014is a fine test case for De Mille\u2019s assertion.

I dont know that much about russian literature, but I have a grasp on the basic shape as well as the rules of Russian poetry.<br><br>The reason I love Dostoevsky is that he combines an absolutely overwhelming love for humanity and existence, marred by periods of intense suffering, with a psychological acuity and a theatrical flair that creates these insane melodramatic sequences where the characters are practically shouting out the dialectics of the inner torments of his soul. The sequences in which Dmitri and Alyosha or Alyosha and Ivan basically scream at each other in TBK are among the most affecting things I have ever read. The Father Zosima death sequence may as well have been writtten by a mystic or prophet. He just completely understood the sense of simultaneous love for everything and confusion over the brokenness of everything and he managed to express this through the travails of the characters he has set up as kind of mouthpieces for aspects of human existence. The brothers and the father all represent magnified dimensions of personality(monk, rake, intellectual) which correspond also to basic principles of reality(the spirit, body, mind), but he has arranged them into this almost delirious theatre of circumstance where you lose track of whether the characters are even really being characters or just acting out some kind of conversation. His prose is overall not great but he does possess the ability to make you feel a sense of excitement and foreboding, a breathless anticipation, with the way he chops up his sentences and paragraphs with digressions and cutoffs, you are always fully attendant even when he goes on a 20 page detour about some minor character&#039;s backstory because you understand why this is important to the overall conversation being had by the voices of the novel. <br><br>He is not a first rate artist, but he is a monumental impact on literature.

Personally I think this kind of critique is 100% necessary for Christianity to renew itself and reacquire some kind of metaphysical core, but I have to admit, like I was saying above, I think this jnana-tantra approach has its limitations. For example, Evola and Guenon both want to talk about the occult war, as I mention in my reply above. But how do you talk about this war without taking demonic influences seriously, as non-impersonal? Ironically Paul is one of the best sources on this, and Christianity in general is one of the few traditions willing to describe a real metaphysical war against personally active demonic powers: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Essentially, Traditionalism&#039;s critique of Christianity is very similar to the Theravada critique of Mahayana Buddhism&#039;s soteriological and eschatological elements. <br><br>But these criticisms potentially force Traditionalism itself into a passive and quietistic position, which it is supposedly criticizing Christianity for.

In fact this is where a lot of Guenonians end up, advocating just riding out the kali yuga because it&#039;s all cyclical anyway. If your conception of all human dealings, all history, is simply that it is samsara, with no teleological or eschatology, then your only two options for understanding samsara are (1) it&#039;s an uncreated and &quot;static&quot; eternal world, like Aristotle&#039;s world, or (2) it cyclically dies and is reborn, and presumably there is some symbolically &quot;fixed&quot; number and nature to the ages of the cycle and so on and so forth, but again all this means nothing, since as an individual initiate you cannot affect the cycles in any way, or perhaps at most you can accelerate the present one (?).", "time": 1670831965, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373693, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:00:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373691</a><br>What is even the value in seeking to create a &quot;diamond/rainbow body&quot; and escape samsara at all?

Guenon and Evola both emphasize that there is nothing &quot;moral&quot; in what they are doing, and that the vulgar sentimental and moral religion of everyday faithful is merely exoteric, basically its only value is containing dumbed down versions of symbols that keep ordinary people anchored in their Traditional-Platonic republics, while maintaining pathways of symbolic ascent for talented individuals to pursue to their eventual initiation. But again, why? Unless there is some real, non-cylical, zero-sum struggle going on, then who cares?

It&#039;s a bit like modern science in this way: science is unwilling to envision anything metaphysical, because it&#039;s obsessed with not tainting itself with superstitions.

Most major traditions have some form of angelology/demonology, whether Neoplatonic or Christian, pre-Islamic djinn, Buddhist demonology, etc. From a Traditionalist perspective, a Christian or Neoplatonic angelology that emphasizes faith in and collaboration with Good beings who are actively engaged in an eschatological fight, an occult war, and who both want to help us and who want our help, would just be superstition. But from a Christian perspective, and from a Neoplatonic or even Mahayana perspective that takes the occult war seriously, Traditionalism would be dangerously &quot;magical&quot; in trying to be an amoral series of techniques, and advice for the maintenance of said techniques in initiatic lines, in a cosmos in which active participation in soteriological eschatology is a necessary element of any awakening, and in which demonic forces are equally active. From this perspective, Evola and Guenon would be doing exactly what they criticize New Agers for doing: stripping people of their everyday protections and throwing them into trans-personal psychic experiences in which they will simply be subject to whatever forces are nearby. <br><br>In rejecting all claims to revelation as contingent and samsaric, Traditionalism also misses out on the possibility of a symbolic interpretation of &quot;dispensationalist&quot; revelation, in which history is not merely samsaric and cyclical, and attaining enlightenment is not merely optional and always potentially open to amoral initiates, and the occult war is not merely a particularly bad patch in the most recent kali yuga in an infinite cycle of them, but instead, history is not cylical, there is a fixed goal here, there are win and lose conditions, enlightenment is not just &quot;available&quot; to initiates but is a responsibility and a duty, and thus enabling others to be enlightened is also a duty, etc.", "time": 1670832087, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373698, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "most of them<br>start with the mystery of the grail", "time": 1670832095, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373699, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:01:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21370825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21370825</a><br>Evola was influenced by the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich so it&#039;s not like he disregarded all protestantism.", "time": 1670832118, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373700, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:02:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373697</a><br>And therefore, the mythic-eschatological content of a religion like Christianity, with its publically available emphasis on resisting Satan and imitating Christ in daily life, is not just an incidental exoteric form of symbols that are only really relevant to autistic initiates, there is actually a purpose to the &quot;opening&quot; of the mysteries, which, yes, vulgarized them from a certain perspective, but perhaps only because this was analogous to sprinkling thousands of seeds, formerly been contained in neatly condensed form in individual pots, over a huge field of soil and manure, so that at first they seem merely &quot;lost,&quot; but in time they grow and become many thousands of fruit-bearing, seed-bearing trees themselves? <br><br>If all of history can be interpreted symbolically in this way, then we can begin to ask questions that the Traditionalists are afraid to ask: What does it MEAN, using symbolic interpretation and sympathetic intuition, that Christ figures appeared and managed to embed moral messages and fundamentally change history, turning pagan Europe into a moral and even sentimental Christian Europe - which Evola can only view as an aberration, from his Traditionalist perspective?

But it should have been a clearing and a praeparatio evangelica, not a self-sufficient technique to end all techniques. Overall I think Traditionalism needs a re-fertilization by all the traditions it rejects: Abrahamic, Zoroastrian, and Hindu bhakti. Its extreme rejection of personal, moral, eschatological, and soteriological elements was historically conditioned by the dangerous spread of New Age syncretism and occultism that led to people like Crowley (probably genuinely dangerous, as can be seen in Scientology). This process should be oriented toward fighting the occult war in a moral, soteriological, eschatological way. The presupposition of autistic initiation and meaningless cyclical samsara should be dropped, and the &quot;merely accidental&quot; elements of traditions (that is, that don&#039;t accord with autistic initiation and meaningless cyclicality) should be reinterpreted in this light.", "time": 1670832148, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21373703, "now": "12/12/22(Mon)03:03:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21373700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21373700</a><br>Much of the Traditionalist understanding of history doesn&#039;t stand up to scrutiny.

This is important because an understanding of history is necessary for understanding how to fight the occult war. If your answer is just &quot;go back to Rome&quot; or &quot;wait out the next cycle,&quot; you may very well be reenacting a move that didn&#039;t work in the first place (or that caused the problem to worsen in the first place), or surrendering the world to evil if you are wrong about its cyclicality, respectively.

But personality and freedom are symbolically analogous to history: apparent contingency that can contain or reflect symbolic truth. Traditionalism sees all three of these categories in a merely negative way, each is interpreted as mere caprice or as the negative pole of manifestation of essence. But if the nature of all being is that of essence, which is pure in itself but which struggles to manifest clearly in becoming, then why shouldn&#039;t becoming itself (and its subordinate aspects: personality, freedom, history) have its own essence and meaning? Why not interpret ALL temporal contingency, all becoming qua &quot;mere negation of, or derivation or divagation from, atemporal being,&quot; as itself the symbolic emanation of an essence that combines and explains both being and becoming, instead of merely LEAVING becoming as an empty/negative category as almost all nondualist metaphysicians, including Traditionalists, do?

I can&#039;t and won&#039;t summarise everything for you. What I can tell you is that Evola already had major gripes with the Jewish prophetic tradition, which is the deepest root of Christianity. The key to understanding the prophetic tradition is to acknowledge two things - first, that it belongs to a very profane culture, and second, that it originates from the lowest social stratum of that culture. So, whereas (at least the best) rabbis and Jewish kings had their own spiritual and royal arts, the prophets were mostly very pious and coarse bums. Their spirituality was that of a man who feels a strong, strong love for divinity, but also, due to his coarse mentality and special psychological features, fails to discover the presence of the divine element anywhere at all. Hence the difference between the Greeks who admired the world as a reflection of the divine world of forms on the one hand, and the Jewish prophets on the other hand, with the famous cry &quot;vanitas vanitatum&quot;. In the prophetic view, God is the only thing of value, and he is not to be found anywhere, least of all within ourselves. Hence the fundamentally shattered and broken nature of man, who needs &quot;redemption&quot;, and, what is more, faith in order to be redeemed. From this stems also the very flawed &quot;solution, at every level - you just need to be rendered &quot;complete&quot; by &quot;God&quot;. Orthodoxy provides the most successful formulation of this with the idea of the Godbearing man, and also of Theosis, but even that stops short of true metaphysical heights. God is beyond all form, beyond all manifestation and beyond any completeness or completing function. To unite with God means more than to honour him in your heart - it means to become one with him, literally, and consequently also transcend everything, as he does. That&#039;s henosis. If you don&#039;t reach that level, you are still dealing with manifestation rather than with the source, the essence.", "time": 1671013978, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21382633, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)09:38:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382153</a><br>I can see why that apply to Abrahamic religions, but i dont get why Evola (and Guenon too) then do not offer the same criticism to Islam, which also relies on faith, a fallen view of man, and the inadequacy of man without God.", "time": 1671028721, "resto": 21370500}, {"no": 21383195, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)12:39:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21382633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21382633</a><br>It&#039;s because Islam has institutionalised Sufism which knows much higher metaphysical heights than exoteric Islam.

They spend more attention and time on Islam than on anything else, and almost all the major figures heavily specialise in Islam and constantly promote it or support Islamic groups. The ones that are not pro-Muslim are just vaguely perennialist, which would be fine if the rest weren&#039;t so heavily pro-Muslim.

Read what he wrote about the Holy Roman Empire and the Ghibellines, the crusades and the Templars. So read almost any of his books. He says Europeans are the ones who retain the most &quot;spiritual virility&quot; which is the legacy of the Aryans. Some races also retain elements of it, and ancient China interests him partly because of this. In Revolt he talks about the Ancient Aryans being pale and white, and the Chinese legends of pale, blue-eyed giants teaching them the secrets the empire-building. He routinely refers to darker races in harsh terms, if you read Revolt then you would know that he believes that Aryans and Nordic races are solar while darker races are telluric and chaotic, metaphysically. Yes, it isn&#039;t purely biological, but ideally (i.e., Traditionally) biology matches race of the spirit and of the soul.

Early modern political theory took this kind of thing very seriously and functioned by envisioning something like the stage on which people are the ultimate subjects they are in the state of nature, and can&#039;t be reduced any further politically, and then envisioning what it means for people in that state to constitute themselves a free people, by &quot;giving themselves the law.&quot; This is why Locke says that the state of nature continue to exist, i.e., all sovereign peoples are in a state of nature with respect to eachother just as all individuals were prior to the formation of any sovereign peoples. <br><br>If you have any other already constituted sovereignty to which people owe their ultimate obedience when supposedly constituting themselves a free and sovereign people, then it is a false constitution, because they gave erroneous assent to the formation of the body politic. <br><br>English and American political theory always had a huge fear of Catholic subversives, going back to the early days of the English Reformation when the church was dominated by the Habsburgs, who had just conquered and sacked Rome, and who wanted to end the Reformation by conquering and subduing the Protestants as rebels and heretics, including conquering England and pressing dynastic claims on it, famously culminating in the Battle of the Spanish Armada. That memory of &quot;treacherous papists&quot; and especially subversive Jesuits never died in England and led to fairly brutal persecutions of Catholics. <br><br>By the time of the 19th century Catholics often were from more rural and less bourgeois regions and gained the further stigma of being backwards, anti-Enlightenment, retarded bumpkins but also subversives who would ally with the pope and his infiltrator Jesuits and sell out the bourgeois nation-state at the drop of a hat.", "time": 1671260662, "resto": 21394191}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21394979, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:57:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Has any good literature come out of communist China aside from chairman Mao?", "time": 1671260228, "resto": 0, "filedeleted": 1, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "has-any-good-literature-come-out-of-communist", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21394996, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)02:01:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;aside from chairman Mao</span><br>There will never be an end to the memetic irony that veils every discussion had online.

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot;Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.", "time": 1671257886, "resto": 21394522}, {"no": 21394889, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)01:19:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21394603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21394603</a><br>Unspeakably based", "time": 1671257947, "resto": 21394522}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21388431, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:44:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Goodreads 2022 most read books<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/blog/sho<wbr>w/2493?rto=x_gr_e_nl_general&amp;utm_me<wbr>dium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;ut<wbr>m_campaign=December152022&amp;utm_conte<wbr>nt=Top.Reading.Challenge&amp;ref_=pe_30<wbr>97180_680606390</span><br><br>So what do we think of this list?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw harry potter still in top 50</span>", "filename": "1617471627164", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1113, "h": 876, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 196, "tim": 1671137050097956, "time": 1671137050, "md5": "L8Hr15LNbpbpbA9tubc1gA==", "fsize": 156174, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "goodreads-2022-most-read-books", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 63, "images": 6, "unique_ips": 39}, {"no": 21388437, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:45:26", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21388431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21388431</a><br>Jert jurt jurt jert n squrt", "time": 1671137126, "resto": 21388431}, {"no": 21388448, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:48:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "men really need to step up their game and start reading and writing. women basically dominate both sides of the market", "time": 1671137323, "resto": 21388431}, {"no": 21388457, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)15:50:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21388431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21388431</a><br>These all look like shit, of course they&#039;re all written by women.

Yes, it would be good if the entire world could laugh and play and jump around bonfires with glee, but that isn&#039;t reality. Tribalism is really the preservation of one identity against others. Tribalism isn&#039;t inherently bad, but due to its nature it is competitive. Generally, this will entail harming other &quot;tribes.&quot;<br>If we talk about the most obvious example, ideology, you can see the example illustrated clearly. If you believe in &quot;anti-tribalism&quot; and want to ensure that the world is peaceful and &quot;humanistic&quot;, you will have to defend your &quot;tribe&quot; against the others that will very gladly tear it to pieces and replace it with a far less tolerant ideology. Because the more tribalistic peoples will have no qualms with crushing anything and remaining intolerant of your ideals, your tribe will inevitably disappear through out-competition. We can see this with the failure of liberal democracy to assimilate minority groups and extremist minority religions.<br>For the example of race, we have to talk in pragmatic terms. Jews are highly tribalistic, and this isn&#039;t a bad thing. The fact is that Jews, whether they overall like the Jewish community or not, are forced to rally together at every turn to defend themselves from possible racial or ethnic threats. They are tribalistic to survive. Blacks must be tribalistic in the same way, and their tribalism is what kept their culture alive. Whites are far less tribalistic, and their tolerance is being rewarded with the disappearance of their race and culture. This won&#039;t result in a more tolerant world; they will simply disappear and be replaced with more tribalistic peoples.<br><br>Tribalism is just a fact of human evolution. You cannot and should not avoid it, unless you&#039;re okay with being replaced.

It would make sense that tribalism formed for reasons that are similar to the familiarity and safety that is inherent in most families. These tribes would then either through intuition or experience come to certain conclusions as to what activities or beliefs would be practiced and held by the ideal society. They would then actively oppose tribes that are in disagreement with them, first for the survival of their tribe and later on this line of thinking and acting is continued for tradition-sake which then leads to people like OP oppose previous tradition.

Andrei looking up at the sky at the battle and again at his estate, Natasha exclaiming about the moonlight, the Rostovs making little play and then the carriage ride home, pierre looking at the comet, etc it so full of these things it is ridiculous, they are so bursting with inexpressible meaning. The best thing he ever wrote though is also the most famous thing, &quot;He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking&quot;. This is maybe the greatest use of metaphor ever in a novel. It is literally impossible to overrate this sentence. The way it comes about when Levin is meeting the object of his love who it becomes increasingly clear doesnt care about him magnifies the intensity of it tenfold. I dont think any other author has ever depicted the state of nervous romantic confusion as clearly as he does here; it is so vivid that reading it feels more real than your own memory. The implication of fretful sun worship and sin embedded in his lust, combined with the beauty and innocent longing of his romantic affectation. The inadequacy of his person that orients himself to her in a position of worshipper to god in the first place. It illustrates the entirety of their relationship in a single fragment, while simultaneously being a strikingly beautiful and immersive image that transports you into the scene. There is probably no better example of why Tolstoy is a genius, and it also contains his typical strange almost laboured sentence structure, like he is just ekeing things out from some predetermined arrangement.<br><br>He also has some interesting short stories and essays but my post is becoming too long.

Choice is a purely destructive act, the elimination of possibilities from a list according to some criterion, to favor choice at the expense of questioning is to cause a progressive whittling-down of variety until stagnation is reached.<br><br>A recommendation emerges from this: to nourish your conscious freedom, seek The Unknown.", "time": 1671145864, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389129, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:12:29", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389122</a><br>This was a copypasta i posted as a joke but ok", "filename": "pepe", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 500, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671145949231146, "time": 1671145949, "md5": "JeQlowBROhqeF5W+ysnxZw==", "fsize": 23001, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389133, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Acknowledges the beauty of nature</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Denies the existence of heaven</span>", "time": 1671145958, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389147, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:17:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389133</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Denies the existence of heaven</span><br>Unequivocally false<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.</span>", "time": 1671146224, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389157, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:19:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389007</a><br>Evangelical=feels<br>Orthodox=reals", "time": 1671146375, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389166, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389007</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have noticed how different the Kantian system is from the evangelical protestant world.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Evangelicals</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;lots of feelings, emotions, language tends to be vague and wishy washy, the people are very nice</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kantian system</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;they don&#039;t care about feelings or emotions, they have very specific and clearly defined terminology, their worldview is much more concrete and structured, they might not always appear as nice or friendly on a surface level, but they aren&#039;t trying to be rude either; they simply care about truth rather than feelings</span>", "filename": "DerMetaphysikerDerMetaphysiker", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1387, "h": 1704, "tn_w": 101, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671146531183999, "time": 1671146531, "md5": "YTgsTkAliK/+LnjFMUi3xQ==", "fsize": 793829, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389189, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:30:57", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21389166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21389166</a><br>Orthodox Christians have refuted Kantianism though!", "filename": "1632169971008", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 296, "h": 550, "tn_w": 67, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671147057983784, "time": 1671147057, "md5": "cY79vMxQ1YGxsoN9Bo5d9w==", "fsize": 41330, "resto": 21388086}, {"no": 21389190, "now": "12/15/22(Thu)18:31:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Clairvoyant anons, what is the poster to lurker ratio?

It is more dependent on root objects of desire than the particular forms or signifiers through which they appear. If you desire a feminine ideal, there are ways in which this feminine ideal could appear to you as a man and ways you could engage with this man either pseudo sexually or in a directly sexual manner. Think not only of the feminine men who you could mistake for women across a crowded bar and want to fuck, but also the relationships with men in which you play a role that fits your ideal of masculinity and they play a role that fits your ideal of femininity, in which you lovingly dominate this man while sharing emotions intimately with him.

For most of my life I was the youngest child. And as my older brothers entered into adulthood, it was obvious from the outset that they were destined to be losers. They both now lean on me for personal and emotional support and see me as the guiding light or whatever. They&#039;re obviously insecure about it too. <br>But on the other hand, when I was about 15 my dad decided to have another child. He was born to a different mother and has grown up very differently than myself and my older brothers. We grew up with an uninvolved mother and my dad was at the time quasi absuive and neglectful. He had a laissez faire style of parenting and we were left to our own devices. <br>Now this much younger brother grew up with two very involved parents. My dad at this time way mellowed out and so isnt such a hard ass and his mom is one of thsoe tiger moms. The four of us began with all the same level of potential, but the neglect and abuse left myself and my older brothers very stunted. My youngest brother is now very skilled in music, top athlete in every sport he tries, and far academically ahead of his age. He&#039;s well socialized and popular and very confident. <br>He often asks me questions about what instruments I learned, or sports I played, or what my birthday parties were like. It&#039;s hard to find ways to explain to him that i never got to do any of those things. <br>I dont resentment him for it. I&#039;m very happy that he has all of that. I feel no jealousy or envy, but I do feel resentment for my parents. I wasnt unambitious or anything. I remember desperstely asking my dad to enroll me in sports and to put me in music classes but he always told me he was too busy. And of course the bad home environment and constany moving left me unsure of myself and socially awkward.

For you seem to be confusing two things as though they are one, mixing up what is naturally separate. First you would mix the idea of water up with its appearance, as you say that a man would try to drink a mirage. But do we not obviously distinguish between appearance and the thing? Let us consider this point a little closer. When you see water in the distance, what would you say?<br><br>Dennett: Why, Socrates, I would exclaim, &quot;I can see water.&quot;<br><br>Socrates: And, to speak perfectly correctly, you would not say, &quot;that is most certainly water.&quot;<br><br>Dennett: Why, Socrates, only if my reason had fled me.<br><br>Socrates: And so we maintain that there is a difference between what is seen, and what, we might say, is?<br><br>Dennett: It cannot be denied.<br><br>Socrates: And insofar as something is seen, we have established that we can only rightly comment on our relationship with the thing, in this case that it is merely seen?

This much we acknowledge?<br><br>Dennett: I&#039;m not sure I follow you, Socrates, but I will consent.<br><br>Socrates: Let me put it this way: do we not distinguish between the sight of water and water itself only in point of its being?

And would we not rightly assent that such a substance is in fact what we believe it be?<br><br>Dennett: Necessarily.<br><br>Socrates: And do we admit the perception of falsities? I mean errors of sight, for example the little transparent letters we occasionally see floating before our eyes? We admit that these are false sights?<br><br>Dennett: Why, Socrates, one might affirm they are false in reality, but how could they be false as far as sight is concerned?<br><br>Socrates: You have led me along the path my own mind was just taking me, Dennett. But ought we to call the mere sight true or false? Surely it is a sight, but whether it is true or false we cannot say.
