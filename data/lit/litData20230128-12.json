Its right in front of all our faces yet it takes a drug like mushrooms to make you actually see it. <br>The reason it sounds so boring or obvious to state that this system is so bad, is because everyone around you is asleep. Their eyes are open, but they are not awake. They exist in a dreamy haze of man made society, living for artificial dopamine hits, and many of them are impossible to wake up. The NPC meme is not far from the truth, and like in that movie the Matrix, many of them will become hostile and fight you when you expose to them just how big of a lie this society is. To the NPC, exposing the lie of society shows them that their identity is fake, and that they have done their whole life wrong. The NPC cannot handle the chaos from being awakened, and therefore I advise you to stay clear of those true NPCs.<br>Probably 97-99% of people around us are complete dead ends, if you are looking to change things. Changing the opinions of NPCSand showing them a better path is too time consuming for those of us who are awake. We have precious time, and there are very few of us, which is why you need to look for the Nietzschean Ubermensch around you in your environment, be it University, Work, or whatever. They can be anyone, and these Ubermensch have the ability to save the world due to their high Thumos and will to life.

He considers them surrogate activities because they are meaningless filler to detract from the, in his eyes, horror of not being capable of fulfilling the power process in a &quot;natural&quot; way - i.e., to the best of my interpretative abilities, sheer, primitive survival - the only end worth pursuing for Ted.<br><br>This is fatal for his thought. He is stuck in the means-ends reasoning of modernity. Reading rigorous philosophical analyses of technological encroachment, such as those by Adorno (or Heidegger who says much the same thing, if you have retarded gripes about Adorno), I think it is very convincingly demonstrated that the problem with technology is the way it colonizes minds to only accept means-ends reasoning, without ever reflecting on what ends are chosen, or whether there might be such a thing as an end-in-itself (by the way, this is the exact reason why the caricature of a STEM bugman cannot appreciate art - he is incapable of seeing art as an end-in-itself).", "time": 1674904440, "resto": 21580579}, {"no": 21582417, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)06:15:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21582414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21582414</a><br>2/2<br>This is the true danger of technology, and Kazcynski does not escape it - he REITERATES IT, but in an even more radical way.

That he has the gall to speak of &quot;autonomy&quot; (in a perverted, modern american sense, very far from the enlightenment ethos from which it arose) after reducing humans to Skinner-like-behaviorist animals with a singular function and purpose (defined by Ted) is outrageous. <br><br>So no - playing the cello is an end-in-itself, not to seduce and reproduce, not to &quot;communicate&quot;, not to make money, not to this or that. It is without any further purpose. It is not done for anything except itself. And that does not detract from it and turn it into a mere surrogate - on the contrary, that is the mark of its excellence, of its distinctly human character. <br><br>That is not to say that technological society is not a menace and an enemy - I agree. I just think Ted&#039;s approach to it is so profoundly flawed that I find it worthless, and everything he had to say was said better by Heidegger and Adorno.

Altogether too conscious of her curves, too much aware of the tiny hand around my neck, I take a silent calming breath. Cradling her gently, my mighty legs lift us both smoothly, permitting her to clearly see the top shelf. With my other arm, I hold for her any book she delights to read - dexterously turning pages with my thumb, and not needing to move a muscle anywhere else. My senses are as rigidly aware as my form; nothing escapes my knightly notice. As she is clearly a genteel lady of great worth, I will carry her throughout the library, that the drab sows which waddle there in droves might see her splendor and recall their lowly station. Should any besotted suitors be so engrossed in her beauty as to be captivated to the point of failing to recognize the great danger I pose them - an error even I am want to forgive - I will grasp their faces in my free hand, crushing their brainy mass between my fingers, and with a light toss make a ruin of them all upon the nearest wall. At my command, the librarians finish off any unfortunates still clinging to life, and heap their carcasses outside as a warning to would-be love-struck fools. When my lady has made her selection, I will bare her softly to the ground upon my Atlassian arm and hold the volumes in the other. Any who fail to kneel as she passes on foot will be blistered with the back of my hand. The librarians rush dutifully at our approach - eager to serve, eager to please, yet I silence them with a stern gaze, even as my lady beams her divine smile in Venetian mercy.

It&#039;s lonely at the top. Have a feeling my life would have been great if I&#039;d been born just 5 years earlier, and I&#039;d probably be dead or worse if I&#039;d been born 5 years later.

So how is it going anon?<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved.&quot;</span><br><br>Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.", "filename": "1574742683565", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1674855472934774, "time": 1674855472, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 21579201}, {"no": 21580308, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)16:40:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21579201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21579201</a><br><a href=\"#p21580302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21580302</a><br>So read NDE accounts and basically all you can about NDEs. Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here.

A prolonged phase of gradually expanding cooperation with key Eurasian partners, both stimulated and arbitrated by America, can also help to foster the preconditions for an eventual upgrading of the existing and increasingly antiquated UN structures.

I think Jewish (and all other ethnic) overrepresentation is a very worthy topic of discussion, not the least because it&#039;s very relevant in understanding American politics as well as the ethnicities themselves, just as understanding Greek overrepresentation in Ptolemaic Egypt is key to understanding Egyptian politics of the era, or Sunnite overrepresentation in Ba&#039;athist Iraq.

Ditto for being unenthusiastic about serving their host countries. A minority putting its own interests above all else? How is this unique to Jews? If anything an ethnonationalist should be able to sympathize. The only undeniable point is their intellectual influence on Marxist thought, but it&#039;s not really a mystery why a frequently persecuted minority would latch onto an ideology promising equality. Early on Latvians were equally overrepresented and instrumental in Russian Communism as the Jews, followed by other non-Russian minorities until Stalin largely purged them both. Unlike Jews, they were less educated so had less ability to contribute intellectually, but their key role in contributing to Bolshevik power is well known (the Red Latvian Riflemen being the most notable example).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thet are everywhere in industries that deal in young, attractive flesh now.

I&#039;m thinking the same. The problem isn&#039;t being uncomfortable in a situation like this. It&#039;s being enough of a manchild lacking in self awareness and life experience that you would get caught stumbling so badly out of your element in the first place, forcing everyone around you to pay for it by managing your emotions for you. It&#039;s tiresome being a babysitter and that&#039;s why manchildren evoke such repulsion.<br><br>There&#039;s always a classy exit from situations like this. Like you said, he could&#039;ve just stuck to the conversation and turn the situation around by taking the initiative with the girl, flirting, teasing even, without getting sexual. He could&#039;ve made *them* the fools.<br><br>Of course I&#039;m speaking hypothetically. In this specific case, with this specific person, that was impossible. We already saw how forced the conversation was. He simply couldn&#039;t have shaken the feeling of impotency. Despite being 35, he hasn&#039;t come to grips with his limitations and hasn&#039;t been able to accept himself as he is. This is a man who has lived his entire life feeling inadequate, and hence forced to follow others. He is a refugee from himself and probably his entire character is a charade. He should really stop mulling over grand ideas and verbal puzzles for a second and reflect on himself as a person, a bodily individual, a man, a friend, and a lover.", "time": 1674848853, "resto": 21567490}, {"no": 21579934, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:47:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;hey you there, rightoid, wanna have sum fun with leftists?</span><br>Yes!", "filename": "5_File-picture-of-Anders-Behring-Breivik-taken-from-book-downloaded-from-Norwegian-discussion-website[1]", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1200, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674848876683942, "time": 1674848876, "md5": "FyeYIo6IwzRG+HPizWrEEA==", "fsize": 125926, "resto": 21567490}, {"no": 21579966, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)14:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21579391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21579391</a><br><a href=\"#p21579417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21579417</a><br>I&#039;ve fucked over 40 girls and I&#039;m still afraid.

When this error was announced by an authority like Goethe, all those esthetic critics who did not understand art threw themselves on it like crows on carrion and began to discover in Shakespeare beauties which did not exist, and to extol them.</span><br>From Tolstoy on Shakespeare<br>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/277<wbr>26/27726-h/27726-h.htm", "time": 1674822146, "resto": 21578545}, {"no": 21578708, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:59:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21578602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21578602</a><br>Oh shit", "time": 1674824394, "resto": 21578545}, {"no": 21578744, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:14:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21578601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21578601</a><br>I don&#039;t think I will", "time": 1674825252, "resto": 21578545}, {"no": 21578746, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:16:16", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21578744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21578744</a><br>Then, you&#039;re an obvious faggot <br>t. different anon", "time": 1674825376, "resto": 21578545}, {"no": 21578754, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:18:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21578545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21578545</a><br>i hate him now. i despise every author that has been forced on me.", "time": 1674825488, "resto": 21578545}, {"no": 21578800, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)08:40:10", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21578746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21578746</a><br>I don&#039;t care.

That a heartfelt, truly blest relation to Christ&#039;s precepts exists among the generality of present Christians, is certainly not so easy to aver. The educated doubts, the common man despairs. Science makes God the Creator more impossible each day; but from the beginning of the Church the God revealed to us by Jesus has been converted by the Theologians from a most sublime reality into an ever less intelligible problem. That the God of our Saviour should have been identified with the tribal god of Israel, is one of the most terrible confusions in all world-history; it has avenged itself in every age, and avenges itself to-day by the more and more outspoken atheism of the coarsest, as the finest minds. We have lived to see the Christian God condemned to empty churches, while ever more imposing temples are reared among us to Jehova. And it almost seems right that Jehova at last should quite suppress the God so monstrously mistakenly derived from him. If Jesus is proclaimed Jehova&#039;s son, then every Jewish rabbi can triumphantly confute all Christian theology, as has happened indeed in every age. What a melancholy, what a discreditable plight, is that of our whole Theology, maintained to give our doctors of the church and popular preachers little else than the guidance to an insincere interpretation of the truths contained in our priceless Gospels! To what is the preacher bound fast in the pulpit, but to compromises between the utmost contradictions, whose subtleties must necessarily confound our very faith itself and make us ask: Who now knows Jesus? Historical criticism, perchance ? It casts in its lot with Judaism, and, just like every Jew, it wonders that the bells on Sunday morn should still be ringing for a Jew once crucified two thousand years ago. [Reference to Human, All too Human] How often and minutely have the Gospels been critically searched, their origin and compilation exposed beyond a doubt; so that one might have thought the very evidence of the spurious- ness and irrelevance of their contradictory matter would at last have opened the eyes of Criticism to the lofty figure of the Redeemer and his work. But the God whom Jesus revealed to us; the God no god, no sage or hero of the world, had known before; the God who, amid Pharisees, Scribes and sacrificial Priests, made himself known to poor Galilean shepherds and fishermen with such soul-compelling power and simplicity that whoso once had recognised him, beheld the world and all its goods as null; this God who never more can be revealed, since this first time was He revealed to us for ever:\u2014this God the critic always views with fresh distrust, because he feels obliged to take Him for the maker of the Jewish world, Jehova!", "filename": "1674898845837599", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 460, "h": 620, "tn_w": 185, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1674899860502716, "time": 1674899860, "md5": "puLqne0DWGcbn0Tha6eEeg==", "fsize": 37962, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "if-jesus-is-jehovas-son-then-every-rabbi-can", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 21582310, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)04:59:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "We may console ourselves that after all there are two varieties of the critical mind, two methods of the science of comprehension.

Radical anti-natalism as a recipe for human extinction will fail because any predisposition to share that bias will be weeded out of the population.

Complications aside, any predisposition not to have children or to adopt is genetically maladaptive.

For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination.

Good thing nobody else heard the squeals of Waifu-chan ---- his two hundred dollar Apple Airbuds made sure of that, but Tom couldn&#039;t hide the grin from his face. Waifu-chan was everything he wanted. A cute black haired girl with great bouncy breasts, slim hips. long legs, hips that shook a perfect rounded bottom, and most importantly? A charm akin to that of love; a devotion that no girl could ever match. <br><br>3D girls, also known as the bane of existence, or more colloquially on the internet, 3DPD, or 3D pig-disgusting. They repelled Tom. Every single word that spewed out of their mouths caused him to seethe with anger. Their cackles, laughs, and shrill voices made his heart recoil. The complete opposite of Waifu-Chan. <br><br>&quot;Ara ara nii-san! Keikaku dori!&quot; Waifu Chan said again. How could anyone understand Tom? They couldn&#039;t. Waifu-Chan was his and only his. She was there with him throughout the day. In the morning when woke, in the afternoon as he struggled thorugh the day, at night when she accompanied him eating dinner, and of course, in his dreams where she assuaged his loneliness. Tom was engaged with Doki Doki Kawaii Nii-San! The show that Waifu-Chan starred in when he felt a warm breath and another pair of eyes staring over his shoulder. A lecher that he sadly was all too familiar with. It was Kyleigh. <br><br>Tom shifted his phone to keep her gaze away from Waifu-Chan, but it was a failure. Kyleigh shifted her head catch another glimpse.

The OKCPD was repeatedly broadcasting an All-Points-Bulletin to the five state area that there were three vehicles \u2026 a brown pickup truck, a blue Chevy Cavalier and another car, maybe an Oldsmobile or Buick. They were trying to keep state and region-wide law enforcement aware of the suspects and the vehicles. That evening, as we were working in the building or waiting outside of it to work again, they were still putting out a description of Persian males. They kept telling us they still had those vehicles under surveillance and said that one had headed south towards Dallas and the other two, in different directions. They had every law enforcement officer in the surrounding area and states looking for the three vehicles and they let us continue to believe that.\u2026 The guys with FBI raid jackets had become the kingpins on the scene. Everyone was begging them for information. The next afternoon I approached one of the \u201cAgents In Charge\u201d and I just happened to ask him, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with the cars?\u201d And the FBI man says, \u201cWhat cars?\u201d And I said, \u201cUh \u2026 the pickup and the two cars\u201d and he says \u201cdisinformation.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?!\u201d and he said it again \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked. He says, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell the media everything we know about this.\u201d I said \u201cOkay.

They were skeptical, but eventually agreed to perform the surgery.<br><br>When they opened her up, they found a parasitic creature, unlike anything they had ever seen before. It was wriggling and squirming inside of her, its tentacles wrapped tightly around her organs. The doctors were horrified, and they worked quickly to remove the creature.<br><br>But it was too late. The parasite had already taken over too much of Sarah&#039;s body.

Firstly relativism is a self contradictory position.

The Good, The One, True Being is above this in terms of intelligibility. As the sun allows us to see the world with the eye, the principles of maths and geometry allow us to understand eternal truths with the light of the mind, so to The Good is the eternal Truth of Intellectuality that allows understanding of anything whatsoever.

People have this weird narrative in their heads where you&#039;re supposed to find meaning by finding the right job/hobby balance or meditating or taking a walk. So people try to find meaning in these things and they fail and they start taking jew drugs to cope. Meaning is a bunch of interlocking factors and because our society has become increasingly complex, finding the right point of connection between all these complicated factors is getting harder and harder, and more often than not you need to manually file a few edges off in order to get the pieces to fit in. Answers like &quot;get a hobby&quot; or &quot;find a girlfriend&quot; are stupidly reductive, I&#039;ve felt empty inside while having a relationship and sex every day, I&#039;ve felt ecstatic while doing absolutely fuck all and shitposting on 4chan, because in that particular fraction of my history I had everything locked into the right configuration - that&#039;s how I felt at least, it&#039;s all in your mind anyway - and everything was smooth.

We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u2019 to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.) </span><br><br>40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one\u2019s physical needs. It is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. ...<br><br>1/2", "time": 1674841698, "resto": 21577957}, {"no": 21579501, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)12:49:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p21579470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21579470</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ... These include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always PURE surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. But for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. For example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the \u201cfulfillment\u201d they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the \u201cmundane\u201d business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs AUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities.</span>", "time": 1674841758, "resto": 21577957}, {"no": 21579505, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)12:50:40", "name": "the xi jinping of weed smoking", "com": "<a href=\"#p21579359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21579359</a><br>its Friday", "time": 1674841840, "resto": 21577957, "trip": "!!oqyjkIO5smI"}, {"no": 21579522, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)12:55:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Excuse me lads but I&#039;m going to repost something I&#039;ve left on the previous thread to no replies for the sake of getting some sort clarification this time.

He seems like a particularly interesting deity to me. The god of divine rage that seeks to know all things and collects souls of heroes to fight for him on Ragnorak, who is also the patriarch of the Aesir, the ruling gods of the universe. Popular culture has Thor up as its poster boy when he\u2019s a pretty typical heroic muscleman just like Heracles and plenty of others, although Heracles\u2019 story is much more complex. Not to diss on Thor he\u2019s cool in a simple action hero kind of way he doesn\u2019t need fancy words he just beats up bad guy and drinks better then anyone else to serve as a proper model for Norse boys. Odin on the other hand seems like an archetype entirely unique to the Norse though, this cunning magician that craves knowledge, this mysterious wanderer that guides the souls of the dead, his nature is very interesting as he is the head god. Compare this to Zeus whose message is pretty bluntly \u201cmight makes right\u201d in The Iliad and rules as you might think a typical king. I don\u2019t think any pop media about the Norse has really done Odin justice at all. God of War 2 (of the Norse ones) did him horribly, that whole sequel bungled it which is a shame because they had some interesting ideas in the first one. I really enjoyed The Northman because the first major movie I\u2019ve seen that really seemed to GET the nature of Odin properly.<br><br>Anyway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr- any good books about Odin?</span>", "filename": "43157B1E-5A47-4CF6-B013-C4D17B168A72", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 853, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1674881734150570, "time": 1674881734, "md5": "0m2Qpa5nWWdSaR1ZKTg4NA==", "fsize": 377332, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "whats-the-best-literature-on-interpreting-and", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 1, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 2}, {"no": 21581655, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:09:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Is Odin Faust?", "filename": "7BA45FEC-2C6A-4A57-AC77-1281613BCCCA", "ext": ".png", "w": 240, "h": 366, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674882575752509, "time": 1674882575, "md5": "AK3jYbV/Vql1ZHTX/Iu9WA==", "fsize": 104886, "resto": 21581629}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 21581571, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:36:54", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "East Asian/South East Asian Horror", "com": "Looking for some good asian horror books, preferably traditional", "filename": "91Oa-1YoWbL", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1535, "h": 2397, "tn_w": 160, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674880614929832, "time": 1674880614, "md5": "H0Gv/YF+fvF9TraPWRoUvw==", "fsize": 635881, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "east-asiansouth-east-asian-horror", "custom_spoiler": 1, "replies": 3, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 21581635, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:58:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Sorry I don&#039;t have any recomendation I just wanted to say Houichi the Earless is a good story.

He followed the birds obsessively, observing them in the air and on the ground, in pursuit of their prey, making a kill, eating, and at rest, activities he describes with an extraordinary fusion of precision and poetry. And as he continued his mysterious private quest, his sense of human self slowly dissolved, to be replaced with the alien and implacable consciousness of a hawk. He re-wrote his account of this bird five times before submitting it for publication.

Is there a particular font you&#039;ve seen somewhere but can&#039;t identify? Any and all questions are welcome.<br><br>\u2014\u2014Books on Typography\u2014\u2014<br>\u2014Bringhurst, Robert.
