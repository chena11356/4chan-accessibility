This is why Canaan was pointed out specifically at Gen. 9:18-22, where Ham\u2019s other, older, legitimate sons are not mentioned. So while Canaan was White, he was born with a stigma (a mark of disgrace). And while it was Ham who committed fornication with his mother, it was Canaan who bore the curse (and not Ham\u2019s other children)!", "filename": "14292316_527307387463862_1164775364073711314_n", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 542, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 84, "tim": 1668529414540856, "time": 1668529414, "md5": "Whi8j/RIr5Pb1NHkzRiYbA==", "fsize": 95959, "resto": 404526098, "id": "Tm7y9VGk", "country": "AU", "country_name": "Australia"}, {"no": 404527778, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:24:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "it&#039;s all in the first 5 mins of the audiobook brude", "filename": "08be40433269a52f711eca70d1097511fc60105735fbd8a3637610a024b7a7f9", "ext": ".png", "w": 740, "h": 410, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 69, "tim": 1668529471189029, "time": 1668529471, "md5": "ioYKNl7e3jLhH+NMnIH8uQ==", "fsize": 719548, "resto": 404526098, "id": "Tm7y9VGk", "country": "AU", "country_name": "Australia"}], "last_modified": 1668529471}, {"no": 404526978, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:17:45", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Anime characters are asian.", "com": "Anime characters are asian.<br><br>They&#039;re hmong asians.<br><br>Naruto is not white.<br>Cloud is not white.<br>Link is not white.<br>Peach is not white.<br><br>Cope chud.", "filename": "main-qimg-789dee1cbbad354f2e88acbaa0854899", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 602, "h": 549, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 227, "tim": 1668529065864083, "time": 1668529065, "md5": "b4dz+28q71v73xNuamJYWg==", "fsize": 117580, "resto": 0, "id": "wbMYbs8T", "country": "CO", "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "anime-characters-are-asian", "country_name": "Colombia", "replies": 3, "images": 2, "last_replies": [{"no": 404527090, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:18:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404526978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404526978</a><br>Anime characters don&#039;t have race", "filename": "1646047210052", "ext": ".png", "w": 1920, "h": 1358, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 88, "tim": 1668529117828042, "time": 1668529117, "md5": "+XlOpbGj1P9pIw0xInTYrw==", "fsize": 2875227, "resto": 404526978, "id": "LhrqQZjA", "country": "US", "m_img": 1, "country_name": "United States"}, {"no": 404527320, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:20:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404526978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404526978</a><br>Imagine getting this worked up over a chinese cartoon.

Possibly because it&#039;s wekening the blood-brain barrier?<br>So if it wekaens the blood-brain barrier, that&#039;s a big problem all the time.<br><br>The other piece of evidence I have is personally anecdotal. My mum was in terrible health, so many different unrelated problems. She was dependent on painkillers (paracetamol and ibuprofen), took em multiple times every day for terrible headaches and sometimes migraines. A splitting headache nearly every day for decades, 30 years or more. One summer I told her just to experiment by going off them, just for a month. I&#039;ll never forget the look of terror in her eyes when I suggested it, that&#039;s how dependent she was on them, that&#039;s how much the thought of enduring those headaches without painillers scared her. But she listened....<br>...contd...", "time": 1668525516, "resto": 404506491, "id": "/pt+28kD", "country": "GB", "country_name": "United Kingdom"}, {"no": 404521123, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)10:28:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404519987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404519987</a><br>...<br>- She has not had a single fucking headache since.<br>- All her other aches and pains have gone, all the imflammation in her joints that doctors told her they could do nothing for, gone. Knee perfect (for her age), her &#039;tennis elbow&#039; gone, elbow perfect (for her age).<br>- Metabolism corrected, she lost 15kg in 5 months EFFORTLESSLY. No diet, no chaging diet, certainly no exercise. It just melted off her, because her appetite went back to its natural equilibrium after having been altered all this time. She went from eating 4 meals a day to only 2 meals a day. She just wasnt hungry enough for 3 meals. 15kg melted off in 5 months. Then it stopped and she&#039;s been static at that healthy weight. So it&#039;s not like she had cancer or worms because if she kept shrinking at that weight she would have been dead by now. But now, it reseted to its natural healthy equilibrium.<br>- Her hair became fuller, it was getting badly thin, but has recovered a good deal<br>- And the craziest one, you might not even believe this one at all, but I&#039;m telling you it&#039;s true...some of her hair turned bac to its naural colour. I had previously got her to stop dyeing it, to grey gracefully and she did. She was almost entirely grey. After going off the painkillers, not only the her hair become fuller again, but half of it went back to its natural colour. Not everywhere, but overall half of it, it&#039;s in weird different patches. She&#039;s half grey half not. Particularly in the back, it&#039;s almost all colour-restored.<br><br>Who knows what the fuck these painkillers are doing in the body where simply going off them sparks these immediate improvements in a person&#039;s health. Paracetamol and ibuprofen. Like I said, I would never taken them unless my life depended on it (which it never would let&#039;s be honest).", "time": 1668526089, "resto": 404506491, "id": "/pt+28kD", "country": "GB", "country_name": "United Kingdom"}, {"no": 404523459, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)10:48:00", "name": "Anonymous", "filename": "heritage minutes", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1280, "h": 720, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1668527280881425, "time": 1668527280, "md5": "p9g2+zTCOk3wAdCikHRHMg==", "fsize": 113169, "resto": 404506491, "id": "0+rpFpH2", "m_img": 1, "board_flag": "TR", "flag_name": "Tree Hugger"}, {"no": 404525480, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:04:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Just give them weed lol that shit is legal here for a reason", "time": 1668528286, "resto": 404506491, "id": "MhV9lnsf", "country": "CA", "country_name": "Canada"}, {"no": 404526596, "now": "11/15/22(Tue)11:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p404515715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;404515715</a><br>I\u2019ll never comply.
