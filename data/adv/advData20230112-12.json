Don&#039;t let your emotions of anger or sadness drive how you interact with them, keep things calm and light hearted and joke around. If they push you into those emotions then just let them know of your disapproval(This doesn&#039;t mean a speech just say &quot;Nah i&#039;m not about that&quot;) and then leave. Do nothing more than that.<br><br>2. Don&#039;t try to convince her,it&#039;s your way or you&#039;re out however be sensible about it(IE Don&#039;t go up and touch her and expect it to roll over well)<br><br>3. Encourage them that you want to LISTEN but when it comes to relationship advice,unless it concerns her on how you treat her then err on the side of caution or possibly even outright disregard it. If it is about her though then give it some real thought. If you&#039;ve ever read Anne Of Green Gables,women are at their happiest when they can be like Anne.(Read it if you haven&#039;t)<br><br>4. When you make a statement about your preferences, or plans stick to it and LIVE it. Be it if you tell a girl that one day you want to just simply travel the world,that you dislike people who show up late to dates or even if you say that you&#039;re gonna surprise her on her Birthday like 5 months from now,make sure you do it. Even if she challenges you with a hissy fit,you still do it. When you don&#039;t they lose respect and faith in you. Don&#039;t be flexible just be firm except AGAIN in a non-asshole way. They&#039;ll often come around and agree.<br><br>5. Stand up for yourself and learn to recognize BS so you can sweep a girls excuses aside. Don&#039;t place all your chips on a &quot;Maybe&quot; or wishy washy answers or give in to silly demands like her asking for money if you aren&#039;t a couple.

After a while I began to think that there is no way that I could have acted any differently or I wouldn&#039;t be me.

It will always find its level, and can only follow one possible route. Maybe if the water started running 6 inches to the left it would take another path, but whichever way it starts the path is set by forces that shaped it long before the water hit the mountainside. Everything I ever regretted was inevitable and everything I will regret is inevitably going to happen, because when it comes time to act then I can only act as I&#039;ve been prepared to act, in circumstances or settings that depend on everything that I&#039;ve done before. <br><br>One of my worst drug experiences of all time.

How are you gonna yell at me for changing majors when you couldn&#039;t even get through the first fucking semester of university? And despite working a dead end job you&#039;re clearly miserable in, won&#039;t take another and won&#039;t re-educate yourself, then preach about the merits of higher education like you have a fucking PhD in pedagogy and academia wasn&#039;t just a mouthpiece for the various industries in today&#039;s date. What the fuck do you know about literally anything? I wish people would have some fucking decency, holy shit, because it&#039;s hard to respect someone when their entire existence around you is giving decontextualized, useless (and usually completely wrong) cookie-cutter advice. Nobody else does this shit. Being a parent or my senior ig is just like for people to feel superior. I wish I could just be stuck up about this but of course being the &quot;better man&quot; I go out of my way not to do jack shit ab it, for fear of hurting their sensitive fucking feefees, completely at the cost of ruining my own quality of life.

What&#039;s your personality like, what are your flaws and strong points? What precisely are the reasons you don&#039;t have a girlfriend? What kind of a girl you find attractive and what do you want from a relationship?<br>- Consider your hypothetical future gf. What does she want from a partner - can you offer her those things? If not, that&#039;s something to work on. Where does she spend her time? That&#039;s how you know where to meet her.<br>- Go out and socialize. You will never find a gf shut inside your room. Find some activities that allow you to meet new people regularly. Ideally something you&#039;ll enjoy for its own sake, otherwise you&#039;ll be annoyed and grumpy and just drive people away.<br>- Don&#039;t be afraid of failure. If you have no social skills, you will make many embarrassing missteps. Think of them as learning opportunities. The good thing about social skills is they can be practiced.<br>- Do not be unattractive. A defeatist bitter whiny needy self-deprecating attitude (seen in this very thread) is the most unattractive thing ever, far more important than your height or muscles.

Good girls are generally always taken by nature. How many times have you seen a cute and sweet girl single? For how long? They tend to pick someone good enough, but of course there are better candidates out there. Believe me, I&#039;ve seen many cute girls dating average guys (just a matter of being there at the right time and place). And those average guys are not really good at taking care of a relationship. No attention to detail, no hygiene, no self-care, no self-improvement, career stuck and so on. With this in mind, it&#039;s not difficult to imagine myself stealing one of these girls from someone if I&#039;m charismatic, fun, interesting and take care of my looks.<br>Basically, imagine the opposite. Picture yourself dating a fat, big-mouthed cashier that all she wants to do is watch a movie when she&#039;s home and the only fun activity you do on weekends is hiking and hanging out with friends to play board games. Now, imagine you meet that cute girl that always wears skirts at work. She comes to your desk every day to have a coffee break. She always comes with an smile and she talks to you passionately about her dreams and projects. She suggests to have some drinks after work, play pool and darts, ice skating, have a nice dinner at a new Tapas restaurant, you name it. You start to connect with her and you start thinking &quot;why am I dating my fat ugly and boring girlfriend when I could be way happier with my cute coworker who is a Project Manager&quot;.<br>Thing is, if you can&#039;t find a girlfriend, focus on improving yourself. Looks, money, charisma, fun. Chances are you will attract single or even &quot;taken&quot; women because of what I said. The best thing is that you wouldn&#039;t be stealing anyone, she would be the one who would come to you.<br>Nevertheless, there are girls that are really taken.

The screen on the old laptop is made up of 1366 pixels horizontally and 768 pixels vertically. Therefore, when the resolution is set at 1366x768, the number of pixels perfectly matches the resolution. The new laptop has a higher native resolution at 1920x1080, so when you set the resolution to 1366x768, there is not a perfect match between the pixels and the resolution, resulting in blurriness or graininess, because it must stretch the resolution to cover all of the pixels. To get around this, most people will set the resolution to match the number of pixels (the native resolution), then if the text is too small, use the Make everything bigger setting to increase the size of everything so that it is not too small.

We became the core group as we extended a sense of belonging and we would socialise among ourselves. The girl group disliked that as they felt we deprived them of attention and specifically celebrity. Because of the girl group there those that sought to instigate a split and exclusion in exchange of being integrated with the girl group. The girl group had no plans to uphold their end of the &quot;deal&quot; and moved the goalpost on those that instigated - more than once. Essentially the instigators were &quot;timed out&quot; and slowly were re-integrated into the core high school group with suspicion. There were other individuals that sperged out as they didnt get exclusive time with their friend(s) of choice, later those spergs became outsiders very early in high school. Essentially, there were ups and downs and incrementally as I was the go-to guy (very approachable) that began to integrate the year the year became closer and closer. We organised big bike ridding days, movie days, gaming and pizza. It wasnt until the drama with my ex gf that really divided and splintered the year. The girl group trying to restart the integration effort by using the formal/prom as a way bring everyone together again. It didnt happen, the girl group made a pact to not go to the formal/prom with in guy and to arrive separate from the guys. The last remaining group in high school tried to integrate everyone but the catch was that just wanted to make themselves desirable by having outliers and outsiders asking them to hang out. That group has shattered.

He moved far away from his childhood home, like his father before him, deinvesting in family generation after generation. He didn&#039;t know how to father me because he was probably raised more by his 8 older siblings than by his actual father, whereas I was the first son of 2. My parents wanted to treat me like a best friend instead of teaching me about life and telling me the right way to live. Typical American parenting or lack thereof. They say that when I was a baby they would let me cry for 7 minutes before going to care for me. wtf. To me, this is another puzzle piece, probably why I spent my childhood depressed and anti-social. I thought about killing myself from a young age. I don&#039;t know if this was before or after I got into occult stuff. I grew out of that by high school but have still thought about killing myself periodically since then. Sometimes every day. I won&#039;t actually do it.

I guess I was a dick to him sometimes when we were very young. I got a degree in science, and him in humanities. By then our relationship was much better, brotherly love, although he was far-left and I was in the awkward period where I hadn&#039;t yet realized that I wasn&#039;t a leftist like all my friends. Then /pol/ happened, and making his wife cry. She really does have his balls. Once I tried to give him some insight about how women should be and want to be treated by men, and he shared this with his wife and they both accosted me for it. Then the men&#039;s club happened, and learning how low-class men talk to each other. I called my brother a fag jokingly for having a manbun at the time, and his wife cried again. I didn&#039;t understand. This is how my friends and I talked to each other. Anyway, I severed ties with all those friends when I ignored their sexual passes and they threatened to kill me. So I was back to having no friends after having more friends than ever before in my life. Trying to get back on the horse, I met a nice guy who showed me the local bars, and it seemed like I was going to make new friends again, but then he turned out to be a psychopath who felt threatened by how much the people at &quot;his bars&quot; liked me, so now I can&#039;t go there anymore.", "time": 1673514094, "resto": 28104427}, {"no": 28104437, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)04:02:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28104434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28104434</a><br>The person I have become (political, religious, sick with this evil world) is at odds with the rest of my family.

I went back to the person I was before /pol/, as far as they know. My brother now has a house, a son, and a government job, so he&#039;s thoroughly invested in the system. I&#039;m proud of him. He attained my father&#039;s definition of success. Often we hang out and laugh together like old times. He&#039;s more of a centrist now. He tells me about Jordan Peterson and I advise him to read the Bible for himself. He will sometimes make jabs at me, e.g. about me having no shame or about me being a burnout. I think he likes feeling like he&#039;s on top of me now. Secretly, I have no respect for these people. Sometimes I think I hate them.

That would only burn bridges, and I see myself later apologizing and blaming my depression, which is somewhat accurate but then they would ask me to get medicated, and I can&#039;t stand the thought of how smug this would make my brother, that I am discredited as mentally ill.

If you want to suggest something, you should ask the person first if they would be free for critique if they do not know.

You can find interesting ways to make this happen however. Merely donating money is a hollow action.

Part of the problem with something new is that is that you will be bad at it, you may be unequipped for it, or you may end up not liking it after you invested a fair amount of money. That&#039;s not a bad thing either and this shouldn&#039;t stop you if you are interested in something initially.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;achieve at work</span><br>This is another thing that seems cucked, but can actually be really good. No matter who you are, all humans have a chemical that rewards them with good feelings for striving for something and completing it. Some people think that this is only dopamine, but there is another one that specifically gets rewarded to you for accomplishing goals- serotonin. In reality, dopamine is relatively short lived and has a higher high, but serotonin is what is essentially a mood stabilizer. I mention it here because serotonin, since it is rewarded through accomplishing hard work, is worthwhile to go for due to how many benefits you get.
