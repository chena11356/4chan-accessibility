The reason you liked shit more when you were younger was that it was new and your brain sucked it up like drugs. Tech, internet and culture have lead to &#039;skim&#039; thinking (like skim reading). The consequence of that is that there&#039;s a lot more meat and juice still left in stuff you went over before, but you need concentration back again to get it.<br><br>Two: Supplement the above with introducing more novelty into your life. That could mean cooking new food, learning new skills, eating new spices, doing a sport. It doesn&#039;t really matter if you hated whatever it is when you were younger, so long as it&#039;s at least a little bit interesting, because the new factor will feed your brain that &#039;new&#039; feeling. I know you know about getting hobbies, but that&#039;s basically why. New feeling stimulates the brain, and goes a way towards getting you interacting with life a bit more again.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I started biking, which did make me feel way better</span><br>Keep doing it.", "time": 1674822114, "resto": 28212568}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28212994, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)07:10:06", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "Buying my daughter a vibrator", "com": "Is it advisable to gift my daughter a vibrator?

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like.

My specific situation will not really relate to you.<br><br>The TL;DR is that I am an /out/ist through and through and nothing is going to change that.<br><br>I was in the army before college. Biology degree. Wildly depressed, and medicated for it. In college I did an internship with a conservation agency and it was fun, but I did the &quot;right thing&quot; and after school I just kept pursuing my &quot;career path.&quot; Nothing glamorous or financially enticing, mind you. At 27 I had a paradigm shift, some major life changes (sister offed herself and ended a toxic 6 year relationship) and I took some seasonal /out/ work in Alaska to try and clear my heart and my head. Quit taking Zoloft during this time.<br><br>Following this, I left and did a &quot;normal&quot; job for about 1.25 years before I again felt the urge to get the fuck back outside. I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died. I&#039;ve since worked for a few different agencies/places for the feds doing /out/ things. I do not make much money. My job security is tenuous. But I feel at peace and wouldn&#039;t change it.<br><br>The point of my story is simply that if you recognize something you are truly passionate about, you should just stick with it, because trying to convince yourself you are happier in some other capacity just results in you being miserable.

Think of employment as a bridge from virgin neetdom to chad neetdom. Some examples of viable options are trades, sales, it, coding meme, internet marketing. You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

He&#039;s about 60lbs but he&#039;s quite the baby when it comes to pain. He&#039;s got about a 7 inch wound stitched up and then lots of little cuts to help the skin stretch out and reheal, since they removed a section of skin. I guess I&#039;m just worried his thrashing will tear the stitches.

Let me clear something though:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wife takes care of the kids </span><br><br>That\u2019s a job. Kids are cunts, so if she\u2019s raising yours, you\u2019d owe her money. You don\u2019t, so the house belong to both of you and your pay belongs to both of you. As do the kids, unless you\u2019re a cuck, that means you\u2019re only financially liable for the kids.<br><br>Now on to the next issue: you.<br><br>Why are you whining like a little bitch? I have a baby grand piano in a room next to our dining room and I call it the piano room. My wife says we could move the piano to the living room, and use the room for something else. I said no, politely.<br><br>She insisted. And every time she asked, I\u2019d smile and say \u201cno darling\u201d. No reason to get angry or lose your bitch-tits milk. It\u2019s simple - \u201cno\u201d - end of story.<br><br>One day my wife moved the piano to the living room with the help of her sister\u2019s husband. When I got home, my in-laws and my wife along with our kids said \u201csurprise! A new place for the piano!\u201d<br><br>I simply said \u201cIf you could all please leave, I have to have a word with my wife\u201d. Everyone left so I asked why she moved my piano. She explained her reasoning. I said \u201cfair enough\u201d.<br><br>The next day I contacted a contractor and the local piano company. I started a project to increase the size of the piano room into the dining room, making it substantially smaller.

But she rarely did.<br><br>We&#039;d get into screaming arguments constantly about how lazy and worthless she was. I felt like an asshole for it, but goddamn she was a real piece of work. The only reason I dealt with all this was for the kids, and also because the sex is great.<br><br>But one night, I got fed up. Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it.

Think of life like sandbox rpg where you have limited time of play until your character dies and you have to make a new one. Only as an aesthetic phenomenon are existence and the world justified. We are just here to play and have fun but there is no reward for anything except the reward of achieveing the things themselves. This is not a call to laziness and consumerism but a call to realistic ambition and a balanced life. People are worth what they get when you take away everything they have. You are worth what you are. Friends come and go, people die, life changes, time goes by, you can lose your job, your wealth and your health but rooting yourself on that which never changes is what gives you eternal peace of mind and strength. Consider the things you think you want to have or achieve and put yourself in the position of a person that already has these things.

It&#039;s more likely to be you that breaks up with him.

But you&#039;re rushing things much faster than they should be going. It&#039;s a cute enough idea, and if you&#039;d been living together as a couple for the last 18+ months then I&#039;d say go for it.
