Ok, so the issue is that you are trying to banter with an insecure person. Some are into that humiliation crap and so it will work for a while.

The only solution to this is to date a confident girl that knows she\u2018s great and that banter is just that, shooting the shit with each other. She\u2018ll nah you back just as hard but it will only make you bond with her more instead of creating distance. This is the ground work for having depth and gentleness for people like you that are natural neggers. You need someone that can meet you with the same energy and only someone that\u2018s not insecure could do that without it getting abusive.

If you possess at least one of those three attributes, you have a chance of finding a girlfriend. You have to understand that women generally have an abundance of options available to them. They&#039;re not going to settle for anything less than they feel they deserve. Women have a biological imperative to choose the best physical specimen for their future offspring, even if they don&#039;t actively want children, it&#039;s hardwired into them. Similarly, they will also seek a man who can provide them with comfort and security. Pretty much every relationship can be boiled down to this. Sure, personality and compatibility are factors but all relationships start with a hook. My best friend is 6&#039;6 and has chiseled features. He&#039;s never single for long. My other friend is short, chubby and has cerebral palsy BUT he has a well-paid job and shitton of savings. He finally found a girl to date him. I&#039;ve also known plenty of guys who weren&#039;t particularly handsome but they were total arrogant scumbags. They always had girlfriends. I could go on and on...<br>So, if you&#039;re wondering why you&#039;re perennially single, this will be the reason. Unfortunately, most of these traits are out of your control.

Luck is not so much a measurable thing, but it tries to capture the fact that there are slight variations in what females find attractive, so if you have at least one of the three requirements (assertiveness, socioeconomic status, or physical attractiveness) AND opportunities to meet women, you might be lucky and find a great match or unlucky and find terrible matches.<br>Obviously one can argue that all of the requirements can be boiled down to genetics and it is hard to disagree, but I think upbringing and socialization do play a role.

No female has ever expressed interest in me, so I have to assume I am at least below average in physical appearance, if not overall attractiveness. After having spent years reflecting on the female question, I am firmly of the belief that female attraction is determined by 3 closely related mental attributes. Those are:<br>1) Confidence<br>2) Charisma<br>3) Socialization<br>These are functions of the (social) Ego. The ego itself is one\u2019s concept of self in the context of society (which is itself a concept of interpersonal relationships and human organization). The generic \u201cself improvement\u201d advice is premised on building up the ego, because the things \u201cself improvement\u201d suggests are the very things present culture/society values. If you are fit, you can feel good about yourself because you\u2019re meeting society\u2019s expectations (plus there are undoubtedly real mental benefits to not being fat or pained while walking).<br>A job/career obviously benefit society, so of course you can build your ego up after achieving that.

For example, one time we met on a Saturday and hung out, agreeing we&#039;d meet again Sunday too. I said as I was leaving, &quot;let me know if anything changes&quot;.

This kind of thing has happens often.<br><br>Several times now we have met up and he has talked (at great length...) of his job. I listen and comment, but he never asks of mine. He often gives the impression he does not care about my life, and several personal things I&#039;ve shared with him in the past he has barely reacted to, if at all. He has somewhat of an ego. We used to be part of a larger group but he has lost many friends over the last few years due to this.<br><br>The main incident though is when we and another friend were out drinking. As he got drunker he mentioned taking his car for a drive. I thought he was joking, but advised him it was obviously a bad idea anyways. He and our friend live close to each other, and at the end of the night, and after we had all drank a lot, they walked home. He then arrived at his place, got in his car, and drove to pick up our other friend, offered him a ride (almost refusing to take no for an answer), and drove him home.<br><br>I have not replied to his messages for a month or so but he continues to send me memes and invites out etc. I feel he has crossed a line, but I feel conflicted because of our long history.

The reasons you listed are all true. But one thing you haven&#039;t considered is how the quality of the average woman you meet drops off a cliff once you leave university.

This also means expectations are higher for you. All these girls have sucked off tens of broke guys in their younger days, because they were cute and funny. But not you: they&#039;ll expect you to have your own car, have your own place, a good job, and still have your hair. Higher expectations for lower quality.

Grainy, not flattering angles, bad grooming, generic mirror selfies, etc. I know I am more attractive than my profiles have made me appear in the past. <br><br>Problem is I just don&#039;t have very many good photos of myself. I have a lot from when I was younger but I look more boyish and it doesn&#039;t reflect what I look like now. I have one set of professionally taken photos that look pretty good, but I don&#039;t want to just use those. It would be better to have some more variety. One option is I could pay to get more professional photos taken. Would it look unusual if I have only professional photos and no more natural looking photos of me doing things or being with friends? I guess the optimal profile would be a mix of both.<br><br>That brings me to the other problem. I don&#039;t really have any friends to take pictures of me. That would make things quite easy if I did. Perhaps this is symptomatic of a larger problem I need to solve before dating. It has just been difficult because I moved to a new city and I work from home. I try going to meetups and things sometimes but I&#039;m bad at talking to people in situations where there&#039;s more than two or three new people I don&#039;t know. I think I&#039;m getting better at it gradually, but still no friendships as of yet. This is part of why I still want to use the apps. Because for someone in my situation, it&#039;s like, where the fuck am I supposed to meet women? It helps that on an app you know there is at least some mutual interest if the other person matched with you.<br><br>Or maybe I need to abandon the apps and go full on into trying to get girls from social circle and go to even more events and things to make myself get better at socializing so I can do that.

But she had to go to sleep, wakes up at 4 AM for work so I let myself out the door at that. Met her the next day, talked some more, made up some shit about meeting up with people so I could put a time limit on it, she had her nails done and her hair down so I complimented her on it. Was talking about window vs aisle seats, used it as an excuse to compare heights, got right in her space, like an inch from her body; she was pretty eager to be close to me. Then sat back down, we talked, she mentioned something about how guys she date have to initiate contact, and we were talking about hugs and such, so before I left I gave her a strong hug for a few seconds to break the physical contact ice. She was red in the face at this point; way she was looking at me when I was walking up to her, I think she wanted a kiss.<br><br>So we&#039;re gonna cook dinner next, I didn&#039;t call it a date because I&#039;m a faggot, but I need to be more aggressive.

She visited me today for a few hours and as we&#039;re not going to see each other for a while we got right into sex. We went into the bedroom and she sat down on the bed while she got undressed. Normally I don&#039;t like outside clothes on my bed but whatever I&#039;m about to fuck this girl raw so it&#039;s cool. We get fully undressed and have sex.

We finish round 2 and when she goes to the toilet afterwards I have a closer look at her underpants on the ground.

They&#039;re NOT looking for anything and not interested in you. I spent an above average amount of time in university and I came out of it with a laundry list of failures.

I only ever got relationships (around 3-4 real girlfriends) in high school out of genuine fumbling into it out of luck and my first girlfriend thought my extreme quietness was pretty weird. At that time throughout my entire school life I was heavily heavily dosed on ADHD meds that made talking to people insanely hard so I just rarely talked to anyone except childhood friends I grew up with and people who just knew me my whole life. I&#039;m utterly terrified of talking to strangers and have no idea how to hold a normal conversation that isn&#039;t autistically spazzing out. Even among new friends I vibe really well with I get insanely nervous and lose the ability to come up with conversation ideas moments in. <br><br>Despite this I somehow actually have a comically larger than you&#039;d expect pool of friends-- but all of them know I&#039;m super anxious. Ever since I got off the meds I slightly improved, but my social skills dramatically improve on the internet compared to real life. In real life I IMMEDIATELY start spilling spaghetti even among friends. Over Voice chat online, it&#039;s like a totally different person comes alive and my own family even thinks it&#039;s insane how much more confident I am. <br><br>I desperately want to be normal and also meet new people, make friends, and be an adult who can talk normally but I have no idea how when my real life anxiety is so overwhelming.", "filename": "19275195", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 720, "h": 748, "tn_w": 240, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675661389643752, "time": 1675661389, "md5": "a1ux1oGk0vlO14Z5Am1hWw==", "fsize": 31782, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "overcoming-severe-lifelong-social-anxiety", "replies": 5, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 28281181, "now": "02/06/23(Mon)00:40:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28281145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28281145</a><br>I think you should start small.

Even if they&#039;re only after money, they&#039;re still much more pleasant to interact with than the average western female who does nothing but act like a 24/7 bitch, complain about creepy men trying to talk to them, make fun of men for not getting pussy, choose worthless men and then complain all men are worthless, and if they find a decent probably get bored and divorce rape him. I&#039;d rather jack off to porn than fuck most of these bitches. Most of them aren&#039;t even sexually attractive enough to be worth the hassle in the 1st place. What do they want and what do they have to offer in return? They want everything, but all they have is the same pussy as every other woman on the planet.", "time": 1675544581, "resto": 28266636}, {"no": 28271385, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:13:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28271296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28271296</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;date the palest man you can find so people mistake your children for hispanic.</span><br>Black people continue to perpetuate this retarded niggerish self-hate.", "time": 1675545186, "resto": 28266636}, {"no": 28271421, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)16:20:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28266636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28266636</a><br>Have you considered moving somewhere far away?

Truth is I just used said busy season as an excuse to not hang out with her anymore, so that she would get fed up and break up with me. It worked. I could have easily taken some time to spend with her, that\u2019s what any loving boyfriend would do, no matter the circumstance. But I wanted to get rid of her. <br>I loved her and I was also attracted to her. But she\u2019s not conventionally attractive and I was always ashamed to be seen with her. I never even introduced her to my parents, and whenever she mentioned that fact, I made up stories about my parents being evil and that they\u2019re not a part of my life so that she doesn\u2019t need to meet them. I know this makes me a piece of shit and also a coward. I hate myself for it. I don\u2019t think anyone will ever love me the same way she did. <br>I do miss her a lot. Last week she texted me asking if there was any chance that we got back together. I told her I was just not ready to be in a relationship. Fuck, I couldn\u2019t stop crying while telling that to her. I hate myself for hurting her so much. And I can\u2019t stop missing her, but I know that she deserves much better. Why does she even want to get with such a fucking piece of garbage like me? After all the damage I\u2019ve caused, I don\u2019t even deserve to be remembered by her, and yet she still loves me, and it only makes me hate myself even more.

There is less crossover than you\u2019d guess. Civil practice focuses heavily on motion practice and general faggotry. Criminal practice is much more focused on having good relations with the prosecutors. You will get shit deals if you act like an asshole civil attorney in criminal court.<br><br>A middle road that I would suggest is to become a private criminal defense attorney. Charge a ton and help people. Its a ton of fun. The public defender\u2019s office is generally for people who have given up on life or are diehards, no crimes are ever committed types.<br><br>If you cant get a summer job with a judge or big law firm, you can of course apply to the PD\u2019s office or DA\u2019s office. I recommend working for a private investigator who is death penalty certified. You will learn and build connections there over being one of a zillion random interns at the DA/PD\u2019s office.<br><br>For preparation:<br>Civil - learn how to write motions well. Legal writing is not like normal bullshit college writing. Stick to IRAC. You also have to have balls of steel, hate the world, love shit flinging, and have top tier negotiating skills.<br><br>Criminal - <br>Take the classes. Its a lot about personal diplomacy, dont be an outright asshole or pushover. You will work with the same DAs for decades.

One skill you may be lacking in, can&#039;t say from a brief exchange like this, is the ability to engage with ideas that aren&#039;t up your alley. Doesn&#039;t matter if the other person isn&#039;t necessarily knowledgeable or interested in what you are, or vice-versa, you just have to be able to show interest, ask questions, and relate your own ideas and experiences to it, as well as being willing to show your own side of it. You also don&#039;t need to appeal to everyone, or have good conversational chemistry with everyone, it&#039;s the difference between an excellent movie that appeals to a niche audience, and an okay movie that appeals to the majority. One isn&#039;t necessarily &quot;better&quot; than the other, but with mass-appeal comes some loss of content or focus that you don&#039;t have to pursue. You just have to find people who can relate to you, or at least appreciate what you have to offer in a conversation. You can have both, too, no reason why you can&#039;t save the more niche interests for those who can appreciate them, while still learning to keep an exchange up with more generally relatable topics.
