This confusion appears to be at the core of your problem. <br><br>An acquaintance is someone you have some conversation with, perhaps sometimes some very interesting conversations with. They are people whose ideas you might enjoy but you don&#039;t really know very well, and don&#039;t have much (if any) shared experience with. This means by definition acquaintances are people outside of ones friend group, they are held at arms length and are easily disposed of. It&#039;s where someone is when you first meet them and are deciding if you want to be their friend. <br><br>A friend is someone you know things about, whon lets you in and tells you things, whom confides in you and seeks advice, but most importantly whom actively seeks to do things together to spend time and where shared experiences have been established. <br><br>A GOOD friend is a long time friend you have many shared experiences with, know everything about and share a deep connection with. <br><br>---What you have described in your post is an acquaintance, it certainly isn&#039;t a good friend. ----<br><br>The problem you&#039;re having is you aren&#039;t making it beyond acquaintance. In many ways making friends is like dating, only the terminology changes and there&#039;s usually no sex involved. Small talk about your interest is ok to get someone on the hook, but what are you doing to create shared positive experience to bond the two of you in friendship? <br><br>Are you inviting them somewhere to do something together?
