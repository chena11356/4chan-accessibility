All with girls.</span><br><br>Then the attraction thing you are asking for is weighted heavily on what you can &quot;notice&quot; in a person at first so it may not be what you&#039;re used to when you experience attraction in a woman.<br><br>What I mean is the attraction you are familiar with in women is not likely going to be the same kind of attraction you will have in a guy because the difference is, you haven&#039;t been sensitised to the erotic nature of men in any capacity and that will be part of the reason for a lack of arousal. <br><br>There is no gurantee that you will ever get aroused by a man but here are 2 ideas:<br>1. Going back to what I said with what you &quot;notice&quot;. If a man is able to demonstrate traits you like, pay attention carefully to how you feel carefully. The non sexual stuff may be really attractive in a fun sort of way and you just enjoy it that way so it doesn&#039;t feel special let alone sexual. But still, pursue these feelings to see if you discover feelings that are stronger, you may get sensitised and instinctively match the traits that can actually arouse you. The same goes for appearances. Compare with finding good music.<br><br>2. With any sort of feeling and/or curiousity, again read fictional stories with a premise that you find will resonate with your feelings. I&#039;ll warn you not to look at lesbian conversion stuff though because that&#039;ll probably just be fantasy stuff that hardly occurs in real life.<br><br>Hypothetically, if a guy you already knew, one day while having an innocent chat revealed a side to him that you wasn&#039;t aware of before but found your heart racing and decided you liked that side of him. That would be an extreme case of attraction but on a level of just &quot;noticing&quot;.

I mean, it helps but I know an average-looking 5&#039;6&quot; guy who has slept with probably over 30 women by now, some of whom are very attractive. The thing is, he is pretty socially confident, dominant, and fun to be around. The point is - realize that right now, as we speak, there are probably plenty of guys who are &quot;objectively&quot; uglier than you who are fucking attractive women. So for you it&#039;s probably a mental thing that you need to get past. First of all, forget about all that &quot;know their place&quot; bullshit. Throw that right out the window. Re-examine your beliefs. Why would you be unworthy of looking at a pretty girl? There are guys who are uglier than you, morally worse than you, poorer than you, etc. fucking pretty girls right now as we speak.<br>Second, think of it as a numbers game. Basically sort of like this multiplication: your objective qualities x your sexual projection and confidence x your volume = your results with girls. Volume meaning just how many girls you are interacting with in any given period of time. If you increase any of those three factors in the multiplication, you will get better results.<br>To improve your sexual projection and confidence, first of all you have to get this through your head:<br>There is nothing wrong with you wanting to fuck women. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting to fuck women. Literally nothing wrong with it. Women want to fuck men too. There have probably been some women before in your life who thought about fucking you even if you didn&#039;t realize it.<br>There is absolutely zero, nothing, zilch, zip wrong or weird about you wanting to fuck women. 99% of guys want to fuck. 99% of girls want to fuck.

Sitting around assuming that she wouldn&#039;t be into you is just speculation. Make a move and find out. By making a move I mean just anything that escalates things a bit. Some deeper eye contact than usual, maybe a sexual joke, etc. Anything that basically puts a bit of your cards on the table so to speak, showing at least some of your sexual desire and intent, and causes her to react. Don&#039;t speculate about whether she&#039;s into you or not unless you have at least tried to make eye contact with her.<br>Third: Realize this very clearly: If you try and you get rejected you are better off than if you had not tried, at least as long as you are baseline psychologically healthy enough that you do not literally frighten her - but honestly, to not be that level of creepy isn&#039;t very hard, you just have to not be an obsessed stalker mode type of guy. Anyway, assuming that you&#039;re not obsessed stalker kind of guy, and like probably 90% of guys are not, basically this is the point to take away:<br>You cannot lose from trying, you can ONLY win. You go try to flirt with a woman, there are two outcomes - either she rejects you and you had some fun and you now you have some more real-life experience to improve your skills, OR you get somewhere with her which is great. Think about all the guys who are too scared to even try to flirt with a woman and realize that even just trying already makes you sexually more confident than all those guys. Pretty much every guy gets rejected sometimes. It&#039;s much much better to be rejected 100 times and sleep with 10 women than to be rejected 0 times and sleep with 0 women. Try to make flirting with women fun for yourself no matter the outcome. One key thing is, don&#039;t take any of it too seriously.

Although you are having fun for yourself, this also is attractive to her because we all feel safer and more comfortable around people who are having fun.&quot;. Don&#039;t be afraid to be a bit of an actor, try to put on a bit of a role and experiment with adopting different personalities as long as it&#039;s for fun and you&#039;re self-aware about it. A bit of role-playing in flirting is fun.<br>Keep in mind this though: fun by itself without sexual intent just puts you into the &quot;random fun guy&quot; bucket, not necessarily the &quot;guy to fuck&quot; bucket. You also need sexual intent, to project sexual intent. From my experience, two good ways to get better at it are:<br>1) Make sure to make good eye contact with women you&#039;re attracted to. Eye contact by itself even without anything else goes a long way with women. You can go to YouTube and find lots of eye contact with women practice videos. Go spend some time watching them, it&#039;s actually enjoyable and it can help you to feel that making eye contact with women is something fun and sexually charged. If you feel like it, masturbate while watching the videos. It&#039;s like porn but the difference is that sexually charged eye contact is something that can happen at the bar while everyone&#039;s clothes are on.

They are two different forms of sexual tension. The difference is basically whether you are leaning away from the sexual tension or leaning into the sexual tension. Sexual tension is a great thing, it&#039;s basically the chemistry and sparks that are flying when things are going well between two people who are flirting. You experience it as fear if you lean away from it and try to suppress or escape it. For example, you see some hot woman and instantly the feeling of sexual tension arises in you. If you lean away from the feeling and tell yourself self-hating bullshit in your mind about how you&#039;re a loser or whatever and you have no chance then that feeling of sexual tension turns into fear because your attitude to the sexual tension is to want to escape it, to reduce it. On the other hand, if you lean INTO the feeling and you make eyes at her or go approach her and you are telling yourself uplifting thoughts about how hot you are and so on, then that sexual tension becomes a HAPPY feeling. Same energy, but you are leaning INTO it instead of away from it. You&#039;re not running away from it, you&#039;re acting on it. Then you go talk to the woman and all the way through you are enjoying that feeling of sexual tension and no matter whether you get laid or not, you have won because you are moving more into, you have learned to be more comfortable in the space of enjoying that sexual tension, that space of sexual chemistry.", "time": 1674250191, "resto": 28162871}, {"no": 28163847, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)16:31:07", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28163808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28163808</a><br><a href=\"#p28163833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28163833</a><br>Is this both by you?

If you try to make moves on a woman and you&#039;re not creepy about it the worst thing that will happen almost all of the time is just that she is flattered but is not receptive. I know there&#039;s a meme out there that &quot;creepy is just when an unattractive guy does it&quot; but that&#039;s not actually true in my experience. In reality, creepy is just when a guy hits on a woman in too awkward a way and/or he is oblivious to her responses and does not take them into account. If you hit on a woman in a fun way, meaning that you are doing it in a way that is fun for you and playful, and you pay attention to her response and do not try to escalate if her response is completely negative, then you won&#039;t come off as creepy. Most of the time women&#039;s rejections to guys who have basic social skills are not complete rejections of the &quot;go away&quot; type, they are more just of the &quot;I&#039;m kinda flattered but I don&#039;t want to pursue this&quot; type. Sometimes women who reject you in that way will change their minds later. Basically, it&#039;s not creepy to hit on women if:<br>1) You are playful and fun about it as opposed to being dreadfully serious &quot;you are my true love blah blah blah&quot; mode<br>and<br>2) You pay attention to her response and if it is not positive then you back off a bit and give her some space<br>Making moves on women in itself is not creepy at all, it is only creepy if you are either dreadfully serious about it, which makes her feel that you might be weird stalker obsessed guy, or if you ignore her responses and try to plow through and monopolize her attention too much when she is sending signals that at the moment she doesn&#039;t want that. By the nature of making moves on women, you have to step into her reality a bit and put your cards on the table. As long as you&#039;re having fun, not taking things including her reactions too seriously, but also are aware of her reactions and back off a bit if she isn&#039;t feeling it, you&#039;re not going to come off as creepy to her.", "time": 1674258452, "resto": 28162871}, {"no": 28164795, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)18:48:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28164624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164624</a><br>why wouldn&#039;t it be? its just a matter of money which is mostly a matter of time<br>if you decrease spending to minimum and maximise your savings you will be able to go again eventually, everyone will<br><a href=\"#p28164749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164749</a><br>yeah in school it can work but thats not cold approach, its always regular things<br>and your friend is still autistic as shit, if he just had a regular conversation instead of asking out randoms he would have gotten a gf in 1-2 approaches like a normal person does. <br><a href=\"#p28164610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164610</a><br>Shut the fuck up you didn&#039;t think it, you already know what everyone is going to say and are just now baiting positive affirmation like a woman.

You talk to Jessica, then to Megan, during conversation with Megan you say what Jessica told you, Megan also tells you something, then you go to Louis and tell her what Megan and Jessica told you and this process goes on and on until you have more and more to say to more and more people in your social circles.

It has been 8 months. Short term (ignoring hair) side effects were increased libido, increased penis sensitivity, increased ejaculation volume, but decreased thickness, slight ball ache. More medium term I started noticing less enjoyment of alcohol, less desire to get drunk, reduced libido, decreased tolerance to stress, increased anxiety, some muscle aches and fatigue. Now 8 months in I&#039;d say overall the decreased desire and enjoyment of alcohol, the decreased libido, the reduced stress tolerance, muscle aches and fatigue seems here to stay. I am tolerating the side effects because they are tolerable, but I am not ignorant of them. My major concern is over time reduced executive function and drive. I&#039;m concerned that over 5 years I might be generally okay with the status quo were as maybe off fin I&#039;d have started a business, made some moves y&#039;know? If you are wondering why I tolerate any side effects what so ever I believe that everybody will get some side effects on fin, but whether you can tolerate them or not is when they become a problem. I used to jerk off 6 times a day and want sex 2-3 times a day, like I had a problem. Now my libido is a lot more matched to my partners and I&#039;m happy with sex twice a week and I jerk off a couple of times a week. I used to drink way too much, like it was bad for my health and now I drink one or two drinks a week and I rarely get anywhere approaching drunk which is also an improvement in my book. The muscle aches suck, like I get pain in my knee and I feel tired and I feel fucking old, but I&#039;ve started some daily cardiovascular exercise and I figure that losing a little weight and getting in better condition will help with that and also be a better idea in the long run.

As that is in ascendency your interpersonal relationships kick in to gear, you get forced to get a little job or something. Basically you are never left alone with enough free time to really start thinking this way. You&#039;ll get put upon the first steps of a higher education and eventually a career, complaining the whole time that you just want to be left alone, but all this shit is insidious because each thing presents challenges to overcome, creates goals which offers rewards and sustains motivation. I need to optimise xyz in order to silence the complaints of xyz in order to free up time so I can finally get back to living my life how I wanted to. If you are fortunate this motivation lasts until you are on your death bed. You will always look back and think the grass could have been greener because ideally you are constantly improving and kicking ass. That is what it means to be a man anyway.

To have a choice is an unimaginable luxury because most of the time humans didn&#039;t have a choice. With that luxury comes a burden however, if you can choose what should you choose? For me the answer was obvious. You should choose to be good through the eyes of others as your own are prone to self delusion and you should do so as best as you are able holding on to that principle as an internal sort of honesty. Everything is melts away. In any situation I&#039;ll try my best as well as I am capable. If not I know that I did and that is just how it had to go down. Anybody who knows me can trust in that.

Do you have a community? Find one if not. It doesn&#039;t matter if it is a chess club or a woodworking group or a worthy job or a bunch of fucking drunks in the same dive bar. Humans seek out a group of an appropriate level and then they are human with one another. They shoot the shit and they comfort and empathise and they help each other out and jostle for position and try to catch the eye of the opposite sex and flaunt the things that make them unique, interesting and demonstrate status within the group. If you haven&#039;t got that then you are missing out on quite a lot. A lot of it might seem like a burden you create for yourself in order to feel better about yourself and truthfully a lot is like that.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like. In my opinion physical improvement is the number one best thing you can do if you are unhappy with your life because it lays the foundation for everything else. This is coming from someone who was fat basically my entire life and was well on my way to being an eternal neet.

Then how are you going to do drugs and or get yourself a new fake identity? To accomplish these things you will need to deal with shady characters.<br><br>Here is my honest advice. <br>First, do not become a druggie. That will only make your life worse in every measurement. <br>Second, save up as much cash as you can while slowly deactivating all social media. If you just vanish people will look. If you just slowly fade out everyone will be busy with their own self-absorbed lives they will probably not even notice. After that take your money and the few belongings you are keeping and drive to a new city of your choosing. Preferably one far away to avoid running into people who know you. <br>Once there rent a place with cash for a few months and head to the court house and get the ball rolling on a legal name change. Depending on how long that takes you can either wait for your new name to find employment or you can just live frugally off your savings. Once you have a new name and ID, go build a new life.

That was after a decade of not smoking anything at all. Addiction creates powerful connections in our brains, anon. It&#039;s not a willpower thing, it&#039;s a psychology thing.
