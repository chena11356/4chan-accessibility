It can definitely feel awkward or forced at first especially if you are anxious or sensitive to it. This can be reduced by socializing beforehand elsewhere intentionally to get your social skills all primed and ready. Additionally in some cases the way you open a conversation is going to feel forced or awkward and you won&#039;t be able to make it not feel that way. In those cases you can either lean into it jokingly (if they pick up on the vibe) or ignore it and continue. Some of the best conversations, social situations, and flirts I&#039;ve experienced started from really hamfisted openings or situations. Oftentimes these get forgotten or people don&#039;t care about them or sometimes as I said before, they&#039;re inescapable.

Although I&#039;m a virgin at 31, I can&#039;t imagine a reality where sex feels so much more better than fapping, and every time imagine what the sex would be like eventually, it always feels like a finale, like you go through all those trials, avoid all those traps, get lucky and she ACTUALLY likes you doesn&#039;t just try to use you for networking/money/betabux/attention,<wbr> doesn&#039;t falsely accuse you of rape, or the dating experience isn&#039;t so awkward, weird and bad that one of you is forced to quit the job. So you go through all these trials and tribulations for what amounts to fapping with another&#039;s hand.<br>The juice isn&#039;t worth the squeeze. There is simply too much, too many variables, too many things that ca go wrong, for the 1 eventuality that you get sex. And then there are equally as many bad things that can happen against the 1 eventuality that something bad doesn&#039;t happen after the sex. As I have said in my previous post, I have lost all confidence and hope in the world. I know and see that there is no &quot;justice and fairness&quot;. No guarantees, no specifics. There is no guarantee that working hard earns you a living. There is no guarantee that being a lazy alcoholic slob means you&#039;ll be homeless. No certainty that being ugly gets you women, and also no certainty that being hot gets you women. This unstable chaos, this randomness of existence that allows for free will makes me utterly void of any purpose. Why should I even work for X if working for X does not guarantee I achieve X? Or vice versa, why SHOULDN&#039;T I just work for X? Nothing is real, nothing matters and at the same time everything is too real and matters too much. 1 careless word to someone right now might result in me becoming ultra rich 20 years down the line, or becoming homeless 20 years down the line.<br><br>When facing such chaos, what can a man do?

This resulted in me not being able to move my arm for 10 minutes or something. Then the pain still lasted and I can still feel it. Yesterday I was sitting at my computer desk and did a dumb movement and I think i overstretched or tore a muscle in my neck/back/shoulder. The pain is fucking severe and I cannot do things like sleep, turn around, get in and out of bed or even put my fucking socks on. The pain goes from neck, shoulder all the way to arm where I had this injury from 2 weeks ago. Could this all be related to eachother? Maybe something was already weak and I fucked up some important connection? I really am fucked cant do shit and am wondering how im gonna fucking wipe my ass.

That&#039;s entirely bullshit. Feel your feelings. The goal is to understand why you feel them and whether the beliefs/ideas/thoughts behind those feelings are serving you and the life you have/want. What you&#039;re feeling is common and normal, especially in older &quot;historical&quot; friendships, the ones that continue on long after their expiry due to shared history. The issue here is your communication in this relationship, and also the toxic nature of being EMPLOYED BY YOUR FRIEND (major no no, but whatever, moving on from that point since that&#039;s not what your post is about). You saw your friend react in a way that told you something was up. You can&#039;t know that for sure till you ask her. You didn&#039;t. Then the same thing happened on your end. You&#039;re growing resentful for not communicating your desire to hang out with her/go on the trip, and feeling hurt due to not being seen by this friend. She could feel the same way. You have to talk to her about this stuff, about these real issues.

The problem starts when I am living somewhere new.

A month in, I basically broke off contact with everybody here. I had the same, when I started my 1st year of uni. I have some people I smoke with sometimes and that is it, apart from that I am just in my room 24/7 or in Uni. I cant sleep, I cant do work, I am playing games to avoid my loneliness.

I know, I just need to write some people, pursue my hobbies and so on, but I am absolutely paralysed by fear and anxiety when I have to think about reapproaching people. Furthermore, I do not have any idea what to write them. So I am basically fucked. And I hate myself even more for this. And then I am way to anxious to develop a strategy. <br><br> I am so desperate to not be lonely anymore, but I am so deep in my depression with that, that I am on the border of becoming crazy. <br><br>Then, the friends I have, I feel only hanging out with because they are the last option I have.

At the same time learn what is worth making a suggestion to invite yourself over for whilst respecting boundaries. I guess the old saying &quot;mi casa es su casa&quot; is very relevant huh? <br><br>Essentially my advice is that you want to practice giving comfort to others so that you can accommodate their whims. Finally, to accelerate the process I suggest when meeting your new friends again, you should deliberately bring a newer new friend and introduce them to each other then rinse and repeat with each successful connection.<br><br>Hobbies, interest and all this other &quot;personality&quot; stuff does not matter to anynbody in hindsight.
