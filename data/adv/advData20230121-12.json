Haven&#039;t had friends since I left secondary school, and even then I wasn&#039;t part of any social groups, just had a few people I spoke with occasionally. Towards the end of secondary school it got so bad that I spent my entire breaks in the toilets just to save myself the embarassment.<br><br>I think upbringing has a lot to do with it. My mum was raised by very controlling parents who didn&#039;t really let her out much, and no surprise, she gave me the same exact upbringing. On the few attempts I do try to go out she will do whatever she can to control it in one way or another (offering to give me a lift when I already said I will bike or take the bus, constantly messaging me etc.). I wasn&#039;t allowed to walk to school by myself until Year 7 despite our school being a 5 minute walk around the block. I was always the last kid waiting at the end of the day.<br><br>And my dad was the complete opposite, just never really there. My only memories of him as a kid are of him drinking and swearing at me or my mum and blasting loud music by himself every Friday night. A boy without a good father figure is a waste of existence in my opinion. I wouldn&#039;t wish that fate on anyone.<br><br>The worst thing I can remember them doing is, one day I went to the shops down the street with some kids from my school, it was the one time I actually tried to do something by myself, and when I got back and my parents found out my dad walked to my friend&#039;s house and yelled at their parents. Who the fuck does that? Fucking embarassing. I didn&#039;t understand it back then, but I think now I realised that that moment probably sealed my fate forever.<br><br>And now here I am, doing nothing but working and making shit music.

Basically sort of like this multiplication: your objective qualities x your sexual projection and confidence x your volume = your results with girls. Volume meaning just how many girls you are interacting with in any given period of time. If you increase any of those three factors in the multiplication, you will get better results.<br>To improve your sexual projection and confidence, first of all you have to get this through your head:<br>There is nothing wrong with you wanting to fuck women. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting to fuck women. Literally nothing wrong with it. Women want to fuck men too. There have probably been some women before in your life who thought about fucking you even if you didn&#039;t realize it.<br>There is absolutely zero, nothing, zilch, zip wrong or weird about you wanting to fuck women. 99% of guys want to fuck. 99% of girls want to fuck.

Sitting around assuming that she wouldn&#039;t be into you is just speculation. Make a move and find out. By making a move I mean just anything that escalates things a bit. Some deeper eye contact than usual, maybe a sexual joke, etc. Anything that basically puts a bit of your cards on the table so to speak, showing at least some of your sexual desire and intent, and causes her to react. Don&#039;t speculate about whether she&#039;s into you or not unless you have at least tried to make eye contact with her.<br>Third: Realize this very clearly: If you try and you get rejected you are better off than if you had not tried, at least as long as you are baseline psychologically healthy enough that you do not literally frighten her - but honestly, to not be that level of creepy isn&#039;t very hard, you just have to not be an obsessed stalker mode type of guy. Anyway, assuming that you&#039;re not obsessed stalker kind of guy, and like probably 90% of guys are not, basically this is the point to take away:<br>You cannot lose from trying, you can ONLY win. You go try to flirt with a woman, there are two outcomes - either she rejects you and you had some fun and you now you have some more real-life experience to improve your skills, OR you get somewhere with her which is great. Think about all the guys who are too scared to even try to flirt with a woman and realize that even just trying already makes you sexually more confident than all those guys. Pretty much every guy gets rejected sometimes. It&#039;s much much better to be rejected 100 times and sleep with 10 women than to be rejected 0 times and sleep with 0 women. Try to make flirting with women fun for yourself no matter the outcome. One key thing is, don&#039;t take any of it too seriously.

Although you are having fun for yourself, this also is attractive to her because we all feel safer and more comfortable around people who are having fun.&quot;. Don&#039;t be afraid to be a bit of an actor, try to put on a bit of a role and experiment with adopting different personalities as long as it&#039;s for fun and you&#039;re self-aware about it. A bit of role-playing in flirting is fun.<br>Keep in mind this though: fun by itself without sexual intent just puts you into the &quot;random fun guy&quot; bucket, not necessarily the &quot;guy to fuck&quot; bucket. You also need sexual intent, to project sexual intent. From my experience, two good ways to get better at it are:<br>1) Make sure to make good eye contact with women you&#039;re attracted to. Eye contact by itself even without anything else goes a long way with women. You can go to YouTube and find lots of eye contact with women practice videos. Go spend some time watching them, it&#039;s actually enjoyable and it can help you to feel that making eye contact with women is something fun and sexually charged. If you feel like it, masturbate while watching the videos. It&#039;s like porn but the difference is that sexually charged eye contact is something that can happen at the bar while everyone&#039;s clothes are on. So watch some of those videos and make them part of your porn, so to speak.

They are two different forms of sexual tension. The difference is basically whether you are leaning away from the sexual tension or leaning into the sexual tension. Sexual tension is a great thing, it&#039;s basically the chemistry and sparks that are flying when things are going well between two people who are flirting. You experience it as fear if you lean away from it and try to suppress or escape it. For example, you see some hot woman and instantly the feeling of sexual tension arises in you. If you lean away from the feeling and tell yourself self-hating bullshit in your mind about how you&#039;re a loser or whatever and you have no chance then that feeling of sexual tension turns into fear because your attitude to the sexual tension is to want to escape it, to reduce it. On the other hand, if you lean INTO the feeling and you make eyes at her or go approach her and you are telling yourself uplifting thoughts about how hot you are and so on, then that sexual tension becomes a HAPPY feeling. Same energy, but you are leaning INTO it instead of away from it. You&#039;re not running away from it, you&#039;re acting on it.

If you try to make moves on a woman and you&#039;re not creepy about it the worst thing that will happen almost all of the time is just that she is flattered but is not receptive. I know there&#039;s a meme out there that &quot;creepy is just when an unattractive guy does it&quot; but that&#039;s not actually true in my experience. In reality, creepy is just when a guy hits on a woman in too awkward a way and/or he is oblivious to her responses and does not take them into account. If you hit on a woman in a fun way, meaning that you are doing it in a way that is fun for you and playful, and you pay attention to her response and do not try to escalate if her response is completely negative, then you won&#039;t come off as creepy. Most of the time women&#039;s rejections to guys who have basic social skills are not complete rejections of the &quot;go away&quot; type, they are more just of the &quot;I&#039;m kinda flattered but I don&#039;t want to pursue this&quot; type. Sometimes women who reject you in that way will change their minds later. Basically, it&#039;s not creepy to hit on women if:<br>1) You are playful and fun about it as opposed to being dreadfully serious &quot;you are my true love blah blah blah&quot; mode<br>and<br>2) You pay attention to her response and if it is not positive then you back off a bit and give her some space<br>Making moves on women in itself is not creepy at all, it is only creepy if you are either dreadfully serious about it, which makes her feel that you might be weird stalker obsessed guy, or if you ignore her responses and try to plow through and monopolize her attention too much when she is sending signals that at the moment she doesn&#039;t want that. By the nature of making moves on women, you have to step into her reality a bit and put your cards on the table. As long as you&#039;re having fun, not taking things including her reactions too seriously, but also are aware of her reactions and back off a bit if she isn&#039;t feeling it, you&#039;re not going to come off as creepy to her.", "time": 1674258452, "resto": 28162871}, {"no": 28164795, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)18:48:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28164624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164624</a><br>why wouldn&#039;t it be? its just a matter of money which is mostly a matter of time<br>if you decrease spending to minimum and maximise your savings you will be able to go again eventually, everyone will<br><a href=\"#p28164749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164749</a><br>yeah in school it can work but thats not cold approach, its always regular things<br>and your friend is still autistic as shit, if he just had a regular conversation instead of asking out randoms he would have gotten a gf in 1-2 approaches like a normal person does. <br><a href=\"#p28164610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164610</a><br>Shut the fuck up you didn&#039;t think it, you already know what everyone is going to say and are just now baiting positive affirmation like a woman.

Most of what people say are conversations they&#039;ve had with you in the past or with other people throughout the day. Talking is essentially just exchanging stories and mutual information about one another. <br>with your parents, you for sure know something that happened in your parents life recently so you ask about it e.g. your dads car broke recently, you ask him about it, ask about what mechanic he went to, what broke, how much it cost, how is he getting around now, how did it impact him, if he&#039;s upset etc. next time you speak to your dad you recount this conversation, if you talk to your mom you recount it as well and ask about her view on the subject<br>With women it comes the same way, you talk to them about something they&#039;ve said to you in the past or something someone else (that they also know) has told you. You talk to Jessica, then to Megan, during conversation with Megan you say what Jessica told you, Megan also tells you something, then you go to Louis and tell her what Megan and Jessica told you and this process goes on and on until you have more and more to say to more and more people in your social circles. Its all it is, its just disquised with phrases like Hey how are you how is your day going I just had a chat with Jessica and she said...<br>Its all essentially based on having prior conversations with people, them or others, the only hard part is starting this process and can only really happen in schools, because school gives you the starting point, the starting conversations to say things to someone to establish relationships, to say sentences to people who then tell you things which you can repeat to others. <br><a href=\"#p28164801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164801</a><br>I dont need to be encouraged, I&#039;m right<br><a href=\"#p28164809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164809</a><br>And you don&#039;t know this already because you haven&#039;t had any women", "time": 1674259076, "resto": 28162871}, {"no": 28164869, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)18:59:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28164795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164795</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why wouldn&#039;t it be? its just a matter of money which is mostly a matter of time</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you decrease spending to minimum and maximise your savings you will be able to go again eventually, everyone will</span><br>In this economy if you wish for your own house and car it may take someone too many years and dating women 15+ years younger may not be ok for some people<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and your friend is still autistic as shit</span><br>He&#039;s literally autistic, but each has his own way<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes because in dancing classes, people who go there will just be couples that already know each other and just want to prepare for wedding or something.

I know you\u2019re not being needy as guys communicate like rational people. Women do not do this obviously and they do view your \u201chey can you meet now? How about now? When are you free?\u201d texts as needy and potentially desperate because they know that the guy that they want won\u2019t be texting them to try to get a date.

Just leave her with something like \u201cok let me know when you\u2019re free\u201d and don\u2019t text her again. Don\u2019t double text trying to meet up all the time she will not meet up with if you continue to do this and I hope you didn\u2019t already fuck it up.

Given that most women have options, they also have many innate things that will turn them off from you if you do the things that you\u2019re doing now. Just wait on it and see if she replies.

Since I am a jaded old fuck with many burdens that most here would not understand, I couldn&#039;t get with that shit in my current state.<br><br>Two problems arise here.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one</span><br>How do I learn to have fun like women want to be around without faking? I am truly deep in my soul a 60 year old man waiting to die. It comes from knowledge of how the world actually works that I got from being a glownigger. I have seen shit that keeps me up at night bros. I also have a ton of occult knowledge from that time as well and that shit is a whole other burden. I feel like I just skipped adolescence and can&#039;t tolerate the banality and fakeness of most human interactions. 99% of people have no context to accept the reality of the world so you have to keep it close to the chest and makes you exhausted and misanthropic. It&#039;s to the point that I&#039;m just going to live in the woods, virgin wife or not.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two</span><br>I just found out she is 16. I&#039;m glad my hesitation kept me from making a move cause I would have probably fucked myself with a bar of soap otherwise. Is it weird to entertain the thought of waiting till she is 18 and making a move then provided she doesn&#039;t lose her faith and whore out? I want an 18 year old virgin wife, but am I approaching it immorally? I probably will only have the opportunity to talk to her twice in two years.", "time": 1674259670, "resto": 28159810}, {"no": 28165003, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:18:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28159862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28159862</a><br>this sounds like a disconcertingly genius move", "filename": "1504121962694", "ext": ".gif", "w": 288, "h": 288, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674260285529227, "time": 1674260285, "md5": "QJqDns4POAfSOGH8bnRFaA==", "fsize": 1974230, "resto": 28159810}, {"no": 28165016, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)19:19:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28164076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28164076</a><br>Even though this was perhaps too expensive and maybe sent the wrong signals I think bowling is a good thing to do on a date. When you&#039;re sitting opposite a girl you can&#039;t see her body and can&#039;t escalate. When she was throwing the ball I got to see her body really well. And drinking 3 glasses of wine combined with having a couch next to the bowling lane made it easy to escalate physically. Also doing all these things, first cafe, then restaurant with drinks, food and bowling, allowed the date to go on for a long time. If you just have coffee it&#039;s going to be a very short date. Maybe I should have tried to fuck her after the date but my apartment was untidy so I thought it&#039;s better to do that next date, plus she seemed like girlfriend material so I thought maybe it&#039;s not good to have sex on the first date.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like. In my opinion physical improvement is the number one best thing you can do if you are unhappy with your life because it lays the foundation for everything else. This is coming from someone who was fat basically my entire life and was well on my way to being an eternal neet.

Social environments ex: dating apps/events, bars, maybe places like concerts, parties, etc. Just because an environment has a lot of people doesn&#039;t mean its a place to socialize and attempt to pick up a woman, ex: Caf\u00e9, libraries, random public spaces even including malls, bus stops.... <br><br>Women aren&#039;t always looking to be hit on JUST because they are outside interacting with the world. No one wants to get hit on shopping for groceries or are on errands. You can&#039;t know the headspace of the person at any given time. When people go to places like bars, use dating apps, parties, most of the time, they are usually PREPARED to talk to people/seeking what you are. In their element.<br><br>Ladies like to look good when they&#039;re seeking partners, as do men I&#039;m sure. You go to these kind of social places in order to meet and mingle. People don&#039;t necessarily want to meet and mingle on the way to work/getting food. I feel success rate would be increased seeking out a woman when SHE IS BEING SOUGHT AFTER. Not just randomly approaching her like a kidnapper. There are a lot of dangerous men out there and a woman is innately suspicious of a rando approaching her in a non-social situation and environment. Learn to read a room and body language. If you are going to go about the cold approach you better master being as non-threatening as possible. School oy the exception. If you ask me the sole purpose of college is to make connections, but it is also a place to of course, learn and get things done. I am a woman and I do not like to be cold approached, as sparse as it happens. If I were at a party, a bar, park, even book store, I welcome an approach because that is what I am seeking there.

You need to looks and confidence maxxx to be good at it. Despite having a high failure rate with most, it\u2019s the ones who stick with it who get good at it. When I started I was obviously getting rejected most of the time despite being confident and good looking. I just kept at it and got very good at it now I know how to do it with very high success rates. I recommend it to all anons because despite having high failure rate, most anons don\u2019t factor in the effects that it can have on your confidence. If you can harness the rejections in \u201cdamn I can\u2019t believe I said that to a chick\u201d or \u201c I\u2019m happy I at least shot my shot\u201d instead of thinking \u201comg I can\u2019t believe that didn\u2019t work\u201d then this can really help you so much in life in general. Getting out of your comfort zone and socializing with random people is a very useful skillset and the more you practice it the better your social skills will become.<br><br>You also have to break down the different kinds of cold approach (which are setting based) as you have approaching in bars or at a concert (basically where booze is involved) and then you have on the street and in coffee shops or something. Cold approaches are pretty common in bars, how else do you expect to meet women if not through friends? In bars you can get very high success rates especially if you are just approaching and talking to people everywhere you are to anyone.

Or try your hand at civil in Canada as that is very prestigious and if you get through it you will get the money you desire. You need good math for all of these anyways so I&#039;m guessing that it&#039;s not an issue for you. If it is you have no chance. Sorry to be blunt but that&#039;s just how it is. You will probably do physics in mining and civil. You deffo will in civil. Computer science has easier maths. But involves less following formulas like in physics and more coming up with your own formulas and algorithms. Some people prefer one or the other etc. Regardless you&#039;ll probably do calculus in all of them.", "time": 1674250312, "resto": 28159474}, {"no": 28165316, "now": "01/20/23(Fri)20:11:55", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28163793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28163793</a><br>Makes sense<br><a href=\"#p28163855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28163855</a><br>Why civil over mining?
