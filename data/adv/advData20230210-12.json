Accept the fact that you weren&#039;t made for relationships and get on with it. Life fucking sucks. No self improvement will help. Life isn&#039;t a movie where you can just wait for the right one. Love isn&#039;t real. The sooner you accept this the better. I could be patronising and say go get a hobby and focus on the things you like doing, but it&#039;s merely a substitute for being loved.

He builds houses, but apparently the bank accounts and everything are in her name, so she literally stole everything because he has no legal recourse without risking being sent back to Mexico. The son challenged her about her new boyfriend who tried to install a camera in the bathroom (the other kids are all girls) so she kicked him out. One of the sisters had been messaging the father online, and the mother was furious. Our church confronted her about the infidelity and she stopped coming to church.

But if it&#039;s important to you, you need to be careful about selecting someone with matching interests. I don&#039;t have many hobbies in common with my husband. He likes technology, math, programming, sports, lifting. I prefer literature, history, cooking, weebshit, taking care of the house and sewing. But we are still very close. I listen to him rant about new tech, go over sci-fi books I recommended and explain how exactly it would work out irl. I don&#039;t have much to contribute, it took me ages to figure out all the math stuff he loves talking about (like Modern Differential Geometry, Jesus). Likewise, when I share details about a history book I&#039;ve just read, rant about validity of sources, explain every scene of the new PreCure season and how it relates to the past entries, what is he gonna know about all that? Nothing! It&#039;s nice to find a common ground sometimes. We like reading hard sci-fi books and visual novels together, sometimes I get him to watch anime, he asks me to watch him play sports with his buddies or when there are dancing classes in the gym we go together. He lifts and I stretch, the sweaty sex afterwards is amazing too lol. I think it&#039;s nice that we can help each other with things we are not the best at. I cook for him, sew him clothes, decorate our home, he takes care of my cybersecurity, picks and buys tech for me that I&#039;d have no idea about otherwise, etc. Over the course of our relationship he assembled like 8 desktops for me. And I&#039;ve been making him cute lunches to uni and then work for years, every day. I make sure he is always happy, clean and fed.

So if you can just live with the guilt on your shoulders and bring it to the grave then you should be ok, at least if you\u2019re like me.

Women get aroused from rape and men they find detestable all the time, it&#039;s also mostly about physical attraction to them. You should be held to the same standard as her.<br><br>The thing is, once you got married to your woman, you&#039;ve entered a contract. You are supposed to stay monogamous and be dedicated to her, sexuality included, for life. If both of you fail, then the relationship becomes just completely worthless. You are willing to risk the life you have, kids, her trust and happiness, for a little bit of physical pleasure. It&#039;s not easy or feasible to cheat for decades, it&#039;s basically a guarantee you&#039;ll get caught sooner or later, causing her unimaginable pain and humiliation. So it&#039;s just funny to me you claim you love her, since all in all you place fucking someone else for a couple of minutes on a higher pedestal than her life.<br><br>Now, your wife is also to blame. There are ways to increase your libido, I was in similar situation to her. Before her surgery, my wife absolutely needed to have sex at least 2 times a day, and for me once is more than enough. So I tried my best to accommodate her, fuck her hard enough, finger her, etc. For women it&#039;s even easier, since it&#039;s just easier to please a guy.

It also function Lust itself is just driven by testosterone and estrogen. <br><br>Most interestingly, brain scans during arousal stimuli have found that women respond with arousal stimuli more often for both preferred and nonpreffered stimuli i.e. women can more easily become sexually aroused by things that they do not sexually prefer. Women are not lying when they say things like &quot;I dated a guy that is not my type/I wasn&#039;t very attracted to but he turned me on&quot;.

A mistake would be, say, a woman marrying a guy who put on a charming front and only turned into a psychopath after the wedding. Or calling off a marriage because she had very strong but circumstantial evidence that her fiance cheated, even though it was all a misunderstanding and he was loyal. These are understandable actions that led to bad outcomes because of imperfect information. Not deliberate and intrinsic wrongs.<br><br>If you don&#039;t care about waiting until marriage, then sure, it doesn&#039;t make sense to get upset that women didn&#039;t wait, but any moral standard that you do have--like about infidelity--is absolutely a relevant concern to have in a partner&#039;s past. It shows what that person is capable of, and what they truly value. And having wider social consequences for doing wrong is an important part of discouraging people from making &quot;mistakes&quot; in the first place. <br>It isn&#039;t a noble position to say you wouldn&#039;t care about what your partner did in the past. It&#039;s a very selfish one, since you are willing to send a message that doing wrong has few consequences in exchange for the mere *belief* that you get a pleasant relationship in the present. You don&#039;t need to, and shouldn&#039;t, attack someone for a past they regret and can&#039;t change.

I made sure to plan out when I would go and how many days and she was cool with everything. Then last week she asked for space. It came out of nowhere because we were on good terms and she was sending me cute messages the whole week. I gave her the space and we stayed in contact, but I started to suspect there was someone else. I confronted her about it in a calm way and she reassured me that she wasn\u2019t seeing anyone. The next day we FT and she mentioned that I should shorten my trip because 2 weeks was too long for our first meeting. I ended up getting upset and she started crying. Eventually I calm her down and we hang up on good terms. That\u2019s the last time I saw her. She started avoiding my calls then sent me a paragraph explaining how she feels overwhelmed and can\u2019t do the trip because of her mental health. She took all the blame and felt horrible. I reassured her that I\u2019m willing to wait it out. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting to hear from her again and she messaged me two days later asking how I was. We had some small talk and when I brought up discussing the paragraph she sent, she went completely ghost. It\u2019s been a week since then and idk what to do.
