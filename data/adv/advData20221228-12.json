No wonder there are so many incels, as MEN ARE THIS FUCKING RETARDED TO OSTRACIZE WOMEN WITH NORMAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOR NO REASON. If a woman does not get married it is normal for her to have the number of partners you said your girlfriend has had. Because women, too, get dumped. And they too, need to have sex life, preferably relationships, not to end up as social outcasts, as no one wants to be friend of a loser who has no sex life. And if you haven&#039;t got friends irl, to post pictures of on your social media page, you won&#039;t have following, and if you haven&#039;t got that, you won&#039;t be hired by anyone either. As no one follows a loser with no friends and no one hires a loser with no following.

You giving up on your desire to reproduce in a different time, as a different person than your parents, is because you are weak. You have decided, consciously or otherwise, to be a coward. To refuse to adapt. In so doing, you avoid growing as a person instead of making the painful changes necessary for making you into a man (the masculinity that provides competency (value in society) and security to women.).

Believe me, I&#039;d fucking know. Entry level machine operator work is mind numbing and soul rending. When I first started machine operator work, I was expecting to work with the machines and fix whatever issues they had and really get in there in a mechanical sense. The truth is, most of your time is a machine operator is going to be spent standing in front of the machine watching it do its job. Maybe you&#039;re feeding it. That&#039;s about it. Some places are pretty chill, but most places I&#039;ve seen are strict as hell.

That&#039;s when shit gets fun and that&#039;s also when you get paid pretty well too. Not as well as welding though on average. Most of the machine operating places I worked at hired people through temp agencies. It&#039;s like they couldn&#039;t keep people there for any longer than a month. God only knows why. That being said though, it&#039;s a big market and you&#039;re guaranteed to find something at least. Might not be pretty, but something. Like I said, if you want to do machine operating focus on becoming a machinist. A machinist works on machines and operates machines. A machine operator, just operates the machine. The difference being, One is a serious profession that pays well, and the other is basically unskilled labor. <br><br>Most machinists make around 55k per year. Some make 77k-100k. But that&#039;s rare. Machine operators usually make $15-20 per hour. I quit machine operation for a career in engineering. That was years ago.

In retrospect if me and friend spoke about it before we paid for prostitutes we would have abstained and reconciled our common despair.

Ambivalence means you are of two choices: You really want to keep using porn but at the same time want to quit. You cant reconcile these two extremes and likely do not understand it yet, but its simple. Its I vs IT. The you that matters vs the primitive midbrain beast. <br><br>Step two is learning to recognize the addictive voice. Once recognized your thoughts untangle themselves. You decide to stick with your choice instead of what this midbrain compels you to do.<br><br>Step three is strengthening your grip over the addictive voice. You mainly do it through the technique of shifting. It means letting the beast out and then reining it in over and over again. You can see it in action in the second part of the video series and its very powerful.

So instead of doing the same, I started to take a shower as soon as I got home, after that I started to cook something and prepare my things for the next day.

I get along better with guys because I am autistic and more blunt and I guess the way that i socialize by primary liking friends I do things with that are of my special interest like gymming. But guys eventually hit on you so do girls if they are gay. I stop talking to them because my bf is the sweetest in the world and I have no interest at all. The female friends i have had usually used me to get them things or to do thungs for them since I am a people pleaser and easy to push around because I am anxious and it is hard for me to formulate exactly what is off in the social situation even tho I know something is wrong. It is normal for female autists to end in that situation. If it bothers him that you dont have friends it is a him issue because he loves you and you work fine with him which shows it is the other situations that are off. My bf gets it but im lucky cause my earlier relatiobships didn&#039;t. I have a lesser need to be around people so i dont go actively to look for new ones i only spend time with people that i found acidentally and that are just so awesome i do still like to do things with them but it is more rare.

You are autistic so if he do not like that trait about you it wont work anyways. Have you tried to talk with him about it? But my advice is to look at it likw this. Your mn has to hear about your sewing and hobbies while others are made to listen to their gf rant about their bitch ass stupid friends.

When they ask, &quot;What is that?&quot; because people are retarded, tell them to Google it. The very first result that comes up when you Google HSV1 is Johns Hopkins Medicine saying that 50 - 80% of the entire population has it, &quot;oral herpes,&quot; and &quot;is oral herpes even an STD?&quot; From those results, they will infer that you must have &quot;oral herpes&quot; and the internet will tell them &quot;everyone has got it.&quot; They might respond better to this. I doubt any of them will even ask, &quot;Where do you have HSV1?&quot; because, again, people are retarded. Anyone who asks will already be familiar with herpes enough to ask.<br><br>This is morally OK and ethically permissible because there is almost *ZERO* difference between HSV1 orally vs. genitally. I say &quot;almost&quot; because HSV1 genitally has an even LOWER chance of being spread than HSV1 orally. But the retarded general population does not know this and does not care to know this. Also, no law states you have to tell them *where* you have it.

The just-world that they live in is actually just and fair. They *are* what is expected, and in return, they get what is expected. It is this satisfaction of expectation that is justice.

The first step in this denial is writing it off by effectively saying \u201cyou\u2019re also a normie, just one that hasn\u2019t blossomed yet. Do what I did because it worked for me.\u201d Obviously this doesn\u2019t work except for the genuine few failed normie late bloomers who fell through the socialization cracks during their formative years or shortly thereafter.

Night shift is the easiest way to do this. I only have 3 months of work experience and I&#039;m 25 because I&#039;m in a very similar situation. The only reason I was able to work those 3 months was because it was night shift. I just sent in an application hopefully getting that job back because anxiety got the best of me leading me to quit. I regretted it though because while before I got the job I was also barely able to get out of the house and constantly on edge but after I quit I realized all the progress I made just with the minimal social interactions with co-workers and time at the job was able to keep my mind off my home life all while I was earning my own money. When it comes to your agoraphobia and being on edge, remind yourself that even if you say/do the wrong thing around some stranger first of all they won&#039;t think twice about it in the future and you&#039;ll almost certainly never see them again anyway. Start off with something you can handle and be responsible with your money so you can get your car fixed. If you&#039;re not ready to send out applications quite yet because of the agoraphobia, try setting a chair by your front door and just sit outside for 30 minutes. You can bring your phone or something else to keep you occupied, it&#039;s just getting outside that&#039;s the important step. Take it from there little by little and go for short 15-30 minute walks, and then see if you&#039;re ready to send applications.

Loyalty means caring in spite of these kinds of things, and if they reject you they aren&#039;t loyal. I don&#039;t know much about Islam, but Christians doing this is highly hypocritical.

Good luck OP, if you&#039;re in the West there are plenty of people who will love you regardless of faith. I know first hand that, sometimes, you have to pick or make your own family, and cut out toxic, hurtful people regardless of being blood. It hurts, but the pain they can cause you with their callousness and judgementalism can be so much worse. I have to doubt that their God said to turn their backs on family, their uncaring is their own choice.
