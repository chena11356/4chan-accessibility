The advice I&#039;d give is fairly similar to those who get emotional of witnessing their own failures - Understand that pain is a natural part of life, but most of the time it&#039;s only a big deal if you make it so. Becoming frustrated with or wallowing in pain will damage you way more than the pain itself. Missing a shot in a football game? Unfortunate but not unbearable. It doesn&#039;t damage or scar you physically, you can still play in the future and hit other shots, it doesn&#039;t ruin any valuable relationships... it&#039;s hardly anything tragic.<br><br>Learn to separate tragedy from pain. Pain isn&#039;t evil. Through it we learn that putting our hand on a stove is a very bad thing.

I think the degenerates in the mainline Protestant branches scared the rest of them into thinking that accepting leeway there is a path to modernism. The exception to this is probably the Anglican groups which tend to be far more lenient in their confessions and therefore you are more likely to find a priest/pastor there who agrees with you. Conservative Anglican churches exist you just need to look around, in the states we have the ACNA as well as like a million little splinter groups, idk about Canada. But also most evangelical denominations (Baptist, Charismatic, Non-denom, etc) do not have any kind of overarching hierarchical structure in their churches and they are usually self-governed. In these cases you could very well find a conservative church that also accepts a nonliteral interpretation of Genesis, but it might difficult. <br><br>The stance on creation is pretty unimportant in the grand scheme of things in your Christian life. Finding a church that agrees with you on every single little doctrinal issue, especially if you&#039;ve really thought through this stuff, is extremely rare. Focus on finding a church close to you that you can agree with on the big picture shit. For example my theology is in line with Lutheranism pretty broadly, but the LCMS in the states prefers the literal interpretation of Genesis.

Don\u2019t let them touch your things and let your children know to avoid them. Don\u2019t vaccinate in front of a femcoomer. Instead invite your doctor to your home so you can shut the blinds and let him vigorously administrate you away from the suspicious eyes of the femcoomer.

So how do I fix that?</span><br>Basically, you have to stop being such a fucking asshole all the time. Don&#039;t worry; I&#039;ll elaborate more. Your family history is sad, but not surprising. It definitely fits a profile. Your parents did a shit job. That&#039;s not your fault...but it IS your responsibility to fix now if you want things to turn around. And considering how you said you were raised by a Super Nintendo and not some variety of Playstation or X Box I&#039;m gonna guess that you&#039;re not young either. Meaning it&#039;s well past the time to learn how to interact with people.<br>And I think a part of your problem is that you&#039;ve come to define yourself solely by your interests, and likewise define other people by theirs. YOU are not anime or Evil Dead, and likewise someone who doesn&#039;t like those things is not making a personal attack. Likewise, these other people are not the Minnesota Vikings or whatever. There is more to them, and there would be more to you if you stopped hiding it.<br>The other problem here is that you&#039;ve divided people based on their interests as either &quot;normie&quot; (hilarious considering your video game taste) or as &quot;based 4chan autists!&quot; or whatever the fuck. And I think a lot of that is simply contrarianism on your part. For example, you said you&#039;d date a trekkie, even though you didn&#039;t say you&#039;re into Star Trek. So why the exception then? Oh right, because Trek isn&#039;t &quot;normie&quot; so it&#039;s ok for people to like whether you like it or not yourself. And since you have this childish black and white view of the world, you don&#039;t seem to realize that there are people out there who like football and Game of Thrones, AND video games and cheesy horror movies. I would know; I&#039;m one of them.<br>So you need to learn to stop pigeonholing people (yourself included) by their interests, learn to find common ground, and learn to read the room to figure out when people don&#039;t want to hear your shit.

I can&#039;t say what you should do, but once you decide don&#039;t be a bitch. You need to fully commit. If you start right now, it will probably be 2 years to get all of your pre-med classes out of the way to be able to apply to med school. You should apply to some MD schools but apply to DO schools as well (look it up of you don&#039;t know what a DO is). DO schools are easier to get accepted. If you&#039;re really hard up, look into carribean schools, although doing clinical rotations with them sounds like a nightmare. Once you graduate you have to do a residency to actually learn how to be a doctor. I think there is a specialty with a 2 year residency (can&#039;t think of what it is rn), family medicine has a 3 year residency, internal medicine is usually 4 years, surgery is 5 years, and neurosurgery will take you 7 years. Theres a bunch of other residencies out there, look them up. While you&#039;re a resident you&#039;ll be making about $60k/year. You&#039;ll be working 80+ hours a week. Once you finish residency you can practice as a &quot;real&quot; doctor or you can do a fellowship in a subspecialty if you want more training in a specific area. You will still be in several hundred thousand dollars of debt by now, but you can have most of it forgiven if you&#039;re willing to work somewhere rural/a shithole. Basically you&#039;re looking at ten years minimum to start practicing. If you like people, I&#039;d say look into family or internal medicine. Since you&#039;re on 4chan I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re a misanthrope so you should do something with more procedures like surgery, cardiology, gastroenterology, or urology. If you really hate people you can do radiology or pathology; you&#039;ll have very little interaction with patients. <br><br>Some alternatives could be CRNA, CAA or PA.

She has random rage fits. I can&#039;t be in the same room at the same time as her. Because of this I am constantly on high alert. High stress. Images of dead people and fight scenarios are constantly running through my head. Its involuntary. I can ignore it to the best of my ability but the fear of death shadows everything I do.<br><br>I&#039;m in-between jobs and have some interviews lined up. Besides this I am completely disfunctional and can&#039;t really be around others without insulting them. Its as if I&#039;m being controlled by some demon who hates everyone.

I think it might even be OCD, since trying to stop the urge to treat people like shit is like something else controlling my body and thoughts.<br><br>I can&#039;t go anywhere in public without masking a deep inner frustration, like an autistic freakout.
