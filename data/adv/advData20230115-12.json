I can&#039;t stop thinking about death. I recently started prozac which actually is helping with severe panic attacks I suffer from.

Only lowered my libido a little bit compared to other SSRIs I tried. <br><br>But it hasn&#039;t stopped the OCD thoughts. It&#039;s almost like the prozac eliminated my silly little anxieties and left me focusing on the only thing my brain cannot logically decipher: Death. I think about the death of others, the aging of others, including my wife and how she will one day grow old and frail and possibly gain dementia and become a shell of her former self, a walking ghost, a distorted, messed up echo of the love of my life. All before her body finally becomes still, and I have to see her laying cold and DEAD, unmoving on a hospital bed and then a coffin. I go into this level of imagination with all of my loved ones and friends and how they will decay and eventually lay lifeless before me.<br><br>Then there&#039;s my own death. In particular, I obsess about what it would be like to die in a horrific accident. Being shot actually doesn&#039;t sound too bad. Not afraid of that for some reason, but I have a great fear of a crushing death from a car accident, plane crash, or my house collapsing from a natural disaster or nuclear event. I try to imagine in vivid detail what I will see as a plane crashes: the sudden shaking/collapsing of everything around me, what part of my body will feel the most pain/crushing sensation and how insanely painful it will be compared to any other pain I have felt in my life, the shock and adrenaline as my brain realizes what is happening and panics.", "filename": "istockphoto-1307392488-612x612", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 459, "h": 612, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673711121595832, "time": 1673711121, "md5": "S77e5ubhF6SBXWpHwnaYRA==", "fsize": 36397, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "ocd-obsessive-thoughts-about-death", "replies": 13, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 28120652, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)10:46:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "So far, the only solace I&#039;ve found is...well, thousands of humans have died in accidents similar to this before me.

Also what is comforting is the fact that perhaps what I imagine it would be like to be in a car crash or plane crash, maybe my imagination is making it worst than it would actually be? Maybe I&#039;d sort of be &quot;chill&quot; and like &quot;oh shit, here comes a plane crash. Ow, that hurts a shit done. Bro, am I gonna die?&quot; Not everyone panics in every situation, even in the face of death. Maybe it won&#039;t be as traumatic as I think. And it will be over quick.

I am a Christian but the pain of life is making my question my beliefs a bit. I pray to Jesus for help and still feel lost. I am also looking into meditation and Tibetan Buddhism, which teaches you to intentionally focus on yours and everyone&#039;s inevitable death so that compassion grows. When you see everyone around you not as a living person, but as a deluded person thinking they are going to live forever and suppressing their eventual pain and suffering and death, you gain compassion for them. I feel that. I feel my compassion has grown by focusing on this and seeing my fellow humans as sad, decaying creatures who try at all times to suppress and not think about the fact they are decaying.

CBT and/or mindfulness training are two really effective times ways to get anxiety and intrusive thoughts under control, also when retards on 4chan tell you to stop taking meds, IGNORE THEIR SHITTY AND DANGEROUS ADVICE", "time": 1673757171, "resto": 28120647}, {"no": 28125332, "now": "01/15/23(Sun)00:02:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28120647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28120647</a><br>So I think you&#039;re not actually afraid of death. You are actually afraid of the future, particularly the possibility of a painful death. The part where you are dead is not scary. In fact it is a certainty just as much as birth is a part of life. What is scary is the uncertainty leading up to death. You seem to be able to think about one thing and focus on that thing for a long time. The problem is, you are focusing on the wrong thing. You are focusing on the future, which is uncertain and also unchangeable because we can only interact with the present. This causes you to experience anxiety because you are imagining a danger, but you are not able to act to get away from the danger. In this sense, the danger is everywhere and all the time.<br><br>In OCD, there is the Obsession, which is the thought, and then the Compulsion which is the behavior in reaction to the thought which is used to remove or replace the thought with something else. E.g. &quot;My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty. I am washing my hands. My hands are not dirty anymore, because I just washed them.&quot; In your situation, there is the thought, but no action is able to be taken to replace that thought with another.<br><br>What you should do is focus on the present. It is possible to act upon and change the present. It is not an unknown unquantifiable danger, it is known and quantifiable. Then you remove the danger and you can then relax.

So what happens is the chemical gets released in preparation for you to receive affection from your girlfriend. When you don&#039;t receive this affection, the body realizes it and shuts down the release of such chemicals which is a lot like coming down from a drug. When you miss your girlfriend, that is likely some of your chromosomes kicking off since humans are genetically monogamous so your body can&#039;t grasp that you are single. You can&#039;t use women to avoid this, it literally takes time for your body to readjust. In your midtwenties you will get another chance though.

We got together a little after i started working but it never evolved into much more (due to issues on my part that I was working through). Fast forward to middle last year when she meets her current boyfriend at her new job. Fast forward (again) to just a little over a week ago, when she calls me over to vent about him breaking up with her for no good reason and without talking to her about it. She starts talking about their relationship and how he was never doing anything for her, she was the one pushing their relationship along. Also was told of some questionable things he said to her while they were together. Tried to convince her that she wasn&#039;t in a good relationship with him and thought I had gotten through to her a little bit. But, today I found out that they talked and got back together. When I asked her about this, she told me she was convinced it was all a misunderstanding and that he loves and cares about her and she&#039;s convinced she loves and cares about him.<br><br>This might just be jealousy on my part because I do still care about her and did want to try for an actual relationship, but obviously fucked up (seriously, don&#039;t need the reminder).

Almost all of those dates were where I didn&#039;t at least make a tasteful sexual joke, tell them they look hot in a flirty way, break the touch barrier or actually try to bang them. I almost always get ghosted when I try to just enjoy the time and have a good conversation. There are some exceptions but this is usually how it goes for me.<br><br>Moral of the story is that she wanted DICK and you didn&#039;t give it to her.

We did share some mutual friends, but we never hung out together. <br><br>After graduation, we all parted ways. Some of us even moved far away. Our graduating class tried to stay connected on social media. But you know how that goes. Social Media isn&#039;t a replacement for real life. We all moved on.<br><br>In 2021, the news broke on social media that my classmate died suddenly. I reached out to a mutual friend for more info. I sent my deceased classmate&#039;s family a sympathy card. <br><br>I guess they had a private funeral. I didn&#039;t hear of anything else. I was not close to their family (I never met them). All I could do was send a sympathy card and move on. <br><br>This was 2 years ago. <br><br>-------------------------<br><br>In 2023...<br><br>2 years later, suddenly out of nowhere I received a card from my deceased classmate&#039;s mother. <br><br>The mother apologized and said she&#039;s been very depressed and sad these passed 2 years. But that out of ALL sympathy cards she received, my card meant the most to her. More than any other card from other classmates, friends, or family. It really meant so much to her. (huh?) <br><br>Then the mother then asked me if she could speak with me, and even meet in-person.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>1. I have no idea why my card was the most treasured. I&#039;m very confused. My sympathy card was nothing special. I was just polite, briefly explained who I was, and expressed my condolences for their family&#039;s loss. That&#039;s it. <br><br>How should I handle this? I&#039;m very surprised at this message. I know there were many other people who were much closer to my former classmate than me. I feel awkward. <br><br>I&#039;m trying to keep an open mind, but what is going on? Why is the mother contacting me 2 years later, and asking to speak to me, and meet me in person? Why me?

The two biggest lessons I learned from a very good therapist were 1) your guilt and discomfort are very much part of human biology, they are really primitive emotions and needing that parental approval is a leftover survival instinct. And 2) is a question she asked me - how many times do you go to the well and find out it is dry, before you accept that you&#039;re never going to get any water from it? If you can a certain that this is how she is, you can&#039;t change her, then that allows you to focus on what you can change, i.e. yourself and your situation.
