I know you can smoke seductively and you seem to imply that you mainly find it attractive when used in that way. Iow, a hot girl who would smoke hastily and routinely might not do it but if she\u2018d do it slowly and deliberately, it might? I don\u2018t think this has anything to do with you hating smoking outside of a sexual situation. I actually think it\u2018s more about the confidence of intentionally being sensual and seductive. Kind of the vibe of a woman knowing what she\u2018s doing and doing what she\u2018s doing on purpose to seduce? Might be an overarching desire to be tempted by the succubus archetype.

When she affirms that this is what she wants, get the condom on and ask if she is ready. If she seems hesitant, ask her if she wants to wait. Remember that this is a show of respect and an act of self-preservation, not fear. This is important because she (probably) does not want to see you nervous. This will make her uneasy and ruin your night.<br>11. Chances are you will either come too soon or lose your erection. Under no circumstances are you to tell her you are sorry. This shit happens. Your reaction should be: Oh well, these things happen. Let&#039;s make out some more. Don&#039;t just say this, mean it.<br>12.

ADHD often is comorbid with other conditions like PTSD (it makes sense, being undiagnosed means that chaos and bad experiences are plenty, especially if both parent and child have it, due to bad impulse control, frustration from not having your shit together, always being told &quot;you could achieve so much more if you just put in the effort&quot;, and a whole bucket list of shit undiagnosed ADHD leads to). The point being that meds usually help, but they&#039;re not gonna resolve stuff by themselves. If your doctor is like &quot;take these pills and be done with it&quot; he or she is frankly a shitty excuse for a doctor. Look into different things you can do yourself also; there&#039;s a great book by two doctors who are specialised in treating ADHD and have it themselves, so they have both the medical professionals&#039; and the patient&#039;s perspective. The book is &quot;ADHD 2.0&quot; by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey. If it IS adult ADHD in your case there&#039;s a lot that can be done about it, but finding a competent doctor can be a struggle.
