Baiting is that during the conversation about some item in the surroundings or whatever non-personal you drop little pieces of information about yourself which aren&#039;t too revealing, and where she would have to ask you a personal question to find out more. If she does that&#039;s a big indicator of interest, if she doesn&#039;t take the bait that&#039;s an indicator of disinterest. I had a date where I talked to a girl for over an hour and she didn&#039;t ask me anything personal the whole time, and most likely she was just in a social mood and wanted someone to talk to to kill time. An example of bait is something like &quot;When I was in South America I ate this dish made of x and it was the spiciest thing I&#039;ve ever eaten&quot;. If she just talks about something spicy she ate then she&#039;s not taking the bait. If she asks which country it was then she&#039;s taking the bait. He also says you might have to drop a few pieces of bait before she takes the bait.", "time": 1671460470, "resto": 27943447}, {"no": 27945927, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)09:40:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27944246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27944246</a><br>I made two contacts with guys in the smoking room of a club I think it was the time before last time I went to a club.

Also important to note is that I&#039;m kinda into that, but I haven&#039;t dared to let my parents know about that. They&#039;re fairly judgmental and shallow when it comes to appearances and other people in general. I&#039;ve heard how my own mom and sister judge this woman for her hair loss and I doubt they&#039;d want me to date her.<br>My question is how can I ask my mom to introduce me to this woman without outing myself to them? Is there any way or am I going to need to fight with them about this?

Honestly, I believe I have the potential to do it. But a few problems stand in the way:<br><br>1) I haven&#039;t made much music up to now. There&#039;s a few reasons for this - I&#039;m a perfectionist so if a song isn&#039;t great I&#039;m just never gonna do something with it. Plus for like ten years I had a misconception about songwriting - you can do it without fancy instruments or really anything. I spent all my teenage years not doing it because I assumed I didn&#039;t have the resources yet, when I totally did. So lately I&#039;ve finally started making music, but...<br>2) I&#039;m mentally ill. I can&#039;t enjoy stuff anymore, I don&#039;t feel emotions much, my energy is always low, my memory sucks, my circadian rhythm is really bad (insomnia), and so I can&#039;t really make music.

They are physically impossible and would be weird to look at if they did exist. Someone subjectively telling you that you&#039;re attractive is irrelevant to this. <br><br>The rating scale has nothing to do with subjective attraction. It&#039;s an objective measure of symmetry, racial features and genetics. It&#039;s used to communicate leagues. <br><br>The concept of someone who is 10/10 is a quite literally perfect.

She&#039;s not attractive to you. Same goes for you, it&#039;s just that womens idea of &quot;attractive&quot; tends to be more diverse than men. That&#039;s generally speaking, I know there are edge cases. <br><br>If your response to this is &quot;Well, I guess that just means that women think they&#039;re worth more than they are!&quot; or &quot;Standards are way to high nowadays, I shouldn&#039;t need to do all that just to attract someone!&quot; then you&#039;re destined to never change your situation.

While you&#039;re doing that, you should also be safeguarding any benefits that might be taken away from you if she makes good on her threat to get you fired, if there are any (for example, if the company provides matching contributions towards a retirement account, you could preemptively max that out).

Sex with the same person for the rest of your life is overrated. It&#039;s still valuable to experience a relationship with a woman who likes you back, at least just to experience the &quot;honeymoon phase&quot;. In your position, I would focus on chasing fame, money, great friends, and a passionate hobby. Don&#039;t waste too much time on finding &quot;love&quot;, so as to min-max what life has given you. You basically rolled a character who is optimal for chasing fame and money, and the women can come after this.

Don&#039;t think of it as being doomed to stay with her forever, divorce is still an option, but you should explore every other avenue that is available to you first (short of cheating) and genuinely try to fix things before you go down that path. If nothing works and you do end up getting divorced, your number one priority over EVERYTHING ELSE is still the well-being of your child. I don&#039;t care if the process of divorce left you hating the mother, you&#039;ll not insult her, demean her or try to torpedo her life or relationship with her child - you support her to support your child. I don&#039;t care if you have a nice dinner date set up with your new partner, if your child is having a stage play at school, you go - whether it&#039;s playing the lead role or a tree in the background.

And it was 2 AM.<br><br>im not sure. I won&#039;t post pictures for security reasons but when he came back 4 hours later, he was terribly angry. He even hit a concrete wall and jumped around the garage. Thats not his usual behaviour, cosplay aside he is a mature 29 years old<br><br>Today i was lurking Facebook and found out that a former classmate ex of his was raped the same night, she didnt recognized her attacker but he was extremely violent and did horrible things to her. The reason this consternes me is because that girl was part of a group of bullies that ganged up on him in highschool. The girl even pointed out it was a man dressed up in black. The only thing that reassures me is that she said she heard her attacker voice, if it had been my kid voice she would have recognized him. It cannot be him.

Firstly, you most likely have depression, which is warping how you perceive everything. If you are depressed, you don&#039;t realise your perception is being warped because depressed people always think they are extremely logical and objective. This is in fact an anti-cope, they have to believe this or the whole description of reality created by the depressed mind comes crashing down. So your first priority is ameliorating your depression. You can talk to a doctor, try some pills if you&#039;re up for it. Personally I found cognitive behavioural therapy the most useful approach in the long run. This can be with a therapist but there are also many books on this.<br>Secondly, sex has a special status in our culrure now, but on a biological level it&#039;s just a form of socialising, part of a spectrum of social activities of varying intimacy that humans naturally do. You can already socialise, we are socialising right now in a limited way. The more you socialise, the more you form relationships with people, the more likely it is that you will at some point have sex. I know you imagine that only the especially attractive or charismatic can have sex but this is objectively not true. Average guys have sex, fat guys have sex, even ugly guys have sex.<br><br>Work on your depression, work on socialising.

Try it.<br>The cruelty of nature is not lost on me. It is not fair, but my logical side took over when I began accepting my situation. It hurt emotionally, to be invalidated by them, but they (females) will never change. For that reason, I tried to accept the situation as hard and fast as possible. In the way that you ignore cold weather, or the rain, or a delay in traffic; that is how I ignore what they(females) say and do. Not in a malicious way, but being objective. Incel, creep, ugly, loser, etc. What&#039;s the difference? It&#039;s all the same. Every man has a logical side, and a/multiple [priority]. We still adapt.

It was Hell. <br><br>OP, for the love of fuck hear my words I type to you now. You&#039;re half-right. There&#039;s a reason you feel a &#039;relationship&#039; will save you from your misery. That much is true. But it is NOT with others. You are called to have a better relationship TO YOURSELF. Focus on that as much as possible! It took me decades to sort this out for myself. This is the fucking key that khvs and incels keep missing, over and over. Some of them never find it and end up dead. Others end up in their 50&#039;s and bitterly hating themselves for never seeing about finding this key. And that key is: Develop a better relationship to yourself. Forgive yourself. Accept yourself. Love yourself. If you don&#039;t, you will remain in perpetual self-prophesied misery.<br><br>God bless", "time": 1671457568, "resto": 27939705}, {"no": 27945718, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)08:48:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27945687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27945687</a><br>Man a lot of people have been out of work these last couple years and I&#039;d fucking kill to have the type of career that some of you talk about because all I&#039;m getting is fucking jobs.
