I\u2019m kind of worried she may have hooked up with some female inmates or corrections officers in prison. How likely is it do you think she would have cheated on me? Should I be mad at her if she did considering she was in prison by herself? How could I even begin to ask her or find out it happened?", "filename": "004FEED8-974E-4482-AEAD-289E21D7B710", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1422, "h": 908, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 159, "tim": 1672551578331237, "time": 1672551578, "md5": "lkWu8hYf5sM/MvRiMLJ06g==", "fsize": 259093, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "my-wife-went-to-prison-last-year-for-a-dui-and", "replies": 18, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 15}, {"no": 28021866, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:42:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28021858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021858</a><br>A woman fooling around with another woman isn&#039;t cheating. lmao", "time": 1672551747, "resto": 28021858}, {"no": 28021894, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:48:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28021858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021858</a><br>She&#039;s already cheated on you...

Only thing is she has a really nice ass which she is always sticking out at work which gets alot of attention from other guys. Idk if she is an exhibishionist or she just can&#039;t find jeans that fit properly and loves to get a workout while she bends at work. Either way a good belting and spanking should fix her.

Embrace the trials you face, don&#039;t let the lessons slip past you, and don&#039;t let the lies of failure or success fool you into the idea that there&#039;s a final conclusion you&#039;ll someday find.

I&#039;m absolutely 100% not alone in having grown into my looks/body/all of that, but I think I have better perspective and a better ability to articulate what I&#039;ve seen than most guys. When you&#039;re younger every interaction you have with hot girls is framed through the lens of being a hunter trying to &quot;secure&quot; something. Most young guys, even ones who think they&#039;re well intentioned/romantic, want to &quot;secure&quot; something steady so they don&#039;t have to keep hunting. Unfortunately when you&#039;re younger most of the truly attractive girls aren&#039;t as into you. Older guys will tell you to &quot;stop caring&quot;, or even just to outright be an asshole. What they really mean (and struggle to communicate I think) is that you need to stop caring about the outcome. Girls have a sixth sense for that. If they catch a whiff that you&#039;re that invested in the outcome of you guys dating it&#039;s a huge turnoff. Unfortunately it&#039;s a difficult thing to turn off, and I have found that really the only way to get over that hump is to just date/fuck a lot of girls until you get to the point where your brain accepts the idea that &quot;this isn&#039;t the last girl&quot;. I&#039;ve fucked around 25-30 girls and seriously dated maybe 8 or 9. At this point I just don&#039;t really care and I think the only real value in any of it is as a sort of trophy that you flex. Relationships are kind of pointless outside of that assuming you have game (or money in the case of this thread).

At least for me, anyway, the only future I see for myself as long as I know the ease of just paying a chick and getting right into it is impregnating an escort. It destroys the mindset you need to go out there and talk to a normal healthy regular chick. Because not only is her BRAGGING about other people to you she knows BORING in comparison to how some escort got abused or stole shit,she(and many OTHER women) are going to be stringing you along and you won&#039;t be getting the regular sex straight out of hentai that you want while still maintaining your weaboo hobbies.

Until that hour is over, make the most out of it by stretching your body, doing some workouts -- do anything that will make the rest of the 23 hours just slightly better -- this means sitting down for a few minutes to write a plan for what you&#039;re going to do for the rest of the day, or to reflect on all you&#039;ve done today and all you plan to do tomorrow, is also productive. You decide what is important to do. Use that time you set aside to do something productive to ease your biggest worry, maybe, see a doctor. <br><br>Throughout your journey you&#039;re going to have people telling you what to do. They will give you purpose and direction through god or some incomprehensible idea that they believe you should experience in order to &quot;become better&quot;, but it doesn&#039;t seem like you&#039;re that type of person. Perhaps an ascetic approach will do you some good. You are being tempered by the vagaries of your journey. Our definition of happiness and how it is attained, or contented, will continue to change as we go through life. My point in all this is, perhaps it&#039;s time to seek inward.", "filename": "1672447035555945", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 534, "h": 534, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1672552193953447, "time": 1672552193, "md5": "IxFM/zb/KXhXpoADj/V7fw==", "fsize": 20258, "resto": 28021777}, {"no": 28021931, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:55:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28021777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021777</a><br>James ferraro is that you?", "time": 1672552539, "resto": 28021777}, {"no": 28021935, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)00:56:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28021902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021902</a><br>You are very smart and nice.", "time": 1672552583, "resto": 28021777}, {"no": 28021971, "now": "01/01/23(Sun)01:02:21", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28021886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021886</a><br><a href=\"#p28021886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28021886</a><br>Well truthfully, I&#039;ve been trying to get back into games to provide some positive sense of mental structure.

You&#039;re making a move, a move you think has a future in it, a risk to be sure, but a risk made in the name of doing something you think is worth doing. I can tell you that, no matter the result, failure or success, or somewhere in between, fighting and trying for something you think is worthwhile will never be wrong. My mom used to tell me something I never believed growing up, and it was: &quot;we&#039;ll figure it out, we&#039;ll make it work&quot;, and I always thought that was just a coping mechanism for the hardships we faced, but getting older I only find it to be more true every year. You can find a million reasons not to do something if you want to, but what we&#039;re so often bereft of is reasons TO do something, and once you find something you really want to do, think should be done, and believe in yourself to do, then everything else is just a problem to solve so that you can. You can find work if you try. You can get over the debt if you try. You might not know just how yet, but if you want what you&#039;re trying for, you&#039;ll figure it out, you&#039;ll make it work.<br><br><br>The only thing you&#039;ll regret at the end of the day is doing nothing, not trying, not taking a chance on yourself.

At some point I washed my hands for HOURS at a time. After getting home, after shitting. During that time if I went against anything, like the sink, I had to start over. Otherwise I&#039;d get sick. Or at least that&#039;s what I thought. I even used dishwashing liquid and my hands were so dry they would literally crack and bleed. Couldn&#039;t put lotion/cream on them as well, that would make me wash my hands again lmao. That really fucked up my day to day life. Luckily it&#039;s better now, meaning I don&#039;t wash them for hours at a time, but still have the feeling of them being dirty and having to wash them, just for a shorter period of time. I can&#039;t eat something with my hands if they&#039;re not 100% clean and I find it disgusting how people can do that or even not wash their hands after using the bathroom. I wont eat something if i think it has been &quot;contaminated&quot;, ie touched by someone with dirty hands. I also have a sacred area: my computer&#039;s keyboard and mouse. Hands have to be clean for me to touch those. If I for example touch my phone, I have to wash my hands before using the computer again<br>But you asked about other obsessions. I for some time had something very similar to you, I was constantly reinstalling OS and programs because I felt that I had gotten some shit on my computer from somewhere, even though the probability of that was close to zero. I also only use free and open source software so I am not tracked etc, so that goes under that umbrella as well.<br>Minor stuff has been like checking alarms a shitton so I don&#039;t sleep in, but I think the two I mentioned before are the biggest pains for me.

Ultimately, I think you are right. I wasn\u2019t raised in a religious household and from this I do not traditionally observe as I should be. I do feel pathetic at times but these urges are just tough to deal with. Im around women all the time through work alone in addition to say going out with friends. I wish I didn\u2019t have to deal with this bullshit but part of me feels that I am too far gone even though I know that\u2019s not the case. The reality is is that deep down I do want to embrace this life. The confidence and ego boost I get from attracting women is like a drug for me. I feel that I need it. I should be stopping these urges altogether and should try to going to church. It\u2019s just tough as I live a life that I feel requires me to do the things that I do in order to function. Like I said in a previous post I need a source for my mojo and I only ever got it from validation from the opposite sex but I should try to find validation elsewhere where I am still able to maintain my mojo. I grew up near a large city and with that grew up with all of the innate temptations that come with it ie a debaucherous lifestyle. I learned how to socialize very well early on and especially with women and I have always depended on the source of my power from their validation. I wish I can change and hope I do but again it\u2019s hard if you lived the life I have lived. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from the country where things are black and white and you were lucky enough to have a family and support structure that were religiously observant. All I can tell you is to cherish that as in this shitty gay world were living in its becoming far more uncommon with each passing year.<br><br>I can understand your judgmental approach of course and appreciate what you have posted but try to understand that everyone doesn\u2019t share the same experiences and that we are formed by the people around us.

I realized that a big portion of my search for God was completely misguided (and thus my faith stunted) because I thought religion had to do with being a good person. Then it became a quest of finding the perfect philosophy, the perfect mysticism, the perfect politics, etc., to repair an utterly broken society. It was such a prideful, silly, and vain venture, even if society forces you to care about the impossible. No, you don&#039;t have to be religious to be a good person, at least in the eyes of society.

I realized that I could never be the perfect person I wanted to be in the eyes of God, yet nothing else short of that flame would ever satisfy me either.

I don&#039;t consider biblical Christianity a religion, it is more like just the only perfect way of life. The only way to be free from the wickedness of this world. <br><br>If you really want to see the power of God though, and the truth of Jesus Christ, you have to actually believe it and do what He told us to do. So repenting and getting baptized in Jesus&#039; name is mandatory, and you have to actually believe that receiving the Holy Spirit is real or else you&#039;ll never receive Him. <br><br>It also helps to believe the truth about the nature of God. He is one person, not three. Jesus said that the Father is the only true God (John 17:3), and the scripture says that in Him (Jesus Christ) dwells all the fullness of the Godhead (deity) bodily (Colossians 2:8-9). So Jesus Christ is the incarnation of God, not a second co-eternal, co-equal person. Also, since we know that the only true God is the Father, and that the Father is Holy (Leviticus 19:2), and that He is a spirit (John 4:24), we can therefore deduce that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the one true God, not a third co-equal, co-eternal person. So there is one God, who is one person.<br><br>You don&#039;t have to understand that to have a true faith, but it is really important that you know what God you&#039;re serving. If you don&#039;t get it or don&#039;t agree about that particular point, don&#039;t let that stop you from continuing to seek God in spirit and in truth.<br><br>Like I said, I did all the philosophy stuff, searching for the truth/meaning of life over the last nearly 3 years.

I&#039;ve been running an experiment this year regarding interacting with strangers. The idea was to compliment five strangers a week. If a conversation occurred organically, I would continue it. If not, I would tell them to have a nice day.<br><br>TL;DR: Conquer anxiety by directly addressing it, realize you have more to gain than lose, be polite, expect nothing, receive gracefully. People are more likely to want to interact with you then you think. Build confidence and the world <br>opens up to you.<br><br>This is week 52 of the year, that means I&#039;ve had 260 experiences with completely new people. Of all of those experiences, two were negative, three were neutral, and 255 have been positive. 202 interactions have been with women, the rest with men.<br><br>On location - All of these notes are from approaching people in parks, coffee shops, concerts, and on the street in metro areas. There is very little to lose in the aforementioned locations. At church, work, or other large social gatherings that you frequent, the stakes are a little higher but worst case, something gets awkward and it blows over in a week or two. Always be respectful and give people space if it does go sour.<br><br>On approach - I tend to first make eye contact with someone, then smile real big, and begin conversation with &#039;excuse me&#039; or &#039;pardon me&#039; and then give a simple compliment.
