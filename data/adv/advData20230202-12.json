But would you ever respect an ox? Think of it as superior? Of course not, ridiculous. The cattle is only there to work itself down to the bone in service to its masters.<br><br>And that&#039;s what men are for. To die and sacrifice themselves for the sake of a woman&#039;s safety and well being, be it at work or in war. That&#039;s all they can do. God knows they&#039;re worthless for emotional support, or for raising children, or even making children in the first place.

A man is like a crude hammer: to be thrown away once it&#039;s broken.<br><br>And there&#039;s no need to pity, or god forbid, respect them for their sacrifices. It&#039;s simply their nature and purpose to go out and ruin their bodies and minds to ensure the survival of the species, and the safety of us women and our children. That&#039;s the part that MRAS and incels don&#039;t get: they think it&#039;s a great injustice that men experience less love, that they do all the hardest and dangerous jobs, that they commit more suicides, that they get left behind, abandoned or sacrificed first thing during a war or a catastrophe.

My first time hitting on a girl seemed to work out and I&#039;m not great looking and I didn&#039;t get hung up on it (IMPORTANT NOTE: BUT MAYBE I AM \u2013 it was the one and only time I actually made a move on someone) and we both moved on \u2013 the girl hopefully had a nicer day and I think it was a successful, nice first experience. I think OP anon should more or less do the same. But, with the addendum, that since they work in the same area, he should probably try to avoid her afterwards to avoid any more possibilities of obsession.

I believe that to get out of depression, tiredness, fatigue and all that shit, you first have to work your body, since a healthy body is a healthy mind, for that it is good to do sports, whatever it is. it is as long as it keeps our body busy. Another important factor is studying, it doesn&#039;t really matter what, it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s for university, school or for yourself, you have to do it to keep your mind occupied with something productive. I would also say that looking for a job, or generating income with a startup, as this will keep our mind and body busy, while giving us money, in itself gives us a reason to keep going, especially when you are working on something of your own.<br><br>Another important point is to stop comparing yourself to others, stop thinking that the other is better than you because you have more knowledge, money or physical condition. It is also very silly to think about issues such as superiority or inferiority, we are all human, we all have problems and difficulties in life, of course there are degrees of this, but this does not have to be a limitation. You have to focus on yourself, on your problems, on your virtues, on your life, and not on that of others.<br><br>Another issue is guilt and remorse, which depending on the person can be the easiest part, or difficult to overcome, because it is easy to forgive others, but sometimes it is difficult, if not impossible, to forgive yourself. No matter how dirty your hands are, they can always be cleaned. You have to accept your sins, accept what you did wrong and live with it. Go to a priest, a psychologist, or tell someone you trust what you did, this can help, it doesn&#039;t matter if you think psychology is a joke, or if you don&#039;t believe in God, the important thing is to somehow get the weight off What are you wearing.", "filename": "b3d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 657, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1674863961876206, "time": 1674863961, "md5": "/ckkLToCRMe9uKIXDVDZTA==", "fsize": 38305, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-this-thread-we-are-going-to-look-for-the-cure", "replies": 151, "images": 19, "unique_ips": 66, "tail_size": 50}, {"no": 28216874, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)18:59:55", "name": "OP", "com": "My least favorite part of this thread is going to a psychiatrist and being prescribed medication, which in itself sucks.

A buttoned blouse, which could be just as well be worn in an office, something that you can unbutton to reveal as much as you&#039;re comfortable with and can roll the sleeves up on to reveal arm accessories. A v-neck shirt, a pair of jeans, solid colour socks and underwear. A thin sweater you can layer on if it gets a bit chilly. Sensible clothes that provide utility. <br>Your most expensive items of clothing, just like a man&#039;s, oughta be the shoes and a coat. Women have the option of high heels on their feet, while their jackets can be a bit more bold with different cuts, shapes, colours and patterns.<br><br>Then you can fuck around with all the accessories. Nice jewellery, ribbons, hair ties, rings, piercings, nail paint, scarves, hats, pins, flowers.<br><br>Basically, unless you&#039;re doing some kooky runway show or are some massive whore that&#039;d be just as happy running naked, you just have to try nail down the generic NPC look and change up one or two things that stand out.", "time": 1675326454, "resto": 28252140}, {"no": 28253914, "now": "02/02/23(Thu)03:54:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Thanks for all the wonderful tips.

The federal age of consent&#039;s 18 and when states disagree about age of consent, the higher age takes precedence. There&#039;s no Romeo in Juliet law in California anyway, so this means since you&#039;re 19 and she&#039;s underage, regardless of your personal opinion, from the state&#039;s perspective the relationship is abnormal and illegal.<br><br>Now, liking a 16 year old as a normal human being in the sense that you want to fuck them? That&#039;s pretty normal, at least broadly in the US, and the age of consent being 16 in most US states reflects this.<br><br>In the situation you&#039;ve described though, separate from the legal question? It seems really abnormal. I think with this kind of age gap, your distance to the other person&#039;s is crucial for it to not be weird, and it gets weirder the more you have to go out of the way to make the relationship work. For example, if you were actively going to the same school when you started dating, I&#039;d totally get it, that&#039;d be a rising senior dating a sophomore. If you found out online that she lived in the same city as you, you met up, and you didn&#039;t know her age then? It&#039;d be much weirder, but I could at least understand it. But if you&#039;re in college now or working, and you&#039;re still going after high school chicks either in person or online, you know she&#039;s a high school chick, and you&#039;re still pursuing despite finding out she literally lives across the entire country from you where it&#039;d be illegal?<br><br>That&#039;s some wild to-catch-a-predator shit.

That is, they are less likely to either take them seriously or aim to have a unique and lasting relationship with their spouse. Even if they claim to take relationships seriously, the fact is that they&#039;re willing to be intimate without commitment and with multiple people (because the point of cohabiting for the ones who claim it&#039;s out of seriousness is to test compatibility--presumably so they can cohabit again if they find something they don&#039;t like). That such people are also more willing to leave a relationship isn&#039;t surprising, since everything they do reflects a mindset that doesn&#039;t prioritize commitment.<br><br>Second, cohabiting creates inertia. If you&#039;ve already been living together, mingling finances, and even had kids before getting married, you&#039;ve made it much easier to slide into a marriage you never really wanted in the first place, because a formal marriage doesn&#039;t change much. Whereas if you live apart and don&#039;t do anything reckless (like having a kid out of wedlock), getting married is very much a conscious commitment and a major change in one&#039;s life on its own. It&#039;s much harder to just sleepwalk into a marriage this way.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you think it&#039;s because the former group probably tends to be religious and therefore already biased against divorce</span><br>Not primarily, no. The &quot;religious, therefore no divorce&quot; argument is simplistic and often just wrong. Religions DO tend to emphasize following certain rules, like sexual restraint, which just so happen to improve the outcomes of the relationships people have. The effect holds even after controlling for religion: those who wait until marriage both divorce less AND have happier marriages.

During that initial year, couples that did not live together first are at higher risk for divorce.

He is so smart and eloquent, incredibly witty and just unafraid of being who he is. I had so much fun talking to him, and I always found myself wanting more of him. I loved listening to him talk about his passions, and argue with him, and discuss with him things we both loved. <br>When we started talking about more personal matters, I just fell in love with him. I wasn&#039;t doing very well at the time and the pain was incredibly isolating, but I never felt alone after I met him. He understands me and I never felt like I had to hide my pain from him, and he confides in me and trusts me. We shared so much, so quickly and I just couldn&#039;t help but fall in love. He&#039;s such a beautiful person. We both were so driven to better ourselves through our relationship with one another.<br>He&#039;s really kind, compassionate, generous, and he has some purity about him that I rarely see in people. <br>Over time I just fell in love with him more. I love how dorky he is, and how much fun everything becomes when he&#039;s with me. He&#039;ll always match my kinda silly and mischievous energy, and it just feels great to have someone who will be silly with me. I will never get over the way he will grab me and dance with me in the kitchen, or how he sings to himself when he&#039;s grilling. I admire his relationship with his family. I feel lucky that he will always spoil me, and that he never makes me feel like I&#039;m insane if I share with him one of my many anxieties. I love how grateful he is for me, and how thoughtful and dedicated he is to our relationship. He&#039;s incredibly loving, romantic and affectionate and I&#039;m so lucky to have a man who loves me the way he does.

True and life-long happiness comes from a combination of three things: social connections, meaningful struggle, and an attractive location. Almost every happy person today is just compensating their happiness by overachieving in one of these three areas. Either they depend on an incredible amount of social connections and constant communication, do an inhuman amount of community work outside of their normal job, or exist in a place that provides constant pleasurable factors. For example, a person may choose to put in a fuck ton of effort to go to bars or community events constantly, or one may get stuck in a tiktok dopamine cycle, or they may be working to get a promotion, making them think their work is meaningful. This is a draining way to live, and only leads to burnout and greater dips in mental health. There should always be the opportunity to live these three factors of happiness without the chance of overwork and burnout.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is not the default state of humanity or the world</span><br>It more resembles the default state of how we lived naturally many thousands of years ago, but just with more technology<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I dont want to work</span><br>I guess so, but I&#039;m more just advocating for meaningful and community-centered work opportunities rather than the shitty soulless corporate work we&#039;ve all been sold into thinking is right and normal.
