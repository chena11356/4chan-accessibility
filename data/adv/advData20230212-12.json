Technically, I was having my cake and eating it too. However, after about 1.5 months, my ex developed a crush on her coworker. 2 more months went by before the guy asked her out and they hooked up. She told me we could no longer be intimate. At this time, I was still hooking up with my ex and a girl or two a week.

Abusers tend to put in the mind of their victims that they are whiners, weak minds that just complain too, that they have to be stronger, that, in fact, it is for their own good. Always good to be stronger, right? Makes sense. Except when it&#039;s used to supress one&#039;s rightful emotions. Years later here you are, still unsure, because someone put in your head that what you felt was no valid. Again, it&#039;s typical in cases of abuse. They&#039;ll teach you your feelings aren&#039;t valid and try to rewrite history in your mind, they will blame their own problems (real ones, you know, not like yours) to justify their behaviour, and they will condition you into ignoring yourself. How do you expect to be able to move on from something painful if you don&#039;t even feel entitled to acknowledge the pain it causes you? Abusers all do the same. Largely predictable group people. They go little by little, increasing your tolerance to abusive behaviours. Of course as a child you can&#039;t do shit about it, but as an adult you have choices, you can protect yourself. Seeing a therapist is a good idea. Say it all.

With your condition being as it is I would try to rule them out altogether. In this situation your endocrine has become somewhat pathological and it&#039;s probably an entire environment&#039;s worth of factors that have brought this state about.<br><br>The endocrine system is a network of organs throughout the body all of which work to maintain a hormonal homeostasis. If even one of these organs is in stress it stresses the rest of them out as well and if the environmental issues are not resolved a pathological homeostasis takes form which creates a normal state of unhealth. The problem, once this happens, is that to break an existing homeostasis requires a sharp shock to it. So you may have to make some drastic changes in order to turn things around.<br><br>Here are a few of them, there are more but these are the most important:<br><br>Vitamin D3 deficiency is a worldwide epidemic. Vitamin D is not really a vitamin, it&#039;s a prohormone and it plays myriad of roles throughout the entirety of our organism. You may want to get a blood test which tests for both the active and inactive form of vitamin D to see where your levels really are. Regardless, with most people being deficient I strongly suggest supplementing with 5000-10,000IU a day especially during the winter and the times where you&#039;re not getting sunlight. Vitamin D3 should be taken with K2 as vitamin K2 ensures that the vitamin-d associated calcium ends up where it&#039;s needed and not in the areas where it can induce trouble. As for a supplement, I recommend the Dr. Berg brand as it&#039;s the cheapest combo with U.S. made ingredients.", "time": 1676082338, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320800, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:26:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320794</a><br>The liver is a secondary organ in the endocrine system but its role should not be written off. When you take NSAIDs regularly, which is particularly common for women with painful menstrual cycles, you begin to deteriorate your liver&#039;s capacity. Since you&#039;re having so many recurring migraines I can only imagine how often you rely on these to get through the day. To stop taking them is probably not an option, nor would I want you to suffer. But what you should do is chase every NSAID with at least 600mg of N-Acetyl-Cysteine, preferably Pure Encapsulations brand as they&#039;re a U.S. manufacturer that doesn&#039;t use Chinese ingredients. NAC helps replete the master antioxidant glutathione within your liver which NSAIDs rapidly deplete. Chronic use of NSAIDs will keep your liver in a perpetual state of unhealth by suppressing glutathione levels which can, over time, exacerbate and further allow this pathological homeostasis of your endocrine system to persist.<br><br>From what I&#039;m observing based off what you have provided you are expressing multiple symptoms of estrogen dominance. This can be overcome but to break the current homeostasis requires a shock. The strongest shock you can provide, in my opinion, is fasting. I think a 3 a day water fast every month for 4-6 months might be exactly what you need to start recovering. If you are the type of person that eats three meals a day you may want to work yourself to one meal a day before going for a three day fast. To go from three meals a day to no meals a day is really difficult for people doing their first multi-day fast. You can do it, it&#039;s just more stress on the body than it would be if you were already eating one meal a day.", "time": 1676082399, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320807, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:27:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320800</a><br><br>Second, you&#039;re going to want to get an intracellular magnesium and potassium test as these are the electrolytes that are most often related to estrogen dominance and glandular function. You need to specifically ask for an intracellular test for these electrolytes as they are intracellular electrolytes (98-99% are within your cells). If you rely upon a blood serum test you&#039;re not going to be able to adequately diagnose a deficiency until its in its latest stages. For some, magnesium can make migraines worse so use caution with them. I would start with magnesium glycinate and then work from there if that form of Mg induces migraines. Try to find a form of magnesium that does not stimulate migraines if you can, don&#039;t give up if the first brand/type you try induces them. For potassium I recommend buying Dr. Berg&#039;s electrolyte powder as it has 1000mg of potassium (4,700mg is the recommended daily intake) per scoop. It&#039;s the most affordable way to supplement with potassium that I have found. Most potassium in the diet comes from vegetables so you may want to try to figure out how much you need to supplement with to ensure you&#039;re meeting your dietary requirement. <br><br>Third thing you&#039;re going to want to do is clear the body out of heavy metals which you have been accumulating throughout your life. The safest way to do this is by way of Modified Citrus Pectin. 5mg/3x/day for 1 month (PectaSol / Econeugenics brand) should clear the majority of what can be cleared out minus what has been sequestered in bone of course.

Bottled water inevitably leaches chemicals from the plastics even if it&#039;s a BPA-free plastic. I recommend dropping money on a distilled water system and adding your own trace minerals to it or using electrolyte powders to get the needed electrolytes. The brand of distiller I recommend is the My Pure Water brand:<br><br>https://mypurewater.com/shop/mini-c<wbr>lassic-ct-distiller/<br><br>I own this one myself and it&#039;s a great machine; it&#039;s easy to maintain and only requires a once a month cleaning to keep going. If you&#039;re making soups, broths or use water for boiling to make rice/pasta then I would also invest in an undersink filter to filter out your municipal water, especially fluoride which is notorious for wreaking havoc to the endocrine system (I&#039;ll get to fluoride more in a second). The system I use is this one: <br><br>https://www.amazon.com/Frizzlife-SK<wbr>99-NEW-Certified-Chlorine-Chloramin<wbr>e/dp/B08NDYVZV5/<br><br>As for fluoride, I would immediately stop using fluoride toothpastes. I would also be mindful of any canned foods packed in water (often packed in municipal fluoridated water) and if you can get a flouride-rated shower filter that would be helpful as well. The problem with fluoride is that it accumulates as it&#039;s readily retained at a rate of 35% - 50% of that which is ingested (younger people retaining more than adults). And when fluoride gets retained it gets sequestered in bone. The presence of iodine triggers its release and removal and there has been some brewing hypotheses regarding using iodine as a way of treating long-term fluoride toxicity.", "time": 1676082521, "resto": 28318791}, {"no": 28320819, "now": "02/10/23(Fri)21:29:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28320641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28320641</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m pretty sure the director would never admit to that</span><br>How have you not seen the video?

When people say high-school is the best time of your life, include the couple of years after high school when you&#039;re just having fun with your friends and learning life. Even if you&#039;re on struggle street for a little, as long as your friends are hard-up as well it really isn&#039;t an issue because you all manage together. Bonus points if you have a goal during this time like finishing university.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;moving out with strangers</span><br>60/40, if you get a good house it can be almost as good as above, if you get shitty housemates you&#039;ll be more miserable than when you&#039;re at home.

Rent is way too much and you&#039;re going to struggle until you&#039;re earning properly. If you can&#039;t do what you want while living with your parents (either too far away or too strict parents) then this can still be okay but it&#039;s not a care-free lifestyle since you&#039;ve got such high overheads with rent and bills.

He is in the UK (married at the time) and I&#039;m in Australia (long term relationship). He means the absolute world to me as I do him.<br>Anyways, Last year we finally met irl and spent 3 weeks together and had the most amazing time getting to know each other for real and not through a screen. The only issue I had at the time was that the wife kept calling and using the kids as an excuse to call and would constantly message him - at home she would never even notice he was there which was why I came into the picture. Fast forward to now and he has left her and seperated and is about to file for divorce but obviously she&#039;s prolonging the financial side of things (she sits at home and does nothing white he works to support her and the kids). <br><br>My question is, in a few months he wants to come back here but I&#039;m not sure if enough time has passed where the crazy ex won&#039;t use the kids to still annoy him. He said he would only answer necessary texts and talk to the kids when they are at his parents house. Obviously I can&#039;t expect him to do this because they are his kids and come first. <br>Do I just flat out tell him no and to see how this pans out in the long run? Or get him to come and hope it all goes well? <br><br>Backstory on why he left her? Shes manipulative and controlling and has controlled every aspect of him/their lives since they where both 16 years old. They married at 19, she manipulated him into having kids a year later and turning 30 was huge for him and he grew a backbone and realised that how he lived his life was literally like being in a prison and now that he&#039;s free, he&#039;s happy and learning more about himself in the process.

The last few times she&#039;s asked me what music I&#039;m listening to and we have a quick chat before the bus leaves. <br><br>Today, she pulled up driving a different bus than the one I wanna get one. She looked at me and smiled and nodded. I was standing on the outside just watching because it wasn&#039;t my bus. She then noticed that two older people weren&#039;t getting off and asked if they needed help. They insisted on help and were kind of being rude it seemed. While she was trying to help them gather their stuff she looked at me and made a face like &quot;can you believe this?&quot; and then later looked at me again and laughed. So I feel like at some level there&#039;s a more personable vibe here. <br><br>I don&#039;t know her name. I know nothing about her besides she&#039;s extremely friendly.

An LSD trip is a little over twice as long as a mushroom trip. LSD feels a little more energetic to me while mushrooms feel a little more sedative and usually bring on a little nausea. A half gram of mushrooms or a half hit of acid are probably going to be pretty manageable doses for someone, even a first timer, doing this alone.<br>What you definitely need to keep in mind is to not do these kinds of drugs often. They can seriously change you, and if you keep doing these drugs often without having spent enough time integrating those changes then you can easily fry your brain. People online like to recommend you wait at least two weeks to trip again purely for the sake of tolerance, but I honestly think you should wait at least a month or more between trips.<br>That being said, I also think you can trip for purely recreational reasons and will likely have some fun with these experiences alongside your intended reason for taking them.", "time": 1676184762, "resto": 28325365}, {"no": 28329825, "now": "02/12/23(Sun)01:52:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28329794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28329794</a><br>Yeah but you probably won&#039;t feel shit.

If you work 23 hours a day or 1 hour a day, if your emunah and bitachon are enough, you will earn the same thing. How can this be possible? Imagine you earn 60k now, then find a job that pays you 120k. HaShem can make it so your expenses leave you in debt, while in the previous job you were able to save money.

Stuff will go wrong so you basically spend some time reading up or watching youtube videos and then apply that knowledge on the weekends. During the week you observe. Repeat till you have your own little balanced ecosystem. I keep very little fish so the water doesn&#039;t get filled with waste and I don&#039;t have to clean very often. Maybe 30-45 minutes every two weeks to change water and clean the glass. You can also just get fancy shrimp like pic, a few in a tank will pretty much just feed themselves forever and produce very little waste. There&#039;s also more pet type aquatic animals you can get like a big ole crayfish or cichlids. You could have a tank with just that one and a few fish you take care of.

The exams aren&#039;t bad at all, for me they all take place the same day as class so I would have been anyways. Above all though I remind myself I&#039;m just here to satisfy my desire to learn and not jump through the academic hoops for a degree.

Especially since my PC has ended up pissing me off more than ever, I wanna make the most out of my life, and to a lesser extent I wanna maybe be a bit more interesting, if that doesn&#039;t sound more sad than it did in my head?<br><br>So my question, how exactly is the best way to find more hobbies to enjoy, and keep myself motivated with others? <br><br>To list a couple examples of the hobbies with little motivation:<br><br>Exercise/weight loss: This year I wanted to make my year to finally lean down, but I never ended up getting to it, for the reasons listed above but also i&#039;ve held things off due to a messy area. Cleaning this room again tomorrow, and hopefully after that i&#039;ll finally get a session in at least once a week.<br><br>Music/drawing/other art: These are a bit different but the reason for why is pretty much the same. Every composition I come up with or every sketch I draw looks like trash, I have zero confidence in it, and then I end up trashing it.<br><br>Anime/game/media consumption: This one I chalk up to procrastination and nothing really exciting me anymore, but moreso procrastination.<br><br>For a couple i&#039;ve wanted to get into:<br><br>Reading: I just don&#039;t know where to start, how to find anything else I wanna read. I don&#039;t wanna be stuck with a couple manga I picked up, I wanna read traditional literature as well.<br><br>Yeah that was the only one on the top of my head.<br><br>Also, if anyone has any recommendations for others, i&#039;m happy to hear what you have to offer, if you need to ask anything to figure it out, ask away.", "filename": "196854533", "ext": ".png", "w": 849, "h": 474, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 139, "tim": 1676156084859501, "time": 1676156084, "md5": "OOkPnMRX6kLs1XAapDDTRA==", "fsize": 491327, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-do-i-put-an-end-to-my-boring-life", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 28327206, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)18:04:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28327120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28327120</a><br>First of all, your mindset is wrong.<br><br>Its not about &quot;finding motivation&quot;.

There was so much stuff I wanted to do but it took effort and wasting time being online was so much more &quot;relaxing&quot;. It screws you over in the long run though. Honestly the best way to do your hobbies is literally to just do them. Don&#039;t give any thought to how much better it would be if &quot;I just skipped today/ I&#039;ll do it tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>With regards to exercising, I&#039;ve found that once you incorporate it into your weekly routine it&#039;s harder not to do it. I go to my uni gym between classes. But what do you do if you don&#039;t have breaks? Make time: wake up earlier and go to bed late. I know it&#039;s a pain in the behind and it will feel like hell at first, but that only lasts for the first week or so. After that you&#039;ll start enjoying going more and more. Plus if you make friends there it will be even better. I don&#039;t know your eating habits, but try to eat less pre-made meals and cook more often. It helps.<br><br>For reading, read some popular books until you figure out the genre/topics you like. You don&#039;t even have to read for hours at a time, just say 15 minutes before bed. A good way to find what book to read is just google &quot;books about x&quot;. I also use goodreads to find books similar to the ones I enjoy.<br><br>For drawing and music I haven&#039;t had any personal experience with them but my advice is the same: to just do it.<br><br>I know it seems like doing all of this is a huge hurdle to cross right now but ask yourself: do you wish you&#039;d started all these hobbies 6 months ago? If you did, imagine all the progress you would have made by now. <br><br>But it&#039;s not like you&#039;re out of time. Start now and you will thank yourself 6 months from now.

Waiting until marriage is a good thing, and it\u2019s doable for both men and women without cheap loopholes like porn. Porn today is unfortunately very widespread, but that doesn\u2019t mean you just need to accept what you feel is wrong. If it\u2019s important enough to you to be a dealbreaker, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about sticking to your standards.<br><br>This being said, you should consider the kinds of guys you\u2019re going for. Those who independently want to wait until marriage are showing you that they share a lot of your values, rather than just going along with them like your bf did (since he initially pressured you, showing he expects sex outside of marriage). Guys who have a past of sex outside of marriage, or who pressure you for it, are less likely to be either willing or able to not only wait but also quit porn, because they\u2019re already starting from a belief that something as intimate as sex shouldn\u2019t just be with their spouse. <br>Like another guy ITT, I have to admit to using, even being addicted to, porn, although not while in a relationship. Still, I admit it\u2019s a flaw, and I came to that conclusion because I want to wait until marriage. It\u2019s not the same thing as sex, but it\u2019s a devaluation of intimacy, and it\u2019s very easy to see why a woman wouldn\u2019t be happy with it. Point being, guys who already value waiting/monogamy should be more motivated to not watch (or at least quit watching) porn in a relationship.", "time": 1676170460, "resto": 28326284}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28328880, "now": "02/11/23(Sat)21:52:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Literally every other dream I have is about wanting to get back with or get attention from my high school ex.
