If it is then intermittent fasting with a no refined sugar, low carb diet may provide some benefit. Thiamine supplementation, along with the other B-Complex vitamins, may help as well as these vitamins are necessary for proper adrenal health. Two teaspoons of non-fortified organic nutritional yeast mixed with almond butter may be a good habit to start your mornings as it contains most of the B vitamins your adrenals require for proper function. <br>A month of NAC supplementation, at 1200mg/day 600 2x/day, could be helpful if your body has been able to replete glutathione levels after so many years of marijuana use, especially int he lungs:<br>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/103<wbr>40948/<br>https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Encapsu<wbr>lations-NAC-Glycine-Powder/dp/B08WJ<wbr>DLHMJ<br><br>That handles the physiological part of it. Unfortunately the psychological part is far more complicated. And really there&#039;s not much I can recommend for the psychological part as much of it is dependent on your environment. With chronic stress being capable of inducing your symptoms on its own, even proper nutrition may be ineffective. That doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t try to get the physiological side in order. Physiological health should, at the least, help to make your stress symptoms more manageable. I think it&#039;s worth trying for at least a month.

Literally a day after my ex shows up her friend also shows up and asks me how I&#039;ve been, I eventually find out my ex actually works right across the street from me which kind of pissed me off since I hate running into people from highschool (unless it some hot girl), in any case, thoughts? <br><br>One thing I forgot to mention is that back in 2019 I ran into the friend and my ex while they were in the alcohol section of a grocery store, I said hi to the friend but my ex immediately just turned around and started speed walking away, which is weird because we didn&#039;t have a bad breakup or anything, she was the one who ended it to begin with so I don&#039;t know why she&#039;s making such a big deal about it.", "time": 1673853244, "resto": 28133197}, {"no": 28133778, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:15:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28133245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28133245</a><br>Hard to say, we need more context to come to a conclusion anon.", "time": 1673853305, "resto": 28133197}, {"no": 28133796, "now": "01/16/23(Mon)02:19:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28133442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28133442</a><br>No response.

Due to personal reasons i find a woman who stays with a man who treats her as if shes worth less than she actually is for extended periods ro be just as shitty as the guy himself. I want a girl who is patient and who isnt a snowflake who cant be bothered to deal with a little bit of assholery and who ultimately hopes the other person is good deep down but who also knows how to recognize when things arent this way and how to distance herself from a toxic individual once its clear that theyre scum. And if he is awful and keeps stalking her or being aggressive and pushy over that thats when id like to interfere as her current boyfriend/friend.

Most of the coursework is just retelling books/articles and making shit up just to get the necessary word count. <br><br>I just feel like I&#039;m wasting my time and not progressing. <br><br>The thing is I used to study in The Netherlands (I dropped out because of covid and having to come back home to support my family). Because of this I can directly compare the level of education and its not even remotely on par here. <br><br>I kinda knew all of this before signing up for Uni here and the only reason I did sign up is because of my mother. For her if I don&#039;t get a diploma I won&#039;t even be considered a person and won&#039;t be able to make a living. <br><br>I just don&#039;t know what to do, I keep pushing forward but with each day it feels less rewarding and harder to maintain because of my motivation dropping. <br>Any ideas as to what to do?<br><br>P.S.

We did share some mutual friends, but we never hung out together. <br><br>After graduation, we all parted ways. Some of us even moved far away. Our graduating class tried to stay connected on social media. But you know how that goes. Social Media isn&#039;t a replacement for real life. We all moved on.<br><br>In 2021, the news broke on social media that my classmate died suddenly. I reached out to a mutual friend for more info. I sent my deceased classmate&#039;s family a sympathy card. <br><br>I guess they had a private funeral. I didn&#039;t hear of anything else. I was not close to their family (I never met them). All I could do was send a sympathy card and move on. <br><br>This was 2 years ago. <br><br>-------------------------<br><br>In 2023...<br><br>2 years later, suddenly out of nowhere I received a card from my deceased classmate&#039;s mother. <br><br>The mother apologized and said she&#039;s been very depressed and sad these passed 2 years. But that out of ALL sympathy cards she received, my card meant the most to her. More than any other card from other classmates, friends, or family. It really meant so much to her. (huh?) <br><br>Then the mother then asked me if she could speak with me, and even meet in-person.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>1. I have no idea why my card was the most treasured. I&#039;m very confused. My sympathy card was nothing special. I was just polite, briefly explained who I was, and expressed my condolences for their family&#039;s loss. That&#039;s it. <br><br>How should I handle this? I&#039;m very surprised at this message. I know there were many other people who were much closer to my former classmate than me. I feel awkward. <br><br>I&#039;m trying to keep an open mind, but what is going on? Why is the mother contacting me 2 years later, and asking to speak to me, and meet me in person? Why me?

Same age, same height, same color, but with a 5inch. You have a job, car, house and security, he doesn&#039;t. Shit you&#039;re even a millionaire. You know what she&#039;s gonna do? She&#039;s gonna pretend to be with you then fuck him behind your back and spend your millions on him. All they care about is dick, they judge or choose men based on dick size.

Be the friend you&#039;d want if you were you&#039;re him. That&#039;s why he&#039;s doing them in the first place. Addiction is in his life for a reason. It&#039;s teaching him something about himself, about his soul. This is his path and there&#039;s a lesson behind it he&#039;s supposed to learn. Not all of us need to learn the lesson of addiction but some of us do, those of us that are too open, too friendly, too careless, too cool, too nice, too receptive to the world around us are the ones that become easily addicted. I used to be addicted to opiates and I hated my sister. She would literally see me out walking and wouldn&#039;t even give me a ride, would drive right past me. She&#039;d throw food away she bought just so I couldn&#039;t eat it, she had me thrown in jail once, we have no relationship whatsoever. I hate my sister deep down. I see her and talk to her every now and then but it&#039;s awkward because she&#039;s a lot cooler now that I&#039;m clean but I still hate her for how she treated me during my addiction. Don&#039;t be the brother that he ends up hating because you sat back an judged him like a snob. You&#039;re no better than him whatsoever, his lessons are just different than yours. Help him, go out of your way to show him you&#039;re there for him. Ask em if he wants to go out our something. Most of all, if you really don&#039;t agree with what he&#039;s doing then move out so you don&#039;t have to see it and don&#039;t end up losing a relationship with your brother. Don&#039;t sit there and make yourself mad because your obsessed with your brothers drug problem and cause you guys to fall out. Just say bro I love you but I can&#039;t be around and watch you do this. If you need somewhere to go or someone to talk to I&#039;m here for you but I can&#039;t sit back and watch you destroy yourself. You could even offer to be his sponsor and take him to a.a or n.a.

He may have had this problem in a past life and didn&#039;t over come it and now the addiction is bleeding over into this life and its gonna keep bleeding over and popping up life after life until he himself breaks the cycle with his own freewill and overcomes it. Or it just may be something he just started this life and if he gets clean and overcomes it then it&#039;ll stay in this life. We come here to learn about ourselves through problems like these. We don&#039;t come here to be perfect, we don&#039;t come to be squares and saints and gods and angels. We literally come here to do drugs and party and have sex and make the biggest mess we can. This whole life is just a big adventure for our souls, a giant learning experience, these problems like these are the very reason we incarnate here. The things you hate about life are literally the reason you&#039;re having this life. To overcome them. This addiction is like climbing a mountain. Some people climb literal mountains and its fulfilling when they get to the top. This is his mountain. He&#039;ll eventually get clean and be normal, but he has to do it for him no one else. So just know in the back of you&#039;re head it isn&#039;t gonna last forever, this is just a phase.

I have always hated people for saying this type of shit to me. Before AND after I had kids, I always saw it as stupid. Anyone with enough of a brain/sense/empathy can imagine what its like to have a kid/something you care for that much. But thats not the point. What you probably arn&#039;t thinking of, and most people dont, is that kids dont fucking turn off. Its non-fucking stop. You&#039;re on call 24/7. The first one is easier. You can pawn it off on your significant other. The next one ups the ante because you usually each end up with one kid or the other. Its just non stop, you&#039;re both always tired and just want to fucking do nothing when you have a second to relax. Sleep and shitty mind numbing entertainment are a precious commodity that you only get so often, so you take them when you can. Stuff like this<a href=\"#p28128431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28128431</a> happens a lot and reduces women to sleeping just a handful of hours a night, if that, because they have to nurse. Sure you can use formula, but its better for the kid to drink from the tap (or so they say). Its not that you CAN&#039;T imagine the point of view of being a parent, its just that you&#039;re probably not thinking of it the proper way.

Learn the basics of singing and you&#039;ll learn how to talk and sound better. I&#039;m not telling you to actually sing scales or vocal exercises (although they can&#039;t hurt!). Watch some singing tutorials and apply those same lessons regarding the mechanisms of your mouth, diaphragm, vocal chords, etc. to regular talking. I&#039;ll spoon feed you on some basic pointers and exercises. Learn to open your soft pallet on the roof of your mouth, drop your larynx, breathe from your stomach instead of your chest, and speaking from the stomach instead of your chest. Some ways to learn how to do these things are: learning how to keep the yawning position while talking, singing while shitting, tightening your abs while exhaling and talking. You&#039;ll feel silly at first, but so long as you&#039;ve learned how to articulate your words properly whilst doing the exercises, you&#039;ll notice your voice is stronger, louder, and clearer. It will be natural. Think of a good end goal as well. What kind of general tone are you going for? How does this target voice mesh with the tools you&#039;ve been given? Personally, when I am speaking with good technique I sound a little bit like Han Solo in the original Star Wars film mixed with my own local accents/inflections.

When you cold approach you give 100x more information about yourself to her instantly by just being face to face with her, if she likes you after a cold approach she&#039;s less likely to be flaky because a picture doesn&#039;t mean shit, it&#039;s just one guy&#039;s picture among 30 other guys&#039; pictures she saw that day.

Didn&#039;t realize until many years later I had a chance with many of the hot girls, and that I shouldn&#039;t have rejected that girl. Then I took a course at college, high school level but at college. There were also many hot girls who seemed to like me. I didn&#039;t do anything except I tried talking to one girl who hadn&#039;t shown interest, she was a bitch, but then later she came up and smiled and said hi, don&#039;t know why, I was pissed off at how she had treated me earlier so I just gave her a dirty look. I didn&#039;t know anything about how to approach girls back then, but maybe I was also too stressed about managing the studies, I barely managed, I wasn&#039;t one of those who can get good grades and still be relaxed and have time to go to parties etc. Then later when I started trying hard to get girls I got very little. I&#039;m almost 40 now. I didn&#039;t go much to bars and clubs since I was like 21 because of some negative experiences.
