Living together with some guy without a trace of commitment for any period of time, let alone several years, is ALREADY a bad outcome. Most people fuck first and ask questions later. They treat each other and their relationships as interchangeable, and this is reflected in their lives after marriage as well. Marriage, to those types, is just a cosmetic change. They&#039;d already had sex, lived together, and coordinated their finances before marriage, so what changes afterwards?

I hate to agree on this, but like in business, diversifying is key. Don&#039;t go for just one girl. Have several opportunities available. That way, if you fail with one, you&#039;ll have all the others available anyway. If you don&#039;t like a girl, date her anyway. You might be surprised and change your mind. If not, at least you can use her as practice.

It doesn&#039;t really matter that much if the girl is not into those, most probably, she won&#039;t. Do you know many people who are into scuba-diving? But yet, it sounds cool when you mention it. Talk passionately about it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Money: I&#039;d say, this doesn&#039;t matter really much. Just have a decent job and that&#039;s it.

Fun holiday if you spend it with people u care about. Celebrating it with ur bf sounds like a great idea and if i were ur bf i would love u even more.<br><br>U can try and make pho, but a lot of people dislike the amount of work put in and time. U could always just buy from viet businesses or in a local viet town (like china town)<br><br>Look up Banh Tet. Eating Pho is great and you can eat it for breakfast, but in the spirit of the holiday, buying or making Banh Tet is pretty cool. The word Banh is like, generic for something solid+glutenous i guess, like rice or bread or sugary sometimes. Not always like dessert. <br>Banh Tet is Pork and mung beans wrapped in sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, and maybe try to get ones with maybe less sticky rice (larger ratio of tasty meat+mung bean). Unless ur a seasoned cook, please dont try to make it urself - not that it&#039;s hard, but because if it&#039;s new to you, it will be time consuming and ull hate urself for screwing up cuz ur buying new ingredients.<br><br>At the shops u might also see some classic &quot;viet desserts&quot;. Ok realize that chocolate is a new world dish and the east were not blessed with such godly delights. Dried foods and fruits are common. Some are bad (imo) and some are good (imo). Maybe ask around or guess. Have fun with that lol. Coconut based ones are usually good, as are Banh Tam Khoai. Maybe get some milk-based &quot;che&quot;s dessert-drinks(?). <br><br>I believe u can just go to ur local chase and ask for 2$ bills in chinese new year red envelopes, when it&#039;s in season. Maybe there are spares if out of season. Or just buy from ur local asia-town businesses maybe.<br>U can also buy lanterns and other fun decor. <br><br>Dont think too much about authenticity - focus more on having a fun time", "time": 1671869596, "resto": 27975682}, {"no": 27975928, "now": "12/24/22(Sat)03:15:40", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27975702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975702</a><br><a href=\"#p27975716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975716</a><br><a href=\"#p27975744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975744</a><br><a href=\"#p27975772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975772</a><br><a href=\"#p27975774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975774</a><br><a href=\"#p27975782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975782</a><br><a href=\"#p27975804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27975804</a><br>Lmao scrotes mad.

I have also gotten off cross-dressing in real life, but I&#039;ve never really gotten off to pictures or videos of this online because a sort of basic-rationality filter means only dumb, sickly and obese people publically post this behavior. Sissy porn is almost always equivalently disgusting. I also have maintained normal attraction for and the ability to get an erection for normal females. I have had a long-term relationship with a normal girl, and never had trouble getting it up. So what the fuck is wrong with me? Anyone else ridiculously deep down a hole of some mysterious childhood fetish? Is engaging with this stuff in reality bound to send me down a hedonistic hellhole?

Addiction is addiction. I might have been unclear though: I am totally interested in actual sex, &quot;the way God intended it&quot;. I desire to have completely vanilla experiences like this on a regular basis with a partner. And to respond to the last bit: in high school I got swept into the early life stages of the NoFap trend and refrained from PMO for about 120 days. During this time I got a girlfriend and became busy with so many fulfilling challenges, responsibilities and friends. I had totally forgotten about this fetish.

To me, a fetish is a sufficient and unusual condition for turning somebody on, not a necessary and unusual condition. That&#039;s my bad for misusing the language though. Anyway, the issue is that even though I can be satisfied without it, I deeply desire to fulfill this fetish, and I fear I could never follow through with a promise to give it up. Yeah, maybe I&#039;d make it in the short-term, but I always imagine that 5,10, or even 20 years down the line the curiosity and passion would probably break me into wanting to engage with it, and breaking a promise like that could fatally hurt a relationship or marriage.<br><br>Hopefully that clears it up.

It&#039;s basically just the thought of never engaging in it that bothers me. Not sure how I&#039;d find someone who&#039;s understanding though.

Taking the blackpill doesn&#039;t mean remaining forever bitter, it means accepting the harsh reality and moving on to other things that you do have control over.

You cannot win against some people with superior genetics like Usain Bolt, no matter how hard you try. Accepting blackpills, especially aging since it happens to all of us, doesn&#039;t mean we cannot live a satisfactory life.

Negativity propaganda (blackpills) works exactly the same way; sometimes you think you can&#039;t do something but it ends up being that you can do it, and sometimes when you think your situation is hopeless, suddenly a new hope arises in your life. <br><br>My point is, taking the blackpill is no excuse to abandon what is righteous and instead turn to what is evil.

Even when I had been drinking a 5th of whiskey a day for weeks straight. When the doctors told me to stop I just plain stopped again. Cold turkey. Waited a couple months, my health improved, doctors gave an advised ok.

All that matters in tech is your skill set and whether or not you have a degree; doesn&#039;t matter at all where you got the degree.

Like I said, most companies only care that you have a degree, doesn&#039;t matter where you got it from.

You are overthinking this whole situation\u2026. It\u2019s just one woman\u2026. Let me tell you as a guy in his 30\u2019s who did a 2 year womanizing thing at 30 years old, that it\u2019s kind of funny how things work out with women\u2026. <br><br>So I decided after becoming single to womanize. But I was really bad at it\u2026 I spent months directly approaching women at bars\u2026 got some numbers but mainly rejections. And the dates went really bad. I\u2019m talking dates with like 10+ women. <br><br>Eventually all of those experiences changed me. It took awhile but you and do something over and over and over again and not experience growth. Like if you played basketball twice a week for 6 months there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t get better. <br><br>So eventually I just got better at getting women. But they weren\u2019t coming to me. I was still approaching them but being smoother about it and had better instincts in dates about what to say and how to converse and stuff. I got laid a lot for a while. <br><br>Then after like a year of that lifestyle, I woke up one day and was depressed. A hot girl had left my place after a great night and I should have been happy but I wasn\u2019t. I felt shallow. I didn\u2019t want a relationship but I didn\u2019t want to womanize anymore. so suddenly I stopped wanting to get women. <br><br>This new perspective came over me and for several weeks I just started doing my own thing. Then all of the sudden hot women started APPROACHING me. <br><br>I\u2019d be in the laundry room at my apartment.. I\u2019d be walking down the street in a college area\u2026 I\u2019d be sitting by myself at a bar just sipping a whisky minding my business\u2026. It was crazy dude\u2026 I just got flocked by women because I had become genuinely aloof. I didn\u2019t even want them anymore.<br><br>conclusion: if you want women spend time trying to get them so that you get good at it and burn out and stop wanting them. once you don\u2019t want them anymore, women will start approaching you. <br><br>This one girl is no one my man.
