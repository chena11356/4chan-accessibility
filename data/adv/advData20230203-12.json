I&#039;ve been with my boyfriend, soon-to-be husband for 7 years. 31 years old both of us. It&#039;s been since January, his dick went soft when initiating sex. It happened three times since then. We&#039;ve had sex normally in between but yesterday it happened again (3rd time).<br><br>Sex has become kinda a routine, which I&#039;m completely against. But I guess it happens because it&#039;s better when we&#039;re both clean after a shower etc. He said he&#039;s sometimes bored to do it, but also he doesn&#039;t want us to have sex too rarely (we do it 2-3 times a week, but we had married friends tell us they hadn&#039;t done it in a year and I think it terrified him).<br><br>I&#039;m sure he&#039;s not cheating, also he doesn&#039;t watch a lot of porn. But I don&#039;t know how I feel about it. I mean of course I don&#039;t want him addicted to porn, but not watching porn at all (or very rarely) is the other end of the spectrum, no?<br><br>Please give me advice on what to do, how to spice things up, how to approach him about it? I actually like kinky stuff during sex but we never do any, it&#039;s pretty vanilla apart from the usual doggy style, occasional 69 and ball/anal licking. I can tell he likes his butthole being played with and his balls pulled but he doesn&#039;t say anything when I ask him if he has a fetish or something he likes. How can I get him to open up?

Unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die and that life is like a video game or a simulation and you actually chose to come here and that the meaning of life is to learn to love and be kind and thrive here despite how hard it is in this world. So you will get to be your preferred gender forever in paradise, but in this incarnation you are here to love everything despite that nonideal state of things. So how is it going anon?<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening as you realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness.

It makes them feel as though they are not worth their parents&#039; attention. They may believe that they are the cause of the neglect, when in reality it is often the parents who are to blame for their inattention. You should try to find a way to accept that this was not your fault, and that the actions of your parents do not represent your worth.<br><br>You can do this in a few different ways: One way is to remind yourself that the actions of your parents say nothing about who you are as a person.

Anyway, I have no memories. None. Zilch. I don&#039;t retain memories, either, the longest they remain is for a week or two if I&#039;m lucky. It&#039;s severe enough that I frequently find myself forgetting my name, birthday, the date and time, and so on. However, when given a cognitive test, my results end up near perfect every time. In other words, my memory is above average in an isolated testing environment, but it isn&#039;t in any other application. 4 separate psychologists have dropped me because they think I&#039;m lying about this, but I&#039;m completely sincere. I&#039;ve been diagnosed before with DDNOS, schizoid personality disorder, and a smattering of various other things beforehand, the latter all dropped. I have an apparently extensive (recorded) history of childhood abuse but I don&#039;t remember a single moment of it. This abuse is divided into two different extremes; neglect and coddling, negative and positive enforcement, physical/sexual and mental abuse, so on and so forth. I&#039;m stuck in the latter environment because I cannot learn as a result of this mix of this memory affliction and near-debilitating lethargy and brainfog. EMDR has not made a dent, I was referred to a hypnotherapist but various pathologies of mine make that nearly impossible. I&#039;ve tried journaling, calendars, alarms, signs, rote and spaced repetition, everything I can think of or was recommended to do to improve this, but nothing works. What do I do? Is trauma suppression (which I suspect it is) this severe possible to approach? I&#039;ve been tested for various physical ailments and none have turned positive, so this is evidently something psychological. I have no brain damage to speak of, either. Is there any approach to improving this situation even a little bit or a lead I can follow to reattain my memories and remember new ones?", "time": 1675421231, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261219, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:48:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261199</a><br>introjection<br>sperg", "time": 1675421292, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261224, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:49:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261200</a><br>where is arts mentioned you fucking sped<br>are you actually so braindead that you don&#039;t know what a bachelor of psychology is?", "time": 1675421354, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261228, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:49:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261219</a><br>sperg", "time": 1675421389, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261232, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:50:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261228</a><br>introjection<br>sperg", "time": 1675421423, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261237, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:50:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261214</a><br>Fascinating", "time": 1675421450, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261240, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:51:18", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261172</a><br>I didn&#039;t<br>Dimwit", "time": 1675421478, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261245, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:51:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261232</a><br><a href=\"#p28261240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261240</a><br>sperg", "time": 1675421519, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261246, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:52:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261240</a><br>sperg", "time": 1675421522, "resto": 28259932}, {"no": 28261251, "now": "02/03/23(Fri)05:52:25", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28261170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28261170</a><br>It&#039;s a different kind of science.

But as a recap. I hooked up with a uni classmate that has a long-distance boyfriend. Apparently we had been mutually attracted to each other (over the past year or so) but had never talked to each other or shared these feelings. This (academic) year we started talking and things moved fast we ended up hooking up many times (even had unprotected sex a bunch of times something which apparently she doesn&#039;t do with her boyfriend). Over the course of the hookups I waved the question of her leaving him and dating me instead, decision which she always claimed she was in the process of making sometimes wavering more towards one end others towards the other, but ultimately never making. The last time we hooked up (around 2 weeks ago) it seemed to me like things had taken a turn for the better as the hook up was a lot more romantical and emotional/spiritual compared to previous ones. However, due to unforseen circumstances she had to go back home (we are both out of state students at uni), back home ofc is where her long distance bf lives. Ultimately since she got back home, things started getting a bit dry and cold over text, which was hurting me a lot, she also hadn&#039;t made any decision over us so ultimately I told her that we should just be friends. This all took place a little over a week ago. Since then I&#039;ve been very sad and unhappy, she has made no attemts to rekindle any romace we might have had. Soon she&#039;ll be back from home. My question is a) has this run its course already or once we start seeing each other again (e.g at uni) we will somehow rekindle what we had (as it was very physically driven), should I keep on pursuing her and risk getting rejected, should I just move on?

After a year we moved in together and I started to feel like I was missing out on all the things that young people do. I wanted to party and be free and try out other people. We took acid together and I accidentally told her that I something that indicated that I didn&#039;t love her anymore while we were tripping balls. It was actually really traumatic. I didn&#039;t even mean to.<br><br>So for the next couple years, we were seeing each other on and off. I became very unstable and developed several drug addictions. I told her I was going to kill myself and that was the last time I spoke to her, because I realized I was becoming a scumbag. Since then I have probably hooked up with about 8 different girls and it is NOT WORTH IT. Sex is so much better with a long term partner. <br><br>I still think about that girl every day.

In the course of 10 months this psychotic woman managed to convince my ex that her life was shit because of me for reasons that occurred before I even knew her. The breakup conversation at her place sounded like she was reading off some generic anti-male feminist talking points, she couldn&#039;t provide an example of times I did even one of them, and she had blocked me everywhere by the time I made it out the door.<br>About 3 months after ripping us apart, that roommate met some homeless looking dude and unannounced moved in with him 3 weeks later which forced my ex to move back in with her parents and eat the bill for breaking their lease 1.5 years early. That roommate got engaged not a month later, spent a year convincing him that he was gender fluid then a woman, made him get his dick chopped off to &quot;prove his love and confirm his true identity&quot;, then she dumped him because she&#039;s &quot;not a lesbian and he was broke&quot; after the elective penis removal surgery was not covered by insurance.<br>This would be our 7th year together. We&#039;d have moved overseas and have a kid or two by now. According to her parents (I see them at the grocery store occasionally) she has not dated anyone since me as of last month and is recovering from severe alcoholism over the last few years. Despite everything, she set the bar incredibly high for future women in everything from cleaning the house to looks to relationship dynamics, and there have been a total of 3 days that I have not thought about her even through 2 other relationships. My current gf falls short in every way, but I realize that ex is not coming back and I&#039;m trying to make the best of things.<br>So OP don&#039;t feel bad about being a lonely incel.

They lift you up instead of drag you down. It is about how they make you feel, not about how much money they have in the bank or how broad their shoulders are. Ofc those things are nice too but the actual thing that draws in others is delusional confidence that you\u2018re god\u2018s gift to humanity and the more society agrees with you, the easier it is to keep up that level of confidence for extended periods of time. It\u2018s like an upwards spiral. The more confident you are the mire people will enjoy your existence and that in turn will make you be even more confident. Basically you become unstoppable.

Start noticing when your thoughts take you somewhere you don&#039;t want to be. When you get into a line of thinking you don&#039;t want to be in, figure out something you can just quickly snap your brain to doing. When I was paying off my student loans, I&#039;d say &quot;money, money, money&quot; in my head and it&#039;d click me into doing mental math on my debt. It can be anything distracting in a preferably positive sense. Planning a goal you&#039;re working towards, thinking about strats for a game you enjoy, anything and it&#039;ll likely change for you over time so just go with the flow of whatever you find keeps you from ruminating in the dark crevasses of your mind that you don&#039;t want to spend time in. Do this whole process with a sense of calm and mental tranquility, I mentally visualize softly pushing thoughts out of my head that I know are bad for me but find whatever works for you. <br><br>A big eureka for me in this process was running across a quote from some swami that ran to the effect of: &quot;If you&#039;re trying to get through a crowd, you do not walk up to each man and fight him.
