Shes not going to take out a tape measurer and proceed to laugh you if its 1 centimeter short of 6 inches. Dick size is the LEAST of things Ive heard women complain about sexually.<br><br>My best advice for improving your partner&#039;s sexual satisfaction is to<br>1. Have good hygiene, if you smell like unwashed asshole its going to make her question her life decisions. I feel like this should be obvious but you&#039;d be surprised on the horror stories I&#039;ve heard<br>2. PAY ATTENTION TO THE CLIT. Most women are unable to orgasm from purely penetration. Using toys, rubbing her while penetrating, or eating out are all great things you might want to consider incorporating into your sex life<br>3. Have good foreplay and pay attention to how she responds. I hear a lot about how women were in pain their first time and thought &quot;that is just how it was supposed to be like&quot;. It shouldn&#039;t hurt. Good foreplay is an absolute essential in so that she actually enjoys it and so it doesn&#039;t hurt<br><br>Dick size does not fucking matter lmao its the least of your worries. Bigger doesn&#039;t always equal better. Honestly the biggest struggle is just getting in the mood in the first place, it&#039;s not as easy to do for women because there&#039;s generally less nerves to be stimulated (aside from clit) and because of hormone differences compared to men.

Since my teenage days I always thought that I was depressed because I felt something &quot;wrong&quot; about me, but these last few years I was able to afford therapy, but to me surprise, both attempts I failed to qualify as depressed. They tested me and while I show some signs of mild depression, I&#039;m not depressed. I couldn&#039;t afford more time in therapy so I just tried to go on, but things didn&#039;t work out for me, I still struggled to finish things, even small ones and I was constantly switching form being super motivated to feeling with no motivation at all. <br>I&#039;m 26 now and I have failed at pretty much everything I&#039;ve tried because I wasn&#039;t persistant enough and I just wne to the next thing I wanted to try. College dropout, failed artist, dumped by gf that still loved me, unable to keep jobs, etc. No matter how much of a mess I was in, I was never able to commit to make significant improvements in my life, even if for certain periods I was super motivated. <br>At that point I&#039;ve already droped the idea of having some disorder and I thought I was just lazy (which is true) but then I saw this image and realized how much it fits to me situation. I never considered ADHD because while I always had problems to focus in my tasks, I was always calm and chill, but after reading more in depth I get that&#039;s not as simple as that, and that the whole thing really fits not only for my current situation, but also to my chilhood and teenage days.

Doesn&#039;t even actually answer the question<br>it also<br>2. Pretty much tells the girl seeing it, even though its clearly meant to be expressed as a joke, that you seem shallow and will say anything so that you can get into her pants. Maybe you clearly see it as a joke and not to be taken seriously at all, but from an outside perspective could also be interpreted as using humor to casually and indirectly inform the viewer that you&#039;re looking for only hookups and that you don&#039;t agree with generally liberal ideologies.<br><br>Prompt 3 is kinda hard to mess up. &quot;yummy yummy in my tummy&quot; is probably better off removed though.<br><br>And for your bio, just don&#039;t mention MILFs lmao.
