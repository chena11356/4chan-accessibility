Literally the blame is just psychopaths are out to get me, but if the psychopaths are out to get me than I seem schizo no matter who true it is.<br><br>I gotta move out of this apartment. An entire year + has been robbed from me by dipshits but I am powerless to do anything about it. If I don&#039;t get this job tomorrow I am fucked. I am sick of bouncing around from job to job. I shit you not EVERY SINGLE JOB that I get I am surrounded by a sociopathic staff and I get picked on for being the only guy with empathy on the staff. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I fuckin&#039; know some retarded anon is going to accuse me of being paranoid and insane or something but that would just be gaslighting because that&#039;s just my life. I am bullied by psychopaths. I move from one psychopath to the next. Not out of choice, but lack of economic mobility.<br><br>the only jobs that are hiring are the ones that hire felons and fuckups. The only rooms that are open are from people who can&#039;t hold a roommate. It&#039;s a revolving door for dipshits who don&#039;t make above the poverty line. I&#039;m not neetbux so I can&#039;t get a full time job. Rent is so expensive that a one bedroom apartment in this part of the country is impossible to afford by yourself.<br><br>I am stuck living with psychos because I am too desperate to make friends. I am basically on the verge of homelessness because I have been pushed too far too often.<br><br>Literally I understand how it happens to people now. They are just invalidated to the point of emptiness and then just give up. No one wants you around and so you sink inside and something dies and you just live with this poison mind of negativity.<br><br>I just want to be positive but everything positive is stolen from me by a manipulator.

The prevailing theory is that it&#039;s an evolutionary mechanism from our tribal past, whereby a rejection in a small group could signal your lack of evolutionary fitness to all the females of the group. Other girls&#039; opinions being so important for any one girl&#039;s actions, it puts future mating opportunities in dire jeopardy for a male to be rejected, thus the anxiety around it. Despite that social dynamic being anachronistic, our emotional systems haven&#039;t evolved past that dynamic yet.

Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home.

Are you willing to give up your say in what city and country you live? Are you willing to look after children from the breadwinner&#039;s previous relationship? Will you assist the breadwinner like a PA to the benefit of their career? Is it fine for the Breadwinner to have other partners without telling you?

This is not reasons that brought housewives into existance and it is not value the typical reasons why women live today as housewives when it is upheld as tradition.<br><br>You could say you want to be a non-traditional housewife but you would not be able to get away with that because to most people that wouldn&#039;t make sense.

You&#039;re actually trying to say a housewife is X and you would still fit into X as a housewife. Say you wanted the exact same thing but you were a guy. You couldn&#039;t say &quot;househusband&quot; becasue this is a novel term. You would have to settle with &quot;Stay at home husband&quot; which I think is fine. But you cannot now tell anyone that &quot;housewife&quot; and &quot;stay at home husband&quot; are equal in terms of significance held when it comes to history and tradition.<br><br>So the point I make is not at all about how the role of housewife functions as a tradition. The fact of society, is that housewife is a role that has been known for such a long time that it is part of a tradition with a notoriety that stay at home husband hasn&#039;t achieved, again not the point. The point is you can&#039;t get past the expectations when you use the term which is there because of what is traditional in the first place.<br><br>There is not necessarily a strict criteria for this per se, but polyamory practice you refer to is not traditional. If you had polyamory in the form of polygamy such as Mormon sister-wives each married to the same husband, that would indeed be traditional.<br><br>What this is essentially boiling down to is being a housewife because you think you fit into X like I said before. And you want X to be everything tradtional because of the expectations except the parts that which you intend to go against or at least want the freedom to go against because you don&#039;t want to be follow certain traditions.<br><br>In a way I guess it is just semantics but to some extent you are disregarding the reasoning behind the concept because you feel that your whims can benefit from your innovation.", "filename": "Love is kind", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1988, "h": 3056, "tn_w": 81, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674693392937548, "time": 1674693392, "md5": "hxv+IhFp7osQF0UYdQrJug==", "fsize": 1537119, "resto": 28194671}, {"no": 28202600, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:14:27", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28201577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28201577</a><br>honestly, ive said multiple times i dont want to fit into any tradition. honestly the traditional norm is for women to work and men to as well. you can engage with some parts of a tradition and disengage with others. and if you really wanna say that im not being traditional, then im not. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you feel that your whims can benefit from your innovation.</span><br>i think that it can, and i have enough of a safety net to try, or to fail supposedly", "time": 1674702867, "resto": 28194671}, {"no": 28202660, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The point is you can&#039;t get past the expectations when you use the term which is there because of what is traditional in the first place.</span><br><br>i get the point you are making, but thats why you are supposed to make it clear to the people you are speaking to of your desires from the relationship. i say housewife for the sake of convenience, whatever the correct word may be it really doesnt matter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; being a housewife because you think you fit into X</span><br>not trying to fit into X i just want a husband and a family. doesnt matter this is just semantics at this point", "time": 1674703331, "resto": 28194671}, {"no": 28202860, "now": "01/25/23(Wed)22:56:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28202600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28202600</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;honestly, ive said multiple times i dont want to fit into any tradition</span><br>And I have already noted that I&#039;m aware that you&#039;re not fitting/going/adhering to tradition.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;honestly the traditional norm is for women to work and men to as well</span><br>No it is not because traditions are subjective.

The only sure contradiction I think you established is having other lovers than the breadwinner. This also means it is possible to have as many lovers as you want, divide attention away from breadwinner, give as much time as you see fit as a companion to a lover who is not the breadwinner, stay at a lover&#039;s residence that is not breadwinner&#039;s for as long as you like and maintain it as you would for the breadwinner.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like.

My specific situation will not really relate to you.<br><br>The TL;DR is that I am an /out/ist through and through and nothing is going to change that.<br><br>I was in the army before college. Biology degree. Wildly depressed, and medicated for it. In college I did an internship with a conservation agency and it was fun, but I did the &quot;right thing&quot; and after school I just kept pursuing my &quot;career path.&quot; Nothing glamorous or financially enticing, mind you. At 27 I had a paradigm shift, some major life changes (sister offed herself and ended a toxic 6 year relationship) and I took some seasonal /out/ work in Alaska to try and clear my heart and my head. Quit taking Zoloft during this time.<br><br>Following this, I left and did a &quot;normal&quot; job for about 1.25 years before I again felt the urge to get the fuck back outside. I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died. I&#039;ve since worked for a few different agencies/places for the feds doing /out/ things. I do not make much money. My job security is tenuous. But I feel at peace and wouldn&#039;t change it.<br><br>The point of my story is simply that if you recognize something you are truly passionate about, you should just stick with it, because trying to convince yourself you are happier in some other capacity just results in you being miserable.

Think of employment as a bridge from virgin neetdom to chad neetdom. Some examples of viable options are trades, sales, it, coding meme, internet marketing. You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

Just some stupid autistic arrested child. I&#039;m not smart at all. I never did well in school. My judgement of myself is insurmountable because it feels so accurate. I&#039;m exhausted of everything to be honest. I can barely take care of myself. I hate the endless cycle of eating and shitting. I wish I never had to do it anymore. I&#039;d give up a lot to be free from eating and shitting. I really dislike where I live. Sometimes I just start screaming because of my life. I spend most of my time day dreaming about taking the train somewhere far away and trying to start something new. Maybe if im in a new place and have zero resources it will kickstart myself. I already feel like a machine. I run on diesel and cranks. I totter around leaking oil doing nothing useful. Until I stop moving. And then a therapist runs over to crank me moving again. I feel like a fool. I have nothing to compare my life too so it just seems even more pathetic. At the end of the day I think I never outgrew my childlike desire to be a hero and go on adventures. I&#039;ve talked about this. They&#039;ve suggested I travel. But I don&#039;t have the money to do it often. And when I have been a tourist it hasn&#039;t fulfilled me at all. Travelling isn&#039;t the adventure I&#039;m looking for. I don&#039;t want to be a tourist I want to be a hero. That is my entitled desire. But I&#039;m weak and don&#039;t understand anything. Which is okay for a 12 year old and that&#039;s what I mentally see myself as. But I&#039;m way beyond 12. Im not endearing and naive I&#039;m just an idiot. I can&#039;t be either a masculine put together man or an innocent pure hearted thing. I&#039;m just pathetic. I have tried origami and writing drawing and Music. Model kit building.

The same is true for dick size. Huge dicks are extremely erotic to women, every girl fantasizes about sucking on one. It may make sex more difficult, but most women will tolerate that for the sake of having a huge meaty rod to play with.<br>The man does not need to put his entire dick inside a woman if it&#039;s too big anyways.

But no matter how desperate, horny, and drunk a guy is, if he&#039;s straight, he won&#039;t let an unattractive man fuck him, because when it comes to men there isn&#039;t this slight, residual, background attraction: there is literally no attraction at all. <br><br>And *that* is what it&#039;s like for women. When we&#039;re attracted to a guy, we feel that attraction as strongly as you do; but when we&#039;re *not* attracted to someone, we are really 100% NOT attracted. It&#039;s not like the way that men are &quot;not really attracted but maybe a tiny bit if I&#039;m drunk enough&quot;, it&#039;s really no attraction AT ALL, in the same way as you are not attracted AT ALL to other men.<br><br>So, if a woman were to have sex with a man she doesn&#039;t fancy, that is not like a guy having sex with a woman he doesn&#039;t *particularly* fancy, it&#039;s like a guy having sex with a man when he&#039;s straight. It is *that* unpleasant.<br><br>It depresses me that men don&#039;t understand this. They still have this attitude of &quot;Why are you so upset when you could have sex any time you want?&quot; And it&#039;s like, *you* could have sex with an unattractive gay man any time you want to, but you don&#039;t, because it would be an incredibly distressing, traumatising experience for you. But having sex with a man we don&#039;t fancy is every bit as distressing and traumatising for us as being fucked in the ass by an unattractive man would be for you. So the fact that we have the option is NOT A POSITIVE THING.", "time": 1674734023, "resto": 28203103}, {"no": 28204643, "now": "01/26/23(Thu)06:54:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28204631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28204631</a><br>Well sure but the fact you are so hung up about your first impression on others or them not being able to grasp your true self instantly is concerning in itself.

Fortunately, as a woman there are a lot of tricks you can use to elevate your beauty considerably. If I were you, I\u2019d do the following:<br><br>1. Fix your diet. Count calories eat better<br>2. Work out. No need to kill yourself but go to /fit/ and research good female routines. Focus on your ass for instant mires. Should take you 6-12 months of consistent effort to look good if you have a skinny fat body type<br>3. Drink only water. I started doing this a few years ago and it helped me in so many areas from how tired I felt to weight to digestion to skin health <br>4. Go on YouTube or go to a salon for hair, make-up, beauty and skin routines. Your appearance suggests you out no effort into it and that deducts points from nearly everyone who isn\u2019t a 8, 9, or 10. The rest of us have to work at it. Eyebrow threading, a skin care routine, a little makeup and a trendy hair style will bump you up a point or two alone. Just don\u2019t overdo it and find someone who will mentor you<br>5. Fashion. This is harder because you don\u2019t want to change who you are as a person, but you do have to adapt to the environment to catch the prey you want. Look for feminine clothes like well-fitting sun dresses, sweaters, and form-fitting pants or leggings. American Eagle, Hollister, and other trendy stores for young women is where you want to shop. I\u2019d slowly upgrade your wardrobe until you get your goal body<br><br>I know this sounds like a lot, but as someone who is probably twice your age I would encourage you to start now.

So then, I feel like I\u2019m struggling cause I have nothing to lean on.
