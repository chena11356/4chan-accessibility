After &quot;beating&quot; the game a few times and unlocking new endings, a multiplayer option came up. Now I&#039;m showing some guy through the game and we&#039;re having a blast together. After some time, we take a walk around the garden behind the house and this guy proposes to me. Obviously I say yes, and suddenly we&#039;re in some big cathedral on our wedding day. I&#039;m wearing a jacket, but after someone I evidently regard as a member of the wedding party convinces me I shouldn&#039;t wear it, I take it off to learn I&#039;m wearing a beautiful wedding dress. Queue a very long and detailed wedding ceremony where I feel absolutely in love with this guy and my family is all in attendance being supportive, along with a bunch of &quot;friends&quot; I supposedly met while going to drag shows or something as I explored my sexuality and crossdressing. The &quot;friends&quot; and my family gave toasts, and we spent a while doing odd games like you would expect from a bridal shower or something. In the end, everyone slowly left the reception and it was just me, my new husband, a few close friends, and my parents cleaning up after ourselves as priests walked around looking impatient. The dream ended with me suggesting we hold a 4th of July celebration at the very same old house from the beginning while feeling as if we (husband and I) lived there, being told it wasn&#039;t a good idea since it&#039;s old and flammable, and leaving the church arms linked with my husband, full of anticipation for our wedding night.<br><br>Am I a faggot?

The flaw in your thinking is that you\u2019re thinking for an exact replica of yourself, the female version of yourself, which you are very unlikely to come by. You can marry an equal without her being a clone of you. <br><br>For example, she can be a 10/10 in looks but makes 40% less than you. While she makes less, she makes up for it in her looks. You married up in looks but down in income. It equals out. Ultimately, you have to decide which traits you value most in a partner. For the record, when a woman earns more than a man, the divorce rate nearly doubles. It\u2019s important to maintain the masculine role in the relationship and for her to be the feminine.

It&#039;s an incredibly fucking stupid idea to do it impulsively without working on fixing the things that bother you first. If you had no children I&#039;d say sure, go for it. But you do, and that leaves you with a mountain of responsibility and one of those responsibilities is to provide a stable, loving environment where they can grow up in and flourish. I don&#039;t care if you don&#039;t like it, come to terms with it. Seek out marriage counselling, talk with your wife, don&#039;t be resentful towards her and especially your child. Don&#039;t think of it as being doomed to stay with her forever, divorce is still an option, but you should explore every other avenue that is available to you first (short of cheating) and genuinely try to fix things before you go down that path. If nothing works and you do end up getting divorced, your number one priority over EVERYTHING ELSE is still the well-being of your child. I don&#039;t care if the process of divorce left you hating the mother, you&#039;ll not insult her, demean her or try to torpedo her life or relationship with her child - you support her to support your child. I don&#039;t care if you have a nice dinner date set up with your new partner, if your child is having a stage play at school, you go - whether it&#039;s playing the lead role or a tree in the background.

It&#039;s still valuable to experience a relationship with a woman who likes you back, at least just to experience the &quot;honeymoon phase&quot;.
