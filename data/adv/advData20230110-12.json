We&#039;ll have been split about six months now, but I&#039;d say the relationship had deteriorated well before that.

We&#039;re the same age, have jobs in the same field, and have a lot of the same passions. We have several mutual friends. Only issue is that I only know her via Facebook. I&#039;m in my comfort zone when I can approach a woman in person. Asking a girl out via messenger or just saying &#039;Hey, what&#039;s up?&#039; seems kind of creepy/odd to me.

I could always ask a mutual friend (none of whom I&#039;m particularly close to, but close enough that I could probably bring her up) and see where that takes me. I&#039;m really at a loss here because I&#039;ve never been in this situation before.

The true, poor goal is for everything to go your way and for life to please you and present no challenges, be carefree, painfree, problem-free.

What makes me happy is taking responsibility for things I didn\u2019t know I could take responsibility for, and making them better. <br><br>Happiness is just when you fully engage with your life and have a vision for it that excites you, even if just for the short term.

It should be at the minimum as immersive as your best memories where you played a really cool video game. Yes, real life is far more hardcore. But you can still be immersed in the moment to moment creation of something better. Instead of thinking life is a series of things you don\u2019t want to do, that you have to do, and just hoping to end up somewhere better. Only doing things where success is guaranteed\u2026 The ultimate mindset is when you can have absolutely thrilling fun playing for an impossible reward. Understanding that it\u2019s not about that reward, although it IS about it, and it would be beyond words to attain it.

The fact that your gf would do such a thing as not respecting your privacy is a red flag, but it is not surprising.

I&#039;m the guy who, when in a group, would just be quiet and only sometimes chime in for a comment. I also rarely message people directly and mostly talk in group chats, but I&#039;ve been trying more recently. A while ago I had a little fight with one of those friends, but I&#039;ve said sorry and he never brought it up again.<br>But recently I feel like they&#039;ve been ignoring me. I tried dm&#039;ing another friend in the group directly, but they never replied. They also never brought it up when we next interacted online through the group. But I know they&#039;re in dms a lot with the friend I had a fight with. And when us three hang out I usually feel like a third-wheel. <br>Is it time for me to seek out other friends? I&#039;m socially awkward but I can at least start online.

Shits great. If you&#039;re looking for advice as for the how to then i&#039;d recommend that you stop caring about the future so much. If you see a girl that arouses you just take it one step at a time,starting with saying a greeting like Hello. Then you ask her name,call her pretty and offer to get her some food and chat so you can ask her questions and have her blab about herself. She gives an excuse then you ask for her number get it and text her a week later for a date. If she makes it any more difficult than that(Or doesn&#039;t even give you a number) then just find another chick.<br><br>The most important things with handling women though is to not talk a fuckload and to not let sadness or anger be your emotion when talking to her. Just mainly focus on making moves AND making her talk by asking questions. Where you take her and what ACTIONS you do are what matter. For example if you don&#039;t make real moves like kissing a girl during or after a date,she&#039;s gonna get the wrong fucking impression. Doesn&#039;t matter if you held her hand,met her parents or hugged her it has to be REAL MOVES like grabbing her tits,slapping her ass, or kissing her. When it comes to where you take her,make it places where the both of you are talking. Nothing dumb like a concert or a movie. Otherwise she&#039;s gonna get the wrong idea about you and act all weird when you try to stick your penis in or let your pent up (beta) emotions fly. If she&#039;s not receptive to any of this? Never call or text her ever again because she&#039;s just not interested.<br><br>Follow that and pussy is e to the Z", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 1135, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673164041505380, "time": 1673164041, "md5": "qSYgwY9ydhfITPQmK2Y3GQ==", "fsize": 867715, "resto": 28062521}, {"no": 28074055, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28062521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28062521</a><br>A few days after my 27th birthday.
