And so would you, me, or anyone, including the most dogmatic atheists and skeptics, because it is VASTLY more self-evidently real than this brief little experience of life on Earth we have now. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep, deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.", "filename": "1611312397491", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1671451577602023, "time": 1671451577, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 27945302}, {"no": 27945450, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:10:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27945302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27945302</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;society will collapse soon</span><br>Nah, just some of the systems you rely on will collapse.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;if not, nuclear war will happen</span><br>Not going to happen, unfortunately.", "time": 1671451817, "resto": 27945302}, {"no": 27945464, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:18:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Pic related is OP.", "filename": "C968F136-9A62-4FDF-A580-4150F27E9128", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 479, "h": 680, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1671452308681083, "time": 1671452308, "md5": "uBwbAbVKsmpex9D1ss33kQ==", "fsize": 69095, "resto": 27945302}, {"no": 27945467, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)07:20:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Lol, nothing will collapse", "time": 1671452402, "resto": 27945302}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 27944892, "now": "12/19/22(Mon)03:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "sub": "ITT: Ask the opposite sex anything!

To the point that almost every time I pulled her underwear off there would be a string with a giant wet spot. When we made things official, she decided to get an IUD. For the first 2 weeks it was fine but then her vagina completely dried up. She never denied sex but could not get wet / very hard time getting wet. I know IUDs can cause this issues. However, when she masturbated, she would get wet like she used to when casual. Over the next year it did get better but never to the point of when we were casual. A year went by and she got the IUD removed. Over the next 9 months until we broke up, her wetness did increase with some days being better or worse than other. Her initial wetness never got back to casual status but a few minutes into sex and she would be really wet.<br><br>After we broke up, we continued to have sex (we still lived together) and her initial wetness dramatically increased. But then steadily decreased over the few months. The past few times we&#039;ve recently had sex, I would foreplay with her for a good 10 minutes. Kissing her and slowly working my way down to eating her out but she&#039;d almost never get outwardly wet. I could taste when she&#039;d start producing. She would get wet enough for me to get it in and THEN after about a minute she&#039;d get pretty wet.<br><br>I know women will say that wetness =/= arousal. Like I said, my ex never denied me sex. However, literally and I mean LITERALLY every girl (even girls who currently had an IUD) I&#039;ve had sex with would be wet to the touch before I even got to her vagina. So I would think that wetness = current attraction level (burning desire to have sex with you). <br><br>An example being; I had a FWB and she would get pretty wet.

An incel has nothing to offer in a relationship. Women will never even give him the time of day. On the other hand, a psychotic whore has nothing of value to offer in a relationship other than her body, which plenty of men are willing to attain just because she&#039;s pretty. Some great men choose to become involved with awful women knowing full well what they&#039;re getting into. Any sane woman would never do the same.<br><br>Many women feel that they deserve a strong partner despite not achieving much on their own to &quot;earn&quot; said partner. Which means that they feel they have something to offer the man that is worthy of his attention and loyalty. Like anyone, women must be aware of their shortcomings. Yet a woman with a multitude of issues will still throw herself at a well-groomed, high income, useful and dependable man. And on occasion, she will succeed in getting the man she wants.<br><br>My epiphany is that both the man and the woman are fully aware that the woman has nothing to offer other than her body. Why else would a high caliber man settle for a low caliber woman? This means that women must fully admit that the &quot;strong independent&quot; archetype is complete bullshit and they have absolutely no problem with it. It sounds too harsh to be true, but I have seen it time and time again with the women that have thrown themselves at me. It doesn&#039;t add up any other way. Most women do not care about being strong or self sufficient or any of that because they subscribe to the idea that they can just spread their legs for a desirable man and seal the deal. And somehow, they don&#039;t see anything wrong with that.<br><br>Either that or women don&#039;t even think about any of this shit at all and they are as shallow as they complain men to be.

Yes, many men have nothing to offer. It&#039;s unfair that women that have nothing to offer can still be rewarded, but I understand why that&#039;s the way it is. Beyond that, the concept of &quot;fairness&quot; is a human construct; it means nothing in terms of survival, i.e. mating and reproduction.<br><br>I am in further agreement that relationships are built on emotions and they should be.

I get that loneliness and anxiety make people desperate, but if they learned to be happy with themselves first and foremost, being single wouldn&#039;t be so scary and they would be shaping themselves into a better partner when they do find the right person.

I wanted to know if I was eating her ass the night before he ejaculated in it. I could just puke at the thought. Regardless, she picked up every night. We had a good time, and it went well. I actually loved calling her. She was funny and the perfect amount of slutty. My test results came back the day before we were gonna fuck again. I was clean, somehow. How the fuck. I am so lucky. But from now on, i&#039;m bringing a fucking condom. If she doesn&#039;t like it, fuck it. <br><br>We go to the hotel and I bring the rubbers. She isn&#039;t too happy, but she goes along with it. <br><br>Holy fuck, I&#039;ve never put a condom on before. I&#039;ve been rawdogging granny for 2 years because she was past menopause. <br><br>I had to turn the other way to hide my fumbling fingers. I&#039;m almost 30 years old, putting a condom on for the very first time. Eventually, I get it on, or so. I thought. I become clumsy. I can&#039;t get her bra off anymore. I lick her nipples and her piercing got caught on my tongue and poked her. Okay, enough foreplay.<br><br>I penetrate her with my wrapped-up dick and start thrusting. As I said, I am obese and have no upper-body strength, and being on top is impossible, but I try. After maybe 30 seconds, I become exhausted. Where is my previous stamina? I exit her and I saw the condom popped. What the fuck do I do? She won&#039;t get pregnant cause she has an IUD so that&#039;s no problem, but what about a potential STD? Then she tells me &quot;if it makes you feel any better, i didn&#039;t have sex with anyone since the last time we had sex.&quot;<br><br>What? Really? I don&#039;t fucking believe it.

She said it made her feel gross. Probably her christian upbringing.<br><br>Now.. I like to be ridden, but every night for a week is too much of the same.

First night we had sex, she unbuckled my pants and gave me the literal best blowjob ever. I never thought i&#039;d be down with the gargling shit they do in porn, but it FELT so fucking good. Literally a pornstar-level BJ. Then she took the rest of my clothes off and told me that i have a &quot;hot body.&quot; Like, what? Fuck it, i&#039;ll go along with it. She took me to the couch and did reverse cowgirl while looking back at me and whimpering &quot;d-daddy...&quot;<br><br>I was like 99% about to cum but i wanted to last longer so i asked her to get on the bed and let me try doggystyle for a bit even though it&#039;s my lesst favorite position.

We did doggystyle for a bit, i started getting flaccid, then she got a little concerned, but then i just told her to ride me and i could cum.

The smell of blood makes me nauseous. I took a viagra pill, but i still kept going lightly limp when i caught a whiff. I told her i needed a few minutes to recharge, then we could go again, because i needed to breathe a bit. I was eating her ass a bit, trying to avoid as much blood as possible, so she understood and went to wash up a bit. For some reason, when she came back, the smell of soap and the tiny hairs on her back got me back up real quick. I flipped her over and gave her the best thrusting my fat fucking ass could give her. About 2 minutes, tops. Not impressive, no, but again, my testosterone was at an all-time high so i was rushing it. She started smiling at me with her cute little dimples and gorgeous eyes and told me to lay on my back so she can look at my body while she rides me.<br><br>I came so hard again inside her and with so much, it felt like i was cumming for like 10 seconds straight.

And inspection and some crash course Youtube helps. Cosmetic stuff like bad paint or carpet may look bad but can be fixed fairly easy with some time and money so don&#039;t overvalue those like most people. Also asbestos was banned in July 12, 1989 in the US and lead was in 1978, so any house after late 1989 is required to not have a bunch of those hazards. So I tend to like ones built in the 1990&#039;s as it is after most bad stuff was banned but before builders got super cheap, but that&#039;s a trend not a rule so you still have to do your research. Look out for DIY, that tends to have extreme results as you either get someone who knows and cares which is great or an idiot who made the place an accident waiting to happen.

You want to go buck naked onto your front porch and take a morning piss? Nobody\u2019s there to stop you. Want to shoot squirrels from the back porch and learn how to make them into a nice stew? Have at it. Pretty much the only three rules that are enforced out in the sticks are: Don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t hurt other people, and don\u2019t go on somebody else\u2019s property. So long as you don\u2019t do it in front of the lone cop in the county nobody really cares about the rest. <br><br>Next is country people. As the last detail might have implied they are a very \u2018live and let live\u2019 kind of people so long as they don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re trying to force your city ideals on them. These people also party like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I\u2019d kill to have a bonfire out in the woods with the boys again.<br><br>Lastly, at least where I was, you don\u2019t have to wait in line for practically anything. If there\u2019s more than four cars in the McDonalds drive through it\u2019s a busy day for them. There\u2019s only two restaurants in town where you have to wait on a table, and that\u2019s only on Friday/Saturday nights. Lastly, any type of service you need, plumbing, heating, electrical, are only booked a day or two out at most. And everything costs less, to boot.<br><br>In short, make friends who\u2019ll introduce you to country life and how it\u2019s supposed to be done.

You cannot throw your entire hand because you pulled a shit card. Invest in yourself, find things you enjoy, preferably things that involve other people. Keep a good sleep routine, same for eating and exercise. You do not deserve to be miserable.

Firstly, you most likely have depression, which is warping how you perceive everything. If you are depressed, you don&#039;t realise your perception is being warped because depressed people always think they are extremely logical and objective. This is in fact an anti-cope, they have to believe this or the whole description of reality created by the depressed mind comes crashing down. So your first priority is ameliorating your depression. You can talk to a doctor, try some pills if you&#039;re up for it. Personally I found cognitive behavioural therapy the most useful approach in the long run. This can be with a therapist but there are also many books on this.<br>Secondly, sex has a special status in our culrure now, but on a biological level it&#039;s just a form of socialising, part of a spectrum of social activities of varying intimacy that humans naturally do. You can already socialise, we are socialising right now in a limited way. The more you socialise, the more you form relationships with people, the more likely it is that you will at some point have sex.

Not to mention you now control your own fate. Being an object of attraction shouldn\u2019t even be that life defining for you.

Growth can mean money or it can mean skills or it can mean getting from a bad place to a good place like building a great home that\u2019s fulfilling to come home to. The problem is if too much growth is expected in the relationship from either individual like the concept of not being ready for a relationship is tricky for either person.

My gf was somewhat hesitant, I told her it would be a platonic &quot;I have a gf&quot; meeting. Hit it off really well (I talked too much) and I wanted so badly to spend more time with her. Struggled to find an appropriate time to tell her I had a girlfriend. Walked her to her car once the coffee shop closed and told her then. She seemed somewhat disappointed but thanked me for telling her. I was trying to hide my own disappointment when we parted ways. Sent a message the next day thanking her for her time, she was her usual friendly self but hasn&#039;t taken me up on hanging out again (potentially with the gf as well). Things haven&#039;t been great in my relationship for the last couple of years, but at this point we have spent the better part of our adult lives together and been through alot.

It&#039;s understandable that you&#039;re worried about what would happen if your mom were to pass away, especially since you&#039;re currently dependent on her for housing and support. However, it&#039;s important to remember that worrying about something that may or may not happen in the future can be unproductive and can even hinder your ability to move forward and make positive changes in your life.<br><br>One way to cope with these fears is to focus on the things that you can control. For example, you can take steps to become more independent and self-sufficient, such as seeking out job opportunities and building your work experience, saving money, and developing skills that will be useful in the future. It may also be helpful to have a plan in place for what you would do if your mom were to pass away, even if it&#039;s just a rough outline. Having a plan can give you a sense of control and can help you feel more prepared to handle any challenges that may arise.<br><br>Another way to cope with your fears is to reach out to others for support. This could be a close friend or family member who you can talk to about your worries, or a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and develop strategies for managing them. It may also be helpful to connect with others who are in a similar situation, whether through online support groups or in-person meetups.<br><br>Ultimately, it&#039;s important to try to focus on the present moment and the things that you can control, rather than worrying excessively about the future.
