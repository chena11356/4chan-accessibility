I\u2019m pretty curt with her but polite and notice her biting her lip a few times when I turn to look her in the eye during the conversation. I throw out casually that I\u2019m going to the cafeteria to grab coffee and if she wants me to bring her some and she invites herself to go with me.

The emotional shit was still there, though. I was highly risk averse, living essentially multiple lives between school, my friends, my sisters, my mom, and my grandma (she would watch us while my mom worked toward a masters degree while I was in high school). I did what I could to hide everything bad about myself, which made the really bad shit that inevitably occurred stand out dramatically.<br>I was scared of females, under the impression that my mom would judge harshly anyone I attempted to date. I later found out that wasn&#039;t the case, but when a girl sent me a bikini pic I completely panicked thinking any and all potential porn use as a minor would get my mom fired from her job and render us homeless (yes, this is what she told me when she saw porn in the browser history once).<br>1/?", "time": 1674014418, "resto": 28147199}, {"no": 28147726, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:15:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28147616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28147616</a><br>While in high school, I realized how mediocre a cook my mom was. In hindsight, it was that she was too fucking busy with work, her school, 3 kids, and trying to work with attorneys to get my dad out of prison, but it made it that available food in the house was uncommon outside of dinners. I learned to cook so I could be able to eat more than the shitty cafeteria meals at lunch and the frozen, processed meals that awaited me for dinner. However, this was always a delicate practice because I was only guessing at what raw food was &quot;planned&quot; for meals, and my attempts to feed myself got me in trouble a number of times.<br>As implied with my &quot;multiple lives&quot; statement, I became quite good at lying convincingly and garnering pity from people. My mom never bought it, but peers, teachers, and others near me would never pay it a second thought if I was truthful. <br>I think one of the biggest ironies is that while it was a horrible, abusive situation, I have only recently been breaking the dependence on my mom for my life (I&#039;m in my 30s). I relied on her for so fucking much in my 20s, when I truly shouldn&#039;t have. She was not a good advisor for school/work situations, she was far from a good confidant for my romantic life, and frankly even visits had some strange sense of tension and obligation, particularly around holidays. <br>I&#039;m kind of rambling now, but it&#039;s really hard to say which was more impactful -- the abuse or the lack of masculine upbringing. My sisters claim I had it easier, but they&#039;re both married with children and I&#039;ve never had much self confidence and ability to be vulnerable with people. They&#039;ve taken great risks in their lives, and I&#039;m the one who barely survived a suicide attempt.<br>I might can articulate specific issues better, but I think this incoherent mess should suffice for now.", "time": 1674015314, "resto": 28147199}, {"no": 28147741, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:17:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28147199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28147199</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how has it psychologically affect you without having a present father figure?</span><br>how would you ever know? you can&#039;t a/b double blind test this. everything is just gonna be a guess", "time": 1674015450, "resto": 28147199}, {"no": 28147742, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:17:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28147604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28147604</a><br>Too bad you envy his balls just going off and doing hus own thing, feget", "time": 1674015469, "resto": 28147199}, {"no": 28147758, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:19:46", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28147604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28147604</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wagie getting dabbed on by fatherless zoomer</span><br>Seems pretty based to me", "time": 1674015586, "resto": 28147199}, {"no": 28147818, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)23:29:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28147199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28147199</a><br>It messed me up very badly.

I forgot about my ex completely. <br><br>But now thoughts are coming back. We blocked each other on everything, and I can&#039;t take her back even if I wanted to, too much bad blood. Thing is, she was my first for a lot of things - first unprotected sex, first official gf, first sober sex, first girl to live with to name a few.

I really love this girl and she loves me, but there is a huge problem that is bothering me. She is extremely sadistic. She did some really bad things in the past, i.e. tortured people, that even I dont know the full details of because it bothers her. She is more in control of herself now but she admits that the urges to torture are still there, not even torturing someone as a form of punishment but just torturing for the sake of it, the pleasure she feels. <br>I dont know what to do really. I genuinely love her and she is my first and, aside from pre-pubescent stuff, i&#039;m hers. She is an enigma in a lot of ways, having problems with expressing her emotions and a lot of the times coming off as cold. The only reason she ever told me about this is because she loves me and we agreed to be honest with each other. I do believe that people can change but I am still afraid. She did admit she had bad fantasies about me before we got really close and now she doesn&#039;t feel that stuff towards me. She enjoys gore sometimes which I despise, and she &quot;jokingly&quot; said that she&#039;d want to be the torturer in a horror movie we were talking about. I understand that everyone has an edgy phase, myself included, but this isn&#039;t it since she actually did do terrible things. <br>I am really lost.<br>1. I genuinely love her aside of that part of her, and she does seem to have it mostly under control. <br>2. If we separate, that might hurt her really badly and maybe she loses control over her urges again, especially if the reason I give her is that I am afraid of it<br>3.

Tldr, she tortured three people in extreme ways, mostly in a precise surgical way with her having full control, and that is the &quot;worst&quot; she has done that I know off, so there are probably other instances as well. She got caught on one instance and suffers consequences for it, i.e. meds, check ups and a horrible relation with her real life acquaintances. <br>But she is constantly changing for the better. When we first got into a relationship and she opened up about these things, she admitted she would go out alone at night trying to &quot;get attacked or confronted&quot; so she had an excuse to fulfill her violent urges.

I kind of feel really bad about it but I still stick with the idea that she was not interested and being nice, hence why she never followed up with her last message.<br><br>If it helps in making you know what was happening, I felt that she was too distant since she was always busy on weekends. I of course felt like I was kept in the dark and my imagination led me to believe she was already taken and she was just looking for attention from someone else. She assured me this was not the case though but I couldn&#039;t shrug off that something just wasn&#039;t right. Her going absent after going to a night club just solidified it for me though.<br><br>I think they lose interest because you are way too distant and they don&#039;t want to press on in fear that you may be with somebody else or that you&#039;re just going to waste their time by not having your dates turn into anything serious.", "time": 1674104411, "resto": 28153434}, {"no": 28153716, "now": "01/19/23(Thu)00:44:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28153472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28153472</a><br>No, I don\u2019t think so <br><br><a href=\"#p28153522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28153522</a><br>Maybe.

This pattern can be frustrating and confusing, but it may be related to the way you interact with men at the beginning of a relationship.<br><br>One possible reason for this pattern is that you may be unconsciously sending mixed signals. By being detached and ignoring men at first, you may be creating a sense of mystery and intrigue that initially draws them to you. However, once you begin to reciprocate their feelings, they may feel that the mystery is gone and lose interest.<br><br>Another possibility is that you may be attracting men who are not emotionally mature or ready for a serious relationship. These men may become infatuated quickly, but lack the ability to sustain the interest and commitment over time.<br><br>To avoid this pattern, it may be helpful to be more mindful of your behavior and communication in the early stages of a relationship. Try to be more direct and clear about your intentions and feelings, and avoid sending mixed signals. Additionally, it&#039;s important to be mindful of the type of men you&#039;re attracted to, and make sure they are emotionally mature and ready for a serious relationship.<br><br>It&#039;s also important to focus on building a strong sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and not relying on the validation of others to feel good about yourself.

When you have a solid sense of self-worth, you are less likely to rely on others for validation and are more likely to be able to detach yourself from a relationship if it doesn&#039;t work out.<br><br>It&#039;s also important to have realistic expectations when it comes to relationships and not to put too much pressure on them.

But this is sort of thing is a great example of correlation =/= causation. There&#039;s no proof that the drug directly caused the blood clot, nor that the blood clot would have occurred independently of the drug, and that&#039;s why it gets listed as a potential side effect.<br><br>But blood clots are a side effect of hundreds of different conditions, lifestyles and environmental factors. In a large sample (which it&#039;s fairly safe to assume that the testing groups for a common drug like birth control would be large, probably in the hundreds if not the thousands) you are bound to dig up a number of people with underlying and pre-existing conditions that predispose them to other medical issues that are unrelated to the trial.<br><br>In some cases the long list of side effects on drugs is directly related to the demographics of the testing samples. For instance, drugs that are commonly used to treat older people often list side effects that are simply caused by old age, like joint pain. There&#039;s no evidence that the drug causes joint pain directly, but your sample is 100 people over the age of 50, so the odds that some of them will experience and report joint pain during the trial is high. And as someone who&#039;s been in a drug trial I&#039;ll just point out that the trials coordinators WANT you to report any little abnormality.

Aimless wandering searching for the final revelation, a new purpose, and new happiness is fraught with disappointment because our lives are first physical and we are biochemical beings who have biochemical needs. The realization of this elevates the physical life to utmost importance before all else. This means your quality of sleep, diet, and exercise should be a \u201ccore\u201d of one\u2019s life from which everything else stems \u2014 including the big question raised in the OP. Having these in check does a lot to one\u2019s mood and perspective, curbing a lot of aimless wandering and pointless questioning. We are creatures of biological habit and that\u2019s easy to forget in our post-modern, post-scarcity world. I think of it as starting with the basics: why worry about the materials of the roof if the foundation isn\u2019t even built? Everything in its own order rather than a miracle pill, a final epiphany, or a new distraction of the month. If you are healthy fit and in a good mood because your chemical processes are optimized by good habits you may change the definition of will make you happy and content; it could be something simple like a morning walk through nature. The point I\u2019m getting at is that happiness is not something you find, it\u2019s something that\u2019s a byproduct of what you\u2019re doing. The best and easiest way to everyone can achieve success here is to take of their health, exercise, sleep, and eat right.", "time": 1674076696, "resto": 28147853}, {"no": 28151513, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)16:27:58", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28151461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28151461</a><br>I am also saying that is it easy to confuse those biochemical needs with philosophical needs whereas questions of philosophy and purpose should first be grounded in practical healthy physical routines which I already mentioned.
