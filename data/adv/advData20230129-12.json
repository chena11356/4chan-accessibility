I had an ugly fuckbuddy and I had no problem at all with her talking to and meeting other guys, we went to a club together and I even told her she can talk to other guys, but the reason I had no problem with that is probably because I wasn&#039;t very attracted to her, this girl is much hotter and that&#039;s probably why I feel it&#039;s harder to have that attitude, plus the fuckbuddy was very eager to talk to me and meet me, always replying fast, initiating texting a lot etc. Even though I myself don&#039;t know if I want a serious girlfriend right now and have hopes of getting dates with girls hotter than this girl who is flaky, it&#039;s hard to have the attitude that I don&#039;t care if she talks to other guys, I guess it&#039;s the fact I might be low priority for her that sucks, I say I&#039;m ok with us talking and meeting only occasionally, but I feel it&#039;s hard to deal with being low priority for her, so I don&#039;t know if I feel ok with her possibly meeting a lot of other guys although I said so.

It is essential that you work on these aspects. To do this you have to know yourself, forgive your sins, and accept yourself as you are with both good things and bad things. It can be difficult, and if necessary seek therapy.<br>Well, having said that, there is the most important question, where to get girls. What I recommend is that you go to a charity center, and help the most needy people, there are usually girls. You can also go to a dance school, and there you will find many girls, of course you will be ashamed for never having danced in your life, and for never having danced with a woman, but you have to overcome those fears. Usually good girls go to those places, and you will feel better about yourself since you will learn new skills or you will be helping others, which regardless of the girlfriend is a very good thing.<br>Then there are the more secondary tips, dress well, be hygienic, be respectful, among others. There are many personal image videos and tutorials. In fact, there are entire guides of people who are dedicated to this, whether it&#039;s dancing, improving your self-esteem, taking care of your hair, or those things. But women want a self-confident man, someone loyal, sincere, and respectful. Don&#039;t be afraid to show yourself as you are.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izG<wbr>wDsrQ1eQ", "filename": "guide", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1294, "h": 602, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 58, "tim": 1674971914557545, "time": 1674971914, "md5": "N1j5v36LGH/OkNWZflzPeQ==", "fsize": 143148, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225549, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)01:17:14", "name": "OP", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225435</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Horrible upbringing</span><br>The past is not worth living in, forgive your parents and try to move on.

Did you think that just by learning to draw you could earn money? Art doesn&#039;t move the world, nobody gives a shit about art, if I wanted to find a drawing of anything I just google it. But I think in order for you to make money drawing, you have to specialize in very fetishistic and disgusting shit, it&#039;s not morally correct, and you would have to deal with the worst scourge of this miserable world. Draw porn that is very hard to find on google, usually it will be very degenerate and dirty stuff, or illegal realistic content. I heard that furry porn pays well, but you have to do something within it that is very fetish and niche, something so nasty and specific so you don&#039;t have a lot of competition. You can use the money earned and reinvest it in buying used things in garage stores and selling them on facebook or ebay.<br>I really recommend that you look for another way to earn money, art is a beautiful activity, but it is difficult to make it profitable, I think you should look for a profession as a farmer or something like that if you want to go and live far from society.<br>https://youtu.be/o1tj2zJ2Wvg", "filename": "( ( my place", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1386, "h": 1040, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 93, "tim": 1674975889900682, "time": 1674975889, "md5": "quurKykUNBCTjwZ0cAkO+g==", "fsize": 585753, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225711, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:06:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225706</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just become a farmer bro</span><br>I CAN&#039;T.

Your teeth are a small part of all your flaws, a small part of all the shit you are, so be thankful for that at least.<br>I only answer you because unlike you, I keep my word. The only advice I can give you is to free yourself from this earthly world and return to where you belong, dirty being of the devil.<br>Enjoy your song, damn scourge.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZ<wbr>j7YW5oFQ&amp;t=0s", "time": 1674977241, "resto": 28225269}, {"no": 28225810, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)02:31:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28225792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28225792</a><br>Weak.

So how is it going anon?<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved.&quot;</span><br><br>Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.", "filename": "1574742683565", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1674924196250407, "time": 1674924196, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 28220506}, {"no": 28221483, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:44:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28220506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28220506</a><br><a href=\"#p28221474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28221474</a><br>So read NDE accounts and basically all you can about NDEs. Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here. As NDErs say, everybody on Earth is a star on the other side for having the courage and endurance to come to this nightmare hellhole.", "filename": "1615120187322", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 225, "h": 225, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1674924276600878, "time": 1674924276, "md5": "VSla6OBrWteYgUkZkobScA==", "fsize": 7568, "resto": 28220506}, {"no": 28221488, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)11:47:19", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28220506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28220506</a><br><a href=\"#p28221474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28221474</a><br><a href=\"#p28221483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28221483</a><br>So you already have spent eternity with her, and will get to again after this life.

I believe that to get out of depression, tiredness, fatigue and all that shit, you first have to work your body, since a healthy body is a healthy mind, for that it is good to do sports, whatever it is. it is as long as it keeps our body busy. Another important factor is studying, it doesn&#039;t really matter what, it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s for university, school or for yourself, you have to do it to keep your mind occupied with something productive. I would also say that looking for a job, or generating income with a startup, as this will keep our mind and body busy, while giving us money, in itself gives us a reason to keep going, especially when you are working on something of your own.<br><br>Another important point is to stop comparing yourself to others, stop thinking that the other is better than you because you have more knowledge, money or physical condition. It is also very silly to think about issues such as superiority or inferiority, we are all human, we all have problems and difficulties in life, of course there are degrees of this, but this does not have to be a limitation. You have to focus on yourself, on your problems, on your virtues, on your life, and not on that of others.<br><br>Another issue is guilt and remorse, which depending on the person can be the easiest part, or difficult to overcome, because it is easy to forgive others, but sometimes it is difficult, if not impossible, to forgive yourself. No matter how dirty your hands are, they can always be cleaned. You have to accept your sins, accept what you did wrong and live with it. Go to a priest, a psychologist, or tell someone you trust what you did, this can help, it doesn&#039;t matter if you think psychology is a joke, or if you don&#039;t believe in God, the important thing is to somehow get the weight off What are you wearing.", "filename": "b3d", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 657, "h": 527, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 200, "tim": 1674863961876206, "time": 1674863961, "md5": "/ckkLToCRMe9uKIXDVDZTA==", "fsize": 38305, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "in-this-thread-we-are-going-to-look-for-the-cure", "replies": 63, "images": 12, "unique_ips": 32}, {"no": 28216874, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)18:59:55", "name": "OP", "com": "My least favorite part of this thread is going to a psychiatrist and being prescribed medication, which in itself sucks.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like. In my opinion physical improvement is the number one best thing you can do if you are unhappy with your life because it lays the foundation for everything else.

I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died.

Some people will tell you about how they have a passion for making other people rich, but they&#039;re mostly just coping.

You should find something you&#039;re good at that you can tolerate without burning out that MAXIMIZES cash flow and pursue that. Ideally it should pay you to learn skills that you can deploy outside of employment so you can exit employment sooner rather than later. Think of employment as a bridge from virgin neetdom to chad neetdom. Some examples of viable options are trades, sales, it, coding meme, internet marketing. You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

My ex also didn\u2019t like that, after I randomly and suddenly cut off this girl I became friends with, the girl texted me worried to see if I was okay and why I up and cut her off so fast. Come to find out, when we broke up, my ex admitted to me that she texted this girl I was friends with for a week to see if we flirted or had \u201ca thing\u201d behind my ex\u2019s back. My ex showed me the texts between her and the girl and the girl said she\u2019s \u201clesbian so you don\u2019t need to worry, we never did anything\u201d (meaning me and the girl obviously). I was upset about the whole thing, but I wondered if the girl ACTUALLY was lesbian or if it was to cover for me and lie to my ex<br><br>After my ex and I broke up, I actually started finding the girl attractive now.

Then the female friend confesses that she&#039;s interested in you. You have two options: Be a massive whore, break your brother&#039;s heart, and date the girl you KNOW he&#039;s crushing on. Or reject her politely, in solidarity with your bro.<br><br>No matter what you choose, you&#039;re gonna make a horrible mistake. Just abandon all hope of dating the older sister, and don&#039;t lead the younger sister on.<br><br>If you&#039;re not actually all that SET on the older sister and you&#039;ve just got a minor crush on her, and you genuinely like the younger sister as a person, and see her as dateable, go for the younger sister. It&#039;s scummy to date the &#039;second-best&#039; sister if you think poorly of her, and you consider her older sister to be way better, but it&#039;s not scummy if you genuinely respect and like them both, and find them both attractive.

His case is a generation one and my case is a generation three, so they look similar but somewhat different. They said I was acting \u201csuspicious\u201d when they questioned me (I gone out for a few beers and came back pretty tired and a little angry) so they went to my Chief and DIVO. We\u2019re all on the same ship, different departments. They\u2019re also saying they saw the case on my desk in plain view on Monday, but didn\u2019t say anything because they thought it was mine until they saw my own case.<br><br>This is just insanely frustrating. I got my brand new airpods, why would I steal someone\u2019s else\u2019s just to hold on to? And then leave it where somebody could find it? I don\u2019t know how to sell shit on eBay. My parents are always willing to help me out if I want a gadget of gismo. I have absolutely no fucking idea how they ended up on my desk, My best guess is that I absent mindedly threw them on my desk while cleaning the room.<br><br>This same guy accused me of using his shampoo a few months ago which I apologized for by buying him a new bottle, which he probably mentioned.", "filename": "MME73", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 2000, "h": 2000, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674931644535029, "time": 1674931644, "md5": "0v/Lo8JDD954TFpLN15rfg==", "fsize": 287286, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-being-falsely-accused-of-stealing-a-pair-of", "replies": 7, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 28222133, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)13:50:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "repeat after me<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go fuck yourself, not my problem you lost your shit. </span><br><br>Then piss in their shampoo.", "time": 1674931820, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28222167, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)13:57:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28222120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28222120</a><br>You could tell him to track his pair with the tracking app.", "time": 1674932257, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28224093, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:04:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1674954290, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28224104, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:06:54", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28222120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28222120</a><br>soldiers are fucking retarded. airpods have an identification code. if he doesn&#039;t know his code or doesn&#039;t have apple care plus that&#039;s his own broke retarded fault. or you did steal them in which case godspeed.", "time": 1674954414, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28224123, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)20:09:47", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28224104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28224104</a><br>Sailor", "time": 1674954587, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28224609, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)21:48:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Bump", "time": 1674960518, "resto": 28222120}, {"no": 28224621, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)21:50:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "At least add the retarded other parts if you are just going to repost this", "time": 1674960642, "resto": 28222120}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28223240, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)17:47:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "how long should i wait before starting to hint sex to a girl without appearing pushy", "filename": "1661050072774722", "ext": ".webm", "w": 548, "h": 770, "tn_w": 177, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1674946023509045, "time": 1674946023, "md5": "DODYwQ8+J9GxS57W4V19tQ==", "fsize": 1940480, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-long-should-i-wait-before-starting-to-hint", "replies": 16, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 12}, {"no": 28223267, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)17:52:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28223240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28223240</a><br>i would also like to hear this, but from the opposite end, how long should i wait to hint sex to the guy im dating without seeming easy", "time": 1674946333, "resto": 28223240}, {"no": 28223276, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)17:53:31", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "just write her &quot;sex? y/n&quot;<br>that&#039;s the less time-wasting way and ~1/16 girls (~1/5 girls on Tinder) appreciate this straightforwardness<br>it helps when you don&#039;t look like ass", "time": 1674946411, "resto": 28223240}, {"no": 28223287, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)17:55:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28223267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28223267</a><br>you will be considered easy by Chad and incels, if you don&#039;t wait till marriage<br>as for simps, it doesn&#039;t matter since they&#039;ll worship you no matter what", "time": 1674946548, "resto": 28223240}, {"no": 28223321, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)18:02:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28223287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28223287</a><br><br>Retard", "time": 1674946954, "resto": 28223240}, {"no": 28223331, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)18:04:41", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28223321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28223321</a><br>what you want me to say?

Which is obviously important for a good relationship, but it&#039;s unknowable until after it&#039;s already happened. This is useless for guiding behavior. Mixing these meanings only devalues commitment in practice, since it removes obligation.<br>Having a formal commitment of marriage is the most consistent way to serve the ideal of monogamy (one lifetime partner). Not only is it a way to enforce it--something impossible if &quot;commitment&quot; is just a personal feeling that can be unilaterally changed--but you would presumably only agree to such a commitment if you ALSO felt committed. Plus, as an institution, the standard is *consistent*. As in, it is a very simple way to ensure that people have similar values and goals, much simpler than pretending that whatever informal arrangement you have will end perfectly (even though that&#039;s wrong more often than not). <br><br>Legitimizing sex outside of marriage destroys that standard, to the detriment of anyone who values what the standard upholds: true, lifelong, monogamy. Even controlling for religiosity, people who wait both divorce less and have happier marriages.
