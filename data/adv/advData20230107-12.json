More calories going to muscle means less going to fat. But doing some exercise is mandatory to induce subcutaneous fat (soft, mostly on legs, hips, and ass) as opposed to visceral fat (which goes under your abs and other muscles, creating a more rigid potbelly). But, having a solid, lean muscle layer under that fat, will push it outwards and help give it a good shape (as opposed to being a beanbag). This is all very solid advice when given to a woman, OP should at least be able to get closer than he is now by following similar steps.

He&#039;s 16-17 now, we divorced with his big sister around 2 years ago and I lost contact with him shortly after. We dated and were married with his sister for a loooong time, so I pretty much was always in his life since he can remember. I have little brothers the same age, and that kid just became like an extra brother to me. He didn&#039;t have any brothers of his own, I feel like me being a big brother to him was a big thing for him. His mom used to tell me that often.<br><br>We used to all kinds of stuff together, same as I did with my own brothers. Sports, helping with homework, just talking and watching youtube, whatever.<br><br>After the divorce I tried to keep doing stuff with him occasionally and it was fine for a while, we went out to play basketball like normal and stuff. But at some point pretty soon, our lives just got distant, and I didn&#039;t want to keep pushing it. I was afraid I might seem overly pushy for asking him to do stuff randomly all the time. And in the back of my head I didn&#039;t want to stay that close to my ex-wife anymore. I just didn&#039;t ask him to do stuff anymore, I decided that if he wanted to do stuff and asked me, I&#039;d say yes immediately, but I wouldn&#039;t ask him. It got quiet pretty fast and we haven&#039;t seen after that. Some months later he called me for a couple of seconds. I asked him what that was about, and he said just an accident. I think it was him deleting my number on his phone... <br><br>How do you try to reconnect at this point? I&#039;d love to know what he&#039;s up to and what kind of guy he&#039;s growing up to be.

As a sex fiend myself (bisexual) who enjoys twink bussy, it is VERY hard for me not to chat or try to link on that app. However, after recently accepting the fact that, yes I do like certain types of men, my biggest thing is to try to get into a monogamous relationship or fwb situation just so the negative parts of the gay community (stis and rampant hoeage) don&#039;t affect me. So, I&#039;m assuming he is a lot like me. After being committed to dating only women for so long, being on Grindr and being complimented and just...wanted, is intoxicating. He may actually be addicted. Nymphomania is a real thing.<br>Second thing - Did you make your intentions apparent? Grindr is not a dating app it&#039;s a hookup app. People advertise for who they are and what they want. You need to make sure he understands what you want.<br>Last few things and my general advice - I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re a top or verse. Act like one, tell him what you want, and if isn&#039;t about them just accept it or end things there.<br>Good luck man. The biggest problem with gay people is the lack of monogamy and unsafe sex.

I say that as someone with a lot of biochem background who also took 3 shots (and has chest pains). <br>I want to be very clear with you. Chest pains are basically the worst symptom you could be experiencing for an illness. They indicate that your heart, literally the single most crucial organ you have, is in pain and thus failing. You need to get to the doctor IMMEDIATELY. They can provide basic treatment, monitoring, and will enroll you in possible compensation programs (depending on your nationality).<br>The issue is that the mRNA got into your (and probably my) bloodstream and then circulated throughout the body. The mRNA is encased in a lipid nanoparticle for transport. This lipid disproportionately goes to certain areas like the liver, which is probably the safest place for it to go. But the circulation means that it necessarily hits the heart too. Suddenly, your cardiac tissue is producing these horribly toxic spike proteins. Not only does it hurt the other cardiac tissue around it, but it circulates the spike through your entire body. <br>This is bad for other organs, sure, but it&#039;s worst for the heart (and brain) because they cannot really repair themselves naturally. Your cardiac tissue can&#039;t really repair; it can only scar. So anything you lose in each injection is never coming back and your heart is permanently damaged. <br>I also recently had appendicitis. It is likely that the spike protein has antagonistic properties to the immune system. I have seen evidence contradicting this, but not much compared to the mountain showing it does. It seems almost certain that the vaccine is weakening our immune systems for this reason.<br>For the record, all of this stuff was suggested and floated before the vaccine mandate began.

But some amount of leakage is inevitable, and we suspect that this leakage amounts to far more damage than is currently supposed by most scientists. Additionally, such notions are based on perfect injection procedure. If mistakes are made, as is likely to happen when you administer some 13 billion COVID shots, then the leakage is far worse. <br>Lastly, these studies aren&#039;t actually as definitive as you think. We&#039;ve actually be surprised to find just how much the lipid nanoparticle prefers to go to the liver, for example. Remember that the mRNA can last for days and the spike protein lasts for weeks. <br>Additionally, what you and every other moron on the planet is forgetting here is that the spike protein itself is a homing vector. That is, it is the portion of the virus used to interface with its host and it has preferences for particular receptors on particular cells. Because of this, it causes leaked protein to target particular regions of the body. This means that the vast majority of the spike protein that does leak ends up reaching places like the heart, the kidneys, and so on. The issue is that the spike protein is damaging these organs by effectively the same mechanism as the virus itself, so the damage blends together when studied in aggregate. <br>I am willing to believe that I am wrong or that my ideas could be refined, but it is no longer a debate that the vaccine can induce heart disease and does so at a more frequent rate than previous vaccines.

A day can be two days, a week, a month(prolonged events such as a sprain, breaking a leg, depression) - this will alter the calculation significantly which is why closure has to be attained properly.
