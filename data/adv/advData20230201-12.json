Apparently around the same time, my roomates friend left his airpods in our room and lost them. Two weeks ago, I guess while I was out of the room they found both cases of airpods on my desk, with his being sorta shoved in the corner and obscured a little (but still in plain view on the desk). His case is a generation one and my case is a generation three, so they look similar but somewhat different. They said I was acting \u201csuspicious\u201d when they questioned me (I gone out for a few beers and came back pretty tired and a little angry) so they went to my Chief and DIVO. We\u2019re all on the same ship, different departments. They\u2019re also saying they saw the case on my desk in plain view on Monday, but didn\u2019t say anything because they thought it was mine until they saw my own case.<br><br>This is just insanely frustrating. I got my brand new airpods, why would I steal someone\u2019s else\u2019s just to hold on to? And then leave it where somebody could find it? I don\u2019t know how to sell shit on eBay. My parents are always willing to help me out if I want a gadget of gismo. I have absolutely no fucking idea how they ended up on my desk, My best guess is that I absent mindedly threw them on my desk while cleaning the room.<br><br>This same guy accused me of using his shampoo a few months ago which I apologized for by buying him a new bottle, which he probably mentioned.<br><br>I am going to fucking kill myself over this stress", "filename": "CA5983C0-6AE6-46DE-9D57-EDBFCA024231", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 275, "h": 183, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1675222120157322, "time": 1675222120, "md5": "UIpdCD4jdc403DInvFVqnw==", "fsize": 5924, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "im-being-falsely-accused-of-stealing-a-pair-of", "replies": 8, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 9}, {"no": 28246273, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:29:28", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28246046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28246046</a><br>Yeah, it&#039;s the wrong version of airpods<br>You got a v1 and he&#039;s got a v3, or vice versa.", "time": 1675225768, "resto": 28246046}, {"no": 28246360, "now": "01/31/23(Tue)23:52:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28246046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28246046</a><br>Did you return the AirPods?

In the short term it certainly makes you feel better. Pain causes the body to release endorphins; so you are generating opioids inside the body when you do it. That has a calming effect - there&#039;s a strong sense of release; it helps you cope with stress and negative emotion, and can even make you feel kind of high. It is literally physically addictive after a while, of course, in the same way as taking opioid painkillers.

It&#039;d be a massive lie to say sex and romantic intimacy don&#039;t matter at all - but radical incels are caught in the opposite massive lie, that it&#039;s all-consumingly important to the point that it should be considered a Maslow level need immediately after food, water, and shelter. I fundamentally disagree with this.<br><br>As an ex-incel till like 29, the truth is that the overwhelming majority of life&#039;s joys and one&#039;s appreciation for them do not emerge from vagina or having women in your life that want to sleep with you. Sex feels nice, but jerking off achieves the same physical results. The romantic and emotional intimacy of a partner feel nice, but not to the point that if you had a good friendship with someone you&#039;d blindly accept exchanging it away to have that intimacy. Sexual and romantic emotional intimacy are very nice, but neither are going to make you feel &quot;whole&quot; if you don&#039;t already - and even when you have them, you won&#039;t guaranteed prefer it to alternatives, as they come at significant personal costs.<br><br>There are harsh tradeoffs to getting laid or dating. Even when you&#039;re dick-deep in pussy or in a truly loving relationship, you will, without a single hint of irony, miss those times when you were single and without women, because in those times, you were truly free. Dating or fucking around usually demands about 2-3 days of your free time a week to maintain personal standards, socialize, and keep up with needed bullshit, and I guarantee that you&#039;re already filling that time with stuff you need to do or enjoy - to get women, you must surrender parts of your life, parts you find important and meaningful, to make the space for these women. It&#039;s NOT a guaranteed winning trade.<br><br>Focus on building a life you find meaningful where you spend time with people you care about, who also care about you.

Don&#039;t ever think that you&#039;re nothing, an absolute nobody, for &quot;letting&quot; these things happen. There truly is a simple beauty to being alive, and you literally don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to happen in your future.

I think the idea sounds nice since it is basically a 3 month vacation where I will learn how to deal with my emotions in a healthier manner than alcohol.

The point is, I feel like right now what I should be doing is learning how to re-live my life without alcohol. Start working on uni again, reconnect with lost friends, etc. And I don&#039;t think being in an isolated place where the deodorant is special because otherwise people try to eat it to get high is the solution right now. If I ever, and I really do mean EVER touch alcohol again I will walk right up to the doctor and ask to be admited, but I don&#039;t feel ready yet.

Very often one hears it said that men ought to be free to worship God, each in his own way. This indeed is true, so far as it implies freedom of conscience and each man&#039;s duty of living up to the special lights that God has given him. But it can be very wrong if it means that we worship God in our way and not in His. Consider an analogy: the traffic situation would be tangled and desperate if we said that the American way of life allowed every man to drive a car in his way and not according to the traffic laws. Catastrophe would result if patients began saying to the doctor, &quot;I want to be cured in my own way, but not in yours,&quot; or if citizens said to the government,&quot;I want to pay my taxes, but in my own way and not in yours.&quot; Similarly, there is a tremendous egotism and conceit in those popular articles and lectures entitled &quot;My Idea of Religion,&quot; or &quot;My Idea of God.&quot; An individual religion can be as misleading and uninforrned as an individual astronomy or an individual mathematics.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Individuals who say, &#039;&#039;I will serve God in my way, and you serve God in your way,&quot; ought to inquire whether it would not be advisable to serve God in His Way. But it is precisely this prospect of a stable, universally true religion which frightens the modern soul. For if his conscience is uneasy he wants, instead, a religion which will leave out hell. If he has already married again against the law of Christ, he wants a religion that does not condemn divorce. Such a reservation means that a man wants to be saved, not in God&#039;s way, but in his. In thus refusing to moult his vain desires, he misses the flight to that &quot;Love that leaves all other beauty pain.&quot;</span>", "time": 1675253910, "resto": 28246683}, {"no": 28247776, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)07:18:36", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28247764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28247764</a><br>No", "time": 1675253916, "resto": 28246683}, {"no": 28247779, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)07:18:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28247758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28247758</a><br>Why do women mostly message the average or slightly below guys?", "time": 1675253936, "resto": 28246683}, {"no": 28247781, "now": "02/01/23(Wed)07:19:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28247752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28247752</a><br>When our shithead recently-arrived neighbour swore at and threatened my mother.

Actually getting better was much more about cooling the jets, and learning to let go of that thinking a little bit. Pulling your emotional investments out of the depression AND the hope.

YOU ARE KIDDING YOURSELF, YOUR VERY SOUL IS A LOSER SOUL\u201d, just let it do it, but if you can, try not looking for proof of that either.

It\u2019s the ultimate rebellion against the depression to just stop caring about it, no longer trying to fix it. It\u2019s the thing with brainwashing yourself with positive thinking as well. You have to decide that you trust it.<br><br>For example, I would sit down with a piece of paper, and write how I wanted things to be. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer difficult for me to do things that are good for me.

I literally thought that about every other person for a few months, when I was 16 before I turned 17. Thankfully I snapped out of it though. Can I get any special advice from you anons? I think I finally found out what was stopping me all this time, from living the life I wanted. I spoke to a psychiatrist a few months ago, they said they would call me for an intake in 12 weeks, and never did. I hope to eventually get therapy. I also suppress my own memories that are stressful and hard to accept, and I know they are real and sort of what really happened in the memory, but it seems like a dream or something fake.

If you let them they will drain you dry.<br><br>You should know, however, that your mother, though you may not be aware, has done you a favor by giving it to you straight. She says that you&#039;re a mistake, that you stress her out, that she would have rather not given birth to you. Listen to her; she is being honest with you. With her genuine feelings out on the table you don&#039;t have to delve through layers of deception in order to get to the core of her feelings. The problem for you, right now, is that you&#039;re projecting onto her a perception of her that doesn&#039;t exist. She sees you as a burden but you want her support? She thinks you&#039;re a mistake but you want her love?

These types of people want a pound of flesh and if they don&#039;t get it regularly they get vicious. So throw them a fake bone ever now and then, without them being aware, and they get satiated without it coming off your back. <br><br>Here&#039;s an example of this technique: say you get a good grade on a paper, don&#039;t tell them you did, if they push you about it tell them that you got a bad grade and let them chew you out over nothing. Since they&#039;re attacking a phantom weakness instead of a real weakness you don&#039;t sustain a substantial injury from it. This technique, like gray rock technique, takes some trickery to pull off but at this point it&#039;s a matter of survival so I would pull out all of the stops and do whatever you can to protect yourself.<br><br>With your girlfriend you can leave her but you don&#039;t really have choice with your mom for now.

path.<br><br>So you do those things less and less.<br><br>Alternatively you make the decision to do more and more good deeds, acts of generosity, cleaning up your room, volunteering, going for a walk

As long as you maintain a normal social life, sooner or later a woman&#039;s gonna fall into your lap. Then you make her your girlfriend her and you don&#039;t have to worry about this shit anymore. There wouldn&#039;t be 8 billion people in the world if that wasn&#039;t the case. <br><br>You said you were a virgin so take my word for it, women literally come out of the woodwork when you have a social life. You&#039;re with some people at a get-together and a girl brings a friend you&#039;ve never met before. Some boomer you&#039;re friends with at work brings his niece one day and you hit it off. Women who wouldn&#039;t give you the time of day on Tinder are much more likely to give you a chance if you meet regularly. <br><br>Think of it like a Markov chain in a video game, and working on yourself improves the odds of a girl who wants to fuck spawning in the background. Just work to get rid of your negative qualities and let RNGesus do the rest.<br><br>Too many guys focus on things they lack instead of qualities they already have but need to get rid of. Like, &quot;I need to get jacked&quot; or &quot;I need to be funny&quot; instead of &quot;I try too hard when I text girls&quot; or &quot;my manner of speaking to people is weird and it makes people see me as a loser.&quot; I think improving your social skills is about developing the self-awareness to see the things in you that repulse others, and doing your best to get rid of them.", "filename": "1640807525551", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 1033, "h": 1280, "tn_w": 100, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675035309733288, "time": 1675035309, "md5": "1g6AnplpFMU5k0LktanDow==", "fsize": 321113, "resto": 28226882}, {"no": 28230627, "now": "01/29/23(Sun)18:36:34", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28230596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28230596</a><br>Nah I\u2019ve never liked night clubs or anything like that scene.

A mistake, I say, because she showed it to all her friends, said it was written like a serial killer would. Blocked me on everything. Been having an insane amount of dreams about her lately especially, maybe I finally have the time to process it. She&#039;s there when I close my eyes, feel her hand in mine in my mind.

The whole natural order of things are being violated by kikes and that is why you came down to your conclusion inside your post. There are still pockets of communities that practice the natural order in regards to mating. They are propagating large families and they are multiplying at gradual but noticeable rates. Marriage is a contract being formed for a household being established. Households are like businesses, they need contracts. When you deny marriage, you deny yourself a household and when you deny a household; then you will become old and alone teetering on the brink of homelessness. Wake up guys, you&#039;re being lied to. This is a slow decay on our countries and peoples in the long run - you can still survive its consequences though. You do this by completely rejecting the kike proposed mating model and mold yourself in embracing natural model which is 2 people coming together to establish a household and birthing a liter of children. When the children grow older, they will establish their own households. Multiple families means many routes of passive incomes which is a better safety net than what the government provides you.
