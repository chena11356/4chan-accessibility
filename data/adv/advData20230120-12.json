There was a brief period of time in which I hung out with my cousins then one day I couldn&#039;t anymore, haven&#039;t spoke to them since. It was a lonely childhood and teenage years. My parents are also both autistic, functioning but largely dysfunctional. My parents were loving though, they never abused me or anything and it was my dad that was the most unstable, my mum was quite but there were some tense moments. I hope I can achieve what you have, it sounds nice.<br><a href=\"#p28160450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28160450</a><br>maybe I do attract shit women, I tend to attract alternative women, but I never had much luck attracting straight edge women.

See, my parents never abused me blatantly either. Childhood trauma can be inflicted without physical/sexual/verbal abuse; and parents can be dysfunctional without intending to hurt their children. There are &#039;big&#039; T&#039;s (traumas), and little t&#039;s&#039; - (small traumas). And all of them are embedded in each of us as people if we grew up around them. It isn&#039;t obvious to ourselves, but it is indeed buried in our subconscious - see, when we were kids we developed a sense of &#039;self&#039;, yeah? So the child brain needs a &#039;blueprint&#039; to mold its &#039;self&#039; around. Those would be your parents. <br><br>Depending on how your parents routinely behaved it can and will affect your relationships. There is always a 1:1 direct parallel. How your relationship dynamics played out with your parents will play out with your future partners. It sounds crazy, but it&#039;s also simple.

Has anything physical ever happened? Do you know if she has romantic feelings for you?<br><br>I was in basically an identical situation and I chose my dull girlfriend. That was over a decade ago now, and we are married and have two incredible kids. Our marriage isn&#039;t perfect but it is pretty good. Sex isn&#039;t great but it isn&#039;t awful either. I think about the fun best friend a lot to be honest. In fact, this is probably the only thing i&#039;d never tell my wife. I wonder what might have been. I think my 20s would have been a lot more fun. I think I would have had much better sex than I have ever had. But I wouldn&#039;t have the home I have and she wouldn&#039;t be as good a mother as my wife is. My best friend is a fantasy. The issue is, I argue with my wife sometimes and allow the fantasy to seem more appealing, then I resent my wife for it. This is folly. It is bullshit. Girls like your friend are fun and dramatic, but they are not permanent. Can you imagine yourself with her picking out paint for a living room? Going through brochures for local pre-schools? Buying a car? Any of the dull shit that makes up such a huge part of life? I picked my wife because we are compatible in the quiet and dull moments, and although I occassionally jerk off to memories of my friend I know deep down that all we would have had was quick fun. Probably travelling and sex and then an awful realisation that we don&#039;t click as a couple the second we stop to catch our breath. <br>My advice is this: figure out if you and your friend can just be boring adults together sometimes. If not, it is hopeless.<br>Also, make sure that if you pick your current girlfriend you do not resent her for the fun you missed out on. You are trading that fun for compassion, stability, and a good mother for your kids.

Women are very insecure about their appearance because so much of their security hinges on being attractive to a man. Somehow they think marriage is the end of trying, probably because they don&#039;t know what being attractive really entails, which is energy, fertility, stable mood and physically capable.<br><br>There might be some exceptions, but they are basically like children in that they need a lot of support to start and even maintain a habit. Don&#039;t let her fill the house with goyslop, cooking meals is a good idea because men should be great cooks. Take her for walks and use it to bond, bonus if you have some steeper terrain, a dog is a good excuse for that.<br><br>It&#039;s hard to see progress when you can only capitalize on success but also can&#039;t push a lot at once. If you&#039;re going to be confrontational, be very resolute. You want her happy, healthy and strong and don&#039;t approve of her letting her body fall out of shape like that. Apologising for your innate sense of attraction (and its diminishment) makes any of that pointless. You have every right to wish your family is HAPPY.

Social environments ex: dating apps/events, bars, maybe places like concerts, parties, etc. Just because an environment has a lot of people doesn&#039;t mean its a place to socialize and attempt to pick up a woman, ex: Caf\u00e9, libraries, random public spaces even including malls, bus stops.... <br><br>Women aren&#039;t always looking to be hit on JUST because they are outside interacting with the world. No one wants to get hit on shopping for groceries or are on errands. You can&#039;t know the headspace of the person at any given time. When people go to places like bars, use dating apps, parties, most of the time, they are usually PREPARED to talk to people/seeking what you are. In their element.<br><br>Ladies like to look good when they&#039;re seeking partners, as do men I&#039;m sure. You go to these kind of social places in order to meet and mingle. People don&#039;t necessarily want to meet and mingle on the way to work/getting food. I feel success rate would be increased seeking out a woman when SHE IS BEING SOUGHT AFTER. Not just randomly approaching her like a kidnapper. There are a lot of dangerous men out there and a woman is innately suspicious of a rando approaching her in a non-social situation and environment. Learn to read a room and body language. If you are going to go about the cold approach you better master being as non-threatening as possible. School oy the exception. If you ask me the sole purpose of college is to make connections, but it is also a place to of course, learn and get things done. I am a woman and I do not like to be cold approached, as sparse as it happens. If I were at a party, a bar, park, even book store, I welcome an approach because that is what I am seeking there.

The logic is obvious, but the feelings are where the friction comes from. <br>A woman cannot simultaneously half the independence to fuck off and have a kid while also demanding the same standards held to them as a man who won&#039;t need to fuck off to have a kid. In a productivity perspective, a woman is less effective during times around her period, and ultimately that is costly time but also can be directly expected unlike someone requiring a sick day out of the blue. <br>But modern sensibilities &quot;mandate&quot; a sense of &quot;equality&quot; despite the standards not being equivalent or equivocal.

She was very insecure about maintaining her virginity and she&#039;d freak the fuck out if I touched her pussy, so I&#039;d only do that if I wanted her to leave me alone.

We hadn&#039;t spoken in more than 6 years, and only twice in the last 13. He and my mom had me at a young age, too young, and gave up everything to take care of me. He was abused as a child by his father, who comes from similar stock, and was troubled since he was a kid, getting involved with drugs, and alcohol, and violence to get his way. He tried to do better, in his own way. I can recall a few brief moments where we did something resembling bonding. We especially bonded over computers and video games, as it was his wheelhouse. His favorite game to play with me was Team Fortress 2, but he introduced me to all kinds of games that I still love to this day. His taste in music also rubbed off on me; he was especially partial to Nirvana and Alice in Chains, and grunge in general. He went to work to take care of me, and though he was never a percect man, and often times not even a good man, I could tell he cared in his own messed-up way. He would try to &quot;toughen me up&quot;, which, when he was drunk, meant daring me to hit him as hard as I could. Sometimes when I had an issue with my PC, he wouldn&#039;t help me, but then explained that he was trying to show me how to solve my own problems. Like I said, he didn&#039;t have good context for how to be a father, and was mentally ill on top of everything. At a point he suffered a severe back injury, and got addicted to prescription painkillers. They took him off of them after awhile, yet did nothing to curb his addiction, and so fell victim to it, and started spiraling downwards. One day, he was drunk and high, and we got into a fight. Fists were exchanged, and that was the very last abuse I put up with. I tried so hard for so long to hold out hope, to help him; as a young boy I had to talk him down from committing suicide more than once.
