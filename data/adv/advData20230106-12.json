Work part time in college, make connections with your professors and anyone else in your field before you graduate so you have good references at least and at most a good gig lined up when you graduate.

It&#039;s not just about virginity. It&#039;s about approaching relationships in a way that is much more focused on commitment. Waiting until marriage doesn&#039;t mean you marry the first virgin you come across. It means you don&#039;t have sex until you&#039;re married; you can still date multiple people to find the one you want to marry, and because you aren&#039;t doing anything (sex, living together, sharing major financial burdens) until you commit, the only reason you have to stay together is how well you get along as people. It&#039;s not hard to see how this *approach*, of which virginity until marriage is a feature and byproduct, might be beneficial to the overall success of marriages.<br><br>Moreover, the REASON for someone to take this approach isn&#039;t just its benefits for marriage, but because of what it helps to realize marriage as: an exclusive lifelong bond with your spouse. By only giving yourself to your spouse after you&#039;ve committed to stay together, you make it far more likely that you will be monogamous in the deepest and most intimate way, of only ever having been with each other. This ideal would be worth it even if there were no practical difference in the success rates of marriages between those who waited and those who didn&#039;t. That waiting until marriage ALSO benefits marriages directly is an added bonus, and a refutation of people like you who ignorantly insist that it&#039;s somehow a bad idea.<br><br><a href=\"#p28057203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28057203</a><br>Spare me the incel terminology.

Clearly, a large portion of society could marry later. That was my sole point--while marrying earlier than 30 is important, there is a historical basis in &quot;trad&quot; societies for marrying later without being seen as unusual.<br><br>The idea that you need to get married right out of high school to be trad is counterproductive (particularly in modern conditions, which are comparable to the most urbanized and financially taxing situations in the past--making later marital ages unsurprising for anyone). It largely defeats the purpose of waiting until marriage, because rushing into marriage and marrying very young are both major risk factors for divorce. Statistically, marrying before around 22 carries significantly heightened risk, with each year before that increasing the risk even more. Marrying around 26 is the best when only age of marriage is taken into account, but obviously it&#039;s okay to marry earlier if a couple who waited is ready.<br><br>But that&#039;s the key point: if they&#039;re ready. Waiting until marriage doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll end up with the first person you date, and it may take some time to find the right person. For example, say you start seriously looking around 20, take half a year to find someone, but that first relationship ends in a breakup after a year. Then say you&#039;re single for another 6-12 months before finding the person you&#039;d end up marrying. If you stay prudent and wait about 2 years (much sooner than that also is a risk factor) to tie the knot, then you&#039;re already almost 25 at marriage, even though there is nothing remarkable about that kind of relationship history. <br><br>A woman isn&#039;t a failure for being smart enough to take her time in finding a decent husband; telling her to rush into marriage by 22, &quot;or else&quot;, is counterproductive for both the standard of waiting and the end result of marriage.", "time": 1673000778, "resto": 28047904}, {"no": 28060352, "now": "01/06/23(Fri)06:56:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28051575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28051575</a><br><a href=\"#p28051297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28051297</a><br>Pscyos and to a lesser extent normies can play women off, but Autist cannot.

It\u2019s an image you have in your mind of who you are. The way to change is by imagining a new image. And then you look at your behaviours, and ask yourself whether you are acting out your old self-image/identity, or whether you\u2019re acting out your new one. Keep the new one in your head as you act the new way. It should feel renewing and spacious for you to do it. It should make you look at yourself with fresh eyes, suddenly aware of all the possibilities. The main obstacle is a feeling of resistance. You\u2019ll notice it as a feeling that you\u2019re not supposed to do it, you\u2019re not allowed to let yourself feel like a person who makes good friendships for example. Find out where that resistance comes from, and honestly knife it and stuff it down the toilet. <br><br>Security and certainty that you can be something new and fresh will not just be given to you. If you leave it to its own devices, you will become filled with doubt and you will give up. You have to snap up and scent of doubt. Don\u2019t try to just ignore it. You have to learn to defeat it. And you\u2019re going to go back to scratch several times in this process, and that\u2019s normal. Keep imagining this new self-image as you act it out, and destroy the resistance and uncertainty. As long as you cannot let yourself imagine someone new, you will never change. Whose permission do you need?<br><br>From there, it\u2019s all about your values, reciprocity, intent, looking at what the other person needs, and sharing with them of your world.

Nowadays people just wear plain single color clothes, there is no shirt as dominant as that smile or in utero one so even if they do wear band shirt you might not even know it is one. Yet still every single thing written about PUA only ever talks about band shirt since none of these people ever went outside and the last person they&#039;ve heard of doing so was in 90s. <br><br>School and social cirtcle, thats truth", "time": 1672949366, "resto": 28055342}, {"no": 28055561, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:12:12", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055545</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;social cirtcle</span><br>so how do I develop a social circle in my mid-20&#039;s? is meetup.com useful?", "time": 1672949532, "resto": 28055342}, {"no": 28055601, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:17:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055561</a><br>its used in a very few specific cities in USA so if its active where you live go for it<br><br>but for a lot of guys in majority of places in the world, going to school again is the only option", "time": 1672949829, "resto": 28055342}, {"no": 28055639, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:22:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055601</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;going to school again is the only option</span><br>I already graduated and covid partly ruined it the last time.", "time": 1672950143, "resto": 28055342}, {"no": 28055649, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:24:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055545</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;School and social cirtcle, thats truth</span><br>That&#039;s true, once you are out it&#039;s over", "time": 1672950241, "resto": 28055342}, {"no": 28055672, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)15:27:44", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055545</a><br><a href=\"#p28055561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055561</a><br><a href=\"#p28055649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055649</a><br>please everyone ignore the schizo autistic schooler who thinks it&#039;s impossible to meet anyone outside of or after school, that literally no one has ever met anyone at a bar or gym or night club or event or location other than school or school friends.<br><br>You made friends at the boxing gym or met girls at a night club?

The thing is, I never knew I had anxiety - panic attacks, yes, but not anxiety - so he thought I was just a coward and I believed him, and it just seemed no matter how much advice and help he tried to give, none of it worked (because I didn&#039;t just have normal fear). He left me about two months ago after I kept breaking promises to him and he eventually said that I&#039;d never be able to change and left me. This isn&#039;t the first time he&#039;s done it, but it&#039;s been the longest he&#039;s been gone and he pretty much hates me now. Of course, my anxiety and panic attacks have gotten so much worse without him, since him leaving is basically my worst nightmare, but I&#039;ve managed to learn more about my anxiety and am going into therapy soon. <br>So, with that out of the way, what I would say is first of all, learn more about your mental illness, and second of all, TELL him about it. Get him to read a book about it, or parts of a book, which is what I would do with my bf if he were here. He was the sweetest, most loving person in the world, but I brought out the worst in him because of my untreated mental illness (and his own issues probably made it worse). So, if he is willing to be this patient with you now, you can know that he&#039;s definitely a keeper and would want to help you. Don&#039;t leave this problem unattended like I did, or you could risk losing him like me.

When we talked about our relationship she said she doesn\u2019t want anything serios, but likes talking to me and \u201clikes me as a person\u201d (w/e that means). That was last year on the new year. At that time told her that I don\u2019t want to text her/talk with her anymore since I\u2019ll get attached for no reason. Last year in summer I had a talk with her again because she started giving off mixed signals, being flirty and hanging around me when we were in the same context. She said she doesn\u2019t like me enough to want to have a relationship with me, and that she still doesn\u2019t want anything serious from me. And basically that was it, however when we happen to meet she is still flirty sometimes. In live settings she\u2019s just moving from one guy to another, talking for a few minutes to get her attention then moves on to hang out with her friends or some dude that happens to give her more attention.<br>I want her\u2026 however I can\u2019t force her to like me, or trick her into being with me for a few months.

Then it will take at least a year to have a normal courting relationship before you get engaged. Then because women gotta woman, she\u2019ll want to get married in some specific season or holiday or whatever, which will be six months away on average. So now we\u2019re up to 2 years.

You\u2019re also going to want to spend some time married before you have kids, because once you start, you can\u2019t have your house back for at least 18 more years. So add on another year for that. 28-30+. Time to have kids now. And you aren\u2019t going to want just one, single children are weird and you aren\u2019t really fulfilling your biological imperative if you use 2 people to create only 1 person. But, you also don\u2019t want to have your kids too close together, because that\u2019s at a nightmare. Your first kid should be about 3 years old before your wife is pregnant again, etc. So now we\u2019re looking at 32-36+ when the second kid is born. Let\u2019s assume for a moment that you don\u2019t have any more (even though you should, because if you made it this far without being a deadbeat dad, you\u2019re the sort of parent that should be raising as much of the next generation as possible).

Had no idea she had one before setting up the date (I&#039;m calling it that, fuck you) but I don&#039;t really care.<br>I&#039;m going to seriously evaluate my relationship with my girlfriend as well. I love her, I really do, but I do not know how much longer I can be the support system for her to not even be happy, but just to survive with her depression. It hurts me to see her like that but I&#039;ve given so much already that I don&#039;t know what else to give. I realize now this is why I felt so sidelined by the frankly amazing time I had with my friend. I do not want to let it fade, I want to hang out with her more, I want to get to know her more, I want to go on dates and I want to talk about gay nerd shit. And so on.

It was a whirlwind I am still unprepared to deal with and it\u2019s unimaginably hard to navigate. That shit unlocked feelings I did not know were there, and made me look at my life for the last 5 years from a different point of view. I am not the kind of person that could maintain multiple relationships nor could I have casual sex. The \u201cfree pass\u201d was just the first domino in undoing what was a stable point in my life.

It&#039;s often the case that the chemicals and fire retardants in carpets and other furniture are the culprits for this but proving causation is nearly impossible. The body has multiple methods of ridding the body of these particles from the body: the cilia in the lungs, mucous production, sneezing, coughing up phlegm as well as the assorted traps in the nasal and sinus passages which keep the majority of carcinogens from entering the lungs to begin with. The immune system also encapsulates inflammation-inducing particles and processes them through the lymphatic system and then to the blood and the liver for neutralization and removal from the body. <br><br>The lungs are a also one of the body&#039;s largest stores of the molecule glutathione which is the body&#039;s master oxidant. Each and every cell in your body has numerous glutathione molecules within them which help neutralize reactive oxygen species and other free radicals which may come into contact with cellular membrane or enter the cells itself. So long as glutathione levels remain at a sustained level carcinogens which enter the pulmonary system will be readily handled. However, persistent exposure to carcinogens can begin to wear down and oxidize glutathione below baseline levels which is when apoptosis (cell death) and inflammation occurs, raising the possibility of oncogenesis. Glutathione can be readily repleted (returned to its reduced, unoxidized state) so long as there&#039;s a persistent supply of the amino acid cysteine which is the rate-limiting precursor to glutathione repletion. Cysteine, however, is in short supply in the body and can be depleted during periods of stress among other things. Supplementing with N-Acetyl-Cysteine can help restore glutathione levels in the lungs which will prevent glutathione levels from dropping below baseline levels needed to maintain proper pulmonary health.", "time": 1672957868, "resto": 28055408}, {"no": 28056936, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)18:38:59", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28055408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28055408</a><br>No but you can get something as bad if your house is pre 1980s.

It will allow you to create opportunities to talk to women and make you more approachable since most dogs are cute and most women like dogs. It will also give you something to talk about. The main reason most guys have trouble with women is because of their environment. You have to be around women for them to notice and/or talk to you.", "time": 1672940713, "resto": 28050566}, {"no": 28054825, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)12:49:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28054089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28054089</a><br>holy shit you&#039;re a faggot, dear lord<br>I&#039;m so sorry", "time": 1672940949, "resto": 28050566}, {"no": 28055456, "now": "01/05/23(Thu)14:55:35", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28053706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28053706</a><br>What do you mean I don\u2019t put in any effort?

Graduated college with a BA in Criminal Justice this past summer and I&#039;ve been applying to police and fire departments since to pursue a career in either. An important note here is that I have a speech disability (partially paralyzed tongue), but it&#039;s not debilitating, and I can communicate with anyone just fine. Best I can equate it to is that it sounds like I&#039;m kinda deaf or I&#039;ve recently had dental work done. Anyway, both police and fire hire in certain time windows so I&#039;ve been having to wait to take entry exams. I&#039;ve been applying to part-time/full-time jobs anywhere I can to have income in the meantime, but I&#039;ve been rejected/ignored by all my applications. I&#039;ve held plenty of part-time jobs before while I was in school so I don&#039;t know what the issue is. The same can be said for my police/fire applications. I&#039;ve either been rejected or ignored by the cities I&#039;ve applied to without any explanation other than a generic letter of rejection. I believe it is because of my speech so my hopes of pursuing my desired career in either are dwindling. To pursue a career in my desired field law enforcement the baseline is being a cop, which is unlikely for me. I could use my degree to get some desk-jockey job but I&#039;d probably hate it. The only hobby/interest of mine that can lead to a career is cars. I&#039;m a good mechanic, work on project cars n stuff. Currently living at home with my mom so I&#039;m a NEET at the moment, 23yo.
