I now know why my childhood was so bland to the point of anomaly. A lot of people came and gone in my life, those who stayed I treasure. It is now November, I am going to be 28 soon. Youth is far away, but I enjoyed my days of debauchery. I wake up at 5AM, a girl from Hong Kong is obsessed with me, she&#039;s only 18, all my old friends left me when they of found out about us. Am I sick? Is it a corrupt power dynamic? No. In a relationship, you just see if you have the strength to handle someone&#039;s negativity. I have no idea if this relationship will last, she wants me. She pursued me. I&#039;m just taking what life gave me. I work out everyday, I sit in the shower and reflect on the past. All my old friends are just stuck, their getting fat, they got soft. They all called me a &quot;sexual predator&quot; for seeing this girl. They wouldn&#039;t know suffering or agony if it burned their houses down. She goes off to work, she laughs, I get ready for work, she compliments me. No other girl in my life has been this loving. I reflect on all my exes, all the strain, all the games, the crocodile tears. I am gradually becoming more religious day by day, I am regaining my animal instincts, learning to trust myself again. In school, I got caught up in identity politics, all my old art school classmates are now freeloaders or disgusting. I think deep down, their just upset someone my age could land someone without the agony of self-depreciation. The sex is fun, but I am growing tired, I still feel empty, I realized traditional western values are perfectly healthy. Responsibility and owning my failures, knowing I&#039;m just an animal trying to make life better, realize my pain is mine and only mine, that makes me happy. I&#039;ll never be a victim to the times again, I tried to fit in society but I soon learned it was a mistake.

She looked good (even great in her better days), had a very personal sense of fashion and a creative disposition. She liked writing, drawing, dancing, going for long walks and reading. But years of failed connections, bulling and her own personal issues had left her with very bad socializing skills, so she didn\u2019t really know how to present herself to other people. And because of her inability to keep a proper social circle she was not fully aware of her own awkwardness. She only knew that, at some point, people just ghosted her. No matter what, people ghosted her. And that reinforced the self-fulfilling nature of her social interactions, because she internalized that every new person would inevitably drop her.<br>It wasn\u2019t until I got access to her writings that I realized the depth of her drive for discovering love, and how that conditioned her worldview. Everything in life was perfunctory but love, and even her creative processes were just a vehicle for the exploration of what being in love with somebody was. <br>But that was the problem. She wanted so much to feel and share that pure, blissful connection that it drove people away. It wasn\u2019t that she was openly clingy or anything like that; it was just a vibe emanating from her that people picked up. Like a primordial directive telling them to stay away.

Guys romanticize the idea and we, when our society was more patriarchal, espoused it as an archetype, the &quot;secret admirer&quot; who longs for his true love. Women always have, and always will, see it as predatory and creepy. Unless they like the guy and are blinded by that, there is no hope. <br>At best, the secret admirer is a craven and a liar. He denies his true feelings to the world and possibly even to his love. He doesn&#039;t do it for his own benefit or hers or anyone else&#039;s, but generally out of fear and insecurity. At worst, the secret admirer is a predator, who has picked out some random girl to be the latest victim of his &quot;affections.&quot; Either way, the girl hates it unless - again - she already likes the guy. <br><a href=\"#p27747896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27747896</a><br>You know only on 4chan and Reddit do I really get to feel like I&#039;m just watching crazy people stammer back and forth at each other.

This is the easiest route to a fagman cozy job lined up after you graduate. <br>- pass your classes but otherwise grades don&#039;t really matter. Still good to have though. <br><br>There is still time to apply for summer 2023, apply everywhere you can. Good entry level roles if you&#039;re shit are very large corporate companies that aren&#039;t generally associated with tech.

I used to hang out with almost entirely girls back in middle school. It helped me a little in that I did ask one out and we went to the dance together, but it didn&#039;t let me just instantly overcome all my anxieties around girls and all that. <br>The reason why is a combination of:<br>1) Poor matchmaking. One or more could secretly like you, or at least be open to the idea of dating you, but you have no idea. <br>2) Dough Boy Syndrome. You&#039;re friendly and likable and affable, but you&#039;re not exciting or sexy or hot. Being friendly isn&#039;t bad, contrary to some advice you see online, but it doesn&#039;t necessarily translate into getting laid. <br>Think of your body as the hardware and your personality as the software. Your personality might be great (and probably is, if they are your friend), but it means nothing without appropriate hardware to run it. <br>I know a guy like that. He lived with 3 girls, always hung around girls, and all that, but he wasn&#039;t sexy. Shit, he didn&#039;t try to be lol. He acted immature, childish, loud, insecure, and had extremely high standards there besides. Stereotypical asian STEMcel who wanted a tall blonde gf lol. <br>If he had worked on himself, he could have become sexy. He had the connections already built. It would have been easy. He just never cared to put the pieces together. <br>3) You aren&#039;t trying. How many girls have you actually asked out? <br>Did you know you can literally just keep asking out girls until one says yes? I mean not literally, but pretty much. One of my friends in HS asked out 5 guys in a month and the 5th said yes. He got mocked for it for years, but he was also the first in my friend group to lose his v-card. <br><br>The fact that you are friends with a number of girls is a great sign.

I know this makes her seem terrible to most basement dwellers here, but she&#039;s a loving and loyal person who desperately just wants to get married to me and have kids, but ig my religion has always been a hard pill for her to swallow and feels like she has to endure it (im a normal church going Christian)<br><br>She insists she&#039;s never going to convert, and although she says we can raise our family religiously, she doesn&#039;t want to convert.

We don&#039;t fight, we love spending time together, we live together, we have for 2 years, we&#039;ve built a lot of memories and I think we love each other, and although my conscious knows that I can&#039;t compromise on my principles, I can&#039;t bring myself to leave her either. It seems so bizarre to end a relationship because of a mere difference of perspective regarding the future, when both of us still get along and care about each other.

The optimistic dogma we are thought or learn somehow might have some truth to it I believe. Hmmm. Worst part is im not sad, Im empty, i feel nothing good. It&#039;s a horrible feeling. Feeling sad is because you have a reason to, and can find some comfort in something. <br>Religious people take comfort knowing their dead loved ones go somewehre better, fatsos hate themselves but take comfort by thnking it doesnt matter given they are enjoying the food.

I&#039;ve never had unprotected sex, so I dont really have any reference for the danger or threshold of getting someone preggers. <br><br>Anyways, TYIA", "filename": "Unknown", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 275, "h": 183, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 166, "tim": 1668802274241442, "time": 1668802274, "md5": "898HrlSkvEfuthuRaN7tTQ==", "fsize": 5936, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "pregnant", "replies": 1, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 27747533, "now": "11/18/22(Fri)15:19:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27747503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27747503</a><br>It&#039;s possible, but apparently unlike.<br>You can try control damage with next-day pills, etc.. or bet on doing nothing.<br><br>That 11% chance isnt like &quot;9 every 10 creampies, girl not gets pregnant&quot;.", "time": 1668802793, "resto": 27747503}], "last_modified": 1668802793}]}]
