I know how to cook, do laundry, and somewhat clean. These are comfty activities, and if I was a women I wouldn&#039;t mind to doing them. Mincing some carrots/onions and then making omelette for my husband is infinity better than making some report for some asshole boss. The ONLY reason why women shouldn&#039;t get a job is if A) too poor B) family isn&#039;t around to protect her in case she divorce. But if you can get a good husband, there is no reason to get a job. Hell, the best part is you get a lot of free time. I hear mom bitch about how much cooking/cleaning she does. After doing it myself, she&#039;s exaggerating. Even laundry&#039;s main time sink isn&#039;t the laundry part, it&#039;s the fact that she likes to organize the clothes.

It&#039;s also an idea that the reality is we have violent flashbacks that are perceptual experiences affecting our sensory organs. But anyways, dissociative patients often have so called unconscious personalities that go to entirely different worlds. I&#039;ve done it with the aid of hypnosis, in a dream one morning. It&#039;s like there&#039;s a weak sense of time. Loose chronology within open apprx. boundaries. What happens, is you end up forgetting what day it occurred the day it occurred, and even though there&#039;s event topography landmarks/chronological mnemonics all during the week you visited the inner world, you still become unable to recall what day it occurred, and become doubtful when you came back to reality. So what happens, in people who have the disorder correlated with that without hypnotic aids, is they lose all sense of time I suppose, when they visit these worlds frequently. I don&#039;t know, never been on a consistent basis.<br>Anyways... it was just an interesting note. I have to admit, it could just be a savage shadow/id element that fears loss of control, or desires competition- maybe? I&#039;m just making stuff up at this point, it&#039;s a theory and makes sense, but, -I don&#039;t think we necessarily know. I&#039;d say the thematic unfolding in religious enlightenment/trance displaced on certain cognitions and it&#039;s unconscious, though, also makes for a psychological argument. <br>Digressing, I think I should say, that this religious adaptation is psychologically maladaptive, culturally adaptive. But, who&#039;s to prioritize the two types of the topic of humans? Maybe it really is does come down to wit and it&#039;s illusion completely dispelled in favor of the displaced contents/those inner worlds. Jung would call us with the condition, then, unconscious or non-living, per a quote in Dreams, Reflections, Memories. &quot;Those without an inner psychic experience with their own individual world should be considered unconscious animals.&quot; ...1/?", "time": 1671059789, "resto": 27913344}, {"no": 27916879, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)18:20:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27916859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916859</a><br>and he had called this inner psychic experience the inner world, filled with the evolutionary archetypes of the unconscious, or now subconscious in his terms, I suppose.

Can never go wrong with minimalist. Don\u2019t get caught up in convos. Keep texting focus and to the point and use your phone just to set up the date.

When you go out hit on everything, be loud and noticeable (but not annoying), lock eyes with everyone and don\u2019t move out of the way, shit like this. I would basically go out with my friends and I would try to make a total ass out of myself in a funny and comical way. I would troll women, or just say wild shit to them and would have no expectations. All of this was to get myself comfortable with this shit so when I am trying to fuck I\u2019m cool as a cucumber. Doing this shit also builds character real quick and if you\u2019re a natural troll irl then you\u2019ll have a blast. It\u2019s key to be with friends as they add huge confidence boost and if they are fun then you\u2019ll have fun lol. But yeah just get out there and start talking shit to everyone you see at a club or a packed bar.

I think one of the main issues is that you have become out of practice socializing (maybe, not sure how often you try) -- I face the same issue of losing my train of thought,reacting unexpectedly, and also having a poor memory. Have you ever thought of going to recovery support type groups, even if you don&#039;t need the support from drug addiction, it can be a good way to practice socializing with others in a relatively low-judgement environment, who understand where you&#039;re coming from and the issues you&#039;re dealing with.<br><br>I don&#039;t think the weed is actually worsening the structure of your brain, but probably isn&#039;t helping with the poor memory and lack of focus. I&#039;m a bit of a nootropics fiend, so I&#039;d recommend trying those to help you out in the meantime -- particularly, dopa mocuna (helps with energy and motivation levels, which I know firsthand is an issue with ADD/ADHD) and possibly and rhodiola root (which helps to improve memory). I&#039;ve had good experiences (have tried a lot of supplements out there in hopes of helping with my depression and brain fog) with both of these with not really any diminishing effectiveness.<br><br>And as for daily mental exercises or habits to try, I&#039;d say meditation (if you can), or maybe those brain-training apps you can get on your phone. Even doing things like sodoku or chess can help to give your brain a workout of sorts. If you have the attention span, reading can help a lot -- I&#039;ve found since I switched from just merely consuming/watching things and doing more active things like reading, my memory has improved.

As no one follows a loser with no friends and no one hires a loser with no following.

Or prayer/calisthenics if you need trad style. Basically find a habit/exercise that focuses your mind with your body. Yoga and mindful meditation work for me and millions of suburbanites and city heathens far from nature and gods. Pick up hiking and breathing exercises for all I care. <br><br>Also other suggestions like reading help. Drawing helps me. Truth is its all a way of getting meandering imagination to work at something. Even if the something is pointless its at least pointlessly involved with something physically outside the mind. This challenges the mind more than your own daydreaming. Wears it out. Doesnt mean its a cure all.<br><br>Think of the imaginative daydream part of your mind as a young labrador dog in a small apartment. Fucker wants to do shit. But the owner is in a restrictive neighborhood and dog has to keep good and quiet. Weirdly the dog has an anxious habit of pacing often, endlessly bored and wasting the owners rest time making small whines for attention. But the simple fix isnt just walk the dog but exercise it. Get the lab running and introducing it to new smells new dog butts new plants and run it more.

It definitely fits a profile. Your parents did a shit job. That&#039;s not your fault...but it IS your responsibility to fix now if you want things to turn around.

Meaning it&#039;s well past the time to learn how to interact with people.<br>And I think a part of your problem is that you&#039;ve come to define yourself solely by your interests, and likewise define other people by theirs. YOU are not anime or Evil Dead, and likewise someone who doesn&#039;t like those things is not making a personal attack. Likewise, these other people are not the Minnesota Vikings or whatever. There is more to them, and there would be more to you if you stopped hiding it.<br>The other problem here is that you&#039;ve divided people based on their interests as either &quot;normie&quot; (hilarious considering your video game taste) or as &quot;based 4chan autists!&quot; or whatever the fuck. And I think a lot of that is simply contrarianism on your part. For example, you said you&#039;d date a trekkie, even though you didn&#039;t say you&#039;re into Star Trek. So why the exception then? Oh right, because Trek isn&#039;t &quot;normie&quot; so it&#039;s ok for people to like whether you like it or not yourself. And since you have this childish black and white view of the world, you don&#039;t seem to realize that there are people out there who like football and Game of Thrones, AND video games and cheesy horror movies.

Many people used to get arranged marriages and in some societies they still do, yet not everyone is miserable in an arranged marriage. In the past people married for practical reasons and they learned to love and appreciate the other person over time. The shared struggled brought you closer. &quot;Hobbies&quot; practically didn&#039;t exist, nor did music or movies. Everything you&#039;re trying to build your relationship on are modern concepts that didn&#039;t exist 200 years ago. What do you think people did before then? Do you think they just lived miserable lives with people they hated?<br><br>Haven&#039;t you ever heard the phrase &quot;opposites attract?&quot; You shouldn&#039;t be looking for someone exactly like you. Sharing someone&#039;s love of something and watching them enjoy it is highly enjoyable in and of itself if you&#039;re not a selfish prick or confused like you obviously are.<br><br>Sex also bonds two people together. You can have a sexual relationship sooner if there&#039;s already an instant attraction between you, but again, it&#039;s not required. Sexual attraction is a lot more than physical attributes.

Stop talking about killing yourself because you don&#039;t have a boyfriend at age 18, that&#039;s fucking retarded. You&#039;re literally completely normal, people lose their virginity at 17-18 on average. In some countries, it&#039;s much later. Contrarily to what you might believe based on what all the incels here say, most women don&#039;t have 50+ sexual partners by the age of 20.<br><br>2. You&#039;re asking the wrong question. As a woman, almost everything about what makes you attractive to men is based on physical appearance. Figure out how to maximize your attractiveness. Wear makeup, figure out how to style your hair properly, etc... I don&#039;t know jack shit about this because I&#039;m a guy, but you can always make yourself look better than you already do. Ask people around you, or strangers online for advice. If you manage to make yourself look good, you can be as socially awkward as you want, it won&#039;t matter. The only thing you should avoid is being too agressive, but based on what you wrote, it doesn&#039;t look like that&#039;s going to be a problem for you.<br><br>3. Have the right standards. If, even after maximizing your attractiveness as much as possible, you&#039;re still a 5, don&#039;t exclusively go after guys who are at 6 or 7. 99% of the reason why people have problems dating is because of that. After all, if there&#039;s so many men and women online complaining about not being able to find partners, how come they don&#039;t just date each other? Well, because they don&#039;t want to. Most people don&#039;t even notice when unattractive people are pining for them, it doesn&#039;t even register. I was in the same situation when I was your age. I kept whining about how girls didn&#039;t like me. In reality, I had a few girls express interest, but I didn&#039;t even really realize it until later.<br><br>Keep your chin up and stop bringing yourself down, you&#039;re not doing anywhere as bad as you like to think you do.", "filename": "datass", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 512, "h": 320, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 78, "tim": 1671059861765851, "time": 1671059861, "md5": "08AGKM9ZyrorphMO987USA==", "fsize": 59857, "resto": 27913096}, {"no": 27916948, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)18:38:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27916557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916557</a><br>ok<br><br><a href=\"#p27916721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916721</a><br>im religious<br><br><a href=\"#p27916784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916784</a><br>alright<br><br><a href=\"#p27916850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916850</a><br>thanks<br><br><a href=\"#p27916866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916866</a><br>ty anon", "time": 1671061083, "resto": 27913096}, {"no": 27917897, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)21:20:03", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27913096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27913096</a><br>poast discord and ill show you how to talk", "time": 1671070803, "resto": 27913096}, {"no": 27918682, "now": "12/14/22(Wed)23:47:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27916948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27916948</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;im religious</span><br>Ok doesn&#039;t mean anything if your not living the walk.
