I&#039;d give up a lot to be free from eating and shitting. I really dislike where I live. Sometimes I just start screaming because of my life.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like. In my opinion physical improvement is the number one best thing you can do if you are unhappy with your life because it lays the foundation for everything else.

I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died.

You should find something you&#039;re good at that you can tolerate without burning out that MAXIMIZES cash flow and pursue that. Ideally it should pay you to learn skills that you can deploy outside of employment so you can exit employment sooner rather than later. Think of employment as a bridge from virgin neetdom to chad neetdom. Some examples of viable options are trades, sales, it, coding meme, internet marketing. You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

I don&#039;t know who my father is but my mom loved me and she did her best to send me to school and tried her hardest to raise me. Then my mom married when I was about 10 to a guy who we&#039;ll call Dave. Now, Dave was rich. He had two daughters himself (who we&#039;ll call B and C. B lived with us) Now, Dave was an awful awful man. He was physically and emotionally abusive. He changed my mom into hating me. I never had nice stuff to wear but B always had the cutest outfits. It gets worse, I had to litteraly beg my mom to buy me sanitary stuff so I could keep some stocked up instead of waiting till the worst possible day it. Their reasoning was that he&#039;s already doing me a favor by letting me live in his already gigantic house.<br><br>Dave&#039;s physical abuse was the most traumatising of the things he did. He always either beat me with a stick from a lemon tree we had in the yard or berate me with all sorts of foul language when something happened at school. One occasion I remember as the worst was when I was suspended from school because I pushed a bully and she hit her head on a desk. He broke almost half a dozen of sticks over my back. I remember waking up the day after and my pajamas sticking to my bottom because of the amount of skin he broke.<br><br>The first thing I did after I graduated from HS was moving to my own place. I hated all of them except my mom.<br><br>Now, a few years later my mom calls me saying that Dave&#039;s in the hospital. She says he&#039;s not doing too well. She says that he&#039;s feeling sorry for all the things he did and he wants to apologise. I asked her why wasn&#039;t Dave the one who&#039;s calling me then. She says that Dave was feeling to weak for that.<br><br>[Continues...]", "filename": "file", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 446, "h": 497, "tn_w": 224, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1674554138929820, "time": 1674554138, "md5": "H1fY65f9X4bJe9lVyVEQXw==", "fsize": 33956, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "abusive-step-father-is-in-the-hospital-mom-wants", "replies": 19, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 16}, {"no": 28189648, "now": "01/24/23(Tue)04:56:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "[...Continued]<br><br>So there&#039;s my conundrum.

I think what really matters is that my partner is trying to learn my body and wants me to be satisfied. As I would want to do for them.

Boys grow with the idea that male sexuality is predatory and violent and that women are noble beings that must be protected. So boys grow to be afraid of their own desires, in part because of the good nature of mankind and in part because of fear of social punishment. This causes confusion and leads many guys to act weird with many women. This only gets worse when you factor in the fact that we live in a society that rewards ego and individuality and makes everyone believe that you must be special in order to be happy, specially in relationships. We believe we are special and that every mistake or misunderstanding against us must be a deliberate and malicious act wiht the intent of hurting us. This sentiment fuels victim mentality which can be easily channeled in fighting for a cause against the perceived injustice that was commited against us.

If you are speaking to incels, no reason to put incels on blast. <br>He isn&#039;t wrong that whitepills don&#039;t sell. No one goes to the store and buys a book about how the sky isn&#039;t falling. The people who know it&#039;s not falling have no reason to write, either. Lose-lose. <br>The real crux of it though is that &quot;whitepills&quot; are hard because most people think the world is better than it actually is. It doesn&#039;t just extend to dating, but virtually everything. <br>Whitepills do exist though. For instance, people are having less premarital sex, or that obesity actually was trending down before COVID. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;why does the redpill and blackpill so dramatically vocally drown out alternatives online?</span><br>But it doesn&#039;t?

I hope you didn&#039;t mean it ironically as some sort of gotcha, because I think you&#039;ll find the answer interesting too.<br>Basically, misogyny and misandry are bad, mkay? Except, in reality, are they bad? We&#039;ve actually begun testing that theory and we&#039;ve found that sexism can be split into multiple different categories, or perhaps levels of extremity is another way to think of it. There is &#039;no sexism,&#039; &#039;benign sexism,&#039; and &#039;hostile sexism.&#039; If hostile sexism is like someone sending their love from Kazakhstan, then benign sexism would be men who insist on paying for dates or insist on driving her. We have found that, at least in women, benign sexism is actually linked to the best outcomes, with no sexism taking the second place and hostile sexism producing the worst outcomes. <br>Now, this research is only preliminary and we haven&#039;t studied the effect well for men, but it&#039;s interesting to say the least. It suggests that women might be best served by looking for men with a healthy skepticism and respect for the opposite sex, which would explain the seemingly baffling behavior of getting with &quot;misogynistic&quot; men. In reality, these men aren&#039;t contemptuous the way we generally think of misogynists. They are misogynistic in that they are patronizing, like a parent to a child. <br>Remember that we aren&#039;t looking for &quot;the one,&quot; some spiritual partner we are destined to find and love. At the end of the day, for an LTR, men are looking for a mother to their children and women are looking for a father. We, as men, want our woman to be kind; who couldn&#039;t love a mother blessed with grace and warmth? But should a father just be kind? Perhaps, but only from a position of respect and strength. He can be compassionate, but it is not a father&#039;s job to defer to others.
