Nothing is wrong with wanting anything. Want the best for yourself. It all comes down to your ability to procure it. You&#039;re not entitled to it. I&#039;m saying that the internet plus unenforced sexual taboos allow women with the characteristics I mentioned to be much more mercenary about the power they wield, if they want. She can fuck the hot guys, make her &quot;maybe&quot; guys wine and dine her, get money or favors/gifts from the simps and orbiters, then marry a provider when she&#039;s done if she wants. Or she may be more traditional by choice. She has the choice to do either with impunity, and girls increasingly go mercenary. Why not get what you want if you can? She has that choice because she has power, and she has that power because the overwhelming majority of all male sexual attention is on those girls. The 18 year old teen boys to the 70 year olds who need pills to get erect. <br><br>You have to be more than your father was.

Nothing about being a 2 or 3 indicates whether a man would fuck her or not, or to what lengths he&#039;d go for it. A 3 might be unfuckable, or it might be &quot;gross, but I&#039;d still fuck if I had nothing better&quot; depending on the guy. And theres nothing that says a 3 for a woman is totally unfuckable, or fuckable if he has X, Y, or Z things going for him. We just can&#039;t tell. I get that it&#039;s the best evidence available in a field where data is often intentionally hidden, but it really doesn&#039;t show much here, and you have to infer a fuckton for it to be useful.

And there are other areas in life where success is less dependent than looks than in datung. Looks can be improved significantly by exercise, good diet, and fashion. Though obviously it is partially genetically-determined, a 5/10 can become a 6/10 or 7/10 lookswise. Success in other areas can increase the overall score further even with average looks. However, simplifying to a score is both unhealthy and misleadingly simplistic. Also you say you 5/10, that is really not bad and you shouldn&#039;t focus on it. Train yourself not to care about the outcome of your life but instead to care about acting with virtue, i.e., acting in a way which makes a better life for yourself and others more likely, and let that be your focus.

Eighth was a married Mexican woman who was in an open relationship. My wife knows I like dark features and that latinas get attached so she ended this one pretty quick.

She was another blonde stunner who let me do everything to her for five hours and screamed like a banshee when she came, before leaving and and none of us ever speaking again. <br><br>Tenth and eleventh was a foursome.

I&#039;m absolutely 100% not alone in having grown into my looks/body/all of that, but I think I have better perspective and a better ability to articulate what I&#039;ve seen than most guys. When you&#039;re younger every interaction you have with hot girls is framed through the lens of being a hunter trying to &quot;secure&quot; something. Most young guys, even ones who think they&#039;re well intentioned/romantic, want to &quot;secure&quot; something steady so they don&#039;t have to keep hunting. Unfortunately when you&#039;re younger most of the truly attractive girls aren&#039;t as into you. Older guys will tell you to &quot;stop caring&quot;, or even just to outright be an asshole. What they really mean (and struggle to communicate I think) is that you need to stop caring about the outcome. Girls have a sixth sense for that. If they catch a whiff that you&#039;re that invested in the outcome of you guys dating it&#039;s a huge turnoff. Unfortunately it&#039;s a difficult thing to turn off, and I have found that really the only way to get over that hump is to just date/fuck a lot of girls until you get to the point where your brain accepts the idea that &quot;this isn&#039;t the last girl&quot;. I&#039;ve fucked around 25-30 girls and seriously dated maybe 8 or 9. At this point I just don&#039;t really care and I think the only real value in any of it is as a sort of trophy that you flex. Relationships are kind of pointless outside of that assuming you have game (or money in the case of this thread).

She has huge tits and uploaded a story wearing a top, so I messaged her &quot;Not even with a divine blessing will I ever put as much effort into something as the tiny strings holding your top together.

My parents have known each other since childhood because of this. As my mom was my dad&#039;s wet nurse/nanny&#039;s daughter.<br><br>They were childhood friends and when they hit puberty naturally began fucking each other behing everyone&#039;s back. Then she got pregnant of me and that&#039;s how i was born.<br><br>But sooner than later it was known that my grandpa enjoyed fucking the female staff. And my mom was in fact my dad&#039;s half sister. So basically I&#039;m the result of half silbings incest. And no I&#039;m not a mutant with six fingers. I&#039;m normal, i may not be handsome but I&#039;m not particularly ugly neither. That explains why my parents never tried for a second kid and my mom got tube&#039;s ligation at such young age, maybe they decided to not test their luck with a second child in case it was born unhealthy. What doesn&#039;t explain is why they decided to stay together.<br><br>In any case. Should i tell my fiance about this? What if she thinks I&#039;m something gross? I already scheduled an appointment with my medic to inform me about the consequences of incest but my parents say they tested me for a lot of things when i was a child and I&#039;m 100% normal like any other person of my age. Now I&#039;m shitting in my pants about the generic screening. What if there is something wrong about me? I don&#039;t gave history of birth defects in my family record or major genetic disorders but you never know with this.

I&#039;ve been reading the Bible, thinking about it and trying to apply it to my life, and looking for thoughtful Biblical commentary wherever I could find it. <br><br>The funny thing is that even religion can lead astray. I realized that a big portion of my search for God was completely misguided (and thus my faith stunted) because I thought religion had to do with being a good person. Then it became a quest of finding the perfect philosophy, the perfect mysticism, the perfect politics, etc., to repair an utterly broken society. It was such a prideful, silly, and vain venture, even if society forces you to care about the impossible. No, you don&#039;t have to be religious to be a good person, at least in the eyes of society. You can always be &quot;good enough&quot; and carve out your rewards later.

I realized that I could never be the perfect person I wanted to be in the eyes of God, yet nothing else short of that flame would ever satisfy me either.

Take it straight from me, man. I went into nursing school in the early 2010s because I liked science, and it was an in-demand field. I went into nursing school and made it one year in and left. I couldn&#039;t handle the patient interactions, I despised patients who refused to heed my advice, and the medical system in America is a fucking joke. What I did like was computers and IT, business stuff. I remember sending the email off and them calling me in and I told them, and I felt a weight lifted off me. My dad supported me, my mom was furious. I&#039;m glad I left.
