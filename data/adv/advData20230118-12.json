I&#039;ve been engaged twice. There&#039;s a little boy running around who is most likely my son. I&#039;ve intentionally isolated myself from society. I&#039;ve dated many girls and slept with far more than I&#039;m proud of and virtually every single one has cheated on me. I had one one-night stand, her intention not mine and felt horrendous and tried to schedule a second date not for sex but just so I could *say* it wasn&#039;t a one night stand. Also I discovered she had a boyfriend she was cheating on with me so I felt like shit and cut contact. I&#039;m genetically desirable, tall, white, high IQ, attractive facial features, but lazy and socially retarded. I blame the fact that every girl has cheated on me on some combination of me being terrible in bed and 99% of them having a personality disorder (my mom has a bunch so I&#039;m sort of trained for it.)<br><br>These days I just as I&#039;ve always wanted look for a nice girl to settle down with permanently. There&#039;s a few girls I message from time to time because they&#039;ll reliably sleep with me, but for one reason or another I don&#039;t get closer with them. When I get lonely I go through a miserable spiral. I go to certain chat places and seek out girls with the following criteria: white, of legal age, not morbidly obese, hasn&#039;t had a dick in her mouth before. This limits me to a fairly small pool considering most of these places are 95% male, but I regularly find someone. We fool around online for a bit and typically plan to meet and have some form of bdsm relationship ending in cohabitating and eventual marriage, but typically there turns out to be something wrong with them. That overwhelming loneliness temporarily soothed I spend nights instead beating off to Chaturbate because it provides me as close as I can get to that connection without having to actually talk to anyone.

I don&#039;t think I could see myself with a non-virgin in the long term, so I don&#039;t even bother with women because I presume that any I find even mildly attractive will not be a virgin, and I don&#039;t want to use the other ones for practice or such.<br>I&#039;ve taken &quot;sigma grindset&quot; seriously and want to focus on my projects, but I keep spending too much time thinking about women and family. I guess it bothers me to know that I&#039;ll never have a young, Christian wife and a family of my own, but that dream was dead as soon as I was born innacity of late 20th century. I just want to brainwash myself into not caring anymore, and although I believe this website has already done a lot for that, it still isn&#039;t enough. How the fuck do I sever my connection with humanity and become a diligent hermit? Anytime I get close to this psychology, I begin to worry that my state is permanent and I&#039;ll regret it, but I just want to be like that and be happy with it.

Generally I support unions given the worker power imbalance today, but I&#039;ve also seen some really corrupt ones as well. <br><br>Like the union at Safeway grocery store, for years they protected workers and made things better. But then a major split happened and the union only started protecting the old members and any new members got the new plan with the new benefits, which was nothing compared to the old members. As time passes the old members slowly left and the new members grew effectively destroying the union. Only good that $14 dues gave new members was they couldn&#039;t fire you instantly as the paper work slowed everything down allowing you to look for another job, were as the old members got a amazing plan with pension. I spent hours and hours on the phone between the union and the company trying to get the health care everyone said I had. Union wouldn&#039;t push the matter till I got a copy of my health benefits contact as because of the split they didn&#039;t know which plan I had, and the company kept saying they&#039;d get me a copy and then would leave me on the phone till the system timed out and hung up after 3 hours again and again.

I genuinely love her and she is my first and, aside from pre-pubescent stuff, i&#039;m hers. She is an enigma in a lot of ways, having problems with expressing her emotions and a lot of the times coming off as cold. The only reason she ever told me about this is because she loves me and we agreed to be honest with each other. I do believe that people can change but I am still afraid. She did admit she had bad fantasies about me before we got really close and now she doesn&#039;t feel that stuff towards me. She enjoys gore sometimes which I despise, and she &quot;jokingly&quot; said that she&#039;d want to be the torturer in a horror movie we were talking about. I understand that everyone has an edgy phase, myself included, but this isn&#039;t it since she actually did do terrible things. <br>I am really lost.<br>1. I genuinely love her aside of that part of her, and she does seem to have it mostly under control. <br>2. If we separate, that might hurt her really badly and maybe she loses control over her urges again, especially if the reason I give her is that I am afraid of it<br>3.

So how is it going anon?<br><br>Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:<br><br>https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o<br><br>It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/<wbr>blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204<wbr>/does-afterlife-obviously-exist <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, &quot;An afterlife definitely exists&quot;.&quot;</span><br><br>Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved.&quot;</span><br><br>Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.", "filename": "1611312397491", "ext": ".png", "w": 2289, "h": 1701, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 92, "tim": 1674029592872795, "time": 1674029592, "md5": "j5ZtICe07WuEX2a39Ajt0Q==", "fsize": 1527639, "resto": 28145677}, {"no": 28148457, "now": "01/18/23(Wed)03:14:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28145677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28145677</a><br><a href=\"#p28148456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28148456</a><br>So read NDE accounts and basically all you can about NDEs. Books, YouTube-videos, articles, everything. They will make you realize that there is an afterlife, that there is meaning to life, and that NDErs say that the primary purpose here is to learn to love everyone and everything, no matter what. That it does not matter so much what kind of things we do, but whether we do them with no strings attached, and summon that kindness, love, and compassion on the inside of our own minds as we do it. So the meaning of life then, according to NDErs, is the small things. Whether it is helping someone with their homework, cooking dinner for our family, cleaning the bathroom, or picking up trash from the ground. Whatever it is, if we do it with love, then that is so huge on the other side, it is amazingly huge. So life is like a game where the goal is to summon as much kindness, love, compassion, and generosity as we possibly can squeeze out of our intentions. Which admittedly is definitely easier said than done!<br><br>You are playing life on a higher difficulty anon. We are here to learn to shine with love and kindness _in a world where it is undeniably hard to do so_! So are you up for the challenge? You can do it anon. Show us you can do it.<br><br>So sure, suicide shoots you directly to heaven and infinite bliss. But at the same time, you were there when choosing to come here. Suicide is therefore like turning off the Silent Hill video game and going out in the sun and playing with your friends. Which is totally fine! But it&#039;s not beating and 100%-ing the game, which is to live until death takes you, and being kind and loving all the time along the way.<br><br>So choosing to come here is like choosing to go to Harvard. It is not easy, and you have to be somebody to even get to come here.

They are attracted to ways of thinking, intellect, humour, etc. etc. It&#039;s more nuanced than you&#039;d think. If this girl is as intellectually switched on as you say then I&#039;m sure she&#039;s privy to nuance in human beings. <br><br>Plus you said you&#039;ve already made moves on her. You held her hand, and you&#039;ve kissed her on the head. Those are romantic gestures, and if she hasn&#039;t been weirded out by them or questioned you on them, I&#039;m sure she knows the nature of your relationship is leaning towards a romantic one. <br><br>Honestly just get more comfortable doing these small gestures with her. Don&#039;t rush in to kiss her just yet, just gauge her engagement with your gestures. Eventually you should just tell her how much you like her. Assure her how much you enjoy her company, the discussions you share, etc. and see if she feels the same. She honestly just sounds shy.

You&#039;re individuals, with different upbringings, life experiences and expectations you should disagree from time to time. <br><br>With that said, sometimes it&#039;s worth picking your battles. If it&#039;s something insignificant you don&#039;t care about/that doesn&#039;t matter but they&#039;re going to make a mountain out of a mole hill, sometimes it&#039;s worth just smiling and nodding. In those situations it isn&#039;t worth a fight. <br><br>You just have to learn how to weigh up whether conflict is healthy or not in a given situation.", "time": 1674027235, "resto": 28148313}]}, {"posts": [{"no": 28143868, "now": "01/17/23(Tue)13:28:14", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt; ex-girfriend sends me text middle of the night</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I miss you cant stop thinking about you&quot; she says</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I say ok, ask her how is she doing </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she says she is fine</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;asks me &quot;Anon, did you really loved me?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I say yes, because I truly did (even if Im over her now, but dont say it)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;ok anon I need to tell you something&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proceeds on telling me on how she hooked up with a dude and they spend all night talking and she fell hard for him and he is amazing</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Im like wtf this has to do with me, but I just answer &quot;k&quot;.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;god, I shouldnt have said that...&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I guess not - I answer. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she blocks me afterwards</span><br><br>???<br>I mean, I couldnt give two shits about her but the whole situation got me confused.

I&#039;ve noticed a lot of girls in the Self Love movement very deliberately dance around this. &quot;I am taking the risk of overcoming my insecurities and say I&#039;m hot&quot; is allowed because she&#039;s signaling that she&#039;s insecure, which in a social context is a &quot;good&quot; thing.
