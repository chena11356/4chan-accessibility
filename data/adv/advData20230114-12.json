NEET. I was rejected by every girl I had a crush on in high school and this led to me giving up on ever trying to date in college because I was an intensely sheltered, incredibly insecure, and socially retarded spaz who never had a good male role model growing up (my dad has always been around but he treated me like shit up until about a decade ago). I figured since no girl ever wanted me in high school even when I lost the weight and got in shape, then no girl will ever want me and it would be a waste of time trying to find one so my college career basically boiled down to doing my homework and going to my best friend&#039;s place to get drunk at the end of the week (he killed himself in 2017 and I briefly thought about following in his footsteps). Then, I graduated college and moved back home with my parents to a tiny town with nothing for miles and my life has basically been the same since then. I&#039;ve never held hands with a girl in a romantic context much less had sex or been in a relationship. I&#039;m not a young man anymore and I have nothing to offer a woman although the friends I&#039;ve made since then really enjoy my company and would miss me if I wasn&#039;t around. They&#039;re the only thing in my life that makes it worth living.<br><br>So I guess after all that rambling I just have to ask- women, what do you think of me? I haven&#039;t had any female friends since high school so I don&#039;t have any concept of what women think of somebody like me. Do I sound pathetic and unlovable like I feel a lot of the time?", "time": 1673695041, "resto": 28119312}, {"no": 28119410, "now": "01/14/23(Sat)06:17:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28119383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28119383</a><br>Belgium<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;this guy&#039;s a faggot&quot;</span><br>I mean, a lot of things would fall into that category because mates like to fuck with eachother.

Obviously I was visibly upset but again, I wanted to get over it and just be positive yet she insisted to know if I was okay.

But I think it all depends. Me personally, I never had a hiccup in school or work. But I probably spent a couple hours per day scouring the internet for new porn videos to download of increasingly more fetish shit. At one point the majority of my storage was filled with porn videos, I\u2019m talking gigabytes upon gigabytes. I cleaned it all out on New Years, have only downloaded once but deleted immediately after: I still jack off a lot. I still watch porn, but deleting the storage was a big step.<br><br>But I have no idea how to deal with that. I\u2019m an incredibly horny young guy and I\u2019m not the type of person to go around getting enough casual sex to stave off horniness . No can I just up and stop being horny. The only thing I know is that I watch porn way less when I have active sex. Even when I jack off during those periods it\u2019s easier to imagine partners instead of pulling up a video. <br><br>Anyways another thing is that naturally, the more time you spend home alone, or just home in general the likelier you\u2019ll want to do it. I\u2019ve also been working out consistently like 6 times a week (3 upper body. 2 lower body . One day for cardio and endurance shit)for a little while now. It\u2019s been great but hasn\u2019t really helped stop my urge to jack off or anything. <br><br>Maybe I\u2019m just taking defeat too easily but I feel like it\u2019s not worth stopping watching porn or jacking for while I\u2019m single.

Set up a specific schedule. There are lots of excel schedule templates and allocate your time specifically, what days at what times and for how long you are going to work on coursework. Also be sure to get out of the house and take breaks. Light exercise can also help calm the mind, short meditations can also be good.
