I&#039;d suggest discussing this with a therapist. Of course male sexuality is predatory in nature, most animals commit some form or rape, it&#039;s not necessarily evil. There is of course a big, and I mean HUGE leap between thinking &quot;Damn this girl is cute you should talk to her&quot; and upsetting harassing, or objectifying women. The former is a natural thought while the latter is some form of fear of failure by justifying why you shouldn&#039;t try instead of failing and encountering the 1% of women who would get mad if you&#039;re try to talk to them. <br><br>I too fear failure and am afraid of the few women who may take my advance as some sort of slight. However, if you went up to someone and said &quot;Wow, nice hair! Did you dye it yourself?&quot; or something is a great way to channel those thoughts about wanting to talk to someone attractive. Women are people too and a compliment like that, or any for that matter, may just make their day. Another thing to take careful note of here is Outcome Independence. Look it up, live in the moment.<br><br>Sexuality is a natural part of the soul just like death is a natural part of life. It is simply demonized and we all should work towards looking at it in a different way. That of course comes with some limits, exploring the pleasure of sexuality should be done carefully so that you don&#039;t become addicted or accidentally create unwanted life.<br><br>I will say this, women *are* free of objectification and sexualization and now choose to partake in it willingly. 700 years ago a woman was property of her husband or her father. Now, women are strong and independent. I personally believe thinking and doing evil are different.

The early pick up artists of the mystery era learned magic tricks for this. I find that cheesy and it never works as well as they say it does. I recommend asking to see her finger nails if they\u2019re painted. Or if you can somehow figure a way to get her to feel the cloth on your sleeve, try that. Your main goal is a light touch in an inoffensive area. You don\u2019t go directly to the leg or back. <br>To add more sexual flair, try and find a way to get her to think she offered it first. Do this by bringing up topics that can go in a sexual way, but never make them sexual yourself. A good example here is to bring up something like how you like I sleep, or what a good morning is like. If she started to add in talk of last relationships that\u2019s a cue to start responding with \u201coh I once had a girlfriend that was like that!\u201d as you get more familiar the sex part will come. But by that point you\u2019ll need to decide what kind of girl she is. There\u2019s the kind they only want experienced men and there\u2019s the kind that want modesty.

What you really want deep down, well beyond the point you would normally consider selfish, intrusive, or even mean, and not whatever your upbringing thinks is expected or proper. Seek conflict to resolve issues, instead of shutting up and doing something you don&#039;t like to avoid conflict. That has carryover into all of social life. <br><br>The book Models will reaffirm that position, and go even further by saying that it&#039;s actually good to offend some people, to polarize them quickly and force them to choose if they vibe with you or not. By laying all the cards of your personality on the table, she will either conclude things quickly knowing she won&#039;t like you, or she&#039;ll really like you a lot. And the you she likes is the real, honest you. Even if most women don&#039;t like your personality, the few who do will actually like the real you. A win/win that saves time and creates better bonds.

I won&#039;t have any sexual thoughts to anyone except the man I am in a relationship with. I won&#039;t even CHECK OUT a man&#039;s body or face because the physical awareness of an attractive man/woman lets people have dirty thoughts jump into their brains. I don&#039;t even watch porn or look at sexy male model pics when I&#039;m in a relationship. I don&#039;t even pay attention to attractive men who are walking by me in the street. I want to devote my entire sexual energy and affection to my partner because that&#039;s who I am romantically and emotionally invested in. I would want my partner to do the same for me.

It&#039;s the ideal relationship. <br><br>I know some people may say it&#039;s jealousy or insecurity, but I think women just want a man who only looks at them with desire, love, and affection and have no eyes for anyone else.

I think there was just an unfortunate convergence of three things that led to me recoiling after actually interacting with a female, and those were 1) flaring hormones which caused to me to obsess over women, 2) this obsession led to me doing the self improover which reinforced the obsession, and 3) the physiological and psychological (ie sexual) stresses that nofap and the other things created further reinforced the obsession, while also making everyday unbearable.<br>Anyhow, I asked the first out, we got lunch, I made a fool of myself because I had never interacted with a female like that before, and then I started internally self destructing after she wouldn\u2019t agree to a second \u201cdate\u201d (the first hardly counts in my mind).<br>Cont", "time": 1671196856, "resto": 27922861}, {"no": 27926304, "now": "12/16/22(Fri)08:22:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27926302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27926302</a><br>That\u2019s roughly the time I discovered incel stuff and it made sense.

It just changed all of a sudden. I realized that I was the issue. I came to understand why women don\u2019t find me attractive, and it\u2019s unfair for me to hate them for doing what they are naturally wired to do. I also accepted that I was choosing not to become attractive. I learned then and now know that I have to both become attractive AND go out of my way to talk to women.

A common talking point of theirs is that the sole purpose of life is procreation, starting families and that they can&#039;t do this, but this isn&#039;t true. As is commonly observed among men reaching their zeniths in their 30s and even before them, there are TONS of women available to do this: single mothers, workaholics who had a change of heart, conventionally unattractive women with losing streaks, etc. The options are there, but they refuse them because they aren&#039;t the idealized form of whatever women they have in their head. This contradicts their common argument of that procreation is the SOLE purpose of life, genetics doesn&#039;t care how many dicks have been in a woman&#039;s hole, just that she can do the work of producing a child and delivering them to term. The group isn&#039;t deprived of this, it&#039;s simply a deflection. It&#039;s also untrue that the purpose of life is procreation, life doesn&#039;t care if you do or don&#039;t, the fabric of spacetime won&#039;t fall apart if you don&#039;t get your dick wet, it&#039;ll just march on regardless of what you do. You also won&#039;t care in death either, simply because it either means an afterlife surrounded by the absolute shitload of family waiting for you on the other side or that it&#039;s a void of nothing, you won&#039;t ever know the fate of that lineage of yours, whether it continued or died out. Even if lineage did matter, the goal of a incel would then be to keep amassing wealth and influence until a woman comes along to snare her interest, life is inherently expansionist, so if producing heirs matter, so too does power and influence so that new life gets the best possible start to do it again. Of course they undermine their own argument by not doing this either. <br><br>Basically, the entire incel group are just a bunch of a overgrown children who desire perfect wives in a world that never promised them such a thing in the first place, its a death cult of ignorance to be ignored.", "filename": "1656801236664", "ext": ".gif", "w": 226, "h": 224, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 123, "tim": 1671268299407428, "time": 1671268299, "md5": "kYXgw+ArvhGiH9YPaqg+UQ==", "fsize": 186144, "resto": 27922861}, {"no": 27931952, "now": "12/17/22(Sat)04:27:22", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27931928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27931928</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the fabric of spacetime won&#039;t fall apart if you don&#039;t get your dick wet</span><br>The meaning of existence is different from the meaning of life.

JFGTonight/Jean Francois Gariepy on Odysee, mostly covers news, with some other things, like film reviews, and debates occasionally (although those go up wherever he did the debate on and not his own channel). David Duke might also do stuff somewhere, from what I have seen, that guy is actually pretty good, I really like that guy and he is completely misunderstood and disingenuously framed for having been a member of the KKK.

And my younger brother went through almost the exact same thing.<br><br>This is gonna sound retarded, but your brother might have anxiety (either he has an anxiety disorder, or he&#039;s just an anxious person, idk).<br>It&#039;s really fucking common for kids to express anxiety via explosive temper tantrums, because they don&#039;t know how to handle their bullshit any other way.<br>It&#039;s less common in teenagers, but it&#039;s definitely a strong possibility that your brother might be going through some shit that he doesn&#039;t know how to handle, and exploding is the only outlet that he has.<br><br>When I my brother and I were kids, we&#039;d lose our fucking minds and throw tantrums whenever we lost a game too many times. I can&#039;t speak for my brother, but in my case, my thought process was &quot;I can&#039;t do this. I can&#039;t do anything right. I&#039;m useless. I&#039;m a fuckup. The world is out to get me. God spits in my face.&quot; I didn&#039;t like not being &#039;in control&#039; of the game, so I was a real bitch when I got my ass kicked. I wouldn&#039;t even be angry. I just needed an outlet for the... tension? I guess that&#039;s the word. So I&#039;d cry or scream or hit things, or hit myself. My brother once threw a controller. He also used to be a real screecher when he lost games.<br>Both of us also reacted to OTHER stresses in a similar way. We&#039;d try to stay calm, but would eventually explode. We had no other way of managing the stress.<br><br>Our parents eventually put us in sports, which made a HUGE difference.<br><br>Frankly, I think the best thing you can do is help your brother find a healthy outlet for his anger. Don&#039;t shame him or yell at him. Stay calm and distract him with something else. If you see him getting wound up, tell him (nicely) that it&#039;s time for a break. Praise him whenever you see him making progress. Get him into sports or into a productive hobby too.

Bear in mind BLUE is being viewed through \u201choneymoon\u201d lens so I may not understand her flaws, and I likely paint ORANGE in a bad light. I&#039;m a 22 year old guy.<br><br>I started a relationship with ORANGE back in November 2021. She was the first sexual relationship I had (partly due to my lack of trying, partly because my dating profile was absolute shit). My parents think she brought out a great side of me, and I do think my life improved a lot over the past year. She\u2019s very supportive of me and willing to compromise, and looked out for me in times of stress. I did have a few issues (e.g. her weight, her finances, and her unwillingness to work on either) but I kept quiet about it.<br><br>However, at the end of October it was enough, and I broke up with ORANGE. I didn\u2019t feel attracted to her body and wasn\u2019t sure I saw a future with her unless it was the path of least resistance. <br>I felt shitty after the breakup, and was very stressed from work. A few days later things were improving, and I created an improved dating profile. I matched with BLUE, and we hit it off and kept seeing each other over the week. <br>However, unbeknownst to me, ORANGE contacted my family about the breakup and said it was likely due to stress on my end, and so my parents convinced me to get back with ORANGE. I thought it could have been a mistake, and wasn\u2019t sure the fling with BLUE would progress, so I got back with ORANGE. <br>I ended things with BLUE, telling her I couldn\u2019t commit to a new relationship immediately.<br><br>What I didn\u2019t expect, was that BLUE said she was happy to wait until the new year. BLUE\u2019s friend even contacted me to say how highly BLUE spoke of me, and that I was truly something special.

Similarly, you are anxious prematurely about a hypothetical &quot;I fall for Blue and then she goes home to China&quot; - hasn&#039;t happened yet, you are cutting off decisions at the wrong point in the decision tree. <br><br>Note you haven&#039;t confirmed who molested Blue- at that age, likely to be a family member. Might be worth thinking that one through medium/long term in terms of not exposing your children to that person. Also if she was molested there is a vastly higher chance her siblings were too etc. which also increases the chance of them being predators (tragic). So, keeping a close eye on that issue is a good idea. Also, If resurfaced as a teenager and she&#039;s 22, would have been right in the midst of MeToo iirc, during which there was a heightened experience of collective trauma. May be less severe going forward.

But this year, I got back into Terraria and I played Kirby&#039;s Adventure. For both of these games, I felt genuine fun playing video games for the first time.

But many years after I had gotten it recommended to me by a friend and after having been somewhat spoiled, I watched Neon Genesis Evangelion and the End of Evangelion. All in a short amount of time. It&#039;s probably a clich\u00e9, but I&#039;ve never seen an anime like this until now. Touching stuff, sure, but I mostly watched anime for laughs. I watched it subbed on Netflix, and the voice acting was good. The music was good. But the story I do believe has the highest stakes of any anime, since it&#039;s about what it means to be human. I relate to Asuka more than Shinji, without the trauma, but I certainly get Shinji&#039;s problem with escapism. However I&#039;m at a point I already was aware of it. I&#039;m also much happier than when I was 14. I wonder what it would have been like if weeb, friendless 13-14 year old me had watched it. I certainly didn&#039;t have the self-awareness to have seen Asuka in me. Would she have been my waifu? It the end it was Misato. But I would certainly see myself in Shinji. I have to take to heart . Have any of you been moved by that series? A lot of people said it changed their life. I just crammed the last episodes and the movies in one day yesterday (not the rebuild ones yet), and I&#039;d started a little over one week ago.

The fact that I turn everything into a chore. But I&#039;ve managed to make it better. I use that ability to do the things I have to be responsible for, while ending it for others. For example, I once kept a diary and tried to write everyday, but it didn&#039;t work out. This year, I ranted and then I came back to that and added stuff whenever I wanted. I now have a diary without the pressure of having to write in it, which ensures its longevity. I just wrote one yesterday after watching Eva, because I needed to vent.<br><br>My second problem is that I put too much emotional weight into it. The thing is I get angry and obsessed at video games. I don&#039;t play rhythm games because I know how toxic I would be. I once played a Google Doodle rhythm game and pushed until perfection. I&#039;m not very good at video games and it frustrates me. The thing is, there are few things I&#039;m really good at. I&#039;m very average. But video games are worst and I tend to overreact. Not to the point of destroying anything, but certainly to the point of meltdown or just not having a fun time. (Thanks, F-Zero, and Zelda Four Swords).

I have done the same for 5 years and I don&#039;t want anything to change. I take walks at 3 AM out in the woods by my standard route. I have done this for many years. Not everyday or something like that, just a few times doing the month. I don&#039;t really want to travel or have a female companion so far. I work 5 days and week and doing the weekends I play with my brother over the computer. If he is busy with his girlfriend, them I have almost nothing to do. I keep a journal. This is another important routine for me. So If my future wife was about to land infront of me, boring would probably fit in my head. That&#039;s what was meant by me. <br><br>Not sure if the last sentences made sence to me. It probably had more to do with the fact that the coworker was autistic. He cannot see that he destroyed her capability to think on her own. He once said &quot;how hard can it be to come up with solutions...&quot;. I understand their marriage better than himself. It&#039;s straight up sad. Their daughter is autistic too. She has been handfed her whole life. Takes time off when she &quot;forgets&quot; to bringer her bike home with her. &quot;Daddy will always fix it&quot;. Takes an out of his workday to drive her to school. She is not only autistic she is the biggest bitch on earth. If I did this to my dad at 16-17 years old, he would have told me to shut up and get on my bike. The idiot cannot believe that he raised his child wrong. This is probably getting a little bit off topic, my reading comprehension is not the best. To answer your last sentence the best I can, there is nothing more important for me, than thinking of other people. Have my flaws sure, but other people always comes first. If I treat her the same as she treats me, there it nothing that makes that seem abusive. What my coworker did seems abusive, because he does not have the ability to recognize any form of proper behavior - I do. I do agree with the part about agreeing even when you&#039;re wrong.

The other nitpicks were that she picked the worst most basic and mean friends, her parents were villagers and barely spoke english, just wouldn&#039;t be able to bond with them easily and she likes to sing and paint but her painting and singing was pretty bad... like lacking self awareness bad...<br><br>maybe we both just needed therapy for our own individual problems. <br><br>The way you wrote here really ivoked some feelings in me and made me think like I haven&#039;t thought before, you seem like a very interesting guy.

People can change but very rarely do overnight. It seems like you gave great thought at the time, so I can only assume it was the correct one. From her it could have been just straight up being nice or maybe she just lacked personality. The part about her lack of self awareness is somewhat telling me what direction I&#039;m leaning towards. Was she rather unintelligent? She goes out of her way to please others, but picking mean friends, doing many things uncontested and also comes back to the same boyfriend twice, should really tell her personality trait. Based on the information given, she would not have changed in my opinion. The next man in line might have to ask himself the same question you did. <br><br>I have always been a big daydreamer.

My coworker says I am a little weird, but so are they. Have an entire little description of all off them. Maybe being a little too brutal sometimes, but hey what about we stop lying to eachother?

I know it&#039;d hurt them and probably me as well, but I don&#039;t want them in my life. The thing is like most people in this country, they pressure you without being blunt, I don&#039;t really feel at ease here, but moving out the country, one of my life goals, wouldn&#039;t help me since I&#039;d be terribly lonely.
