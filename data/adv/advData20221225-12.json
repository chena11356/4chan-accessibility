You are overthinking this whole situation\u2026. It\u2019s just one woman\u2026. Let me tell you as a guy in his 30\u2019s who did a 2 year womanizing thing at 30 years old, that it\u2019s kind of funny how things work out with women\u2026. <br><br>So I decided after becoming single to womanize. But I was really bad at it\u2026 I spent months directly approaching women at bars\u2026 got some numbers but mainly rejections. And the dates went really bad. I\u2019m talking dates with like 10+ women. <br><br>Eventually all of those experiences changed me. It took awhile but you and do something over and over and over again and not experience growth. Like if you played basketball twice a week for 6 months there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t get better. <br><br>So eventually I just got better at getting women. But they weren\u2019t coming to me. I was still approaching them but being smoother about it and had better instincts in dates about what to say and how to converse and stuff. I got laid a lot for a while. <br><br>Then after like a year of that lifestyle, I woke up one day and was depressed. A hot girl had left my place after a great night and I should have been happy but I wasn\u2019t. I felt shallow. I didn\u2019t want a relationship but I didn\u2019t want to womanize anymore. so suddenly I stopped wanting to get women. <br><br>This new perspective came over me and for several weeks I just started doing my own thing. Then all of the sudden hot women started APPROACHING me. <br><br>I\u2019d be in the laundry room at my apartment.. I\u2019d be walking down the street in a college area\u2026 I\u2019d be sitting by myself at a bar just sipping a whisky minding my business\u2026. It was crazy dude\u2026 I just got flocked by women because I had become genuinely aloof. I didn\u2019t even want them anymore.<br><br>conclusion: if you want women spend time trying to get them so that you get good at it and burn out and stop wanting them. once you don\u2019t want them anymore, women will start approaching you. <br><br>This one girl is no one my man.

But anytime we&#039;d go out, she&#039;d get shit face drunk to the point where she was throwing up. She also was constantly wired up and had a fucked up noise. Think she was doing cocaine based off her behavior. Wasn&#039;t the sharpest tool in the shed. She was kind of shallow and her idea of a relationship was being treated like a princess.

Literally the first time it was us two alone hanging out (probably the 3rd time I knew her), she told me every secret of her ex. Sexual fantasies and all. She did a few GDP videos. She was very attractive and she knew it. So guys would constantly approach her, even if I was with her. Every guy we knew was trying to get with her. We never became exclusive, but after awhile she started talking about all these times she &quot;accidentally&quot; would sleep with guys. It was fucking weird. Got out of there real fast, too many red flags. Her friends got tired of her attitude eventually and ghosted her. She then moved across country lol. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Girl #3: Baby fever</span><br>This one as ok. Probably like a 6 in looks. Didn&#039;t really have a stable job or plan in life.

I said nah, I got early work meetings but I&#039;d love to take her out on a date tomorrow. She declined saying she was getting into a relationship with a guy tomorrow from work. Then ghosted me.

But I do a lot of &quot;fun things&quot;, as some put it. And I&#039;m apparently nice and easy to get along with. Finally have a good stable job. So I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s why I attract these kind of women. But its exhausting after awhile.

A coworker basically asked me what are you doing this weekend, but I replied &quot;just staying home, I don&#039;t do anything&quot; - kind of felt bad because I liked her as far as work goes and hoped she wouldn&#039;t take offense, but because I just didn&#039;t feel like a relationship with her on a lot of levels - i.e. she was really perfectionist / hard worker versus my slacker&#039;s mentality, she was really offended by any type of edgy language / humor, and I am an autist who stays home watching horror movies, playing video games, researching conspiracies. The major reason why I politely declined was that I knew she liked me, and that she had a high opinion of me - whereas my real personality and lifestyle would not only be incompatible but also invalidate her perception of me, and I have a bad pattern of disappointing people I like / respect so I didn&#039;t want that to happen. I&#039;m fairly sure 90% of guys would not have cared, and went on the date for better or worse. That would probably be the rational course of action, but it wasn&#039;t mine and I don&#039;t exactly regret that. <br><br>My point is not all men are same, anymore than all women. I&#039;ve struggled with &quot;porn&quot; addiction yet I&#039;ve virtually never watched actual pornography because naked people, genitalia, and images of people having sex are grotesque to me. My &quot;material&quot; was always stuff like pictures of women dressed nicely, characters from anime, or in the last several years kpop fancams. Whenever I tell other people in the NoFap community that I barely ever actually watched &quot;porn&quot;, they react like I have three heads. We all don&#039;t live according to what&#039;s normal, and there&#039;s a significant difference between talking to women you know and approaching strangers, unless you&#039;re really high confidence.

Sissy porn is almost always equivalently disgusting. I also have maintained normal attraction for and the ability to get an erection for normal females. I have had a long-term relationship with a normal girl, and never had trouble getting it up. So what the fuck is wrong with me?

One of the biggest issues is that women cannot stomach this weird interest, and it understandably makes them doubt my masculinity. And to clarify, I&#039;m into both myself wearing it and a female partner wearing it. I didn&#039;t create this fetish for myself, nor have I ever been successful at destroying it, and that&#039;s not for a lack of trying--I&#039;ve tried to deny myself this for maybe half a decade now.

Addiction is addiction. I might have been unclear though: I am totally interested in actual sex, &quot;the way God intended it&quot;. I desire to have completely vanilla experiences like this on a regular basis with a partner. And to respond to the last bit: in high school I got swept into the early life stages of the NoFap trend and refrained from PMO for about 120 days. During this time I got a girlfriend and became busy with so many fulfilling challenges, responsibilities and friends. I had totally forgotten about this fetish.

To me, a fetish is a sufficient and unusual condition for turning somebody on, not a necessary and unusual condition. That&#039;s my bad for misusing the language though. Anyway, the issue is that even though I can be satisfied without it, I deeply desire to fulfill this fetish, and I fear I could never follow through with a promise to give it up. Yeah, maybe I&#039;d make it in the short-term, but I always imagine that 5,10, or even 20 years down the line the curiosity and passion would probably break me into wanting to engage with it, and breaking a promise like that could fatally hurt a relationship or marriage.<br><br>Hopefully that clears it up.

It&#039;s basically just the thought of never engaging in it that bothers me. Not sure how I&#039;d find someone who&#039;s understanding though.

Especially the reveal of some beautiful girl taking off a mask, sweaty and disheveled<br> - Perhaps the person inside is uncomfortable or embarrassed, but there&#039;s no way to show it--they are forced to play the character. I find this erotic.<br>- Going off the last point, the aspect of forced dress-up, especially if another person is involved and demanding it, is such a high level of control and domination. It&#039;s essentially the most elaborate BDSM. And many people who engage in this enjoy adding further BDSM elements on top of the costume, which makes it even more intimate, personal, and devious. There is also an aspect of attention and care here when someone helps you dress up, just like the ASMR you might get from a haircut or massage.<br>- I have always loved customization and personalization in all its forms: in video games, on devices, decorating, and so on. There is definitely some truth to the age-old whining that men&#039;s fashion is &quot;boring&quot; compared to women&#039;s fashion. At a basic level, I just enjoy dress-up, and assuming a female form makes this even more involved and fun then the incongruence of plain crossdressing.<br>- I&#039;ve always been into textures (velvet, silk, plush, etc.) and tight clothing. This goes hand in hand with the suit-up process as well as putting on female clothing on top of this, which obviously has way more of these kinds of things than male clothing.<br>- I feel secure about my masculinity, and I often feel so disgusted by the distorted, machismo image of masculinity (beards, cars, bellies, suits, intimidation, etc.) that I think I end up fleeing all the way to being as feminine and cute as possible, almost to prove a point.

We were friends since we were 15. When our lives went off the rails at 19 we were always beside each other. At 20 it caught fire. We spent so many days in her aunt&#039;s basement or my childhood bedroom lazily in bed, laughing, listening to music, smoking, looking into each others&#039; eyes, making out, having sex, but the best part was just falling asleep next to each other, knowing we&#039;d wake up and do it all over again. We had nothing, but we had everything. We didn&#039;t put words to it, because we thought there was no need - at least I did. <br>Things change. She moved 1500 miles away for college. I stayed. She got into the art scene over there. I got my degree and a 9 to 5 job. She got engaged. I had other lovers, but in the back of my mind I always compared them to her. I tried my best to move on, but there was always her picture in my mind no matter how much I tried to bury it. Seven years passed.<br>She came back into town for christmas two days ago. She invited me to a christmas party at her parents&#039; house. She told me she ended her relationship with her fiance and lost her job. Once everyone went to bed we went back to her room and we did everything and everything felt just like it did seven years ago. She leaves on the 28th.<br>I have to tell her I love her before that happens.

(She broke up with me shortly after) I dont think im ugly but i know i definitely come across as stuck up and an asshole. I try not to but i get so nervous around people especially ones my age. Next year ill keep trying for more friends and being a better person. My job will kind of help with that because im on phones for a lot of my job and can talk to people. Most of the time im silent because i dont know what to say while im fixing their shit. Let me lay out my goals, finish my degree, make a few friends, fix my personality, fix my body. I have other goals like making some music but i need to do the other stuff first. Yeah im probably classified as depressed and desperate.
