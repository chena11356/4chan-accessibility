Shits great. If you&#039;re looking for advice as for the how to then i&#039;d recommend that you stop caring about the future so much. If you see a girl that arouses you just take it one step at a time,starting with saying a greeting like Hello. Then you ask her name,call her pretty and offer to get her some food and chat so you can ask her questions and have her blab about herself. She gives an excuse then you ask for her number get it and text her a week later for a date. If she makes it any more difficult than that(Or doesn&#039;t even give you a number) then just find another chick.<br><br>The most important things with handling women though is to not talk a fuckload and to not let sadness or anger be your emotion when talking to her. Just mainly focus on making moves AND making her talk by asking questions. Where you take her and what ACTIONS you do are what matter. For example if you don&#039;t make real moves like kissing a girl during or after a date,she&#039;s gonna get the wrong fucking impression. Doesn&#039;t matter if you held her hand,met her parents or hugged her it has to be REAL MOVES like grabbing her tits,slapping her ass, or kissing her. When it comes to where you take her,make it places where the both of you are talking. Nothing dumb like a concert or a movie. Otherwise she&#039;s gonna get the wrong idea about you and act all weird when you try to stick your penis in or let your pent up (beta) emotions fly. If she&#039;s not receptive to any of this?

They&#039;re rare, but they definitely exist. It can get demoralizing at first to see a lot of guys just leave if they hear they won&#039;t get free sex, but from what I&#039;ve heard from the couple femanons on here who found their partners this way (and what I&#039;m convinced of myself), it&#039;s well worth the patience once you do find that special someone.<br><br>The silver lining of it being rare also means that the people who do wait both stand out and tend to really mean it. The latter tends to select for quality (at least for people who are honest and committed to their ideals), while the former makes it easier to meet others doing the same. <br>Even if you meet some people who aren&#039;t willing or able to wait while you are dating, you will still grow your social network in the process.

As in, they&#039;ll press for something sexual but that isn&#039;t &#039;technically&#039; sex. It&#039;s just another way of them getting their fill without any commitment, so watch out.<br>Second, a social network only helps if the people in it are genuine and non-judgmental towards you. If they&#039;re the kinds of people to try to make you feel like a freak for waiting, who say you should just give up because it&#039;s too rare, or something along those lines, it&#039;ll be a headache for you.", "time": 1673149174, "resto": 28058696}, {"no": 28072994, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)22:54:05", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28071472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28071472</a><br>im incel.", "time": 1673150045, "resto": 28058696}, {"no": 28073071, "now": "01/07/23(Sat)23:11:49", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28072859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28072859</a><br>Don&#039;t listen to that dude, he&#039;s just a degenerate, cynical coomer.

My wife is great and we are truly best friends but why does being married still kind of suck? It\u2019s just so bland and boring and I know that\u2019s a good thing but to an extent. We have sex regularly but it\u2019s never really exciting. Sex is like a chore at this point and life is kind of just going on as usual.

Best you can do is create the kind of family you know should exist, that supports one another and gives without thought of receiving. A good family builds together, a bad family builds separately, and tears each other down to build their own. American individualism, influenced by popular conceptions of self-reliance and &quot;maturity&quot;, is a detriment to our people&#039;s prosperity, and breaks the very mold set by hundreds of thousands of years of human society. It goes against our very animality to go off on our own with no regard to the tribe we&#039;re meant to be a part of; it&#039;s a recent, and, in my belief, intentional development. &quot;Divide and conquer&quot; applies more than anywhere to the family unit, and thus the community, culture, and nation as extensions of this basic, foundational structure. We are divided, and so we are conquered. The only way to win is to break the divide and find prosperity amongst ourselves, for ourselves, together, with our tribes. The greatest lie they ever told us was that Tribalism is a dead, ignorant relic of the past, and only held us back. It never meant that we need be at odds with one another, only that we maintained ties to those who would support us. Look at us now, and how they act in the face of this lie.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

A day can be two days, a week, a month(prolonged events such as a sprain, breaking a leg, depression) - this will alter the calculation significantly which is why closure has to be attained properly. The longer you are held by something, the more valuable it becomes(this applies to happiness as well).<br><br>3.
