I feel as if I missed out on a lot of fun and sex and feel almost like I regret getting married. I love my wife but I just feel anxious like I never really got to live. I lost my v card at 18 and we got together right before we turned 21.

My wife is pregnant now too which is amazing news but I\u2019m no less horny and now she is already having less sex with me which is driving me crazy.

I grew up a rather lonely childhood, no parents and bullied by my peers. Unlike you though, there was a kind girl out there who gave me a chance and we became friends, then some other guys slowly became friends in those childhood years, and I practically had nothing to do for myself. I never had the courage to step outside my comfort zone (socially at least) and I coped by drowning myself in vydia vydia and more vydia. unlike you, I was obsessed with success at an early age, and even when I was able to enter college early and start my career, I knew this was nothing but cope for having lived a coward and never standing up for myself, letting others take over my decision making. Whenever I wanted to talk to someone, I was invaded by a sense of dread comparable to seeing gangbangers approaching you on the streets, at 2am. The only thing that made me &quot;collapse&quot; was when I looked up that girl during a very low point in my life, and found out she got recently engaged and had moved on, while I was still stuck in a loop of maladaptive daydreaming, where I only imagined the perfect fantasy of us two together, like in a Disney movie. After that, I started changing as a person and putting more effort into taking chances; not wasting opportunities.

That&#039;s no small feat, be proud of yourself. However, this is unfortunately not a one-and-done deal. Your brain likes familiarity, even if you suffer from it, and hates change due to evolutionarily reason. Meaning that you&#039;ll be prone to falling back into familiar patterns. This doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re a hopeless case, though. Every time it happens, you&#039;ll notice it more quickly and thus can pull the breaks more quickly, too. I get that you&#039;re worried, you probably thought once you identified the problem and got rid of it you&#039;d be opening a new chapter. And in a way, you absolutely have! But behaviour we&#039;ve shown for years, and thought patterns that are familiar to us, aren&#039;t easy to unlearn. <br>Be kind to yourself. This doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ve failed. It means you&#039;re in the slow process of succeeding. You&#039;re worrying about being stuck in this rut forever because you&#039;re prone to worrying, not because there is any truth to it. The brain is a tricky, clever beast. Be kind to yourself, don&#039;t chide yourself for falling back into familiar patterns. Recognise it, acknowledge it, then do what you can to break out. Again, and again, and again. At some point, your brain will get the message. One thing to keep in mind that helped me just by being aware of it: you are not your thoughts, you are the observer of your thoughts. So observe them, acknowledge them, then deal with what is causing them. <br>This might sound cheesy but as long as you don&#039;t let fallbacks discourage you from another attempt at change, you will be fine and get there eventually.", "time": 1675494164, "resto": 28268101}, {"no": 28268216, "now": "02/04/23(Sat)02:07:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28268101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28268101</a><br><br>most people aren&#039;t built to wade through rough political discourse in a healthy and balanced way like that.<br><br>best thing to do is stick to stuff that is actually directly affecting you when you eventually do get tangled in something that catches your eye.

When they see a guy they want to settle down with they will withhold sex to try larp as a trad wife because they believe and rightly know that if they give it up quick the guy is less likely to fall for the tradlarp and her value will be lower to him. Its a negotiation tactic and it works. Only issue is the Internet and modern technology which makes it a lot easier for the guy to later find out the trad wife he married or wants to marry gave it up to guys for free in the past whilst he had to jump hoops.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just a ticking time bomb for a dude who has his shit togheter</span><br>If he never finds out and she&#039;s good with her tradlarp, she can probably get away with getting fucked by Chad on the side and live a happily ever after with her loving husband.

I would do embarrassing shit in public and say shit to girls when I was out that would get them to smack me. I would do this with friends which was great because it would just be a fun time and then we would all push each other to go further.
