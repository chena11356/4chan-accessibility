Shits great. If you&#039;re looking for advice as for the how to then i&#039;d recommend that you stop caring about the future so much. If you see a girl that arouses you just take it one step at a time,starting with saying a greeting like Hello. Then you ask her name,call her pretty and offer to get her some food and chat so you can ask her questions and have her blab about herself. She gives an excuse then you ask for her number get it and text her a week later for a date. If she makes it any more difficult than that(Or doesn&#039;t even give you a number) then just find another chick.<br><br>The most important things with handling women though is to not talk a fuckload and to not let sadness or anger be your emotion when talking to her. Just mainly focus on making moves AND making her talk by asking questions. Where you take her and what ACTIONS you do are what matter. For example if you don&#039;t make real moves like kissing a girl during or after a date,she&#039;s gonna get the wrong fucking impression. Doesn&#039;t matter if you held her hand,met her parents or hugged her it has to be REAL MOVES like grabbing her tits,slapping her ass, or kissing her. When it comes to where you take her,make it places where the both of you are talking. Nothing dumb like a concert or a movie. Otherwise she&#039;s gonna get the wrong idea about you and act all weird when you try to stick your penis in or let your pent up (beta) emotions fly. If she&#039;s not receptive to any of this? Never call or text her ever again because she&#039;s just not interested.<br><br>Follow that and pussy is e to the Z", "filename": "file", "ext": ".png", "w": 800, "h": 1135, "tn_w": 88, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1673164041505380, "time": 1673164041, "md5": "qSYgwY9ydhfITPQmK2Y3GQ==", "fsize": 867715, "resto": 28062521}, {"no": 28074055, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)02:54:20", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28062521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28062521</a><br>A few days after my 27th birthday.

Many women consider holding hands in a crowd a quite intimate gesture reserved for a partner, as it implies to the world &quot;we are together, I am his woman&quot;. I am not certain whether she saw it that way.<br><br>We went to a cinema, where she felt cold. I gave her my wool sweater, which obviously collected a bit of my sweat and body odor over the day. She pressed the sweater against herself for warmth. (You do not hug with the smelly sweater of a guy who repulses you on some level, do you?) I also rubbed her hands and arms a bit for warmth. Again, a gesture she accepted readily. I briefly touched her thigh once. No reaction whatsoever, neither enthusiasm nor discomfort.<br><br>While never outright enthusiastic about our touches, never initiating (except touching my hand sometimes), she never rejected them, either.

I was devastated, we talked it out and he promised there were no more secrets. We worked on our communication and trust and it was going well. <br><br>But now, a bunch of months after we started planning out the wedding, I&#039;ve been told he actually went on several dates with this woman, lied a lot to me about what he was doing at the time and actually slept together the day before he moved in with me. <br><br>I feel dumb as hell. It&#039;s in the past, so should I just talk it out and forgive him, build trust back and move on?<br>Problem is, even if he won&#039;t do it again he&#039;s proved he&#039;s capable of doing it and he&#039;s perfectly fine lying to me. So I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m dumb for even considering working on this. <br><br>Am I being gaslighted into believing this has no importance because it&#039;s in the past? Does it make sense breaking up a relationship that has been working perfectly for a while now?<br><br>Am I a retard for considering this has been working when he has cheated on me?", "filename": "main-qimg-89b7657863d75d9758fe61c1ba26ef97", "ext": ".gif", "w": 268, "h": 400, "tn_w": 167, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1673256847281802, "time": 1673256847, "md5": "Lhh0Zh/k8d/MFSOAwdbICA==", "fsize": 2333584, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "how-to-deal-with-broken-trust-before-marriage", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 28081902, "now": "01/09/23(Mon)04:35:49", "name": "YMCA", "com": "Also, sorry about the shitty sentence building.

The first 6 months we dated were perfect (we never argued, and we saw each other almost every day). Since I graduated university and started working in August I suppose that I&#039;ve been a little more irritable and less patient with her. She has been getting upset with me constantly since then because I&#039;ve been urging her to be more active such as to focus more on school and to finally get around to getting a driver&#039;s license. Lately, for the past 2 months we argue almost every day for the littlest thing such as things like how she sat on the other couch and not next to me when watching a movie together or whether or not 21 pilots is considered emo or not. <br>We haven&#039;t had sex in at least the last 4 months and she says it&#039;s because her anti depressant medication lowers her libido which is fine. <br>Overall, the way I&#039;ve been acting is being really impatient with her and raising my voice because of getting annoyed. After New Years Eve, I told her that I was going to change and have been trying my hardest to please her in everything for this last week.<br> Today we had a really good day with no arguments but as I drove her home I ran a red light because the yellow light turned red as I was driving and was going like 30mph. She told me not to do it anymore and I said I wouldn&#039;t do it anymore but told her that I couldn&#039;t just brake if I was going fast. We argued about that for about 2 minutes before I said she was right and that I&#039;m sorry. <br>After I dropped her off home, we texted for about 2 hours about everything and she says that she loves me but is not happy about things lately and that today was a good day but it was soured by the stoplight incident. I told her that I&#039;m trying to make it up to her and will keep trying in the future and all she says is &quot;idk&quot;.

I did get one kiss in high school, but she was the one who initiated it and it took me by surprise and it didn&#039;t go anywhere. Even after I had lost my virginity, I had major social anxiety when I would go to bars. I would feel like a little kid surrounded by grownups or something. It took me a while to get comfortable being in large groups of strangers. Part of what helped was that when I was trying to push myself to meet women after that relationship I mentioned ended, I started to go out by myself all the time. So I got pretty good at talking to strangers. But it took effort. And now I&#039;m putting in effort again because I didn&#039;t try to meet women for a few years and my flirtation abilities got really rusty during that time.

Money and looks may better your chances but ultimately confidence is what matters. It is essential in having good game so you can shoot your shot effectively. Insecurity (along with boredom) is the number one turn off for women, they&#039;ll date a deadbeat alcoholic with multiple convictions cause he actually ACCEPTS who he is, unlike you incels on here who constantly whine about no gf. <br><br>So we have the fake Chad, who thinks that flashing alot of money and just being an overall asshole is the key to getting laid, and it may work short-term. But making women feel insecure about themselves will eventually make you feel the same way. Then you&#039;ll find yourself with shallow, toxic broads who will probably just make your life misery. You won&#039;t even like being by yourself because you won&#039;t know WHO yourself is. Your entire purpose is to get laid and validate yourself, like Bojack almost. Such is the fate of the fake Chad.<br><br>Why not work on yourself? I&#039;ve been suggested this a few times in my life, but usually when people say that they&#039;re really saying you&#039;re ugly and or undesirable. And that there lies the problem with this philosophy. It&#039;s good to have hobbies and goals, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON&#039;T MAKE A FUCKING MOBY DICK OUT OF IT. Realize that skills and gains don&#039;t appear over night, but eventually you come to a point of bulkiness where only other gymcels will wanna fuck you, lmao. Simply put you cannot put 100% of your energy into &quot;yourself&quot;, you gotta relax, go out sometimes, etc. If you make money to get women, you&#039;ll lose em as soon as the money runs out. DO WHAT MAKES YOU FUCKING HAPPY, WHICH IS A NATURAL AND GRADUAL PROCESS. <a href=\"#p28069554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28069554</a> is honestly right here, I thought I was an incel once but really I just lacked the confidence and the game to get pussy.

When you go out to bars/clubs, you can&#039;t be looking for girls TOO MUCH. What I mean is you can&#039;t just expect your 10/10 dream girl to just come up out of nowhere. You got to realize it may not happen tonight, but you should still have a good time. Another incel problem is that they obsess either about the woman they WILL have or the ones they COULD&#039;VE had years ago. Living in the moment and realizing &quot;I don&#039;t have a girl, what can I do NOW to fix it?&quot; is the first step to curing inceldom. Looksmaxing may help, but you cannot just use it as a means to an end. Like an addict, you have to truly want to change to do so. Stop being antisocial and start talking to people, little by little. The bus driver, the cashier, people you see around. Specially older people since they&#039;re more friendly and less likely to be staring at their phones. From there you become more confident and able to speak up for yourself, and you feel less like repressing who you are inside. That doesn&#039;t mean you should start ranting about the nogs to people, but just chatting about common interests, movies etc. Then the idea of approaching a women who makes you feel all tingly feels MUCH less intimidating, trust me on this one. And just be a cool and confident version of your self. <br><br>It&#039;s about being a whole person, essentially. Try to get in contact with your family regularly, assuming they&#039;re not peices of shit. Watch the sunrise. Get some pets, if you can. If you&#039;re stuck in a dead-end job, make the best of it.

The economy dodged the inflationary impact from this by 1) maintaining interest rates at declining and eventually near 0 levels since the early 80s; 2) most governments and large corporations around the world have used the US dollar to conduct trade and settled contracts thus a lot of dollars have sat around internationally as opposed to being in the domestic economy. <br><br>The Russia/Ukraine war and importantly the resulting seizing of Russian assets denominated in USD has made more countries leery of holding cash reserves of USD and have even been attempting to get them off the books, thus slowly forcing them back into the US economy. <br><br>To deal with the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve must now raise interest rates to pull liquidity out of the domestic economy because hyperinflation tends to destroy governments historically. Instead, many large businesses have been living severely overleveraged for decades, because they could. In a declining interest rate environment you can rollover debt to a lower and lower interest rate and just be able to keep maintaining the house of cards. <br><br>But the Fed is now staring down the barrel of crashing the economy (killing off all these zombie corporations in the process) or risking a hyperinflationary crisis that ends the US federal government.

It would have been our first time for both. We talked a lot about this thing and my biggest goal was to leave behind my sexualized condition and only do what she comfortable with, pushing the boundary only a little. The first boundary was to touch or look at her belly. I couldn&#039;t understand why she always said &quot;NO!&quot; in a sharp tone whenever I tried to, but then I learned she was really insecure about how it looks. (it looks perfect) From then on I always told her she was perfect and I loved everything about her, because that is after all how you build confidence. The next boundary was touching her breasts and then I realized again she was insexure about them but also how sensitive she is on her nipples. So when kissing her neck, ears, chest, licking her nipples have made her very ... aroused. Licking her ears was more like a tickle, but her nipples was different for her and I could see that in her expression and feel that in her breath and movements. After kissing further down and down, building the tension of anticipation I stopped, of course. But I kept caressing her...<br>When talking about masturbation she admitted that she never did, however she would feel something strange sometimes when we does squats and when she clenches her legs tightly against her pillow.

She was really ashamed, but she trusted me. Again, I told her its perfect. Later I would ask her if I may kiss it, lick it.

In short you don&#039;t love them, you love yourself or at least the fictional version of them you made up. It means they can never let you down, never cheat, never fail you, never risk anything. You can just wallow in fantasy loosely tied to someone who once lived. And perhaps the big selling point, they leave your mind whenever you don&#039;t want to think about them. <br><br>A real life person is none of those things. Real life people are imperfect, with imperfect behaviour and unexpected and sometimes undesirable reactions, quirks and behaviours that may leave you wanting. That aren&#039;t ideal. Real relationships have demands, they don&#039;t just go away when you cbf, they may let you down, cheat or fail you. So you retreat to fantasy, but acknowledge at least on some level how unfulfilling and unhealthy that is. <br><br>You&#039;re having a love affair with yourself.

I think she likes you, and is being honest with what she says, however this raises the problem of why. The answer is probably the above; she doesn&#039;t know where her life is heading and she&#039;s reluctant about letting a relationship with a new guy define all her long-term plans. I reckon there&#039;s probably more stuff going on in her life, or stuff that has happened to her in the past, that has made her hesitant to commit to anything new that comes into her life, and she probably has a number of ideas about where she should/ would like to take her life going forward. If I&#039;m right about my assessment, she&#039;ll probably change her mind about you if you conduct yourself in an honest, forthright manner, and just keep trying to be yourself. That said, if she asks for space she will probably not take it well if you refuse. Women at that age are more mindful about their boundaries.<br><br>Now if things continue like this for an extended period of time with no signs of changing, or you ever get the impression that she is being dishonest and perhaps trying to use you for something, then you should raise the issue with her, and if she remains obstinate or freaks out, then either she is trying to use you as a placeholder while she waits for a better man, or she is simply too confused and uncertain about what she wants in order for her to give you what you need in a relationship long-term.

My friend raised my hand and yelled them that I was volunteering to come. There was no turning back now, since the girl already took my hand and the audience was cheering.

You can literally get laid at the drop of a hat and use men as you please!&quot; I told him that what he just said was completely untrue and unrealistic. What he said after that was the following: &quot;How so? You&#039;re easily a 8/10. You could be a model if you wanted. You&#039;re skinny, and your boobs and ass compliment each other nicely. Not to mention you have perfect teeth.&quot; Idk why but that got me instantly wet and my face to turn bright red. The idiot noticed my face and asked what was wrong. Completely oblivious. I suspect he has aspergers.<br><br>T. 19yo NPC", "filename": "images (3)", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 740, "h": 414, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 139, "tim": 1673233133288989, "time": 1673233133, "md5": "DnwiqmjSNRPgO21UNSXMMQ==", "fsize": 25013, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "oneitis-in-my-big-bro", "replies": 4, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 5}, {"no": 28080973, "now": "01/08/23(Sun)23:27:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28080456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28080456</a><br>Talk to him and take the lead.

I can never think of anything to say outside of simple questions regarding our surroundings/situation and them. I&#039;m not ugly, I just look like a default character, and I&#039;m pretty charismatic and funny outside of these situations. Sorry about the long post, but I guess I&#039;m just asking: &quot;What the hell do I talk to women about?&quot;. I&#039;m not looking to just dog random women, I want to get to know someone I like and develop a relationship.
