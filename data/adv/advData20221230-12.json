I recommend walking every day. 30 to 60 minutes. If that sounds boring, walk with a friend, listen to an audio book, whatever. It&#039;s good to be out in nature.

I know it&#039;s not my looks because I&#039;ve gotten unsolicited complements on them including from random women and had a few girls (in retrospect) lay themselves up for me to ask out, but there&#039;s some mental problem with me. Idk what it is. Some kind of autism or loveshyness. I think it comes from the fact that I don&#039;t like the way my body looks. I&#039;ve been obese as long as I can remember, but it&#039;s only now that I&#039;ve lost about 70lbs that I have a bit of confidence and am getting positive attention.

I tried for a bit and got some online dating matches (a few dozen over a couple weeks) but couldn&#039;t close any of them. One got pretty close, but she ghosted and then revealed she had a kid.

I will probably get a high end Asian whore from a soapie to give me VIP service for my very first time. Hopefully this cures my loveshyness.

This one place there were two levels with a glass/plexiglass whatever floor... you could sit and drink staring at naked thai girls dancing and winking at you while also looking up at thai pussy gyrating above you.

In retrospect if me and friend spoke about it before we paid for prostitutes we would have abstained and reconciled our common despair.

I&#039;m absolutely 100% not alone in having grown into my looks/body/all of that, but I think I have better perspective and a better ability to articulate what I&#039;ve seen than most guys. When you&#039;re younger every interaction you have with hot girls is framed through the lens of being a hunter trying to &quot;secure&quot; something. Most young guys, even ones who think they&#039;re well intentioned/romantic, want to &quot;secure&quot; something steady so they don&#039;t have to keep hunting. Unfortunately when you&#039;re younger most of the truly attractive girls aren&#039;t as into you. Older guys will tell you to &quot;stop caring&quot;, or even just to outright be an asshole. What they really mean (and struggle to communicate I think) is that you need to stop caring about the outcome. Girls have a sixth sense for that. If they catch a whiff that you&#039;re that invested in the outcome of you guys dating it&#039;s a huge turnoff. Unfortunately it&#039;s a difficult thing to turn off, and I have found that really the only way to get over that hump is to just date/fuck a lot of girls until you get to the point where your brain accepts the idea that &quot;this isn&#039;t the last girl&quot;. I&#039;ve fucked around 25-30 girls and seriously dated maybe 8 or 9. At this point I just don&#039;t really care and I think the only real value in any of it is as a sort of trophy that you flex. Relationships are kind of pointless outside of that assuming you have game (or money in the case of this thread).

I love him alot and even my mom who doesn&#039;t like him at all (He&#039;s technically my step grandpa but he married my Grandma way before I was even born) cried alot. <br> The last time I saw him was just on Christmas eve for a couple minutes when me, My uncle and brother in law jumped in a car to pick him up off the floor after he fell off the bed. <br> When I saw him he was still my Grandpa. Sure he looked skinner and bald but was still insisting he was fine and could do everything himself. I haven&#039;t seen him but now he is apparently just lying in bed with empty eyes who can barley grunt and or mutter. He&#039;s is constantly pissing the bed so he&#039;s just naked with a catathder thingy in which he would never have allowed just a year ago. It&#039;s all so fucky to think about.<br> Any advice on how to cope with all this?", "filename": "FlJlihdaEAA_HRA", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 3000, "h": 3600, "tn_w": 208, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1672385074338938, "time": 1672385074, "md5": "wdAFpiLQ0zL4a1HLo2mOIA==", "fsize": 3072792, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "80-year-old-grandpa-has-days-left-to-live", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 28010305, "now": "12/30/22(Fri)02:54:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28010232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28010232</a><br>Hold tight to the moments where you think of your dead loved ones.

It&#039;s so weird how she doesn&#039;t really talk much and just kinda complies, however she does look visibly very turned on when I do these things. When I ask if she liked it she responds with something like &quot;I guess so haha&quot;. And yes she is very hot.

I am by no means stupid, indeed the exact opposite and no one takes me as otherwise. <br><br>The ugly truth about women is, as much as they complain about men getting handsy with hot girls, women get far more handsy with hot guys. Strangers thinking they have a right to touch you is very demeaning and invasive. It doesn&#039;t feel good to be treated like a piece of meat, and it&#039;s seen me end up in, shall we say violating, situations when I&#039;ve let my guard down. I stopped ever letting my guard down in social situations for that reason. <br><br>Yes, I&#039;ve had a lot of empty sex (mid triple digits) but that creates insecurities for many women when you&#039;re in a relationship with them. The same feelings men complain about on here for women who&#039;ve had some sex, women complain about too. I am married, but even after all these years it sometimes makes my wife uncomfortable. <br><br>The unwanted touching has simmered a bit as I&#039;ve approached middle age, but the endless flirting has not. That too creates uncomfortable situations with my wife. She mostly understands that I&#039;m not reciprocating however one can only see their husband be flirted with so much before jealousy boils over. She sometimes jokes she&#039;s going to need to poison my food &quot;one of these days&quot;. <br><br>I have certainly had far more possessive and jealous girlfriends in my life. I&#039;ve had girlfriends and ex-girlfriends attack me with weapons. Knives seem to make up the bulk of it but sometimes blunt force objects. Some have tried to cut off my dick, some have tried to cut my face and others have tried to take my life. Sometimes while I&#039;m awake, sometimes it&#039;s what I&#039;ve woken up to.

Both men and women need to set good examples, obviously, but women have kids and most closely raise them, so they are typically the guardians of morality in the home. A man typically needs to provide a stable setting for that home. This isn&#039;t to say men and women can&#039;t or shouldn&#039;t help each other out and positively contribute to each other, but it does show the difference in priorities. A woman who becomes a worse mother so she can compete with a father isn&#039;t as praiseworthy as an excellent mother.<br><br>As the Dutch Calvinists put it, men and women are of equal moral worth, but they are not equal. Your father can and should love his daughter, but that love won&#039;t necessarily show in the same way as it would for a son.

Pedophilia is a form of paraphilia - an abnormal sexual desire, usually involving extreme or dangerous activities that can harm oneself or others. Pedophilia in particular is the sexual attraction of young, prepubescent children. Lolicon, on the other hand, is the sexual attraction to fictional characters, whether or not they are canonically prepubescent doesn\u2019t matter as long as they appear to be so, which can be found in lolicon media in the forms of anime, manga, and other anime-related media such as visual novels. It\u2019s also worth noting that pedophilia can be an attraction to both male and female children, whereas lolicon is exclusively an attraction to females. The male equivalent to lolicon is shotacon.<br><br>Now, why did I feel the need to define both words? That would be because some people confuse pedophilia for lolicon, and vise versa, and some use the words interchangeably. However, I believe lolicon to be a completely different sexual desire to pedophilia, and now I will try to explain why as best I can.<br><br>Pedophilia is a harmful sexual desire. Child molesters will try to groom and/or rape real, young, impressionable children. I cannot stress just how disgusted I am by child molesters, and I sincerely hope you\u2019re disgusted - or at least angered - by them as well. There are also pedophiles who do not physically try to have sex with children, but still do directly harm them through child pornography. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they are the ones producing, distributing, or consuming it; the mere fact that they are supporting the production of child pornography will inevitably put more children at risk.", "time": 1672350501, "resto": 28006880}, {"no": 28007492, "now": "12/29/22(Thu)16:50:51", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28006880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28006880</a><br>No because<br>1.

As I\u2019ve stated, pedophilia is the sexual attraction to real children - key word: real. Lolicon is the sexual attraction to drawings and depictions of young girls. It should also be noted that these depictions are never realistic and always have an over-exaggerated appearance in the moe style of anime and manga. \u201cWhy is this difference important?\u201d one may ask. \u201cThey are both sexual desires targeting young girls,\u201d one may state. To put it simply, liking lolicon is no different to being attracted to stick-men.<br><br>Lolicon cannot be compared to pedophilia. One involves the sexual abuse of actual children, and the other does not. No child is present in the making of lolicon material, thus no child is being harmed. If it\u2019s the characters age that causes one to believe that lolicon and pedophilia are the same, I have two things to say. Firstly, not all lolicon are children. Some of these characters are older but happen to look much younger. Secondly, even if the character is canonically a child, it doesn\u2019t matter. It still wouldn\u2019t be child pornography because their age, much like their appearance, is entirely fabricated. This doesn\u2019t just apply to lolis, this applies to all fictional characters. They are not real. Their age is not real.
