I&#039;ve yet to meet a girl who doesn&#039;t already have a bf/husband.<br>Seems like every girl interested in guns got influenced by their bf or dad, and I suspect it&#039;s similar for other hobbies as well. I&#039;ve met one girl (sporty short-haired tomboy) who got into guns all by herself. She said her husband is afraid of guns so she might as well be the one protecting the household. That guy must be the luckiest son of a bitch alive and he&#039;s not even realising it.<br>How do we stay one step ahead and find those great women before they are taken? Surely there must be some hobbies single women enjoy that don&#039;t involve netflix and alcohol intoxination?

We foolishly fall for the improover memes, thinking that doing &quot;xyz&quot; will increase our chances of finding a girlfriend but it makes no difference. You either have &quot;it&quot; or you don&#039;t.

Non-verbal communication can be more powerful than words. When a woman is interested, she will send you signals, consciously or otherwise. It&#039;s then up to the man to respond to those signals. If she&#039;s not sending you any signals, then chances are she isn&#039;t interested. You can talk to her if you want, but you&#039;ll only be confirming what you already know.

The chances of you getting rejected by 3 people in a row however, is also still fairly high. Very close to 42% to be exact. So even if you only have a 25% acceptance rate you just need to ask more people. Your &quot;true&quot; success rate could be even higher!

A small number of users may believe otherwise, perhaps due to their moral principles, but find NoFap\u2019s broad-minded approach works better for them than the moralistic focus of \u201cchastity\u201d websites that dot the Internet. NoFap does not encourage lifelong abstinence from masturbation or sexual behavior. Rather, we encourage our users to abstain for a period of time for the duration of their reboots\u2014typically around ninety days. While some abstain for longer periods of time\u2014even for life\u2014most of our users then return to masturbation having freed themselves of the need to use pornography.

You need strong roots to resist the temptation to &#039;acknowledge the female&#039; in the rational parts of your brain. Even entertaining their questions for a second lowers you down to their level, and that&#039;s how they get you. &quot;Respecting women&quot; is a byproduct of having a healthy body; women, as much as they are axiomatically weeds, can also be flowers that bloom (for you) when your energy is in surplus. The only thing that matters about a woman is that she has a vagina that can bare you a child. Only macho retards take that as an excuse to project their insecurities upon women.

As anyone would be, she was worried, and I loved it. I liked her attention because it felt like reassurance that she cared about me, even though no attention was ever enough for me. <br>I also trauma dumped on her a lot, to the point that it was hurting her own mental health, which was already in the dumps. I am selfish, and I hurt her consistently, without really knowing. Or maybe I knew and didn&#039;t care. It was the first time I could freely talk to someone about how I felt, so I went and told her my own thoughts as raw as I could.

I hurt her so much that her psychologist told her to cut contact with me, and that everyone else around me stopped talking to me (we had mutual friends. Those were all my friends).

Just because broad ideas like &quot;obey your father and husband&quot; were social norms doesn&#039;t mean that they were applied without limits, let alone taken to the edge of possibility by even a plurality of men. Yes, those inequalities CAN be abused, and they WERE abused, but to argue that the inequality is *necessarily* abuse, or that any inequality exists for the specific purpose of abuse, is false. To argue that men would regularly sodomize their wives just for the hell of it (and mind you, shoving objects in her would be treated as abuse, not sex) is completely detached from reality. It&#039;s pure histrionics based on your own massive overreaction towards inequalities you don&#039;t like. <br><br>I fully agree with you that the simple *potential* for abuse of an inequality is bad enough. It warrants strong concern at minimum, and in many cases justifies putting legal equality in place. But I don&#039;t agree with the take that men are uniformly depraved beasts who would stop at nothing to demean and injure women for their own amusement. If they were, then all of your arguing would be moot, since no man would ever give a shit about the potential for doing wrong if his entire purpose IS doing that wrong.<br><br>I&#039;m not here to tell you to have kids.

And NDErs talk about how we can do whatever we want forever there. But they say that we came here to learn to love and be kind and thrive here despite how hard it is in this world.

When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.<br><br>Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light.

I don&#039;t thing anything about it but it is seen as harsh. I had many chances with girls in past couple of months but had not luck because of that. When I disliked something I was vocal, but also when I like something. Thing is girls see me as cynical, pessimistic and harsh, while I do not feel that way. The only thing that brings me down is only the fact that I am lonely and no girl wants anything from me, even though I have model-tier looks, am intelligent and a man of my word.<br><br>Around girls I cannot relax, and I can only relax when I know a girl for a while and think of her as good. I can mask my nervousness but outside of that I rarely get a chance because women are turned off because of my &quot;harshness&quot;, even my family told me.

It would become the world\u2019s most popular religion and every loser would be recommended Buddhism for its effectiveness.

In fact you can\u2019t be successful without suffering. Losers suffer a lot because it is a sign that they need to fix their lives. But rather than trying to shape their environment and empower themselves, they blame all of existence for their suffering and declare that ALL life is suffering and we would all be better off not existing. Which I already proved isn\u2019t true because some of us LOVE life. <br><br>Here is some advice: give everything you got.
