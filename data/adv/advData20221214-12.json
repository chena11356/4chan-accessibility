I&#039;ve seen it in a popular balkan forum where people write things to seek approval or condemnation from commenters, and women overwhelmingly supported OPs decision to dump a rich 30-something man for being too old and hoping to get married quick. The commenters would tell her similar things anons say here about 30-year-old women looking for a man, like, &quot;she&#039;s had her fun and now looking for a fool&quot;, and similar things.

Have you tried any funky diets like the candida diet? Have you checked blood levels to see if you&#039;re high or low in any strange compound?<br>I&#039;ve had relatively light acne in comparison, but it&#039;s persistent and has caused scarring. After cutting it out, dairy - and likely the natural hormones therein - is the culprit. I still eat greek yoghurt and kefir.

So how do I fix that?</span><br>Basically, you have to stop being such a fucking asshole all the time. Don&#039;t worry; I&#039;ll elaborate more. Your family history is sad, but not surprising. It definitely fits a profile. Your parents did a shit job. That&#039;s not your fault...but it IS your responsibility to fix now if you want things to turn around. And considering how you said you were raised by a Super Nintendo and not some variety of Playstation or X Box I&#039;m gonna guess that you&#039;re not young either. Meaning it&#039;s well past the time to learn how to interact with people.<br>And I think a part of your problem is that you&#039;ve come to define yourself solely by your interests, and likewise define other people by theirs. YOU are not anime or Evil Dead, and likewise someone who doesn&#039;t like those things is not making a personal attack. Likewise, these other people are not the Minnesota Vikings or whatever. There is more to them, and there would be more to you if you stopped hiding it.<br>The other problem here is that you&#039;ve divided people based on their interests as either &quot;normie&quot; (hilarious considering your video game taste) or as &quot;based 4chan autists!&quot; or whatever the fuck. And I think a lot of that is simply contrarianism on your part. For example, you said you&#039;d date a trekkie, even though you didn&#039;t say you&#039;re into Star Trek. So why the exception then? Oh right, because Trek isn&#039;t &quot;normie&quot; so it&#039;s ok for people to like whether you like it or not yourself. And since you have this childish black and white view of the world, you don&#039;t seem to realize that there are people out there who like football and Game of Thrones, AND video games and cheesy horror movies. I would know; I&#039;m one of them.<br>So you need to learn to stop pigeonholing people (yourself included) by their interests, learn to find common ground, and learn to read the room to figure out when people don&#039;t want to hear your shit.

I guess thats all daydreaming ever is but at least I am now conscious of it enough to control it. <br><br>The doing creative stuff or reading and mental stimulating hobbies (example tabletop games might be something you get into that leads to friends at least) help to let out the restless imagination. But the more mental meditative habits build your ability to redirect from restless daydreaming to more restful creative hobbies so do try both. Also exercise and lifting. Lifting helped me in that it gave me guilt free time to daydream but it also distracted me from daydreaming as I got more focused on why the fuck isnt my form right? If you can daydream well enough while doing some exercise thats a great way to get it out too. Biking and hiking are my favorite ways. Swimming in the summer is great to do. <br><br>Sometimes you cant force stop the daydreaming but you can force yourself to do some menial exercise or do the dishes while daydreaming. Makes the tasks easier.

The mind has a nice trick, where when we get exhausted, suddenly it decides we didn\u2019t even want it anyway. Exhaustion is a mf, but it can be beaten. If you were certain there was boundless energy on the other side of that exhaustion, it would be easy to continue. What stops us is believing it\u2019s only going to get worse. The exhaustion feels like death and depression, and as I said, we think it means we don\u2019t want to. This has to be questioned. The truth is that there\u2019s something to learn. You need to learn to create energy. You need to learn how you end up where there is no energy, etc. It becomes a defeat because you have never felt that way before and made your way through.

And I know for a fact you are deeply insecure because it\u2019s why you demand virginity in a woman in spite of not being virgin yourself.<br><br>It tells me you do not have a single spiritual or religious reason for it, and you have egotistical needs for it. Your self-worth rides on whether or not a girl has fucked before or not. And before you assume I am enabling whoredom, no. Women with body counts higher than 3 - 5 are red flag as fuck and should be avoided.<br>I read your post loud and clear, you aren\u2019t an incel but you\u2019re certainly swallowing their bullshit by giving in to their dichotomous thinking of<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Either she is virgin but ugly</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or not and has fucked bodies in the double digits</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No inbetween, no ugly whores and no pretty virgins</span><br><br>You want the key to finding a decent woman? Virgin or otherwise? Snub your own insecurities. Work on yourself. And this isn\u2019t to change yourself or \u2018brainwash\u2019 yourself into accepting whoredom. It is to help you identify red flags before even needing to ask body county and actively avoiding them. You will acquire strengths and mental health in yourself and it will be your new standard. It will lead you to an actual human woman who isn\u2019t a degenerate whore.<br><br>Incels could achieve this too but let\u2019s be real, they\u2019re the pot who calls the kettle a nigger.

I think the degenerates in the mainline Protestant branches scared the rest of them into thinking that accepting leeway there is a path to modernism. The exception to this is probably the Anglican groups which tend to be far more lenient in their confessions and therefore you are more likely to find a priest/pastor there who agrees with you. Conservative Anglican churches exist you just need to look around, in the states we have the ACNA as well as like a million little splinter groups, idk about Canada. But also most evangelical denominations (Baptist, Charismatic, Non-denom, etc) do not have any kind of overarching hierarchical structure in their churches and they are usually self-governed. In these cases you could very well find a conservative church that also accepts a nonliteral interpretation of Genesis, but it might difficult. <br><br>The stance on creation is pretty unimportant in the grand scheme of things in your Christian life. Finding a church that agrees with you on every single little doctrinal issue, especially if you&#039;ve really thought through this stuff, is extremely rare. Focus on finding a church close to you that you can agree with on the big picture shit. For example my theology is in line with Lutheranism pretty broadly, but the LCMS in the states prefers the literal interpretation of Genesis. I literally just choose not to care, it&#039;s not like that will be a requirement for you to believe as a lay person in any reasonable church.<br>Do this: <a href=\"#p27907609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27907609</a><br><br>Rome and the East are options, but I think they have more problems and caveats that you need to tackle before jumping ship.
