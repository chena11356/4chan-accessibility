I have a little sister and basically she&#039;s been like a brother to me. we grew up together playing videogames, playing outside and doing the same things. although our tastes tend to differ (for obvious biological reasons). when I went to kindergarten I would constantly be a total autist and get my shoes untied. I would always ask a teacher to tie my shoes for me because my mother and father simply didn&#039;t knew how to teach me to tie a knot. on a eventful day I was having english class and I noticed my shoes were untied and then I waited till the lecture ended to ask the english teacher to tie my shoes for me. she then instead of tying them, taught me how to tie them. and that stuck with me. because she taught me so well. I can still remember vividly that day. <br><br>not to mention the oneitis I had in middle school. she had the same nerdy tastes I had and she was gorgeous. she would always cheer me up and compliment me. boosting my prepubescent ego. but I never mustered the will to ask her out. which I deeply regret, and am always reminded by the mantra that I keep repeating to myself whenever I remember about that: &quot;Coward.&quot;<br><br>Fast forward some years and I&#039;m pretty much all by myself now. with all those positive memories that I have about women, I still am growing bitter and resentful towards them. not personally, but biologically. is there anyway to stop that?", "filename": "d115901ef84651cf5880c3252fa4bb3c", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 600, "h": 800, "tn_w": 187, "tn_h": 250, "tim": 1675843566311314, "time": 1675843566, "md5": "0RWQHvhGUc9YgMMlL6S7PA==", "fsize": 53353, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "women-in-my-life", "replies": 23, "images": 1, "unique_ips": 6}, {"no": 28298595, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:08:23", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298383</a><br>Choose to go outside you pathetic incel", "time": 1675847303, "resto": 28298383}, {"no": 28298615, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:12:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298595</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dont read ops post</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;call him an incel</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refuse to elaborate, leave</span><br>Now thats some 100% certified /adv/ice", "time": 1675847576, "resto": 28298383}, {"no": 28298618, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:13:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298595</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mistaking neet for incel</span><br>inb4 I would tell you to go kys but those are meme terms anyways.", "time": 1675847636, "resto": 28298383}, {"no": 28298629, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:15:08", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298615</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now thats some 100% certified /adv/ice</span><br>more like 50% reddit and 50% /r9k/", "time": 1675847708, "resto": 28298383}, {"no": 28298650, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:18:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "No it&#039;s part and parcel with dealing with women these days", "time": 1675847933, "resto": 28298383}, {"no": 28298664, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:21:06", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298650</a><br>you know it&#039;s kinda funny though. all these technological advancements instead of making us more civilized, just amplify our ape-like mental stagnation.

The 7 who decline to have a discussion do not do so because they dislike the salesman - they are busy, they don&#039;t like the product, and so on.<br>Of the discussions another smaller group, about 1 in 10, agrees to a meeting. The reasons for not wanting a meeting are legion, as well. So for an average salesman 1 in 80 calls is a meeting and 1 in 400 is a sale.<br>Some salesmen have a higher success rate. They have better skills, a better voice, more experience, and so on. Their &#039;conversion rate&#039; can be, oh, 1 in 120. Others are worse - inexperienced, obviously nervous, and an &#039;unfortunate&#039; voice. They have a conversion of 1 in 900.<br>here is the thing: the people who reject the salesmen are not a group that have decided to say &#039;no&#039;, Each one is interacting with the salesman one-on-one with no input from other past calls. Hating &quot;all potential customers&quot; is literally insane because you are not interacting with all of them as a group and they are not all colluding against you. Each interaction is a new chance to succeed.<br>Women are the same. And, just like sales, you can grow in experience, become more comfortable talking to them, learn the signs you are not connecting with them properly and how to fix that, and so on to increase your odds of &#039;conversion&#039;.

We went to the cinema and she laid her head on my shoulder.<br>I noticed that by not masturbating all i think about is going out and meeting new people, i feel bored and honestly useless when i sit at home on my computer by myself, so in a way, masturbation was making my lizard brain think it was happy playing games and watching porn, when it wasn&#039;t at all..<br><br>So guys, do me a favor, try it yourselves, it&#039;s not a fucking meme.<br>I also feel like i could pump a huge load into her, i can feel the pressure, like i have to pee, that&#039;s probably my prostate full of semen.", "filename": "asd", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 235, "h": 164, "tn_w": 235, "tn_h": 164, "tim": 1675854378824694, "time": 1675854378, "md5": "WFnPmBCOo95qUinz8/Pvgg==", "fsize": 18053, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "male-holy-grail", "replies": 14, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 4}, {"no": 28299145, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:09:37", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "weird, I jerk off 4-5 a day and my skin is perfect<br>when I wasnt jerking off I havent had a chance to meet anyone despite going out, I&#039;m just outside by myself, no matter how much I wasnt to meet new people there&#039;s no one to meet, it&#039;s so boring going out<br><br>what did you say to this girl when you were out? recount the conversation for us", "time": 1675854577, "resto": 28299127}, {"no": 28299173, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:14:56", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28299145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28299145</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what did you say to this girl when you were out? recount the conversation for us</span><br>we met on an app, at first we were talking as friends, but i made myself available to help her with something she needed, and that&#039;s when we met, after that i showed her a really nice place in my city and asked her if she wanted to go to the cinema with me and she was happy about it i could see it... we talked about everything really, like she was my &quot;buddy&quot;, but now things are going another way, i think she is already waiting for me to make the move so i will", "time": 1675854896, "resto": 28299127}, {"no": 28299186, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)06:18:00", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wouldn\u2019t this be a case of correlation \u2260 causation?<br>Also this is literally another one of those claims that not jerking off will solve everything in life.

Which means it&#039;s possible that he was expressing transient narcissism, and not the full spectrum of it. The projection tactic, which he employed to shift all the blame onto you, is one of the traits that narcissists employ during the discard cycle.

If it turns out that you were in an abusive relationship, that knowledge may provide a closure to the relationship which you never would have received otherwise.<br><br>The best thing you can do now is go no contact for your sake, and stick with it.

I choose japanese 101 because learning a new language is difficult for everyone so people are more open to talking to their classmates since they need someone to practice and study with and the class is fun and kinda silly so most people would have their guard down. <br><br><br>Then I looked at the class roster and picked out girls I was interested in. I looked up their social media and studied their likes, interests, compatibility and most importantly learned whether they were single or not. I found 2 that I liked that were single and matched with me so I collected my info on them. <br><br>Next, on the first day of class I made sure to sit next to one of the girl&#039;s I liked, the one I sat next to became my GF. I talked and established some rapport with her and we became familiar enough with each other that we continued sitting next to each other for the whole semester. I learned from my research of her and my early interactions with her that she was a quiet, somewhat introverted girl that was easy to get turned off, especially when guys try to flirt with her. I made sure to hide that I liked her and just tried to be her friend so I wouldn&#039;t scare her off. <br><br>From there I just used what I knew about her and we gradually became friends. After that she was ok with hanging out with me outside of class and we started hanging out a lot. Then the opportunity came for her to see me as a potential BF which was her birthday party and I used what I knew about her to get her exactly what she wanted as a gift. After that she completely fell for me so after 2 and a half months of first meeting her we began to date.", "filename": "1652675128620", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 800, "h": 1200, "tn_w": 83, "tn_h": 125, "tim": 1675848574544771, "time": 1675848574, "md5": "TCj7JMvBEhV7XReBYM29sA==", "fsize": 107055, "resto": 28297841}, {"no": 28298707, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)04:30:15", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28298386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28298386</a><br>That&#039;s not what the app did.

In my case it&#039;s my wife who&#039;s regularly travelling. It&#039;s not even a lack of sex from her, but like others have said it&#039;s the innate drive to conquer someone new. I&#039;ve grown considerably more attractive to women now I&#039;m in my 30s and definitely get noticed more, whether it&#039;s due to increased financial stability or simply growing into my looks, it&#039;s been hard to ignore. <br><br>The more you do this, though, the more likely it is that you&#039;ll meet someone you want to be around more than your wife. Contempt lies that way. You may have all the logistics and opsec down to a T.

Your wife will notice this. You may tell yourself you&#039;re in control and that sex is just an act. I did.

Your first few wipes are going to be exploratory, where the objective is to get the main mess away safely so you can be more aggressive with subsequent wipes without having to worry about making contact with any fecal matter. Then, you start going to town on your ass in a sort of right cheek ass crack left cheek right cheek pattern and then when it&#039;s almost clean, like when you can swipe and not see any shit on the tp at all, you can start making successive swipes with the same paper until there is, and when you can go around your whole ass crack and inner cheeks without any shit, you&#039;re done, now vigorously wash your hands and forearms in the sink with soap and water (I take showers myself. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;toothbrushing/flossing</span><br>beyond just preventing cavities and gum disease by eating a better diet and drinking lots of water, there are lots of other things you can do to improve oral hygiene.
