The prototypical Chad and &quot;Chadlite&quot;, a man with genetic advantages, i.e. height, bone structure (broad shoulders, strong jawline), race, low hairline, etc. If a man possesses these physical characteristics, he can afford to be scrawny (although ottermode is preferred) or even out of shape (&quot;dad bod&quot;). He can also get away with being a little shy and socially awkward. A woman will make these allowances because he&#039;s hawt and good breeding material.<br>#2. A dangerous and roguish persona aka &quot;the badboy&quot;. Their profile is marked by impulsiveness, high-extraversion, low-agreeableness, low-empathy and hypermasculinity. They are not necessarily goodlooking, although at times they can be unconventionally attractive. They are possessed of superficial charm and excel at manipulating female emotions. Woman from all walks of life are suckers for badboys. They often ignore the red flags and make a calculated risk to date men like this, despite the risk of abusiveness. Of course, women will deny this but what women say they want is at odds with what they truly desire. <br>#3. Betabux. A normie with a good job and stable income. Women settle for these guys, particularly later in life when they&#039;ve been pumped and dumped too many times by #1 &amp; #2. Badboys typically don&#039;t make for the best providers, after all. The majority of relationships will fall into this category.<br>A combination of the above would be ideal. That&#039;s a woman&#039;s ultimate fantasy (e.g. Fifty Shades of Grey) but it&#039;s not realistic. For that reason, a woman&#039;s tastes will fall into one of the above, depending on her priorities and present situation. If you do not fall into at least one of these categories, you will struggle to ever have a girlfriend.

Then one day you wake up and realise it&#039;s just you and a whole bunch of leftovers who are desperately trying to find someone who isn&#039;t completely fucking awful in some major way before they all get snapped up. A miserable, soul-sucking affair where time always feels like it&#039;s running out.<br><br>Men absolutely love the idea that they can just indefinitely postpone getting married. That they can stop their lifestyle of gaming and self-indulgence and settle down with a high quality girl any time they like. This is a colossal mistake. No matter how much you wish it were otherwise, you&#039;re going to find it very hard to marry a 28 year old (that you&#039;d want to marry) when you&#039;re pushing 40. Very few men turn into a silver fox. Also, never underestimate how much baggage a person picks up over the course their life and how much harder it is to deal with that in a relationship. <br><br>If you seriously want a fulfilling, long-lasting marriage, my best advice is to seriously start looking once you hit 30. You pretty much have your pick of the high-quality women at that age (in that few will be locked down yet, you still have your looks and you&#039;re starting to have some money). Start getting your shit together, have a good amount of savings that you can put towards a house deposit and get rid of your debts.
