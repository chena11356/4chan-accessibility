Always hypervigilant, mind turned on 24/7. This child can recognize, predict, and anticipate the stressors, moods, preferences and emotional injury in other people to the point it&#039;s scary to others around them. <br><br>In other words, they are extremely analytical to the point that, analysis paralysis is a daily occurrence for them. For any dilemma in life, it requires steps to reach a conclusion. Say we have a dilemma; it takes 100 steps to get there mentally, to its goal. Normal people take it step 1. Then step 2. Then step 3. etc.<br><br>The &#039;gifted&#039; child is already at step 80 - 90 within seconds, and by the hour is up, he&#039;s at 100.

The &#039;gifted&#039; child will try to provide them the answer.<br><br>But the other person can&#039;t see it. They aren&#039;t past step 5 yet let alone step 100. And so they just. refuse. to listen. Much to the frustration, and alienation of the &#039;gifted&#039; child.<br><br>This child is always usually from a dysfunctional family (arguing, verbal abuse, emotional abuse).

He had to parent his own family in a way.<br><br>And when their family DID blow up, he would isolate. Using his own imagination/thoughts as a fantasy land to escape to, to process and ruminate.

I feel like everybody in their cars stare at me, and I get intensely paranoid if a car is following me for too long - I drive around in circles to shake them what feels like every other night. I never experienced any type of schizo thoughts prior to my experience. In terms of flashbacks, I do often dissociate and think about it, but I also likely have ADHD so I feel like that&#039;s been a thing for me for a long time - don&#039;t take my word on this symptom.

Come on now, don&#039;t be a fucking retard.<br><br>A friend of mine is going through PTSD after being raped. She&#039;s been really depressed for a long time. She has regular bouts of anxiety. She has severe anxiety attacks. She struggled to face what happened to her, and suddenly couldn&#039;t stand being alone. She was already a very sociable person, but she went through a bad phase of going out on a bender every single weekend, and hanging out with friends every single night until late because she couldn&#039;t stand to be alone with her thoughts.

She&#039;s expressed suicidality many times.<br>Thankfully, her new psychiatrist recognised her issues for PTSD and not just &#039;depression&#039;, so she&#039;s finally been able to work through it in a healthy way (they require different approaches).<br><br>I was raped, myself. And now that I think about it, I had similar behavioural patterns for a few months afterwards. I would immerse myself in videogames or I&#039;d lay in bed listening to music literally all fucking day, just so I could avoid thinking about anything - not just the subject of the rape. I cried literally every day. All day. Even at work. I often skipped work because I needed a mindless videogame break from the world. I was always anxious. I hit myself a lot. If I was left with my own thoughts for too long, I would get suicidal. I had horrible intrusive thoughts about the event, and they made me feel physically sick.

When you betray someone&#039;s trust it hurts them badly and when someone hurts badly they are not going to be rational; nor should they. There really should no expectation for rationality with the fallout that&#039;s about to ensue.<br><br>You&#039;re saying that you need to know how to solve this, how to fix this but you&#039;re trapping yourself in this thought pattern.There&#039;s no fixing your relationship with your fianc\u00e9e, not until you have come clean with her. From your post it seem that you don&#039;t have a pathological temperament\u2014you can admit your mistakes\u2014and that&#039;s good. Now admitting them to yourself is a start but you also have to admit them to your Japanese lover and your formerly soon-to-be wife as well. <br><br>Would I be correct to assume that you&#039;re attempting to induce the least amount of pain for all parties involved? If so then the least painful way to go about this whole situation is to be honest with all parties involved. It&#039;s the deceit that hurts the most. It&#039;s the perpetual lying and dishonesty that permeates throughout the relationship which hurts. It&#039;s the gaslighting when your fianc\u00e9e notices that you&#039;re acting strange, that you&#039;re not as passionate in bed or that your &#039;I love yous&#039; are not as honest as they used be and you deny it. That&#039;s what hurts the most. Honesty hurts acutely but it gets all the pain out at once which allows the other person to recover. If you try to &#039;fix&#039; your relationship by hiding what happened then you will hurt both of them far more than if you were honest.<br><br>You had your fun and now it&#039;s time for the long hangover. Who&#039;s going to live where, your employment, the future child; all of that comes second to being honest with everyone involved. Once you&#039;re honest the picture will become more clear.

I don&#039;t feel guilty about liking them or fantasizing. I think it&#039;s a pretty innocent kink. But I hate porn and the porn obsessed culture that came up after 2010 has been fucking eroding my enjoyment of things so bad. I hate that 99% of artists now, furry or not, are just posting porn porn porn porn porn or sexual memes or porn. I don&#039;t wanna make friends with these proud LGBTQASDFASDFSAD+ degenerates. I hate the culture of &quot;if you don&#039;t want people to draw porn of your characters, don&#039;t post art online.&quot; Well I did stop posting art online. I was never part of the fandom because it&#039;s just a fetish community but eventually I stopped associating with all artists and the art world in general. It&#039;s like I&#039;m the only person in the world who has a minimum of attrition against this fucking wankoff culture. I miss when you could do something that wasn&#039;t porn and see a mininum of interest in people. Over these years I&#039;ve seen all the people who drew art I enjoyed quit, or become full blown porn artists. All the guys who did some racy art on the side and ran a decent thing on main have now quit the decent thing and draw nothing but porn. I hate it so much. It&#039;s like everyone&#039;s mind got swallowed by this horrible black hole. I don&#039;t wanna see assholes and cunts when I want to look at something pretty. I&#039;m so fucking disgusted with things and having to completely bottle up my love for drawing when the web used to be my outlet for it is fucking destroying me. When I want to open an account I remember all the shitshow that is social media and the way &quot;artists&quot; act, how the only point of conversation isn&#039;t art or what you&#039;re trying to say but how to get followers and what&#039;s the hottest character right now that I should draw porn of.
