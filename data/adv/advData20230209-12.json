I listen to him rant about new tech, go over sci-fi books I recommended and explain how exactly it would work out irl. I don&#039;t have much to contribute, it took me ages to figure out all the math stuff he loves talking about (like Modern Differential Geometry, Jesus). Likewise, when I share details about a history book I&#039;ve just read, rant about validity of sources, explain every scene of the new PreCure season and how it relates to the past entries, what is he gonna know about all that? Nothing! It&#039;s nice to find a common ground sometimes. We like reading hard sci-fi books and visual novels together, sometimes I get him to watch anime, he asks me to watch him play sports with his buddies or when there are dancing classes in the gym we go together. He lifts and I stretch, the sweaty sex afterwards is amazing too lol. I think it&#039;s nice that we can help each other with things we are not the best at. I cook for him, sew him clothes, decorate our home, he takes care of my cybersecurity, picks and buys tech for me that I&#039;d have no idea about otherwise, etc. Over the course of our relationship he assembled like 8 desktops for me. And I&#039;ve been making him cute lunches to uni and then work for years, every day. I make sure he is always happy, clean and fed.

No, I&#039;ll tell you exactly what you need: sacrifice.<br>Physical change is natural - every cell of your body is replaced every 10 years or so, but your soul remains untouched by time. Confidence is part of your personality and personality is directly linked with your soul, and thus it cant be changed by the physical realm.

Women get aroused from rape and men they find detestable all the time, it&#039;s also mostly about physical attraction to them. You should be held to the same standard as her.<br><br>The thing is, once you got married to your woman, you&#039;ve entered a contract. You are supposed to stay monogamous and be dedicated to her, sexuality included, for life. If both of you fail, then the relationship becomes just completely worthless. You are willing to risk the life you have, kids, her trust and happiness, for a little bit of physical pleasure. It&#039;s not easy or feasible to cheat for decades, it&#039;s basically a guarantee you&#039;ll get caught sooner or later, causing her unimaginable pain and humiliation. So it&#039;s just funny to me you claim you love her, since all in all you place fucking someone else for a couple of minutes on a higher pedestal than her life.<br><br>Now, your wife is also to blame. There are ways to increase your libido, I was in similar situation to her. Before her surgery, my wife absolutely needed to have sex at least 2 times a day, and for me once is more than enough. So I tried my best to accommodate her, fuck her hard enough, finger her, etc. For women it&#039;s even easier, since it&#039;s just easier to please a guy.

I have something that&#039;s been bothering me constantly and I&#039;m going to unload it here, hope you don&#039;t mind.<br><br>I have a 5 year old little girl whom I had with my wife. We didn&#039;t plan her or anything and it was my wife&#039;s (then girlfriend&#039;s) decision to keep her, which I agreed. She was open with her issues with fertility with me and she was beaming with joy at this little incident when she found out. Even though we used proper birth control. Looking back it feels like a daft, foolish thing to do. We were both young and inexperienced when it came to life but we reasoned that because we were young we would have more energy for our child when she&#039;s at that age where she actually needs us more. I don&#039;t resent anybody over it. I very much love both of them.<br><br>Before our girl was even born my then girlfriend (now wife) started to show some problems with irregular bleeding when she&#039;s not on her period. Sex would sometimes be too painful for her and she would come home from work with bloody underwear. This is where I acted like a complete fool. Instead of pushing her into channeling a specialist or following through with actual tests, she continued to just go to whatever random GP she fancied. Take whatever pills that would supposedly help with irregular period bleeding. It was too late when we found out it wasn&#039;t period bleeding at all. It was cervical cancer. When we found out it has already started to spread to her spine. I don&#039;t why I was such a clown who didn&#039;t make her go to a proper doctor to get tested. I don&#039;t know why she ignored it saying she&#039;s fine. She wasn&#039;t fine. She was like like a skeleton. She said she was always underweight and saying it&#039;s all fine. It wasn&#039;t.

I always talked myself out of getting a girlfriend if thats the sort of life I&#039;ll have to live, because it just wasn&#039;t something I wanted for myself and its something I generally hate when I have to do it.

My brother is pretty much exactly like me so I assumed he&#039;d want something similar out of a relationship as I do. But then I noticed that his girlfriend pretty much wants to all these things I thought a gf would want to do and when me and my brother just wanted to hang out in the house and watch a few episodes of some show, she&#039;d ask &quot;how are you not bored of watching the same thing over and over?&quot;.

Feminism and boomer mothers created a generation of men with low self esteem who are anxious about &quot;not being good enough&quot;, that&#039;s why they find it more comforting to watch you get fucked by a dildo/vegetable so the pressure to do well is not on them. I was shocked to find out how many of my male zoomer and millennials friends have been scarred by overly demanding and narcissistic mothers to feel like they&#039;re not good enough. This type of upbringing takes all the war energy out of you.<br>I mean, realistically it isn&#039;t your problem and if you search long enough you will probably find some men who had actually decent mothers who weren&#039;t self obsessed but good luck with that", "time": 1675836769, "resto": 28296615}, {"no": 28297967, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)01:13:42", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28297945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28297945</a><br>K but can you expand?

After we broke up I took steps to get back at him by insulting him, talking to his friends, and starting fights between us. I regret this time in my life a lot, and near graduation I apologized to him. It is a weird thing where I have accepted that I was awful, and I\u2019ve changed my behaviours. Yet I still can\u2019t be at peace with them. Is the answer to apologize to more people who I have wronged? Is the answer to forget about it and move on?", "filename": "A71A6708-B40E-44C2-B393-5367BF68F57A", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 700, "h": 695, "tn_w": 250, "tn_h": 248, "tim": 1675893322010295, "time": 1675893322, "md5": "9qGCI2LBDmD9H588pTyGOQ==", "fsize": 89777, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "i-have-a-hard-time-getting-over-the-fact-that-i", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "unique_ips": 3}, {"no": 28305226, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)22:00:30", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "the answer is to forgive yourself", "time": 1675911630, "resto": 28303028}, {"no": 28305281, "now": "02/08/23(Wed)22:12:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28305226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28305226</a><br>This.
