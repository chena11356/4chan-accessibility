God tells David he would&#039;ve multiplied his wives if he asked when he sinned with Bathsheba, basically saying dude I would&#039;ve given you more women, you knew this married woman was off limits. So what I think has happened is through this slow feminization of men, we are getting our balls put in a vice, and something that was once perfectly acceptable is now this ucky no no thing UNLESS it&#039;s polyamorous multiple guys and girls with homo and bisexuality all mixed together. A man with multiple wives is sexist, unless of course the women are also lezzing out. In a weird twist, pop culture promotes infidelity and cheating, but not legit out in the open polygamy. If you want to get conspiratorial, I think it&#039;s all by design. Women and their role has been warped into this I&#039;m a princess and men should bow to me, so they don&#039;t see a place for polygamy, even though we can see that is already an open and accepted secret that men of any worth or status struggle with cheating anyways, and often have mistresses. Cheating, homosexuality, furries, bisexuality, weird fetishes, all more accepted than a perfectly acceptable polygamy.", "time": 1674879034, "resto": 28218058}, {"no": 28218681, "now": "01/27/23(Fri)23:12:39", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28218226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28218226</a><br>And how are you gonna stop me?

Playfighting and playing/joking/teasing are very intimate and form strong loving relationships. Hand-holding, hugging, and forehead kisses are major ways to show affection.

Typical American upbringing, my parents were never divorced and I had a great childhood with lots of siblings. I never did good with girls in school. But fortunately I wasn\u2019t the worst, I had girlfriends in high school even got my dick wet. Which is why this is so confusing and emotionally troubling to me. When I was 20 years old I met a Ukrainian national on the internet (My grandparents were Ukrainian btw). Anyway we start talking every day. Texting, calling explaining our desires, our lives. This goes on for 6 months and we are obsessed with each other. Eventually she agrees to meet me. So for my first time ever leaving the country I flew to Ukraine from the USA. She met me in the airport and we fell absolutely in love. I literally would have killed people for this woman. She doesn\u2019t let me fuck her the first time I go. We spent 12 days together traveling the country (before the war) I met her parents, I saw where she lives etc. I fly back to America everything is great. Although she had a new habit. Every 4 months or so she would disappear. Unable to contact her at all. But she would always come back and say something like she was scared. I fly to Ukraine again. This time it\u2019s winter, I give her a real gold necklace with a real diamond inside of it. It\u2019s in the shape of a memorial tattoo for my dad who died. Anyway it\u2019s awesome, she lets me fuck her. I tell her I\u2019m going to ask her to marry me next time I see her (we had been together for 2 years at this point) she loves the idea. 6 months later. A week before my plane leaves. I call her after work. But she doesn\u2019t answer. I can see she is online, and it\u2019s like 5 am her time. So I ask what the fuck, who are you talking to at 5 am? And when she answered she broke up with me and I heard another guy on the phone. She ghosts me for 2 years and I do everything. Make new facebooks, text her, I couldn\u2019t control myself. Two years go by.

But she didn\u2019t like him, she tells me she still has my necklace but not because of me, because she thinks it\u2019s pretty. Well we only talk for a week. And she intentionally makes me jealous with another guy and we get mad at each other and she blocks me again. It\u2019s been 2 years and since then I\u2019ve barely heard anything from her. And then Ukraine gets invaded. I panic and call her cousin to find out if she was okay. Her cousin tells me yeah she is fine. And I tell her cousin everything that happened between me and her. She is disgusted with my ex, can\u2019t believe she did that to me (when she broke up with me, I lost 7k in plane tickets, hotels, a photographer, etc etc) and how after everything I was willing to risk for a relationship she just ghosted me. Well anons here is where I lose my mind. I\u2019m not attracted to other women, when I jack off I think of her, when I see Ukrainians flags my heart sinks. So I made a choice my family hates.

I asked if we could come stay with him (I would have to live with him because he is in a different province and going back there would cost me all my money and I would have no way of bringing my furniture there)<br><br>If we move there he could be a more stable adult in her life and maybe teach her some things. The downside to this is I would suddenly be in his space and we have not gotten along in the past and this would be weird after 6 years. The city he lives in is expensive so I dont know how I will save for furniture and my own place. And I would be relying on him for daily rides to work because he doesnt live walking distance to the main city.<br><br>So it&#039;s like. Either choice I make - stay here or go with him- could have terrible consequences. What if he treats me bad and I end up having to flee with my kid to a homeless shelter? Or what if we dont fight at all and he helps her to have a chance in life?", "filename": "Clouds", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 4000, "h": 2250, "tn_w": 125, "tn_h": 70, "tim": 1674878940201600, "time": 1674878940, "md5": "LgbQrgtzCaqAF2DXlCzmBw==", "fsize": 1162982, "resto": 28218605}, {"no": 28219060, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:27:02", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "c00l clouds p1c again", "time": 1674883622, "resto": 28218605}, {"no": 28219105, "now": "01/28/23(Sat)00:36:43", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "Wow, that is bleak.

In middle school I started to lose interest in my studies for no effective reason (other than my classmates constantly harassing me) and that led me to have problems with my teachers. In high school my interest was null and void and for a whole year I did nothing but warm the seat and get bad grades. I didn&#039;t turn in homework or pay attention in class, and this led me to have confrontations during class with teachers. It was during this time that I began to manifest constant moments of permanent sadness and the desire to end my life because I perceived myself as someone who was worthless and not worth trying anything if it did not bring me pleasure. I tried to end my life, received constant medical assistance and ended up ingraining the negative feelings in me. My poverty in relating to other people, my own lack of social skills to make friends make me feel disgusted with myself. Since then I can only say that I spend my days alone while trying to distract myself by reading on the internet or getting angry for reasons I don&#039;t fully understand.

My aunt suggested me to go to therapy at that time after she noticed that I showed irregular anxious behavior in public (I didn&#039;t feel borderline depressed). As for my parents, I can say that I have an ok relationship with them, I am a very reserved person with them and sometimes use vulgar language but overall everything is in order.

They are caring people.<br>The reasons why they bullied me I don&#039;t fully understand, but I was a very quiet person who didn&#039;t pick on anyone and was incapable of defending myself. I never laid a hand on anyone and I really hate violence. Although looking at it this way, my social introversion and weirdness made some people dislike me and in response they saw me as an easy target. They would fight me, hit me, drag me through the halls, call me the worst. That lowered my self-esteem. As for friendships in general, I had a childhood best friend who disappeared from my life in one fell swoop and a few friends who were more or less as socially retarded as I was but with whom I could sometimes feel relaxed.

You need an entire lifestyle change. I&#039;m 26 and went through something similar around 24. I&#039;m going to recommend something cliche, but it fucking works for reasons I will elaborate on. Get in shape. If you are fat lose weight. If you are skinny hit the gym. Yes it&#039;s a physical thing but we are mostly after the mental benefits. When you improve physically it does several things mentally (arguably it has more mental benefits than physical). First is you learn to be disciplined. This obviously effects every aspect of life. You need discipline to escape NEETdom. Next it will give you a taste of that &quot;better life&quot;. You will see hard effort turn into tangible rewards that you can be proud of. This can set off a chain reaction into other aspects of life you feel are lacking. Next is confidence. You will be more confident in your self and your abilities and it could be enough of a boost to get you to pounce on opportunities you otherwise would have missed by being passive. Perhaps most important of all it will get you out of the house and give you a hobby that isn&#039;t doing anything for you. This can lead to meeting new people and gives you a common interest hobby that you can share and engage with most people over. Don&#039;t forget other people will treat you better too. <br><br>All of that doesn&#039;t even take into account the physical aspects that also play a role in mental health. You would likely see an increase in certain hormones such as testosterone and a decrease in things like estrogen. These hormones play a huge role in mental health and having screwed up hormones probably play a huge role in depression and the like.

My specific situation will not really relate to you.<br><br>The TL;DR is that I am an /out/ist through and through and nothing is going to change that.<br><br>I was in the army before college. Biology degree. Wildly depressed, and medicated for it. In college I did an internship with a conservation agency and it was fun, but I did the &quot;right thing&quot; and after school I just kept pursuing my &quot;career path.&quot; Nothing glamorous or financially enticing, mind you. At 27 I had a paradigm shift, some major life changes (sister offed herself and ended a toxic 6 year relationship) and I took some seasonal /out/ work in Alaska to try and clear my heart and my head. Quit taking Zoloft during this time.<br><br>Following this, I left and did a &quot;normal&quot; job for about 1.25 years before I again felt the urge to get the fuck back outside. I worked for an environmental compliance contractor. I had a moment of clarity when a guy who had been there for 12 years told me he had a zoology degree. It made me sad to know he once shared my dreams. So I had to leave. Almost every person I knew told me that, at ~28 it was too late for a &quot;career change&quot; and I should just stay in place and effectively work at the same place until I died. I&#039;ve since worked for a few different agencies/places for the feds doing /out/ things. I do not make much money. My job security is tenuous. But I feel at peace and wouldn&#039;t change it.<br><br>The point of my story is simply that if you recognize something you are truly passionate about, you should just stick with it, because trying to convince yourself you are happier in some other capacity just results in you being miserable.

Think of employment as a bridge from virgin neetdom to chad neetdom. Some examples of viable options are trades, sales, it, coding meme, internet marketing. You can get an entry-level job in most of these fields with little-to-no experience. Grind certs, lie, just do whatever you need to do.

You might be forced to live with this since dating is hard and if you reject women that behave this way, you might seriously limit your dating pool. <br><br>This is why it&#039;s so important to have IRL friends and places where you can meet new women without having to resort to things like Tinder. Women are bombarded with propositions from men more attractive than you on these apps. It&#039;s only natural that she&#039;s gonna put out for some of them before they drop her and she settles for you. Be under no illusion: that&#039;s what happens when a girl is playing the field and she suddenly decides she wants a relationship with you. <br><br>This is why the only dignified course is to be sleeping with multiple women until you find one you want to commit to.
