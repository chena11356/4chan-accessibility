If by sleeping around you mean engaging in meaningful connections and relationships with other people, keeping your options open and having sex with people that you find yourself feeling physically and emotionally close to then you probably won&#039;t regret it. There are pretty simple ways to meaningfully engage in a sex life that includes more than one person, it just depends on your level of maturity and how willing you are to participate in some introspection and examine your own relationship with intimacy. Personally, I usually had between 3-4 different sexual partners every year before I met my current girlfriend. I felt close and connected with every one of them and I feel like it helped me understand how I engage with intimacy and what sorts of things I like in relationships. I&#039;ve been with my current partner for 7+ years in a pretty happy relationship so I don&#039;t think I buy the redpill pairbonding memes. If you&#039;re smart you&#039;ll figure it out.

Choose a home. Homes with elderly citizens, few residents, and/or residents who frequently leave the house are easy pickings. For your first squat, try to avoid homes with a family as the more residents live there, the more likely you will be discovered. Furthermore, large homes tend to have better hiding spots than smaller ones.<br>2. Perform a reconnaissance break-in. This initial break-in is crucial as it will allow you to find hiding spots and escape routes and determine how much and what materials you should bring. A guide with a few examples of hiding spots is the attached image on this thread. Choose a time when nobody&#039;s home so you can take a complete tour of the home. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until you are satisfied with the home you have chosen.<br>3. Move in. Pretty self-explanatory but it should be noted that this process may take longer than you think, especially if you are bringing a lot of supplies with you. Speaking of supplies, I&#039;d recommend at the barest minimum a sleeping bag, flashlight, smell-proof container, lock-picking apparatus, and some sort of weapon should the worst come to worst.

I would rather jack off than fuck her most times. I am also out of her league when it comes to looks (facially, but also the fact that she&#039;s chubby and I&#039;m slim), if you don&#039;t mind me being crude. She&#039;s very much in love with me, but I&#039;m incapable of that emotion with anyone unfortunately. Nonetheless, I try to reciprocate to make her happy. She doesn&#039;t suspect anything in that regard. I&#039;ve fucked four other girls throughout the relationship, kissed approximately fifty. The recent new girl I&#039;m fucking has been great, which somewhat prompted me to consider breaking up. Also, being known as the &quot;taken guy&quot; in my social circles is annoying as well, so I&#039;ll likely never agree to exclusivity again (not even with the new girl).<br><br>So that&#039;s the status quo, which seems like plenty of reasons to break up. However, she lives in a decent apartment in the city that I work and study in, which has been convenient for me.

Renting a shithole room in the aforementioned city would probably hinder my plans to retire early significantly. I expect my stress levels to skyrocket if I do breakup, as my girlfriend is a laid back and agreeable person while my parents are loud, aggressive, and meddling. Breaking up with her would be a relief, but also a terrible headache.<br><br>What would you guys do? Please do not factor in the perspectives of her or anyone else, that doesn&#039;t matter to me.

For context, I did super well in my GCSE&#039;s and A-levels, did crappy working holiday jobs for a year which were fine but I wanted to challenge myself. I signed up for a degree, I&#039;m 3 months in and I&#039;m just not interested. I just can&#039;t find the passion for any high level subject and the &#039;uni experience&#039; mostly consists of pub crawls and overpriced mediocre sports clubs and rushed in person or old powerpoint online lectures. I was looking into doing a working holiday in the USA over the summer as an outdoors instructor (I have an interview for tomorrow). I&#039;m tempted to drop out and start jobs/ courses that offer employment and qualifications in that field. However, the courses and apprenticeships seem to be for bottom feeding 90IQ retards, and none of the jobs offer live-in accommodation. There&#039;s a course which meets the requirements, but starts in a years time and I&#039;ve got a year plus to make use of my time in. Is there any other jobs which require some skill and intelligence but you don&#039;t need Uni for? I&#039;m not even saying I&#039;m smart, but I don&#039;t want to spend a year on the same level with people who can barely add numbers up. My sisters are major high achievers, and although my parents say &#039;I can do whatever makes me happy blah blah blah, its shallow BS (they&#039;ve proven it to be so before). And I don&#039;t want to labelled an embarrassment to my family.", "filename": "1667472388376456", "ext": ".jpg", "w": 554, "h": 554, "tn_w": 249, "tn_h": 249, "tim": 1670359300240256, "time": 1670359300, "md5": "yl/4Pbli0iDOgIXOaEjq0A==", "fsize": 35971, "resto": 0, "bumplimit": 0, "imagelimit": 0, "semantic_url": "what-the-fuck-do-i-do-bros", "replies": 2, "images": 0, "last_replies": [{"no": 27866313, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:00:48", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27864740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27864740</a><br>There are summer research courses that act as a school semester in the United states where you live in an outdoor research station for example", "time": 1670374848, "resto": 27864740}, {"no": 27866611, "now": "12/06/22(Tue)20:41:53", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p27864740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;27864740</a><br>Hiking guide if in a good location and you are in shape.

And this was key to overcoming my ASPD, granted it wasn\u2019t an a-ha! moment with a flick of a switch change overnight. It takes a long while to shed the asshole. But yes\u2014this is the self-perpetuating cycle that breathes constant life into the disorder. It\u2019s a feedback loop. And it\u2019s entirely perpetrated by the ASPD person themselves unwittingly. <br>How the hell can anyone who isn\u2019t the person(s) who abused the ASPD know their whole backstory? They\u2019re not psychic. Nor is it the responsibility of others to carry the legacy of hurt on their shoulders for the sake of a bpd, or an npd, or an aspd.
