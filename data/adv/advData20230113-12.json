I&#039;m a completely average plain 5/10, thin with good skin and long hair but nothing special, nor nothing hideous; I don&#039;t wear makeup mainly for the admittedly petty reason of not wanting people to mock me for trying to look nice when I&#039;m completely plain in looks. I did it and the interview went well, but now she&#039;s pressuring me to put it on every day so I don&#039;t look like a &#039;corpse that rolled out of bed&#039;. She knows I hate the way I look, yet she continually makes all of these comments and they really get to me. I used to be about 95lbs but she kept on commenting and mocking me for being heavier than my sister, so I starved myself and now I&#039;m under 80, and she screams about me being retarded to not eat when all she talked about beforehand was how I was chubby and should lose weight.<br><br>She&#039;s always so fucking rude to me. She used to beat me until I was on the floor begging to breathe as a child, and while she hasn&#039;t put a finger on me since (though I think she tried to touch me once when drunk), she always, always has something to say. At her worst, she screamed at me in a restuarant when she drank too much about how she should&#039;ve aborted me and shouted so much about how much she despised me that my father left and eventually we were forced out of the restaurant. My dad said the next day that if his parent spoke to him like that he&#039;d never speak to them again, but whenever I start to feel mad about the way I&#039;m treated she always comes in and tells me how much she loves me and apologizes. I don&#039;t know what to do anymore. She&#039;s a genuinely low-IQ chav with either narcissism or BPD and severe anger issues. I can take so much worse from others but as soon as she starts making these comments like today (and today&#039;s weren&#039;t even bad at all), I get so angry and resist the urge to cry.

You don&#039;t need to be a doctor to figure out whether or not someone is highly narcissistic. This type of thought policing, where only a certain select group of elite people are qualified enough to come to a conclusion regarding someone&#039;s character, is itself a tactic employed by narcissists to control those around them. <br><br>You&#039;re also telling him that nothing he&#039;s saying is right while you have no idea whether he is or not. This type of absolutist, black and white perspective on life is also a trait of narcissism. You&#039;re also potentially gaslighting him.<br><br>Learning about narcissistic partners, their tactics and the patterns of abuse they put you through helps you defend against them and protect your mental health. Attempting to curtail someone&#039;s research into it because they&#039;re not an expert is potentially putting him in harm&#039;s way.<br><br>So stop trying to control his path of discovery. There are plenty of quality resources available for someone to educate themselves without the need for a psych. degree. Maybe he&#039;s wrong, maybe he&#039;s right, it doesn&#039;t matter. Either way the man is on a path of discovery.

I can&#039;t take a hint. <br>I think finding love is purely coincidental, because it is inspired and passionate, you don&#039;t choose to fall in love with someone. As such, your view of it does not affect your access to it. You can not will it to happen to you or someone you want, nor can you deny it if it happens to you. You certainly can not construct it through some lifestyle/goals-driven selection process.<br><br>4. It&#039;s because you are whiny<br>I never express these feelings to anyone except my therapist and parents. So this is simply not true.<br><br>5. Change your attitude<br>Depression is a mental illness. It can not be cured, only &quot;treated&quot; by therapists, supposedly. And it&#039;s not like I&#039;m constantly moping, grumpy or even that shy in the presence of others.

I don&#039;t even want him as a friend now really. I feel terrible about this too and I know if I break it off now he&#039;s gonna think it&#039;s about him crying, and well yeah it is but I&#039;m not trying to hurt his feelings or anything. I can&#039;t really just make up a reason for why I&#039;d suddenly dump him either since everything was so great before and we were seriously gonna get married and all that. If I were honest I&#039;d just tell him hey I just don&#039;t feel attracted to you anymore but there&#039;s no way he wouldn&#039;t press for why.

NEVER say hello. It dulls the conversations right off the bat and makes you sound like all the other boring assholes that bombard her with attention. Start with a pick up line, a statement, literally anything else is better than texting her &quot;hi!&quot;. If you follow this simple rule you stand out immediately.<br><br>2. NEVER say goodbye either. Ending the conversation formally implies that you didn&#039;t do anything else while you were texting her, you basically gave her 100% of your attention. That&#039;s a huge turnoff for any female. Also, if you say goodbye, it will feel like a new conversation every time you text her again and texting you will feel more and more tedious to her because of it. Simply don&#039;t reply and pick up the convo later like nothing happened. It will create a constantly flowing, casual vibe between you and that is what girls are looking for. That&#039;s what they want you to make them feel. <br><br>3. NEVER ask questions. Or at the very least, try to ask direct questions as rarely as possible. You&#039;re a man, men don&#039;t ask questions, men make statements. If you want to know something about her, phrase it as a statement or a command. Instead of saying &quot;How was your day?&quot; text her &quot;I hope your day went well&quot; or &quot;Tell me about your day!&quot;. And if you can&#039;t avoid asking a question, for the love of God, don&#039;t use a question mark. Either leave it off completely, or use a thinking emoji instead.", "time": 1673578358, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110112, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:06:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110044</a><br>4. Use emojis. Yes, there is a stigma against men using emojis, but it&#039;s bullshit. The key is to be creative with them. Don&#039;t spam the same couple of ones all the time, mix it up. It creates a visually stimulating conversation instead of a plain wall of text. Another trick is to send them in a separate message, because there are a lot of dating and messaging apps that only give her a preview of the last message you sent her. So for example, you text her something, then send an emoji separately, she will see that she has more than one message, but she will only see the emoji in the preview. This will make her intrigued and curious about you as a whole and she will actually read what you send her instead of just leaving it on &quot;seen&quot;. <br><br>5. Make your intentions clear from the get go. Don&#039;t beat around the bush, make it known that you are interested in her in a romantic way, but don&#039;t be too blunt about it. You gotta make it fun and playful, this is what pick up lines are for. You can use some existing ones or come up with your own, the key is to experiment a lot. You also gotta move fast with this, either start the convo with a pick up line, or use one during the first couple of exchanges. <br><br>6. Double texting should be limited. If she doesn&#039;t respond for a longer period of time, you may try to chat her up again, but is she keeps doing it you gotta let her go. There are instances where she genuinely wanted to text you back but couldn&#039;t for a legitimate reason, so don&#039;t assume the worst immediately, but it&#039;s usually a good indicator that she&#039;s losing interest. If you do double text her, make sure to not seem overly butthurt, but also convey that you won&#039;t tolerate being ignored for too long. Make it snappy, ironic and low effort.", "time": 1673579164, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110182, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)22:24:01", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110112</a><br>7. Texting should be a means to an end. It should serve your ultimate end goal of scoring with women. As somebody already said it in this thread, it should mainly be used as a tool to set up real life dates. However, there are many more practical uses for texting, for example keeping a conversation from cooling down when you can&#039;t set up a meeting right away. Another important usage is to simply practice talking to women. It doesn&#039;t quite substitute face to face practice, but it can still help you hone your conversational skills. With time it will absolutely translate, if you get good at talking to women online, you will be much more comfortable and confident irl. <br><br>8. Don&#039;t go into lengthy discussions. Keep it light and keep it simple, no need to send paragraphs and talking about serious topics. Girls just want to have fun, never forget it. Joke around, tease her and try to set up the real life date ASAP. You gotta move fast, there are literally dozens of other guys chatting her up all the time, there is no time to fuck around if you want to bag her. If she responds to your pick up line in a positive way, just throw in something like &quot;We should grab a drink&quot; right away. If she says yes you basically done the deed, all you gotta do is show up and show her a good time. <br><br>9. Response time should be longer than hers. If you&#039;re stuck in a lengthier conversation, you gotta make her feel like she&#039;s not the only female you text. Since you didn&#039;t close the deal quickly, she gotta assume that it&#039;s because you have other options and not because you&#039;re a loser. Don&#039;t spend hours texting back and forth, go do some other shit and then write her again later. If you failed at the sprint you gotta make it a marathon, otherwise it becomes a slog and she will get bored.", "time": 1673580241, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110849, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)00:56:50", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110044</a><br><a href=\"#p28110112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110112</a><br><a href=\"#p28110182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110182</a><br>Yeah, it&#039;s over for me.", "time": 1673589410, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110873, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:02:11", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110044</a><br><a href=\"#p28110112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110112</a><br><a href=\"#p28110182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110182</a><br>All the sad fucks pretending to be based and alpha saying &quot;it&#039;s her job&quot; or &quot;text only to make dates, not to have a conversation&quot; should read this", "time": 1673589731, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110890, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:05:17", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110044</a><br><a href=\"#p28110112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110112</a><br><a href=\"#p28110182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110182</a><br>It&#039;s not worth the effort", "time": 1673589917, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110902, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:07:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28110890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28110890</a><br>this, like i need a fucking manual to deal with women", "time": 1673590033, "resto": 28103384}, {"no": 28110920, "now": "01/13/23(Fri)01:11:04", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28103384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28103384</a><br>You have to carry the conversation, but basically don&#039;t seem desperate.

I started viewing money just as some pine cones you find at the playground to trade with your friends for a shiny rock in kindergarten. Especially during my teenage years, when father sold the firm and moved to a tax haven [still losing more money daily (due to inflation) than most make in a year] where my standards grew even higher.<br>I was never really spoiled though. If I wanted something, I had to earn it. Either by working part time at his firm or with school performance. Christmas and birthdays were the only days I got things that are generally considered expensive.<br>With all that said, I still got accustomed to living on the high foot. Riding in expensive cars, resort vacations, restaurants, flying expensive airlines, sometimes multiple times a week, and generally living a carefree life. But now, that I\u2019m in college and have to work for my shit (essentially kicked out after hs) I realize I will literally never be able to restore this kind of life. Unlike my father who was lucky and smart enough to create and maintain his wealth, I\u2019ll most likely be stuck in a 9-5 in the middle class. And to most that may not sound so bad, but my world view and standards were so warped by \u201cliving the life\u201d, that anything less is depressing. Like a asian kid who never lived up to his parent\u2019s ideals, but in this case I\u2019m both the kid and the parents.

A LOT of mortgages tack the 30yrs of interest onto the front end of the loan (a $300k loan at 7% isn&#039;t 300k, it&#039;s more like 320k...), so the payee isn&#039;t putting much, if anything, down against the principal of the loan.<br>You borrowed 300k, paid 20k over a year, and want to refinance? Your new mortgage isn&#039;t going to be for 280k, it&#039;s going to be a hell of a lot closer to 295k.<br>You haven&#039;t put 20k (equity) into your home, you&#039;ve only put 5k. Yes, it sucks, and no amount of bitching will make it not work like that.<br>It&#039;s a tricky situation to navigate.

All wrong, either factually or morally. Women are more able to be promiscuous if they want, sure. But that doesn&#039;t say anything about which gender is more inclined to want that in the first place. For example, if 35% of women really wanted to be sluts, almost all of them would be able to do it. If 60% of men wanted to be manwhores, even if half of them were able to do it, in practice you can get fewer promiscuous men than promiscuous women, even though women are less likely to approve of promiscuity to begin with.<br><br>Look up rates of approval of (and engagement in) things like prostitution, casual sex, sex outside of marriage, and so on. Women are consistently better/less promiscuous than men in all of these.

I am simply pointing out that there&#039;s a lot more to the current mess than the immoral behavior of a majority of women. Focusing solely on the problems with women risks breeding resentment, which in turn can lead to people justifying their own immorality by pointing to the worst examples of the other gender.

I think thats a factor in why we became so close, because I&#039;ve been a good outlet for him to talk to me about whats going on in his mind. I don&#039;t want to freak him out if this is out of the blue, and I want to be perfectly clear with him that if he isnt ok with it I wont do it.

We became the core group not because we were more toxic (we werent toxic) or because we were the most bad ass. We became the core group as we extended a sense of belonging and we would socialise among ourselves. The girl group disliked that as they felt we deprived them of attention and specifically celebrity. Because of the girl group there those that sought to instigate a split and exclusion in exchange of being integrated with the girl group. The girl group had no plans to uphold their end of the &quot;deal&quot; and moved the goalpost on those that instigated - more than once. Essentially the instigators were &quot;timed out&quot; and slowly were re-integrated into the core high school group with suspicion. There were other individuals that sperged out as they didnt get exclusive time with their friend(s) of choice, later those spergs became outsiders very early in high school. Essentially, there were ups and downs and incrementally as I was the go-to guy (very approachable) that began to integrate the year the year became closer and closer. We organised big bike ridding days, movie days, gaming and pizza. It wasnt until the drama with my ex gf that really divided and splintered the year. The girl group trying to restart the integration effort by using the formal/prom as a way bring everyone together again. It didnt happen, the girl group made a pact to not go to the formal/prom with in guy and to arrive separate from the guys. The last remaining group in high school tried to integrate everyone but the catch was that just wanted to make themselves desirable by having outliers and outsiders asking them to hang out. That group has shattered. One guy is trying to get a high school reunion which of course I would refuse to attend. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In history in cities this is also how it was.</span><br>It was that it was men that cheated on their wives with prostitutes.

Have also done her raw and have also sort of creampied (I was jerking off as she was dancing and when I was about to cum I told her to mount me, she did and I half my cum ended up inside of her. I&#039;ve also done anal with her at no extra cost. She&#039;s always dated men and seems like she&#039;s not into girls but when I asked her she told me she&#039;s always wanted to try. Her only problem is her family has a bit more money than the other girls so a couple times she&#039;s cancelled and stuff because their family had plans or she just got a better plan with her friends. So there is that.<br>Both are among my favorite girls, one is about to become 19 in a couple of days, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m doing this today, I had a trio with a couple of 18yos in my bucket list for a while, I&#039;m very hyped, I just hope nothing goes wrong, something always comes up when I&#039;m too hyped up for stuff", "time": 1673529668, "resto": 28078914}, {"no": 28105288, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)08:22:09", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28105281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28105281</a><br>threesome I meant, I forget it&#039;s not called that in english", "time": 1673529729, "resto": 28078914}, {"no": 28105442, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)08:56:38", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28102178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28102178</a><br>man 40 emails to fuck her is sitcom tier retarded.<br>No wonder she finally gave up.<br>I can imagine that guy from The Office telling the camera &quot;I had to make sure every little detail was to my liking so I sent her 40 emails with every single question that came to my mind until I was completely sure.<br>Now she won&#039;t respond to me anymore<br>Funny how I didn&#039;t ask her for her emailing tolerance, that should have come during email 10 or so&quot; (Looks at the camera intensely)", "time": 1673531798, "resto": 28078914}, {"no": 28105689, "now": "01/12/23(Thu)09:47:13", "name": "Anonymous", "com": "<a href=\"#p28078914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28078914</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I fucked pic related this Saturday, she&#039;s an underground girl I found in a private telegram group, on the upper end $150 for an hour, sex was fucking great though, gymrat girl</span><br><br>DAMN!

Had to go into the office yesterday and was feeling really groggy and lazy as usual. I took 3 Adderall my cousin had given me on Christmas to help me work. Got in the zone and did about 3 days of work in 4 hours. Started to browse the internet and saw some amazing booty pics and got really horny. Decided to break my streak of no-porn and gave in to my temptations. Went to the bathroom into the handicap stall and began to furiously jack off. Completely lost track of time and place. I was in a devious and sexual state of mind. Coom brain took over. Edged repeatedly, bringing myself to the edge of orgasm around 17-18 times. Finally allowed myself to completely unload at an amazing clip of a 75 yr old man pounding away at a tight little 18 yr old latina. Came so hard my entire body convulsed, couldn&#039;t even help but moan and groan with each powerful pulse of cum that shot out of my throbbing cock. Literal 11/10 orgasm.<br> <br>The next thing I know, I&#039;m laying on the bathroom floor with my pants down and three coworkers standing around me on the phone with 911. They had been looking for me as I&#039;d been away from my desk for two hours. One of them entered the bathroom and saw me laying on the ground. Apparently I came so hard that I blacked out and hit my head upon falling. The most embarrassing part is that I was covered in cum and a porn video had been auto playing on my phone. I refused medical attention when EMS arrived. Was dismissed from work, and today got the email that I&#039;ve been terminated.<br><br>How do I now apply for new jobs and explain my termination?
